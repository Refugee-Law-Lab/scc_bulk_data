S. C. ch, 9). Fournier and Henry JJ. dissenting.\nL'ASSOMPTION ELECTION CASE.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Superior Court of the Province of Quebec, presided over by Mr. Justice H. Taschereau, rejecting appellant's motion presented on the 20th of December to have an election petition declared out of court and abandoned, by reason of the respondent not having proceeded with the trial of the petition within six months of the presentation thereof.\nRespondent contested the election of appellant who was elected at the last federal elections for the electoral district of L'Assomption.\nThe petition was presented on the 23rd of April, last past.\nAppellant fyled preliminary objections on the 30th of April, and on the same day moved that all proceedings in the case be suspended during the session of Parliament then pending.\nOn the 11th of May Taschereau J. granted that motion.\nParliament opened on the 18th of April, 1887, and was prorogued on the 23rd June.\nLong vacation began one week after on the 1st of July and ended on the 1st of September during which time the judges of the Superior Court formally declined to try any controverted election case.\nOn the 2nd of September respondent moved that a day be fixed for the hearing of the preliminary objections.\nOn the 6th of September the case was heard on the preliminary objections, and they were dismissed.\nOn the 17th of September, respondent moved that an order be made and a day fixed for the examination of appellant; that motion was granted on the 4th of October, the day was fixed, and appellant was examined on that day. On the same day, respondent applied to have a day fixed for the trial of the petition.\nOn the 10th of October, Mr. Justice Taschereau fixed the 20th December as the day for the trial. On that same day, immediately after the judgment fixing the day for trial appellant moved that respondent fyle a bill of particulars before the trial. The court made an order that respondent fyle his bill of particulars on or before the 13th December.\nOn the 20th December, the day fixed for the trial, appellant moved that the trial be not proceeded with that the right of respondent to proceed with the trial be declared forfeited, and that the petition be declared abandoned and out of court because the trial of the petition had not been commenced within six months from the presentation thereof.\nThat motion was rejected by the court and the trial proceeded. The appellant's election was voided by reason of corrupt practices on the part of his agents.\nOn appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada the counsel for the appellant stated that although by his factum it appeared that the present appeal was only from the judgment of Mr. Justice Taschereau, dismissing the motion to set aside the election petition on the ground that the trial had not been commenced within six months from the date of the presentation of the petition, was an error, as the appeal was from the final judgment as well, and asked permission to complete the record by adding such final judgment and the notice of appeal.\nThe respondent's counsel objected to any indulgence being granted, on the ground that as the final judgment avoided the election petition for admitted acts of corruption by agents, and that the appeal now before the court was solely from the interlocutor judgment of Mr. Justice Taschereau on a motion which was not appealable, and contended that the appeal should be quashed for want of jurisdiction.\nPrefonlaine for appellant.\nBisaillon Q.C. for respondent.\nSir W. J. RITCHIE C. J.\u2014This is not an appeal from a decision by the judge at the trial, but from an order of the Superior Court, dismissing a motion to set aside the election petition on the ground that the trial had not been commenced within six months from the date of the presentation thereof.\nI think that where a party has gone before a judge and admitted bribery by agents, that we should not strain the law to allow him to appeal. There is no provision in the law allowing an appeal from the decision of the Superior Court on a preliminary objection which is not final and conclusive and does not put an end to the petition, and such is the appeal which is now before us. I am clearly of opinion that we have no jurisdiction in the case, and therefore the appeal should be quashed.\nSTRONG J\u2014Nothing can be clearer than that appeals in Controverted Elections are limited to two matters only, viz : first, an appeal from any decision, rule or order on preliminary objections to an election petition the allowance of which is final and conclusive and puts an end to the petition or which objection, if it had been air lowed, would have been final and conclusive and have put an end to the petition; and, secondly, an appeal from the judgment or decision on any question of law or of fact of the judge who has tried the petition. As the appeal is now presented it is quite clear that it does not fall under either of these heads and consequently this court has no jurisdiction. The appellant after admitting that his election should be set aside for corruption by agents, wishes us to assist him and convert a judgment which on the material now before us is clearly not appealable into a judgment on the merits from which an appeal lies. I am of opinion that this cannot be done and therefore the appeal must be quashed.\nFOURNIER J\u2014I am of opinion that we have jurisdic tion in this case. Moreover I think the decision in this case should be postponed until we are ready to decide the case which was argued at length before this court some days ago, and in which the learned counsel for the appellants contended that a -similar judgment was appealable either as coming within the first part of sec. 50, R.S.C., ch. 9, being a judgment on a preliminary objection to an election petition or as coming within the second part of sec. 50, being a final judgment upon a question of law by the judge who has charge of the trial of the petition. However, if the majority of the court have decided to go on, I will only enter my dissent, and later on in the Quebec County case I will give at length my reasons for my opinion in favor of the jurisdiction.\nHENRY J.\u2014The motion which is now made and under consideration is to allow the appellant to complete his case and without that the court has no material to pronounce upon. In another case this court gave permission to allow the appeal to stand over until another session in order to have the judgment appealed from printed, and I think if we do not wish to be taxed with inconsistency we should be prepared to allow appellant's counsel forty-eight hours to produce his notice of appeal and ascertain whether he has or has not limited his appeal to the question of the six months.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014I am also of opinion that we have no jurisdiction.\nGWYNNE J.--Upon the facts presented it is apparent the court has no jurisdiction.\nAppeal quashed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellant: Godin, Champagne & Dugas.\nSolicitors for respondent: Lacoste, Bisaillon, Brousseau & Lajoie.\n"}

Ritchie C. J., and Fournier, Henry, Taschereau and Gwynne JJ.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of Mr. Justice Caron dismissing the election petition on the ground that the petitioners had not proceeded to trial within six months from the presentation of said petition.\nThe petition to set aside the election for the electoral district of Quebec county in the province of Quebec, was presented on the 9th of April, 1887.\nOn the 20th day of the same month preliminary objections were fyled by the defendant and on the 30th day of May next the same were dismissed.\nOn the 26th of August a motion to fix a day and a place for the trial of the petition was presented which motion was continued to the 5th of September by a ruling of Mr. Justice Caron.\nAt the latter date the same motion was again continued to the 12th day of September, and on that day the trial of the petition was fixed by Mr. Justice Casault, to be held on the 31st of the month of October at Quebec.\nOn the 13th of September a notice of the time and place of trial was given by the prothonotary of the Superior Court according to law, and copies thereof were sent to the petitioners, to the respondent and to the sheriff.\nOn the 26th day of September a petition was presented on behalf of the petitioner to fix a day for the personal examination of the defendant; this petition was, by consent of the parties, continued to the 80th September and subsequently to the 3rd, 4th and 8th of October, by rulings of Messrs. Justice Andrews, Caron and Casault.\nOn the 26th of October the defendant having failed to appear, though duly summoned by subpoena, the case was continued to the 28th to enable the defendant to produce affidavits to justify his absence.\nThat affidavit having been produced, the petitioners then moved for an extension of time for the trial of the petition. On the 2nd day of December two rules were argued, one for extension of delay on behalf of the petitioners and the other by defendant to declare delay of six months for the beginning of the trial lapsed and the petition dismissed accordingly.\nThe former was dismissed and the latter declared absolute and the petition was dismissed by the following judgment:\u2014\n\" The parties having been heard by counsel upon the \"rule of the 30th day of November last to the end that \" whereas more than six months have elapsed from the \" time when the petition in this cause was presented; \"and whereas the petitioners have not yet proceeded \" with the trial of such petition; and whereas the trial \" of said petition has not commenced within six months \" from the time when the said petition was presented; \"the said petition be dismissed and that no further proceedings be had on the same; it is ordered that the \"said rule be and the same is made absolute and the \"said election petition be and the same is hereby dismissed, each party paying his own costs.\"\nBoss\u00e9 Q.C. for respondent moved to quash the appeal for want of jurisdiction.\nMacDougall Q.C. and Martin contra.\nThe statutes and cases relied on by counsel are reviewed in the judgments.\nSir W. J. RITCHIE C. J.\u2014This question has been decided during the present sittings, and I can only repeat What I then desired to say, viz; That I think the appeal to this court is limited under sec. 50 of ch. 9, R. S C. to judgments, &c., on preliminary objections the allowance of which has been final and conclusive and has put an end to the petition, or which objection, if allowed, would have been final and conclusive and have put an end to the petition, and to judgments or decisions on questions of law or of fact of the judge who has tried such petition.\nThe objection here is not, in my opinion, an objection to a preliminary objection under this clause nor is it from a judgment or decision on any question of law or of fact of the judge who has tried the petition. The petition was never tried, and the appeal is from the decision of a judge who treated the petition as abandoned, and on which no further proceeding could be had. Our authority to hear appeals is strictly statutory, and unless the matter appealed from can be brought within the terms of the statute we are powerless to interfere. Had the legislature intended to give an appeal in a case such as this that intention should have been made clearly to appear by the terms of the statute. If it was the intention that there should be an appeal in a case such as this there has been a casus omissus in not making such intention apparent. The appeal should therefore be quashed.\nFOURNIER J.\u2014The question to be determined on this appeal is whether this court has jurisdiction to entertain an appeal from Mr. Justice Caron's judgment dismissing the election petition against the return of the respondent as member for the House of Commons for the electoral district of the County of Quebec.\nIn order to arrive at a proper conclusion on this important question I think it desirable first to refer at length to the sections of the Dominion Controverted Elections' Act ([1]) which in my opinion are material on this point and afterwards to give a synopsis of the pleadings in the case.\nThe material sections of that act are as follows:\u2014\u2014\n13. Within five days after the decision upon the preliminary objections, if presented and not allowed, or on the expiration of the time for presenting the same, if none are presented, the respondent may fyle a written answer to the petition, together with a copy thereof for the petitioner: but whether such answer is or is not fyled, the petition shall be held to be at issue, after the expiration of the said five days, and the court may, at any time thereafter, upon the application of either party fix some convenient time and place for the trial of the petition.\n43. At the conclusion of the trial the judge shall determine whether the member whose election or return is complained of or any and what other person was duly returned or elected, or whether the election was void, and other matters arising out of the petition and requiring his determination, and shall except only in the case of appeal hereinafter mentioned within four days after the expiration of eight days from the day on which he shall have given his decision certify in writing such determination to the Speaker, appending thereto a copy of the notes of the evidence, and the determination thus certified shall be final to all intents and purposes.\n50. An appeal shall lie to the Supreme Court of Canada under this act by any party to an election petition who is dissatisfied with the decision of the court or a judge.\n(a.) From the judgment, rule, order or decision of any court or judge on any preliminary objection to an election petition, the allowance of which objection has been final and conclusive and has put an end to such petition, or which objection if it had been allowed would have been final and conclusive and have put an end to such petition; provided always that, unless the court or judge appealed from otherwise orders, an appeal in the last mentioned case shall not operate as a stay of proceedings, nor shall it delay the trial to the petition.\n(b.) From the judgment or decision on any question of law or of fact of the judge who has tried such petition.\n56. No election petition under this act shall be withdrawn without the leave of the court or judge (according as the petition is then before the court or before the judge for trial upon special application made in and at the prescribed manner, time and place.\nThe election petition in this case was presented on the 9th April, 1887. On the 20th of the same month preliminary objections were filed. and on the 20th of May Mr. Justice Casault dismissed them without costs. On the 26th August a motion was made to the Superior Court to fix a day and a place for the trial of the petition; this motion was continued by consent of parties to the 12th September, and on that day the trial of the petition was fixed by Mr. Justice Casault, to be held on the 31st of October, at Quebec. On the 26th September application was made to the judge to fix a time for the personal examination of the respondent, and this application was continued by consent until the 10th October, when the petitioners applied to have the day fixed for the trial of the petition changed from the 31st of October to the 19th December as being more suitable for all parties. The application being based on the following consent filed by the attorneys of record:\u2014\nCONSENT OF 10TH OCTOBER, 1887.\nLes parties consentent \u00e0 ce qui suit:\nVu la motion \u00e0 \u00eatre pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e ce jour de consentement en cette cause.\nLeo p\u00e9titionnaires consentent \u00e0 l'ajournement tel que convenu mais sans pr\u00e9judice \u00e0 leurs droits.\nLe d\u00e9fendeur et intim\u00e9 d\u00e9clare renoncer aux d\u00e9lais et ne pas s'en pr\u00e9valoir et consent \u00e0 ce que tous les proc\u00e9d\u00e9s ajourn\u00e9s soient faits avec la m\u00eame force et effet plus tard qu'ils le seraient si l'ajournement convenu aujourd'hui n'aurait pas lieu.\nSi le d\u00e9fendeur no comparait pas le vingt-six novembre tel que dit dans la dite motion, les p\u00e9titionnaires ne seront pas tenus de produire leurs particularit\u00e9s le douze d\u00e9cembre prochain ni de proc\u00e9der \u00e0 la preuve le dix neuf du m\u00eame mois, mais ils auront droit de faire remettre la cause et la production des particularit\u00e9s jusqu'\u00e0 dix jours apr\u00e8s que le dit d\u00e9fendeur aura comparu pour r\u00e9pondre aux questions qui lui seront pos\u00e9es de la part des p\u00e9titionnaires.\nQuebec, 10 Octobre 1887.\n(Sign\u00e9) JOSEPH MARTIN,\nProc. des p\u00e9titionnaires.\nANGERS, CASGRAIN ET HAMEL,\nProcs. du d\u00e9fendeur Caron.\nMr. Justice Casault thereupon fixed the trial for the 19th day of December. On the 29th November the attorneys for respondent took out a rule nisi to dismiss the petition for want of prosecution within six months from the time when the petition was presented. On the 19th December Mr. Martin, attorney for the petitioners, fyled the following affidavit:\u2014\nAFFIDAVIT OF JOSEPH MARTIN RESPEOTING DELAYS.\nJe soussign\u00e9, Joseph Martin, avocat de la cit\u00e9 de Qu\u00e9bec, \u00e9tant dument asserment\u00e9 sur les Saints Evangiles, d\u00e9pose et dit:\u2014\nJe suis le procureur des p\u00e9titionnaires en cette cause. Durant la vacance de la cour entre le premier juillet et le premier septembre derniers je suis all\u00e9 plusieurs fois \u00e0 la chambre des juges de ce district, au palais de justice, en cette cit\u00e9, pour demander de proc\u00e9der, et que ce n'est que le vingt-trois ao\u00fbt que l'un des juges a consenti \u00e0 prendre ma requ\u00eate pour fixer l'enqu\u00eate; Qu'au jour fix\u00e9 pour la pr\u00e9sentation de cette requ\u00eate, un certain avocat non autoris\u00e9 par moi et accompagn\u00e9 que par le conseil du D\u00e9fendeur sont all\u00e9s devant l'honorable juge Caron, avant l'heure fix\u00e9e dans l'avis sur la requ\u00eate, et tous deux ont fait remettre la requ\u00eate au douze septembre, par jugement de son Honneur, et que ce jugement que je n'ai pu r\u00e9ussir \u00e0 faire changer a \u00e9t\u00e9 la cause que la fixation de l'instruction et l'audition des t\u00e9moins en cette cause n'a pas eu lieu dans les six mois apr\u00e8s la pr\u00e9sentation de la p\u00e9tition.\nQue les p\u00e9titionnaires ont toujours \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00eats et out persist\u00e9 pour proc\u00e9der \u00e0 l'instruction de la p\u00e9tition dans cette cause,\nEt j'ai sign\u00e9,\nJOSEPH MARTIN.\nOn the 26 December. Mr. Justice Caron delivered the following judgment, dismissing the election petition:\nThe parties having been heard by counsel upon the rule of the 30th day of November last, to the end that, whereas more than six months have elapsed from the time when the petition in this cause was presented, and whereas the petitioners have not yet proceded with the trial of such petition, and whereas the trial of said petition has not commenced within six months from the time when the said petition was presented,\u2014the said petition be dismissed and that no further proceedings be had on the same: It is ordered that the said rule be and the same is made absolute and the said election petition be, and the same is hereby dismissed, each party paying his own costs.\nThe petitioners filed an exception to the judgment rendered, dismissing their election petition, and declared their intention to appeal therefrom.\nNow, sections 13, 43 and 56, with the exception of the first part of sec. 50, are the revised enactments of the corresponding sections of 37 Vic. c. 10, viz.: secs. 11, 29, 54 and 38 Vic. ch. 11 sec. 48, and it should be remembered that these very same sections have already been the subject of mature consideration for this court in the case of Brassard v. Langevin ([2]) In that case (though I must say I was of a contrary opinion) the court held that \"the hearing of the preliminary objections and the trial of the merits of the election petition are distinct acts of procedure,\" and that the judgment then under appeal was not appealable because the appeal was not from the decision of a judge who had tried the merits of the petition. The reasoning of the majority of the court is based upon the fact that the act as framed carried out a distinction as to the separation of. the powers and jurisdiction of the court and those of the judge at the trial. Mr. Justice Strong, in whose judgment Sir Wm. B. Richards, the late Chief Justice of this court, concurred on this point, says ([3]):\u2014\nSection 54 (which is verbatim section 56 of the Revised Statutes. chapter 9, which I have read) of the act contains a provision recognizing a distinction very pertinent to the question raised here; it relates to the withdrawal of a petition and enacts that a petition shall not be withdrawn without the leave of the court or judge, according as the petition is then before the court or before the judge for trial, upon special application.\nAfter the petition is set down for trial the functions of the court are at an end, for no provision similar to that embodied in section 23 of the Controverted Elections' Act, 1873, authorising a judge who tries a petition to reserve a case for the opinion of the court, is contained in the act of 1874. There is, therefore, a well defined line of demarcation between the two jurisdictions, that of the court and that of the judge who tries the petition.\nand, at page 327, he proceeds:\nThis practice of disjoining the hearing of preliminary objections from the trial, which does not correspond with any similar proceeding provided for by the English act, was probably suggested by the course of proceeding formerly adopted by the election committees who, though bound by no prescribed rules but being free to regulate their proceedure in each case according to convenience, were accustomed to hear and determine in limme objections taken to the qualification of the petitioner, and others of the same class, before proceeding to investigate the merits of the petition. These considerations appear sufficient to demonstrate that the Controverted Elections' Act, 1874, deals with the hearing on preliminary objections and the trial of the petition as two distinct acts of procedure having for their objects different results and which it was the policy of the act to keep separate. Parliament has indeed in so many words recognised the separation between the jurisdiction of the court before trial and that of the judge after the petition is set down for trial, when in the 54th section it requires the withdrawal of the petition to be with the leave of the court or judge- (According as the petition is then before the court or before the judge for trial.)\nIt is evident the court held in that case the line of demarcation, when the functions of the court were at an end, to be: \" After the petition was set down for \"trial.\" From that moment therefore the election petition is before the trial judge, who alone can make a report to the Speaker, under sec. 43, declaring the respondent duly elected or unseated for corruption by agents or otherwise.\nThe interpretation put on section 48 chapter 2 of 38 Vic. by the Supreme Court of Canada having been brought to the notice of Parliament, the act was amended by 42 Vic., ch. 39, giving the right of appeal from the decision of the court or judge, on preliminary objections, and as under sec. 13, after the expiration of five days from the decision of the preliminary objections the petition is to be at issue, and the court is to fix a time and place of trial, and as it has been decided by the highest court of the Dominion that from that moment the election petition was under the control of the trial judge, from whose judgment, in the words of sec. 50 (b) \" on any question of law or of fact\", an appeal would lie, it was believed it would not be in the power of a single judge to dismiss an election petition or unseat a member of Parliament without appeal, if provision was made for an appeal from the judgment, rule, order or decision of any court or judge on any preliminary objection to an election petition. Now, applying the law as interpreted in the case of Brassard v. Langevin to the facts of the present case, can it be said that the procedure in this case reached the line of demarcation where the jurisdiction and powers of the court or judge ceased, and the powers and jurisdiction of the trial judge commenced? And is there a decision of the trial judge on any question of law or of fact from which an appeal lies under sec. 50 of ch. 9 R. S. C?\nIt is evident if we follow the ruling of this court in the case of Brassard v. Langevin, to which I have referred that on the 12th September, when Mr. Justice Casaut ordered that the trial of the election petition should be held at Quebec on the 31st October, 1887, the procedure in the case had reached that line of demarcation when the jurisdiction of the court or judge as regards all preliminary proceedings was at an end, and the exclusive jurisdiction of the trial judge commenced. Consequently all subsequent proceedings in the case were proceedings before the judge who had charge of the trial of the merits of the petition, and if any question of law or of fact arose on such proceedings, it would be one which had to be decided by such judge whose decision is subject to review on an appeal to this court, and whose decision in the event of no appeal being taken is, under sec. 43, to be certified in writing to the Speaker of the House of Commons.\nIf no appeal had been taken it would no doubt have been the duty of the learned judge who had charge of the petition, and who decided that the petition should be dismissed, to have made his return to the Speaker declaring the respondent duly elected. On the pleadings the learned judge having decided as a question of fact whether six months had elapsed without proceeding, and as a question of law whether the statute should be construed as he bad done, does not his judgment dismissing the election petition after the same had been set down for trial determine a question of law and of fact appealable under sec. 50 (b)? I can come to no other conclusion than that such a judgment is appealable.\nHENRY J.\u2014This is an appeal from the judgment of one of the judges of the Superior Court of Quebec on a petition of the appellants against the election of the respondent as a member of the House of Commons for the County of Quebec, who decided that the petition should be dismissed because the trial thereof was not commenced within six months from the date of the presentation of the petition.\nIt is objected on the part of the respondent that no appeal to this court lies from the judgment, and\nSecondly, that if it does, that the judgment was warranted by the provision of sec. 32 of ch. 9, of the Controverted Elections Act.\nBy sec. 48 of the Supreme and Exchequer Courts Act an appeal from a judgment on an election petition was provided to be taken by any one\nWho may be dissatisfied with the decision of the judge who has tried such petition on any question of law or of fact.\nIn the case of Brassard and others v. Langevin ([4]) it was held by a majority of this court (Fournier and Taschereau JJ. dissenting), that a judgment on preliminary objections:\nWas not appealable, and that under that section an appeal will be only from the decision of a judge who has tried the merits of an election petition:\nAnd it was held by my brother Strong, (Richards C. J. concurring),\nThat the hearing of the preliminary objections and the trial of the merits of the election petition are distinct acts of procedure.\nThat judgment was given in April, 1878, and during the following session of Parliament it was provided by the Supreme Court Amendment Act of 1879 that\nAn appeal shall lie to the Supreme Court from the judgment, rule, order or decision of any court or judge on any preliminary objection to an election petition the allowance of which shall have been final and conclusive and which shall have put an end to the petition, or which would if allowed, have been final and conclusive and have put a end to the petition.\nPreliminary objections are provided by the statute to be tried before a judge, and they are, in my opinion, such preliminary objections as are taken within the prescribed five days. After they are decided nothing remains to be tried but the merits if the petition.\nWhat then constitute the merits of the petition? Alter the preliminary objections are disposed of everything in law or fact that can be legally urged on either side which should be considered by the judge when dealing with the issues raised by the petition and the answer thereto if one has been filed. He is authorized, and he alone, as the judge to try the merits to decide not only the questions before him raised by the evidence but every questions of law. He may he the same judge who decided as to the preliminary objections, but if so he has no longer any control as to the preliminary questions pointed out by the statute, and his whole jurisdiction is as to the merits of the petition including as well all legal questions as matters of fact. The two tribunals are distinct from each other as if the trial of the preliminary questions was to take place in one court and the trial of the merits. of the petition in another. The judge who tried the preliminary objections fulfilled his whole duty when he decided as to them, and then the statute provides that the trial judge shall be seized of the whole jurisdiction to determine every matter of law or of fact necessary for a final judgment upon the merits either to dismiss the petition or to set aside the election and report to the Speaker of the House of Commons as provided by the act.\nAfter the preliminary objections were disposed of, there appear to have been several orders passed from time to time, appointing the time and place for the appearance of the respondent to be examined, and for the hearing of the merits of the petition. The orders were made by judges acting, as they must have done, as trial judges. The matter was at issue on the 25th of August, 1887, and every motion and order made after that time had reference to the trial of the merits of the petition, and were inseparably connected therewith. On the 29th November, 1887, an order nisi was obtained on the part of the respondent to dismiss the petition on the ground that the six months' prescribed for the commencement of the trial had elapsed. That order was subsequently made absolute and the petition dismissed. From the latter order the appellant appealed to this court; and, as previously stated, the right of appeal in such a case is contested. That question calls for our judgment.\nThe Legislature, having first provided an appeal from the judgment of the trial judge on all matters of law or of fact, subsequently provided for an appeal from the judgment of the judge who tried preliminary objections in all cases where the judgment put an end to the petition, or might have done so if the judge had so decided. The intention of the Legislature was evident that in all cases where the decision of the judge who tried the preliminary objections set aside the petition, or might have done so, or the trial judge on any question of fact or law did so, an appeal should lie. No interregnum could take place\u2014as soon as the preliminary objections were disposed of adversely to the party taking them the trial judge became, eo instanti, seized with the power and duty of disposing of every matter of law or of fact as to the adjudication on the merits of the petition. I feel bound to hold therefore that the question of law raised as to the six months prescribed for the commencement of the trial was a matter of law to be decided alone by the trial judge and that it was to all intents included as one of the matters of law to be decided by him, and an appeal from his decision is provided.\nHaving arrived at the conclusion that the subject matter of the appeal is regularly before us I must deal with the decision appealed from.\nIn order to arrive at a satisfactory construction of section 32 chapter 9 of the revised statutes of Canada I have referred to sections one and two of the Controverted Elections' Act of 1875, chap. 10, from which sec. 32 was taken and condensed. Section 1 provides that\nWhenever it appears to the court or a judge that the respondent's presence at the trial is necessary, the trial of an election petition shall not be commenced during any session of Parliament, and in the computation of any delay allowed for any step or proceeding in respect of any such trial or for the commencement of such trial under the next following section, the time occupied by any such session shall not be reckoned.\nSection 2, as far as touches the present inquiry, is as follows;\nSubject to the provisions of the next preceding section the trial of every election petition shall be commenced within six months from the time when such petition has been presented and shall be proceeded with de die in diem until the trial is over, unless on application supported by affidavit it be shewn that the requirements of justice render it necessary that a postponement of the case should take place.\nIt is in my opinion clear, under the provisions of the two sections just quoted, that the time of sitting of Parliament was provided to be reckoned only in the case mentioned in the first section and not applicable to any other. Comparing the provisions of those sections with those of section 32, before mentioned, I have arrived at the conclusion that the latter section was not intended to and did not essentially amend the provisions in the two other sections. The object in the revision of the statutes was not to amend but to consolidate and condense them; and unless a manifest change of provision was made I think that courts should not impute any intention of doing so.\nI am therefore of the opinion that the decision of the trial judge on the point in question was correct and should be affirmed.\nBy the second section referred to it is provided that the trial shall be commenced within the six months,\nUnless on application supported by affidavit it be shown that the requirements of justice render it necessary that a postponement of the case should take place.\nIf then in the course of a trial a motion should be made for a postponement of the case under that section I should be inclined to the opinion that the decision thereon would be appealable to this court. 'Such an application is not, in my opinion, addressed merely to the discretion of the judge. If then a strong case was made out for or against the decision this court in my opinion, could review the judge's decision.\nSection 33 of the Controverted Elections' Act ch. 9 of the Revised Statutes, is different in its wording from the provision in section 2 before cited.\nFollowing section 32 it provides that\nThe court or a judge may, notwithstanding anything in the next preceding section, from time to time enlarge the time for the commencement of the trial, if, on application for that purpose supported by affidavit, it appears to such court or judge that the requirements of justice render such enlargement necessary.\nThat provision is wholly directed to the discretion of the court or a judge and the decision is final. If therefore the judge should decide that an enlargement should be made, his decision cannot be reviewed and if within the prescribed six months he enlarges the time for the commencement of the trial within the terms of the section beyond the six months his decision is final. The section requires the motion for such enlargement to be supported by an affidavit which should disclose facts and reasons to justify the enlargement.\nThe record of the case shows that on the 23rd of August a motion was filed to appoint a time and place for the hearing of the petition. On the 26th the motion was continued to the 5th September. On the 12th September the hearing was ordered to take place on the 31st October. On the 26th September a motion was filed to fix a time and place for the examination of the respondent. On the 28th of September the motion was continued to the 30th September. It was further continued to the 4th of October and on that day continued to the 10th October, and on the latter day, to the 11th October. It was subsequently ordered, by the consent of the respondent's counsel, that the 31st of October should be fixed for the production of proof of the allegations of the petition and hearing. On the 10th of October, and by the same consent, the time was changed to the 19th of December for the hearing and the production of proof, and the 26th November for the appearance and examination of the respondent, and an order therefor was made. The respondent having failed to appear at the time and place named in the order an order nisi was passed on the 30th November that in consequence of the respondent having been absent on public business the time for his examination should be postponed to the 10th January, and the hearing and production of proof to the 27th January. An order nisi was obtained on the part of respondent on the 30th November to dismiss the petition returnable on the 2nd December and on the 27th of the same month the order absolute to dismiss the petition was passed.\nThe petition having been presented on the 9th of April, the prescribed six months expired on the 9th of October. The record shows that on the 8th of October, after several adjournments, an order was passed, that the petition to fix a day for the personal examination of the respondent stand continued to the 10th of October, the day after the expiration of the six months, and on the latter day the petitioners moved, by consent, to fix a day for the examination of the respondent, for filing particulars and for the trial of the petition upon which an order was passed postponing the hearing of the petition from the 31st October to the 19th of December. It is evident from the record that the appellants were from the month of August desirous to bring on the hearing but delay took place from time to time in consequence of the failure of the respondent to appear as ordered for personal examination to enable the petitioners to file their particulars as alleged, and thus the cause was delayed until, according to my views, the prescribed six months had expired.\nBy section 83 of cap 9 R. S. C., the power of enlargement beyond the six months, as I read it, is given to the court or a judge from time to time, if on an application for that purpose supported by affidavit, it appears to such court or judge that the requirements of justice render such enlargement necessary; and I think that if an application had been made supported by affidavit before the expiration of the six months the trial judge had power to enlarge the time from time to time and that his decision would be final. If it appeared to him that the affidavit was insufficient and he declined to order the enlargement the expiry of the six months put an end to the petition. I cannot find, however from the record that any such application was made supported by affidavit and as the legislature has stipulated that the power of enlargement must be on an application supported by affidavit I am of the opinion no application could be otherwise made nor could any valid order be made. As the result of the governing decisions on the point I am also of the opinion that the application must be made before the expiration of the prescribed six months.\nAs the continuances, as stated in the record, were by consent, it is contended that the respondent must be taken to have waived any objection. By his counsel he certainly agreed to do so and, in ordinary cases, would be bound by the agreement, but in the present it is different on' principle from most others. Here at the expiration of the prescribed six months the statutory functions and jurisdiction of the judge are at an end unless he has enlarged the time for the hearing as prescribed in section 33, and the mere agreement of the parties could not confer upon him any judicial power or jurisdiction.\nAfter the expiration of the prescribed six months during which the legislature has limited the time for the commencement of the trial a judge could not try the case unless he went contrary to the provision of the statute. If, then, he had no jurisdiction as to the trial, if he could not try the merits of the petition, say, three days after the expiration of the prescribed six months, how could he give himself jurisdiction by enlarging the time to a future day? I can find no decision nor any principle upon which such a proposition could be sustained.\nFor the reasons given I am of opinion that the case came legitimately before this court by appeal.\nI am, however, of opinion that for the reasons I have given it should be dismissed with costs\nTACHEREAU J.\u2014Whether an appeal lies to this court or not from the decision of Mr. Justice Caron, has been settled by this court in three cases during the present sittings of the court. The question is therefore settled and cannot be re-opened. I am of opinion that the appeal should be quashed.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014I am of opinion that the statute which regulates appeals in Controverted Election Petitions gives no appeal to this court from a rule or order of the nature of that which is the subject of the present appeal, namely, a rule of the Superior Court of the Province of Quebec (in which court the Controverted Election Petition in the present case was pending) disminse such petition for want of prosecution.\nThe Legislature has restricted appeals to this court in these Controverted Election Petitions to two cases one of which is from the judgment of the Superior Court in which the election petition is filed or of a judge thereof, and the other from the judgment of the judge presiding in the trial court, (a court wholly distinct from the Superior Court in which the petition is filed) after the trial of the issues joined on such petition upon the merits, upon any question of law or fact arising upon such trial. The former is an appeal from a judgment upon a preliminary objection. Now the term \"preliminary objection\" as used in the statute, has a special meaning which, as appears by the 5th and 12th sections of ch. 9, of the Revised Statutes is an objection to the sufficiency of the contents of the petition, or to the status of the petitioner, \" or to anyfurther \" proceedings on the petition by reason of the ineligibility \" or disqualification of the petitioner.\" In the present case the respondent did, under the provisions of these sections, file certain preliminary objections, which were disposed of by an order, of dismissal of the date of the 30th May, 1887,\nWhether the respondent filed an answer to the petition after the dismissal of his preliminary objections does not appear but whether he did or not the cause and matter of the petition was at issue upon the merits at the expiration of five days from such dismissal of the preliminary objections, and no other preliminary objections, in the sense in which that term is used in the statute or so as to make any decision thereon appealable to this court, could thereafter be taken. The order of the 80th May exhausted the respondent's power to make any other preliminary objection in the sense in which that term is used in the statute. It is impossible therefore to read the statute as was contended for by the learned counsel for the appellants, as constituting any objection made anterior to the trial to be a preliminary Objection within the statute, and so the decision upon it appealable to this court. The order, therefore, of the Superior Court, dismissing the petition out of that court for want of prosecution, is not made by the statute appealable to this court, and we have no jurisdiction to entertain an appeal from such decision.\nSo neither can such decision be regarded as a decision upon a question of law or fact arising upon a trial of the matter of the petition which has never taken place, and which, if it had, would have been a proceeding in a wholly different court, namely, the trial court. It was quite competent for the Legislature in their discretion to leave the decision of a motion to dismiss a Controverted Election Petition for want of prosecution to the absolute discretion and judgment of the court in which the petition was filed, there to be dealt with according to the course and practice of the court and this is what, in my opinion, the statute in effect does. The appeal, therefore, in the present case, must be quashed with costs for want of jurisdiction in this court to entertain it. Appeal quashed with costs ([5]).\nSolicitor for appellants: Joseph Martin.\nSolicitors for respondent: Casgrain, Angers & Hamel.\n[1] R. S. C, oh, 9.\n[2] 2 Can. S. C.

That the decision of a judge at the trial of an election petition overruling an objection taken by respondent to the jurisdiction of the judge to go on with the trial on the ground that more than six months had elapsed since the the date of the presentation of the petition, is appealable to the Supreme Court of Canada under sec. 50 (b.) ch. 9 R.S.C., Gwynne J. dissenting.\n2nd.

(Gwynne J. dissenting.)\n3rd. The time within which the trial of an election petition must be commenced cannot be enlarged beyond the six months from the presentation of the petition, unless an order had been obtained on application made within said six months. An order granted on an application made after the expiration of the said six months is an invalid order and can give no jurisdiction to try the merits of the petition which is then out of court. (Ritchie C.J. and Gwynne J. dissenting)[1]. APPEAL from a judgment of Mr. Justice Rose claring the election of a member for the house of commons for the electoral district of Glengarry void by reason of corrupt practices and disqualifying the appellant.\nThe petition against appellant was presented and fyled on the 25th April, 1887. Parliament was in session from 23rd of April, 1887, to 24th June, 1887. The following order was made by the court of common pleas on the 1st December, 1887, extending the time for trial to 31st January, 1888.\nORDER ENLARGING TIME FOR TRIAL.\nThursday, the 1st day of December, 1887.\nUpon reading the notice of motion given by the petitioner herein during this present sitting the admission of service of the said notice of motion, and the affidavits and papers filed in support of this motion and upon hearing counsel for the parties on both sides, and it appearing to the court that the requirements of justice render such an enlargement necessary.\n1. It is ordered that the time for the commencement of the trial of the petition herein be and the same is hereby extended for a period of two months, up to and inclusive of the first day of February next.\n2. It is further ordered that the costs of and incidental to this application be costs in the cause.\nOn motion of Robinson Q.C., of counsel for petitioner.\nAnd on the 17th December, 1887, the following order fixing place of trial was made.\nORDER FIXING PLACE OF TRIAL.\nSaturday, the 17th day of December, A.D., 1887.\nUpon reading the notice of motion given by the petitioner herein during this present sitting, the admission of service of the said notice of motion and the affidavits and papers filed in support of this motion.\nAnd upon hearing counsel for the parties on both sides, and it appearing to the court that special circumstances exist which make it desirable that the petition herein should be tried elsewhere than within the said electoral district of Glengarry.\n1. It is ordered that the election petition herein be tried at the court house in the town of Cornwall in the county of Stormont, on Thursday the 12th day of January, A. D., 1888, at the hour of ten o'clock in the forenoon, and on such other subsequent days as may be needful.\n2. It is further ordered that the costs of and incidental to this application be costs in the cause.\nOn motion of Mr. C. Robinson Q.C., of counsel for the petitioner.\nThe trial commenced on the 12th January, Mr. Justice Rose presiding, and the following is an abstract of what took place at the opening of the trial as appeared in the printed case for appeal:\u2014\nPROCEEDINGS AT TRIAL.\nIn the High Court of Justice Common Pleas Division.\nThe Dominion Controverted Election Act.\nRe Glengarry.\nAlexander Kennedy, petitioner.\nP. Purcell, respondent.\nTried before Hon. Justice Rose at Cornwall, on 12th January, 1888.\nCounsel Present:\nMr. D. MacMaster Q.C., Mr. E. H Tiffany and Mr. McLellan for petitioner.\nMr. W. Cassels Q.C. and Mr. D. B. MacLennan Q.C. for respondent.\nMr. Cassels\u2014Before the case is gone on with we wish to have the objection noted that your Lordship has no jurisdiction to try it. Three judges of the Court of Appeal have slated that the time of the session is not excluded. We say you have no power to extend the time. The Quebec Court of Appeal and the New Brunswick Court of Appeal have in effect held that there is no jurisdiction.\nHis Lordship\u2014I rule with you that the time, of the session is not excluded but that there is power to extend the time.\nAfter the taking of evidence on the 13th January Mr. Justice Rose found as follows:\u2014\nFINDINGS OF JUDGE AT THE TRIAL.\nI find that corrupt practices have been proved to have been committed by D. H. MacKenzie, an agent of the respondent, to wit: advancing by way of loan to Francis Saucier, $100, John Tyo, $200, and Alexander Vanier $100, they being voters, in order to induce such persons to vote for the respondent.\nI also find that such corrupt practices were committed by and with the knowledge and consent of the respondent.\nI further find that a corrupt practice was committed by the respondent, to wit; advancing by way of loan to one Peter Kennedy, a voter, the sum of $100, in order to induce such person to procure, or endeavor to procure, the return of the respondent to serve in the House of Commons.\nI determine that the election was and is void by reason of such corrupt practices, and direct that the respondent pay the costs, charges and expenses, of and incidental to the presentation of the petition and the proceedings consequent thereon, save and except such costs, charges, and expenses as are by the Controverted Elections Act otherwise provided for.\n(Signed,) JOHN E. ROSE. J.\nJan. 13th, 1888. The question upon which this appeal was decided was whether or not the court or judge, on the 12th January, 1885, had jurisdiction to try the merits of the petition, six months having elapsed since the date of the presentation of the petition.\nS. Blake, Q. C., Walter Cassels, Q.C., (O'Gara, Q. C. with them) for appellant, contended:\u2014\n1st. There was no jurisdiction to try this matter. The petition was out of court at the time of trial and the judge should so have determined and dismissed the petition.\n2nd. The learned judge erred in finding the present appellant guilty of bribery, and his judgment, assuming that he had jurisdiction to try the petition, should be reversed so far as the finding on the personal charges is concerned.\n3rd. The learned judge should not, on the evidence, have found in favor of the petitioner on the charge of bribery by an agent and should not have voided the election.\nThe statutes, authorities, and cases cited are reviewed in the judgment of Mr. Justice Taschereau hereinafter given.\nMcMaster Q.C. and MacLennan with him for respondent contended:\n1. That there was no appeal from the order extending the time. 49 Vic. ch. 9, s. 50.\n2. The court or judge had the amplest power to extend the time. 49 Vic., ch. 9, s. 64.\n3. The apparent exception in sec. 32 in the same act, requiring the commencement of the trial to be within six months of the date of presentation of petition, is itself the subject of a special exception in sec. 33, which empowers the court or a judge to \"enlarge the time \"for the commencement of the trial,\" in the interests of justice, \"notwithstanding anything in the next \"preceding section,\" (that is the section in which the six months provision is); and hence the 32nd section must be regarded as directory.\n4. If the 32nd section be not directory, but imperative, then the time occupied by the session of parliament and the terms of the Common Pleas division of the High Court of Justice must be deducted; and the order for the extension or enlargement was made within six months of presenting petition; and the trial was held within the period of the enlargement.\n5. But even if the session of parliament and the terms of the court are included, in computing the six months from presentation of petition, the extension or enlargement might be made after the lapse of the six months, and the order of 1st December is good.\nThe following cases were relied on:\u2014West Middlesex case[2]; Maskinonge case[3]; Rex v. Loxdale[4]; Addington case[5]; Addington case[6]; Ex parte Campbell[7]; Rhodes v. Airdale Commissioners[8]; Kingston case[9]; Quebec West case[10]; Wheeler v. Gibbs[11]; Banner v. Johnson[12]; Lord v. Lee[13]; Sheffield v. Sheffield[14].\nOn the merits the learned counsel commented on the evidence and contended that the decision of the court below should be affirmed.\nSir W. J. RITCHIE C. J.\u2014But for the diversity of judicial opinion I should have thought the construction of the 32nd section very plain. We have the limit within which the trial of every election petition shall be commenced, namely within six months from the time when such petition shall have been presented, and shall be proceeded with from day to day until such trial is over.\nBut it is said that in the computation of this six months the time during which any session of parliament is being held is not to be taken into account. But where in the statute is to be found authority for any such proposition? Had such been the intention of Parliament surely it would have been expressed in simple, plain, unmistakeable language, in some such words as these\u2014\"The trial shall be commenced within six months but in the computation of such six months the time during which a session of Parliament is being held shall not be computed.\"\nWhere the language of the act is plain and unambiguous we should not, I think, go outside of it to seek a construction at variance with such language. This view, that the sessions of parliament are to be excluded in all cases, is, in my opinion, entirely inconsistent with what follows in the statute:\u2014\"But if, at any time, it appears to the court or a judge that the respondent's presence at the trial is necessary, such trial shall not be commenced during any session of parliament.\" Is not the irresistible inference from this that sessions of Parliament are included in the six months, and that it is only when the presence of the respondent is necessary at the trial that proceedings shall not go on during the session? If no proceedings can be had during any session then the provision referred to would be meaningless, certainly wholly unnecessary and not capable of being acted on, and also the provision \"that in the computation of any time or delay allowed for any step or proceeding in respect of any such trial, or for the commencement thereof as aforesaid, the time occupied by such session of parliament shall not be included.\" I think the time occupied by any such session of parliament refers to the session of parliament provided for by the section and not to sessions of parliament when the necessary presence of the respondent has not been made to appear and when it is not even claimed that the respondent's presence is necessary, and, in my opinion, very clearly negatives the idea that any session of parliament is to be excluded, but the one for which the special provision is made.\nUpon the authority of Wheeler v. Gibbs[15] in this court, and Banner v. Johnson[16] I think the court had power to enlarge the time for the commencement of the trial though such order was not made within the six months from the time of the presentation of the petition, it appearing that the requirements of justice rendered such enlargement necessary, and I am therefore of opinion that the time was duly extended or enlarged and the judge was properly seized of the case. The respondent did not move to dismiss the petition as he might have done, and not having done so the petition remained in court subject to the jurisdiction of the court and to the discretion and power of the court or judge to extend the time, although the six months had expired. I do not think the limit in sec. 33 can be read into sec. 32 or be used in any way to affect the right to extend as provided by the latter section because it is expressly provided that the court or judge may notwithstanding anything in the preceding section which is sec. 32, from time to time enlarge the time for the commencement of the trial. I concur with the Court of Appeal of Ontario and the other judges who have taken and acted on this view.\nA majority of the court being of opinion that the time occupied in the session of parliament is not to be included, and that as there is no power to extend the time after the six months has elapsed there has been no legal trial, I think it would be as improper, as it would certainly be utterly useless, for me to discuss the merits of this case as they appeared on the alleged trial; such a discussion must, necessarily, be purposeless and productive of no possible results. In fact, if the judge had no legal right to proceed with the trial, and the trial is, consequently, of no legal effect, in other words no legal trial, there are no merits to discuss, for the simple reason that if there was no trial there were no merits of which this court, or any other court, could take cognizance.\nMr. McMaster, in his factum, objects that there was no appeal from the order extending the time and it was submitted that there is no appeal from it.\nThat would be so under our late rulings, but there was no objection raised in this case by the learned counsel for the respondent, in his factum or in his argument, that there was no appeal to this court against the ruling of the learned judge on the point of law on the trial. It certainly was, as appears by the record, a point raised on the trial and adjudicated on by the learned judge, and therefore would seem to come, as at present advised, within the express words of the statute. The language of the statute is \"an appeal shall lie from the judgment or decision, on \"any question of law or of fact, of the judge who has \"tried such petition.\" The majority of the court entertain no doubt on this point, and therefore the appeal will be allowed.\nFOURNIER J.\u2014Le jugement rendu en cette cause, le 13 janvier dernier, a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 l'\u00e9lection nulle pour cause de corruption par les agents du membre si\u00e9geant et par lui-m\u00eame personnellement. L'appel de ce jugement n'a pas mis seulement en question le bien jug\u00e9 sur le m\u00e9rite de la cause, mais il soul\u00e8ve \u00e9galement la question de savoir si le juge avait le pouvoir de proc\u00e9der au proc\u00e8s, apr\u00e8s l'expiration du d\u00e9lai de six mois fix\u00e9 par la sec. 32 du ch. 9 des Statuts Revis\u00e9s du Canada. Dans les autres causes d'\u00e9lections entendues et d\u00e9cid\u00e9es pendant le pr\u00e9sent terme, la cour n'a pas d\u00e9cid\u00e9 la question de l'interpr\u00e9tation \u00e0 donner \u00e0 cette section, parceque dans la forme o\u00f9 se pr\u00e9sentaient ces causes, l'unique question \u00e0 d\u00e9cider \u00e9tait de savoir si les jugements dont on se plaignait \u00e9taient appelables. Mais dans le pr\u00e9sente cause, l'appel \u00e9tant du jugement final, il a l'effet de soumettre \u00e0 la revision de la cour toutes les questions de droit ou de faits d\u00e9cid\u00e9es sur les divers incidents de la cause. Sur ce point il ne peut y avoir de difficult\u00e9. La cour est donc appel\u00e9e \u00e0 se prononcer sur l'effet de la sec. 32, d\u00e9cr\u00e9tant que le proc\u00e8s d'une p\u00e9tition d'\u00e9lection devra \u00eatre commenc\u00e9 pendant les six mois qui ont suivi la pr\u00e9sentation de la p\u00e9tition. L'interpr\u00e9tation de cette section soul\u00e8ve aussi la question de savoir si dans les six mois de d\u00e9lai, le temps de la session doit \u00eatre exclu dans tous les cas.\nDans le cas actuel, la p\u00e9tition a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e le 25 avril 1887. La r\u00e9ponse du membre si\u00e9geant a \u00e9t\u00e9 produite le 30 juin 1887. La production de particularit\u00e9s a \u00e9t\u00e9 ordonn\u00e9e le 23 septembre, et elles ont \u00e9t\u00e9 produites le 23 d\u00e9cembre.\nL'appointement pour l'audition pr\u00e9liminaire du membre si\u00e9geant qui devait \u00eatre examin\u00e9 comme t\u00e9moin le 9 novembre fut continu\u00e9 de consentement au 20 d\u00e9cembre. Ce jour-l\u00e0 il fut proc\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 son examen.\nLe 17 d\u00e9cembre un ordre fut prononc\u00e9 fixant le palais de justice de Cornwall comme le lieu o\u00f9 se ferait le proc\u00e8s de la dite p\u00e9tition.\nLe 1er d\u00e9cembre une demande, appuy\u00e9e d'affidavits, fut pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e pour faire \u00e9tendre de deux mois le d\u00e9lai pour commencer le proc\u00e8s. Le dispositif de cet ordre est comme suit: It is ordered that the time for the commencement of the trial of the petition herein be, and the same is hereby extended for a period of two months, up to and inclusive of the first day of February next.\nAu 12 janvier 1888, jour fix\u00e9 pour le proc\u00e8s, les parties se pr\u00e9sent\u00e8rent devant l'honorable juge Rose, charg\u00e9 du proc\u00e8s de la p\u00e9tition. Le membre si\u00e9geant par le minist\u00e8re de W. Cassels, C.R., protesta contre l'instruction du proc\u00e8s de la mani\u00e8re suivante:\nBefore the case is gone on with we wish to have the objection noted that Your Lordship has no jurisdiction to try it.... We say you have no power to extend time....Three Judges of the Court of Appeal have stated that time of the Session is not excluded. We say you have no power to extend the time. The Quebec Court of Appeal and the New Brunswick Court of Appeal have in effect held that there is no jurisdiction.\nL'honorable juge pronon\u00e7a sa d\u00e9cision sur les deux objections du savant conseil dans les termes suivants:\n1 rule with you that the time of the Session is not excluded, but that there is power to extend the time.\nD'apr\u00e8s sa d\u00e9cision le temps de la session n'est pas exclu des six mois pour le commencement du proc\u00e8s\u2014et ce d\u00e9lai peut \u00eatre \u00e9tendu. Ces deux questions ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cid\u00e9es par un ordre du juge charg\u00e9 du proc\u00e8s (Trial Judge) et jug\u00e9es au proc\u00e8s m\u00eame, on ne peut soulever dans ce cas, la question qui s'est \u00e9lev\u00e9e dans les autres causes jug\u00e9es pendant le terme, de savoir s'il y avait appel d'une d\u00e9cision renvoyant la p\u00e9tition sur une motion d\u00e9clarant que les six mois expir\u00e9s, la cour n'avait plus de juridiction pour faire le proc\u00e8s\u2014car dans le cas actuel, ce n'est pas la cour qui a jug\u00e9, mais le trial judge, et la question tombe clairement sous l'effet de la sec. 50 (b) d\u00e9clarant qu'il y \u00e1 appel\u2014\nFrom the judgment or decision on any question of law or of fact of the judge who has tried such petition.\nLe droit d'appel est donc ici incontestable et la d\u00e9cision de ces deux questions doit \u00eatre revis\u00e9e par cette cour;\nIl est sans doute regrettable qu'il ait \u00e9t\u00e9 proc\u00e9d\u00e9 au proc\u00e8s ayant que la question du pouvoir du juge d'en agir ainsi ait \u00e9t\u00e9 finalement r\u00e9gl\u00e9e, car maintenant nous sommes en pr\u00e9sence d'une enqu\u00eate r\u00e9v\u00e9lant des faits suffisants pour d\u00e9cider le m\u00e9rite de cette affaire, mais dans la position o\u00f9 cette cause nous est pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e pouvons-nous nous en occuper? La r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 cette question d\u00e9pend enti\u00e8rement de la solution de la question de juridiction. Si le juge \u00e9tait sans pouvoir pour juger, quelles que soient les cons\u00e9quences, nous devons le d\u00e9clarer et annuler le proc\u00e8s. Le respect d\u00fb \u00e0 l'autorit\u00e9 de la loi l'exige.\nLes objections du savant conseil \u00e9taient fond\u00e9es sur la sec. 32 d\u00e9clarant\u2014\nSec. 32. The trial of every election petition shall be commenced within six months from the time when such petition has been presented, and shall be proceeded with from day to day until such trial is over; but if at any time it appears to the court or a judge, that the respondent's presence at the trial is necessary, such trial shall not be commenced during any session of Parliament; and in the computation of any time or delay allowed for any step or proceeding in respect of any such trial, or for the commencement thereof as aforesaid, the time occupied by such session of Parliament shall not be included;\n2. If, at the expiration of three months after such petition has been presented, the day for trial has not been fixed, any elector may, on application, be substituted for the petitioner on such terms as the Court or a judge thinks just.\nQuoique les opinions se soient partag\u00e9es sur l'interpr\u00e9tation \u00e0 donner \u00e0 cette section, il me semble que dans la premi\u00e8re partie, il est dit clairement que le proc\u00e8s de toute p\u00e9tition d'\u00e9lection devra \u00eatre commenc\u00e9 dans les six mois de la date de sa pr\u00e9sentation. Il n'est apport\u00e9 \u00e0 cette prescription imperative qu'une seule exception, celle que le proc\u00e8s ne sera pas commenc\u00e9 pendant une session, s'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9montr\u00e9 au juge que la pr\u00e9sence du membre si\u00e9geant est n\u00e9cessaire au proc\u00e8s. Ce temp\u00e9rament \u00e9tait n\u00e9cessaire pour corriger ce qu'aurait eu de trop rigoureux l'obligation de proc\u00e9der dans tous les cas en l'absence du d\u00e9put\u00e9 \u00e9lu. En proc\u00e9dant pendant la session c'\u00e9tait le mettre dans la position ou de manquer \u00e0 ses devoirs parlementaires, s'il s'absentait pour surveiller ses int\u00e9r\u00eats au proc\u00e8s, ou bien le priver de l'avantage de confronter ses accusateurs, s'il assistait au parlement. La loi me para\u00eet avoir adopt\u00e9 un moyen de concilier les deux int\u00e9r\u00eats en permettant de suspendre la proc\u00e9dure pendant la session s'il \u00e9tait d\u00e9montr\u00e9 \u00e0 la cour ou au juge que la pr\u00e9sence du membre si\u00e9geant \u00e9tait n\u00e9cessaire au proc\u00e8s. C'est \u00e9videmment dans ce but qu'apr\u00e8s avoir impos\u00e9 d'une mani\u00e8re absolue l'obligation de commencer le proc\u00e8s dans les six mois, vient l'exception: \"But if at any \"time it appears to the Court or a judge that the respondent's \"presence at the trial is necessary, such trial shall \"not be commenced during any session of parliament.\" Cette disposition n'accorde au membre si\u00e9geant qu'une facult\u00e9 dont il peut ou non se pr\u00e9valoir, mais dont il ne peut obtenir le b\u00e9n\u00e9fice qu'\u00e0 la condition de d\u00e9montrer au juge que sa pr\u00e9sence est n\u00e9cessaire au proc\u00e8s. S'il n'a pas jug\u00e9 \u00e0 propos de se conformer \u00e0 cette condition, le temps de la session devra compter dans les six mois.\nLa r\u00e8gle \u00e9tablie au sujet de la computation du temps dans la derni\u00e8re partie de la clause 32 en disant \"the \"time occupied by such session of parliament shall not \"be included\"\u2014ne peut avoir un effet absolu et s'appliquer indistinctement \u00e0 tout proc\u00e8s de p\u00e9tition d'\u00e9lection. Les mots such session se rapportent suivant moi \u00e0 une session pour laquelle le juge a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 sur demande \u00e0 cet effet, que la pr\u00e9sence du membre si\u00e9geant \u00e9tait n\u00e9cessaire. Autrement il y aurait contradiction manifeste entre cette disposition et la pr\u00e9c\u00e9dente: la premi\u00e8re dirait que l'intervention du juge est n\u00e9cessaire pour suspendre la proc\u00e9dure pendant la session, et la seconde dirait, au contraire, que cette intervention n'est pas n\u00e9cessaire si le temps de la session doit \u00eatre exclu. Ces raisons me paraissent suffisantes pour en conclure que le temps de la session doit \u00eatre compt\u00e9 dans les six mois, si un ordre n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 donne par le juge pour suspendre la proc\u00e9dure pendant la session. Il n'y en a pas eu dans cette cause, et l'honorable juge a eu, suivant ma mani\u00e8re de voir, raison de juger que le temps de la session ne devait pas compter dans les six mois. Sous ce rapport je suis d'avis que son jugement doit \u00eatre confirm\u00e9.\nEn peut-il \u00eatre de m\u00eame de sa d\u00e9cision sur la deuxi\u00e8me question d\u00e9clarant que le temps du commencement du proc\u00e8s peut-\u00eatre \u00e9tendu au-del\u00e0 des six mois fix\u00e9 par la sec. 32?\nOn a vu d'apr\u00e8s l'expos\u00e9 des proc\u00e9dures donn\u00e9 plus haut, que dans les six mois qui ont suivi le 25 avril, il n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait aucune demande \u00e0 la cour ou au juge pour une extension de d\u00e9lai ni pour fixer le proc\u00e8s. Ce n'est que le 17 novembre que le lieu du proc\u00e8s a \u00e9t\u00e9 fix\u00e9 et, le 1er d\u00e9cembre, plus de sept mois apr\u00e8s la pr\u00e9sentation de la p\u00e9tition, que le d\u00e9lai pour commencer le proc\u00e8s a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tendu jusqu'au 12 janvier dernier. Ces deux ordres ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 prononc\u00e9s apr\u00e8s l'expiration des six mois, la cour poss\u00e9dait-elle encore le pouvoir de rendre de tels ordres? La r\u00e9ponse d\u00e9pend de l'effet que l'on doit donner \u00e0 la premi\u00e8re partie de la sec. 32. Si on le consid\u00e8re comme une injonction formelle et absolue de commencer le proc\u00e8s dans les six mois, il faut en conclure que la cour n'avait plus alors le pouvoir de prononcer les ordres en questions.\nTous les juges sont d'accord que la l\u00e9gislature en faisant ce d\u00e9lai de six mois a voulu rendre beaucoup plus prompte qu'elle ne l'\u00e9tait auparavant, l'exp\u00e9dition des proc\u00e8s d'\u00e9lection,\u2014mais ils diff\u00e8rent d'opinion sur l'effet \u00e0 donner \u00e0 cette disposition. N'est-elle qu'un d\u00e9lai de proc\u00e9dure susceptible; malgr\u00e9 son caract\u00e8re imp\u00e9ratif, d'\u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme simplement directoire, ou bien cette disposition ne fait-elle pas plut\u00f4t essentiellement partie de la juridiction transf\u00e9r\u00e9e des comit\u00e9s parlementaires aux tribunaux civils sur les contestations d'\u00e9lections? Dans la section 2, il est formellement d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que cette juridiction sera sujette aux dispositions de cet acte (ch. 9.)\nApr\u00e8s avoir r\u00e9gl\u00e9 le d\u00e9lai pour la pr\u00e9sentation, le service de la p\u00e9tition, le d\u00e9lai pour la production des objections pr\u00e9liminaires, la mani\u00e8re dont la contestations serait li\u00e9e, vient l'injonction formelle que le proc\u00e8s devra \u00eatre commenc\u00e9 dans les six mois de la pr\u00e9sentation de la p\u00e9tition et se continuer de jour en jour jusqu'\u00e0 ce qu'il soit termin\u00e9. C'est dans cette section que le juge qui pr\u00e9side au proc\u00e8s doit trouver la source du pouvoir qu'il doit exercer. Il lui est enjoint d'une mani\u00e8re absolue de commencer le proc\u00e8s dans les six mois\u2014il doit y proc\u00e9der de jour en jour. Le caract\u00e8re imp\u00e9ratif de cette clause ne lui laisse aucune discr\u00e9tion \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard. Le d\u00e9lai fix\u00e9, expir\u00e9, la juridiction cesse, \u00e0 moins qu'elle n'ait \u00e9t\u00e9 conserv\u00e9e en vertu de la sec. 33, par le proc\u00e9d\u00e9 qu'elle autorise. Mais si aucun proc\u00e9d\u00e9 de ce genre n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9 pendant les six mois de la pr\u00e9sentation de la p\u00e9tition, le juge ou la cour est sans pouvoir pour fixer une autre \u00e9poque pour le proc\u00e8s que celle indiqu\u00e9e par la sec. 32.\nLe pouvoir donn\u00e9 par la section 33, peut-il \u00eatre exerc\u00e9 apr\u00e8s les six mois? s'il le peut, la section 32 perd n\u00e9cessairement son caract\u00e8re imp\u00e9ratif et absolue et devient tout-\u00e0-fait inutile. C'est la faire dispara\u00eetre du statut. Si l'objet \u00e9tait r\u00e9ellement d'assurer une prompte exp\u00e9dition des affaires d'\u00e9lection, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 tout-\u00e0-fait manqu\u00e9 et la loi devient sans effets. Mais ses dispositions sont trop formelles pour qu'on puisse en arriver \u00e0 une pareille conclusion. La section 33 qui aurait l'effet d'an\u00e9antir la section 32, cesse de produire cet effet et ne fait qu'assurer les fins de la justice, si on consid\u00e8re qu'elle n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 introduite que pour rem\u00e9dier \u00e0 ce que pourrait avoir, en certains cas, de trop rigoureux le d\u00e9lai de six mois. Il peut arriver fr\u00e9quemment qu'un proc\u00e8s commenc\u00e9 dans les six mois et conduit avec diligence se trouve tout-\u00e0-coup arr\u00eat\u00e9 par l'absence, ou la maladie des t\u00e9moins indispensables, faudra t-il dans ces cas pour ob\u00e9ir \u00e0 la r\u00e8gle d\u00e9s six mois sacrifier les int\u00e9r\u00eats de la justice? Non, la loi a voulu pour obvier \u00e0 ces inconv\u00e9nients que la juridiction puisse, dans ces cas, se continuer au del\u00e0 d\u00e8s six mois.\nElle en indique le moyen dans la section 33. Mais ce moyen doit \u00eatre employ\u00e9 pendant que la juridiction existe encore et avant l'expiration des six mois. S'il pouvait l'\u00eatre apr\u00e8s les six mois, la section 32 serait illusoire. En exer\u00e7ant dans les six mois la facult\u00e9 donn\u00e9e par la section 33, chacune des deux sections 32 et 33 peut recevoir son enti\u00e8re ex\u00e9cution. Si les six mois de la section 32 sont expir\u00e9s sans que le proc\u00e8s ait \u00e9t\u00e9 commenc\u00e9, la juridiction cesse et cette section re\u00e7oit son effet. Si les int\u00e9r\u00eats de la justice, d'apr\u00e8s des faits qui doivent \u00eatre \u00e9tablis par affidavit, sont jug\u00e9s suffisants par le juge pour \u00e9tendre le d\u00e9lai, la section 33 re\u00e7oit alors son effet et le but de la loi est rempli.\nA part de la sec. 33, l'intim\u00e9 a invoqu\u00e9 encore les sec. 2 et 64 du ch. 9 comme autorisant la cour ou le juge \u00e0 \u00e9tendre le d\u00e9lai au del\u00e0 de six mois. La sec. 2 dit que les cours autoris\u00e9es \u00e0 d\u00e9cider les \u00e9lections contest\u00e9es auront, sujettes aux dispositions de cet acte...... (ch. 9) les m\u00eames pouvoir et juridiction dans les affaires d'\u00e9lections qu'elles ont dans les mati\u00e8res civiles de leur juridiction ordinaire.\nCette disposition g\u00e9n\u00e9rale est faite pour rencontrer les cas non pr\u00e9vus par le statut et autoriser pour ces cas les cours \u00e0 faire application aux affaires d'\u00e9lection des r\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure et de pratique de leur propres tribunaux. Cette disposition ne peut \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme pouvant annuler les dispositions sp\u00e9ciales ou y \u00eatre substitu\u00e9e. Lui donner un semblable effet, ce serait mettre de c\u00f4t\u00e9 la r\u00e8gle d'interpr\u00e9tation bien \u00e9tablie que les dispositions g\u00e9n\u00e9rales ne peuvent annuler les dispositions sp\u00e9ciales d'un statut. On ne peut en cons\u00e9quence s'appuyer sur cette sec. 2 pour annuler l'effet de la sec. 32 qui contient une prescription formelle au sujet du d\u00e9lai dans lequel doit se faire le proc\u00e8s. Le m\u00eame argument doit s'appliquer \u00e0 la sec 64 donnant le pouvoir d'\u00e9tendre les d\u00e9lais.\nApr\u00e9s avoir examin\u00e9 l'acte des \u00e9lections contest\u00e9es dans son ensemble et compar\u00e9 ses diverses sections les unes avec les autres, j'en suis venu \u00e0 la conclusion que pour donner \u00e0 cette loi son v\u00e9ritable effet, je dois adopter l'opinion que le temps de la session doit compter dans les six mois, s'il n'y a pas eu demande au contraire,\u2014et que le d\u00e9lai de six mois pour commencer le proc\u00e8s est de l'essence de la juridiction donn\u00e9e\u2014et qu'il n'est pas susceptible d'\u00eatre prolong\u00e9 au del\u00e0, \u00e0 moins d'une demande sp\u00e9ciale faite conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la sec. 33, avant l'expiration des d\u00e9lais. En cons\u00e9quence, je suis d'avis que le pr\u00e9sent appel doit \u00eatre allou\u00e9 sur le principe que le juge n'avait pas le pouvoir de faire le proc\u00e8s de l'appelant.\nS'il y a plusieurs points importants auxquels je n'ai point fait allusion, comme par exemple l'\u00e9tat de la jurisprudence en Angleterre sur la prorogation des d\u00e9lais d'appel, les deux d\u00e9cisions de cette cour dans Wheeler v. Gibbs[17], etc., etc., c'est que l'honorable juge Taschereau ayant eu l'obligeance de me communiquer les notes si savantes et si compl\u00e8tes qu'il a pr\u00e9par\u00e9es sur cette cause, j'ai trouv\u00e9 ces questions si bien trait\u00e9es qu'il m'a paru impossible d'y rien ajouter. Non-seulement sur ces questions particuli\u00e8res, mais aussi sur celles de la computation du d\u00e9lai de la session\u2014et de la limite \u00e0 six mois de la juridiction pour commencer le proc\u00e8s,\u2014questions qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 si compl\u00e9tement d\u00e9velopp\u00e9es dans ses notes,\u2014je suis heureux de pouvoir dire que je partage enti\u00e8rement ses vues.\nHENRY J.\u2014In my judgment in the Quebec County Election Case[18], delivered a few days ago, I held that the time of the sitting of Parliament, as referred to in section 32 of the controverted elections' act, was not to be added to the six months prescribed in that section for the trial of an election petition, unless in the particular circumstances referred to in that section.\nI also held, in that case, that under the provisions of section 33 the court, or a judge, had no power to enlarge the time for the commencement of the trial of an election petition unless such enlargement were made by an order previous to the expiration of the prescribed six months, and I gave my reasons for arriving at those conclusions.\nThere is a general power given by sub-section 4 of section 31 of the act, to the judge at the trial to adjourn the same from time to time and from one place to another in the same electoral district, but in view of the provisions of section 32 a judge could not enlarge the time for the commencement of a trial beyond the prescribed six months from the presentation of the petition, unless by the terms of that section it was made to appear to the court or a judge that the respondent's presence at the trial was necessary in which case the time occupied by the session of parliament would be added to the prescribed six months.\nNo such application was made in this case and, therefore, the time for the commencement of the trial herein expired at the end of six months from the presentation of the petition.\nNo application was made to the court or a judge in this case under section 33 within the prescribed six months from the presentation of the petition, and I adhere to my holding in the Quebec County Election Case that the court or judge had no power to enlarge the time for the commencement of the trial by an order made subsequent to the expiration of the prescribed six months. My conclusion in this case, therefore, is that the prescribed six months having expired the judge who tried the merits of this case had no jurisdiction or power to do so and that this court has no power to decide on the merits of the case by an appeal from his decision.\nI think, therefore, the appeal should be allowed and the petition herein dismissed with costs.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014By sec. 32 ch. 9 of the Revised Statutes of Canada, it is enacted that:\u2014\nSec. 32. The trial of every election petition shall be commenced within six months from the time when such petition has been presented, and shall be proceeded with from day to day until such trial is over; but if at any time it appears to the court or a judge, that the respondents presence at the trial is necessary, such trial shall not be commenced during any session of parliament; and in the computation of any time or delay allowed for any step or proceeding in respect of any such trial, or for the commencement thereof as aforesaid, the time occupied by such session of parliament shall not be included.\nIn the case now submitted the petition was presented on the 25th day of April, 1887, during a session of parliament which was closed on the 23rd June; subsequently on the 1st day of December following, that is to say, more than six months after the presentation of the petition, but within six months of the prorogation of parliament, an order was obtained from the Common Pleas Division extending the time for the commencement of the trial of the said petition for a period of two months, and on the 17th of December the trial thereof was definitely fixed for the 12th day of January, on which day it was held. At the opening of the case objection was taken by the respondent to the said petition to the jurisdiction of the court, on the ground that more than six months had elapsed since the presentation of the petition, and that the order extending the time for the commencement of the trial thereof was void and illegal because it had been given after the expiration of the six months and, therefore, given without jurisdiction. The learned judge presiding at the trial ruled that the time of the session was not excluded, and that the six months had elapsed, but at the same time ruled that the time had been legally extended. This trial therefore proceeded, and judgment was given setting aside the election for corrupt practices committed by the appellant. Upon the present appeal the same objections are taken on the part of the appellant, and are, of course, to be first determined.\nFirst in order comes the question whether the delay of six months enacted by the aforesaid section 32 of the statute, for the commencement of the trial, is interrupted or suspended by a session of parliament in all cases, and whether or not it has been made to appear to the court or judge that the presence of the respondent at the trial is necessary. Upon this question there is, in my opinion, no room for doubt. As I read the statute, the general rule is that the trial of every election petition must be commenced within six months. The law enacts it in so many words. Can anything be clearer than its terms?\u2014\"The trial of every election petition shall be commenced within six months from the time when such petition was presented.\" To me it seems that, so far, the letter of the law is as plain and unambiguous as it can possibly be, and that it leaves no room for interpretation.\nWhat does this clause next enact? It enacts, in clear terms again, that if at any time it appears to the court or a judge that the respondent's presence at the trial is necessary such trial shall not be commenced during a session of parliament. Now, this is plainly enacted by way of exception to this general rule laid down in the first part of this clause. Within six months this trial must commence except, not when a session of parliament intervenes, that is not what this act says, but when and only when upon an application on his part it is made to appear to the court that the presence of the respondent at the trial is necessary. If there is no such application, or if upon such an application the court is not satisfied that the presence of the respondent is necessary, the time runs, and the trial may be commenced during any session of parliament. All this seems to me so plain, that with the greatest respect for the contrary judicial opinions expressed on the point I cannot but say that it is, to my mind, inconceivable that any doubt could ever have arisen upon it.\nIt is argued further, however, that under the last part of this said section the time occupied by a session of parliament is not to be included in the six months. But this construction is, it seems to me, totally repugnant to the other parts of the section. If in all cases a session of parliament is a suspension of the delay, as contended for by the respondent, why should the act oblige the sitting member, in order that the trial be not commenced during such session, to apply to the court, and to make it appear that his presence at the trial is necessary? Not only is he obliged to make an application for that purpose, but the court, before granting his prayer, must be satisfied by affidavits or otherwise that his presence is necessary, and, I repeat it, may if not so satisfied, fix a day for the trial to commence during and notwithstanding a session of parliament. It seems to me that if, in all cases, parliament had intended that the time occupied by a session should be excluded in the computation of the six months, it would have said so in so many words. This subject would have been accomplished by simply leaving out of this section 32, the middle part of it, so as to make it read: \"The trial of every election petition shall be commenced within six months from the time when such petition has been presented, and shall be proceeded with from day to day until such trial is over; but in the computation of any time or delay allowed for any step or proceding in respect of any such trial, or for the commencement thereof as aforesaid, the time occupied by any session of parliament shall not be included.\" That is how the respondent reads the statute, but that is not the statute; that construction leaves out a part of it, and this cannot be done. I am therefore of opinion that the six months mentioned in the said section expired in the case submitted on the 25th October.\nNow, was the order of the 1st December extending the time for the trial of this petition valid and legal, or, in other words, can the time for commencing the trial be fixed or enlarged, under sec. 33 of the act, after the expiration of the six months mentioned in sec. 32?\nThe court or a judge may, notwithstanding anything in the next preceding section, from time to time enlarge the time for the commencement of the trial, if, on an application for that purpose supported by affidavit, it appears to such court or judge that the requirements of justice render such enlargement necessary.\nThe appellant contends that this power to enlarge the time for the commencement of the trial expires with the six months referred to in the preceding clause. On the part of the respondent it is urged that this power exists even after the expiration of the six months.\nAs a first ground in support of the legality of the orders of the Common Pleas Division in this case, sections 2 and 35 of the act have been relied upon by the respondent. These sections enact, in substance, that as to election petitions the courts in the different provinces and the judge at the trial shall have the same power, authority and jurisdiction as if such petition were an ordinary cause within the jurisdiction of the said court or judge, but subject always to the provisions of the act. It is argued that as under rule 462 of the Ontario Judicature Act the power to extend the time for doing an act or taking any proceeding is, in express terms, given to the court even after the time has expired, consequently the court, on an election petition, has the same power and may extend the time for the commencement of the trial, even after the expiration of the six months. But that argument upon reasoning and authority is groundless. The words \"subject to the provisions of this act\" govern these enactments.\nWe consequently have first to ascertain what are the provisions of the act, and when any special provisions on any matter are found, they must be given full effect to, independently of the said sections 2 and 35 To hold such special provisions nullified or controlled by general clauses of this nature would be contrary to well settled rules on the construction of such statutory enactments. The case of Maude v. Towley[19] is a clear authority on this point. There an amendment had been allowed after the presentation of an election petition. The court, in ordinary causes, had full power to amend, and by an enactment exactly similar to those contained in sections 2 and 35, in question here, the election act which governed the case gave to the court, on election petitions, the same power and authority they had in ordinary causes, subject, however, as here, to the provisions of the act. It was argued that as the court had the power to amend in ordinary causes, it had the same power on an election petition. But the court rejected that contention. \"It must be remembered that our jurisdiction in these matters is limited,\" said Lord Coleridge, C.J., and the court granted an order to set aside the amendment, on the ground that the words \"subject to the act\" governed the clause, giving them the same power as in ordinary cases, and that to allow the enlargement of the petition or an addition to it by an amendment after its presentation, would be to nullify the clause of the act which enacted that it should be presented within a certain time. This decision was approved of and followed in the more recent case of Clark v. Walland[20], and the court also then held that an amendment of an election petition enlarging the allegations of the petition and adding to it could not be allowed for want of jurisdiction. Referring to the words and subject to this act, in the clause there under consideration, Gwynn J. said: \"Now, it cannot be contended that we can strike out these words of the section. We must give them some meaning, and the only meaning that can be given to them is, subject to the provisions of this act. We must therefore look to the provisions of this act.\" These cases are clearly in point.\nIn Alldridge v. Hurst[21] also, Grover J. said upon the same clause:\u2014\nIt will be observed that the powers there given shall be subject to the provisions of the act, and we think it clear that the jurisdiction conferred by the act cannot in all respects be the same as that of the court in ordinary causes.\nIt seems to me clear, therefore, that sections 2 and 35 of the act can have no application to the commencement of the trial because special provisions have been enacted in the act upon the matter. For the same reason, I do not think that section 69 has any application here. That section enacts that the court shall have power to extend from time to time the period limited for taking any steps or proceedings. Now, by a well settled rule of construction, this general enactment of the statute cannot be extended to the commencement of the trial, because, for this proceeding, special provisions are enacted in the statute, sec. 33.\nNow what is the interpretation to be given to this sec. 33? To answer this question, it would be manifestly contrary to all rules to read this section as if it were standing alone and by itself in the statute. The purport and intention of the legislature must be ascertained before we can correctly construe any particular clause of any act, and that, obviously, cannot be done without taking into consideration and weighing attentively all the act and more specially the clauses of it bearing particularly on the same identical matter. Now, here, this section 33 has relation to the time for commencing the trial of an election petition. A reference to section 32 immediately preceding it shows that this also contains an enactment on the same subject. Therefore, we cannot construe section 33 without taking into consideration sec. 32. One must be read in the light of the other.\nNow this sec. 32 enacts in so many words that the trial shall commence within six months. This is a clear, positive enactment, mandatory in its form. To say that it is merely directory is to read it out of the statute. If the parties are at liberty by simply not proceeding to tacitly consent that the trial should be held two, three, four years afterwards, or even not at all, the clear intention of the legislature is set at naught.\nThe policy of the law is to prevent the delays which, when the election petitions were tried by committees of the House of Commons, very often rendered these proceedings nugatory, and it has unquestionably enacted this period of six months for the commencement of the trial to force the petitioner to proceed. This enactment cannot have been made only in favor of the respondent, or of any of the parties to the cause, but it is undoubtably based on reasons of public policy. The legislature intended that the state of excitement, agitation, and uncertainty in which it necessarily placed the constituency concerned in the election petition should not be unduly prolonged. Moreover the composition of the House of Commons and the representation of any one constituency is a matter that concerns the Dominion at large. I take it then that the legislature having so clearly expressed its intention that the trial of election petitions should not be unduly delayed, we are bound to see if the act does not bear a construction which will give effect to this intention. Now, to read sec. 32 as a mandatory enactment and as a peremptory limitation of time, at the expiration of which the petitioner is out of court, is the only possible way to attain that result. Otherwise, there would be no sanction to the command of the law. It would be leaving the law as if that six months' enactment were not in it, and operate as a virtual repeal of it.\nBy the construction which I think should be given to both these sections, 32 and 33, I give full effect to both; the trial must be fixed to commence within six months, but if at any time, on an application supported by affidavits, after a day has been so fixed by either of the parties, before the day so fixed, the court or a judge is satisfied that the ends of justice require it, the time so fixed may be enlarged. When section 33 speaks of the time for the commencement of the trial, it necessarily speaks of a time within the six months enacted in sec. 32. It is impossible to apply this sec. 33 to the judge at the trial, for, as to him, his powers to adjourn the trial, or postpone it from time to time, are regulated by sec. 31, sub-sec. 4.\nIt has been urged that by this construction of clause 32 means are given for collusion between the petitioner and respondent to allow the petition to lapse, inconsistently with the numerous precautions prescribed in the act respecting the withdrawal of a petition in order to protect the public interest. But there is no ground for this contention, as by sub-sec. 2 of that very same section 32, and, it seems to me, for the very purpose of preventing such collusion, at any time after the expiration of three months after such petition has been presented any elector may, if the trial has not been fixed, be substituted for the petitioner.\nThen, does not the construction contended for by the respondent here itself allow means, and I should think much easier means, of collusion between the parties to the petition? For according to this construction, not only is the petitioner not bound to proceed during the six months, but if in collusion with the respondent he may never proceed at all.\nThe case of Banner v. Johnson[22] has been mentioned by the respondent in support of his contention, but in my opinion that case is entirely distinguishable. The holding there was that under a statute which enacted that an appeal should be taken within three weeks from the date of the judgment unless such time was extended by the Court of Appeal, an extension of time could be granted by such Court of Appeal after the expiration of the three weeks. But that was a case, it must be remembered, under the Companies Act, and where private interests only were in question. Then the clause there under consideration before the House of Lords was standing alone and entirely unconnected with any other part of the act. The reasoning upon which I have endeavored to show that upon the wording of section 32 on grounds of public policy the intention of the legislature was that no undue delay should retard the trial of elections petitions could clearly not have applied to the statute under consideration in the House of Lords. Here, as I have observed, it is not only one clause of the statute that we have to construe, but these two clauses 32 and 33 together. We must put such a construction on them that, if possible, both should have their full force and effect. Now the construction put upon section 33 by the respondent virtually repeals section 32 and frustrates the express enactment of the legislature that the trial should commence within six months. Under that construction the trial may be delayed indefinitely, while the construction I think should be given presents in the fullest manner the policy and object of the legislature, and at the same time gives effect to both of these sections, which in my opinion we are, according to well understood canons of construction, bound to do.\nThe case of Wheeler v. Gibbs[23] in this court also relied upon by the respondent is also on a statute entirely different from this one. The question there to be determined turned upon the construction of sec. 48 of the Supreme Court Act, now sec. 51, ch. 9, of the Revised Statutes, as to the three days notice required by that section that the appeal has been set down for hearing. Now there, as in Banner v. Johnston, the clause under consideration stood in the act by itself and unconnected with any other clause of the act. The legislature while clearly enacting that the trial should commence within six months has omitted to provide as clearly for the appeal, and the consequences of this omission are exemplified in a striking manner by that very case of Wheeler v. Gibbs, wherein a judgment annulling the election given in February, 1879, was not heard in appeal till March, 1880, and the appeal not determined till June, 1880, sixteen months after the original judgment. The clause of the statute that governed Wheeler v. Gibbs left it open to the parties to postpone indefinitely and at their will and pleasure, by consent and without affidavits, the hearing of the appeal, while the clauses that govern the present case fix a limit of six months for the commencement of the trial and authorize an enlargement of time only upon application supported by affidavits. The same ground of distinction exists as to Banner v. Johnston. The court would not enlarge the time if not satisfied by the affidavits that there are good grounds for it, but then what becomes of the petition? Is it to be considered as having been out of court at the expiration of the six months, or if not at what period? Then, the petitioner may never apply for an enlargement of time and the respondent is not bound to move to dismiss it. Is the petition to stand till the expiration of parliament? Is a whole constitutency thus to be left indefinitely in a state of uncertainty as to its representation in parliament? Has the house of commons thus indefinitely to suffer that one of its members sits there with a cloud on his title?\nHis Lordship the Chief Justice in rendering judgment in the case of Wheeler v. Gibbs, said:\u2014\nFull effect should be given to the clear and definite words of the legislature, there being nothing on the face of the statute to indicate a contrary intention.\nAnd the doctrines so laid down cannot be questioned. It is clear and sound law. But in the present case, on the face of the statute, as I read it, there is as regards the trial, the enactment of sec. 32 indicating that the power to enlarge the time for the commencement of the trial given by section 33 cannot be exercised after the expiration of the six months, an enactment similar to which none was applicable in Wheeler v. Gibbs. Otherwise, I repeat it, sec. 32 as to the six months' limit is useless and without any meaning. It must be noticed also in the case of Wheeler v. Gibbs that the delay of three days given for the notice of appeal there in question, was so short that the court would reasonably not construe the statute strictly, specially in a case of appeal, the right to which is always favorably viewed, and protected as much as possible by the courts. Here the delay given is certainly not short. In Banner v. Johnston I also remark one of their lordships, Lord Cairns, seems to have been greatly influenced by the consideration that if the House of Lords could not extend the time after the three weeks allowed by the statute, the House would virtually be without jurisdiction, or unable to exercise their juridiction for about one half of the year, a consideration which does not apply here. These two cases of Banner v. Johnson and Wheeler v. Gibbs are clearly distinguishable upon another ground. In the enactments there under consideration the proceeding, for doing which the courts held that the time could be extended even after the expiration of the time fixed by the statutes which ruled these cases, was a proceeding that could be done by one of the parties only. The notice of appeal could, of course, be given only by the appellant and the extension of time be asked only by him. Here it is clear that the extension of time for the commencement of the trial can be asked, under section 33, by any of the parties to the petition, and by the respondent as well as by the petitioner. It is a right common to them both. Now, it is evident that it is only within the six months from the date of the presentation of the petition that the respondent can require, or have any object in asking, an extension of time for the commencement of the trial. If, within the six months, the petitioner has not proceeded to get the trial fixed, and if he, by his not proceeding, leaves the respondent undisturbed in possession of his seat, the respondent has no enlargement of time to ask. He does not require any, or rather he gets all the enlargement possible by the simple non-proceeding of his adversary. This again shows that the enlargement of time permissible under section 33 must be an enlargement within the six months mentioned in section 32. Otherwise, while this enactment would, within the six months, apply to both parties, it would, after the six months, apply to the petitioner alone.\nAnd what again shows clearly that this limitation of six months was intended to be peremptory is that any other elector, if the petitioner does not proceed, can ask to be substituted for the petitioner at the expiration not of six months, but of three months, so that even in such a case the trial should commence within the six months. The petitioner is in default if he does not proceed within three months, and a new petitioner can be substituted for him. But, in any case, the trial must commence within six months. At the end of the three months in the first case, the petitioner is out of court, but the petition remains; but at the end of six months, the petition itself is out of court, if the trial has not been commenced, or the time therefor enlarged.\nIt has been further argued on the part of the respondent as one of the grounds in support of his contention that the enactment of sec. 32 as to the six months is directory only and not mandatory; that in various acts, where the legislature has intended that proceedings should not be taken after a certain time, the clause limiting such time contains the words \"and not afterwards,\" and as example of this we have been referred to ch. 8 of the revised statutes, sec. 117; ch. 32, sec. 240, and to an Imperial Act. To this the answer is obvious. When such a clause has these words, \"and \"not afterwards\" it is plain and plainer than the present one; there is then no room for interpretation. But I fail to understand that we are to infer from that where these words are not in a statute, that a limitation of time therein means nothing and that proceedings for which a time is limited can always and in every case be done after the time so limited. There are a number of statutes where clauses limiting a time to do an act or take a proceeding have not the words \"and \"not afterwards,\" and yet such act of proceeding clearly cannot be done or taken after the time limited. Take the very statute now under consideration, the Controverted Elections Act, sec. 12 thereof for instance enacts that within five days after the service of the petition, the respondent may present any preliminary objections he may have against the petition. Now, if I am not mistaken, it has never been contended that preliminary objections to a petition could be presented after the five days. Yet, the act does not say \"and not afterwards.\" Another similar instance of this is to be found in section 51 of this very same act, which directs that a party desiring to appeal to this court shall within eight days deposit $100 as security. I do not think it could have been contended that an appeal could be taken after the eight days, though there are no negative words in the clause. The case Peacock v. R.[24]is in that sense. There the right to appeal was given by a statute, upon the party dissatisfied with the judgment applying in writing within three days to the justice to sign a case. The appellant had allowed more than three days to elapse before making his application. The Court of Appeal quashed his appeal. \"We have no jurisdiction, said the court, unless the provisions of the act are strictly complied with.\" Yet, there again the statute under consideration, limiting the time to three days, had not the words \"and not afterwards.\"\nThe case of Lord v. Lee[25] has also been cited by the respondent in support of this contention that an extension of time may be granted in certain cases after the time first given to do any act has expired, but that case, which was on an arbitrator's award, was determined on the ground that the extension of the time within which the arbitrator has to make the award amounts to a ratification, a doctrine which clearly is not applicable to the present case. There as in Banner v. Johnston private interests only were in controversy and the parties to the cause only could be affected by any of the proceedings, or by the result of the cause. And that obviously is why the statute which governed that case not only allowed an extension by the judge of the time for filing the award but also specially enacted that the time could be extended by consent of the parties. Now, under the act now under consideration, there is no such enactment; and, clearly, for obvious reasons, such an enactment would be repugnant to the whole policy of the act. It is evident that an enactment by which the parties to an election petition could be allowed, by consent, to enlarge the time for the trial thereof, or postpone it at their will and pleasure, would open the door to collusion between the parties which the legislature in so many parts of the act endeavored to prevent. But the respondent's contention is that, though the parties cannot by an express consent delay the trial, yet they may do it by a much easier mode, that is tacitly, and impliedly, by both agreeing not to proceed at all. Is it possible that the legislature intended it to be so and that the parties can so be at liberty to do indirectly, that which they cannot directly do, and so openly defeat and nullify the intention of the legislature?\nI hold, for these reasons, that the judge in this case proceeded wholly without jurisdiction, and that all the proceedings before him were coram non judice. The appellant appeals from his judgment at the trial, and from that judgment an appeal clearly lies; and the objection to his jurisdiction was clearly open to the appellant as a reason of appeal. The judge decided as a question of law that he had jurisdiction, and sec. 50 of the act gives an appeal from the decision on any question of law of the judge who tried the petition. I need hardly add that if the judge had no jurisdiction, the Court of Common Pleas' orders of the 1st and 17th of December could not confer on him any.\nTo give to these orders the effect of a kind of revivor order, by which a petition out of court was restored and brought into a new vitality, cannot, it seems to me, be seriously contended for, It follows in fact from what I have said that, in my opinion, these orders were made without jurisdiction, and are themselves null and void. I would allow this appeal with costs.\nIn the cases of L'Islet, Montmorency, Quebec County and L'Assomption, we recently held that there was no appeal to this court under section 50 of the act, because the appeals therein were not either from judgments on preliminary objections, or from the judgment or decision of the judge who had tried the petition, the only two appeals given by that section. Here the appeal is from the judgment of the judge who tried the petition, from which an appeal clearly lies.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014The election petition in this case was filed in the Common Pleas Division of the High Court of Justice for Ontario. By rule 23 of the rules of court enacted under the provisions of section 44 of 37 Vic., c. 10, (sec. 66, ch. 9 of the Revised Statutes,) it was enacted that,\nThe time and place of the trial of each election petition shall be fixed by the court and notice thereof shall be given in writing by the clerk of the court by affixing the same in some conspicuous place in his office, sending one copy by the post to the address given by the petitioner, another to the address given by the respondent, and a copy by the post to the sheriff fifteen days before the day appointed for the trial. The sheriff shall forthwith publish the same in the Electoral Division.\nBy an order of the said Common Pleas Division of the High Court of Justice made on the 17th December, 1887, under the said rule No. 23, the issues joined in the said election petition were sent down to be tried at the town of Cornwall, in the county of Stormont, upon the 12th day of January, 1888. Upon that day the trial court for the trial of the said issues, and which by the statute is made an independent court of record wholly distinct from the court in which the petition was filed, was opened as prescribed by the rule or order of the Common Pleas Division. Before the trial was entered upon counsel for the above appellant, the then respondent, objected to the jurisdiction of the said court to try the petition upon the naked ground that six months had elapsed since its presentation, and he asked the learned judge to note his objection, whereupon the trial proceeded and at its close the learned judge who presided at the trial court rendered his judgment in the following terms[26]:\u2014\nFrom this judgment the now appellant has appealed to this court on the ground:\n1st. That the said trial court had no jurisdiction to try the petition; that the petition was out of court at the time of the trial, and that the judge presiding at the said trial court should have so determined and dismissed the petition.\n2. That the learned judge should not, upon the evidence, have found in favor of the petitioner on the charges of bribery by an agent and should not have avoided the election, and\n3. That the learned judge erred in finding the present appellant guilty of bribery and his judgment, assuming that he had jurisdiction to try the petition, should be reversed so far as the finding upon the personal charges is concerned.\nAs to the first of these objections I am of opinion that the learned judge had jurisdiction to try the petitions and that he did right in proceeding with the trial, and that he not only should not have dismissed the petition, if he had had authority so to do, but that he had no authority to dismiss the petition upon the ground suggested or upon any ground. I am of opinion that the petition was not out of court at the time of the trial; and further that the reason suggested why the learned judge should not have proceeded with the trial cannot be made a ground of appeal to this court against his decision upon the trial of the matter of the petition.\nThe trial court over which the learned judge who tried the petition presided is, as already pointed out, made by the statute a wholly distinct court from the court in which the petition was and still is pending. That Court was the Common Pleas Division of the High Court of Justice for Ontario, which court having, by the order dated the 17th December, 1887, sent the case down to be tried by a trial court, this latter court had no jurisdiction to enquire or decide whether the petition had, or had not, been sent down for trial regularly by the court making the order for such trial.\nThe Controverted Elections Act authorises the court in which the petition is pending from time to time to enlarge the time for the commencement of the trial of the election petition beyond the period of six months named in the act if, on an application for that purpose supported by affidavit, it appears to such court that the requirements of justice render such enlargement necessary. Now the trial court had no right to enquire or decide whether or not such enlargement had in point of fact taken place, or if it had, whether or not the order making the enlargement had been obtained regularly, at a proper time or upon proper material. Questions as to the validity of the order if obtained, or whether any such order had in fact been obtained, were questions with which the trial court had nothing whatever to do, and upon which it had no right to pronounce any judgment. Its jurisdiction was limited to trial of the issues sent down by the Common Pleas Division to be tried, just as the jurisdiction of the old court of assize and nisi prius was limited to the trial of the issues of fact sent down by the court in which the action was pending to be tried by the court of assize and nisi prius; the duty of which court was to try such issues regardless of all questions whether the case was regularly sent down for trial or not, or whether sufficient or any notice of trial had been given or not, or the like. By sec. 13 of of 37 Vic. ch. 10, corresponding with sec. 31 of ch. 9 of the revised statutes, now replaced by sec. 3, of 50\u201351 Vic. ch. 7, it is enacted that it shall be competent for the judge who tries an election petition \"to decide \"any question raised as to the admissibility of the \"evidence offered or to receive such evidence under \"reserve subject to adjudication at the final hearing.\"\nApart from questions of law as applicable to the evidence given, questions as to the improper reception or rejection of evidence seem to me to be the only questions of law which can arise upon the trial of the matter of an election petition. The only matter in respect of which an appeal is given to this court after the trial of an election petition is, by the statute, declared to be, \"the judgment and decision of the \"judge who tried the petition upon any question of \"law or of fact,\" that is to say, as it appears to me, the decision of the learned judge upon the matters of fact and law involved in the issues of fact joined upon the petition, and his decision, if any there be, affecting the reception or rejection by him of evidence tendered in respect of such matters of fact.\nIt is the matter only of the petition as appearing on the record of the case, that is to say, the pleadings and the evidence which the statute authorises to be set down for hearing in appeal from the decision of the judge who tried the case, with this addition that in case it should appear to the court that any evidence duly tendered at the trial was improperly rejected the court may cause the witness to be examined before the court or a judge or upon commission. From the above clauses of the controverted elections' act it appears to me that the only matter which is appealable after trial is the judgment and decision of the judge upon the matters of fact and law involved in the issues joined upon the matter of the petition and upon any question of law arising in the course of the trial, affecting the decision upon the matters of fact, as the improper reception or rejection of material evidence.\nIn the appeal case before us it appears, although it does not seem to have been offered, or to have been admissible, in evidence upon the trial of the petition, that upon the 1st December, 1887, an order was made in the matter of the petition by the Common Pleas Division of the High Court of Justice where the petition was pending which is in the following terms[27]:\nNow it is, I think, very obvious that the trial court had no authority whatever to call in question the validity of this order or of that of the 17th December or to disregard them.\nThe suggestion made to the trial judge before the commencement of the trial to the effect that he had no jurisdiction to try the case was a vain, useless and irrelevant objection. It did not submit to his judgment and decision any point arising on the trial of, or affecting the matter of, the petition nor did it call for, nor could he legally make nor did he make, any judical decision upon it. He simply proceeded to try the case in obedience to the order of the court in which the petition was pending as it was his duty to do. Whether or not an order had been issued by the Common Pleas Division within six months from the presentation of the petition for extending the time for the commencement of the trial, of which order that of the 1st December was but in continuance, were matters not within the judicial cognizance of the trial judge at all. His judicial functions were limited to trying the matter of the issues joined on the petition sent down to him by the Common Pleas Division for trial. Anything therefore which may have been said by the trial judge in relation to the objection was, as it must needs have been, quite extra-judicial, for as judge presiding at the trial court in obedience to the orders of the Common Pleas Division of the High Court of Justice of the 1st and 17th of December, no question could legally have been submitted to his adjudication, calling for, or justifying him in giving, any judicial decision as to the validity or invalidity, the sufficiency or insufficiency of those orders. The Common Pleas Division was alone responsible for them. Under color however of an appeal from the judgment and decision of the trial judge rendered upon a trial of the petition upon the merits, the case has been turned into an appeal against the above orders of the Common Pleas Division against which, as was decided by this court in the present term in the L'Assomption, L'Islet, Montmorency and Quebec County election cases, no appeal lies whether the decision of the court which made the orders was right or wrong.\nAs an appeal to this court after the trial of an election petition can only be from the judgment and decision of the trial judge upon some question of law or fact arising upon the trial of the matter of the petition which it was competent for him and it was his duty to decide upon such trial; and as it was not competent for him to call in question the validity of the orders of the 1st and 17th of December, or to disregard them; and as in point of fact he did not make any adjudication or decision, nor, upon the trial of the matter of the petition, was it necessary that he should have made any decision, affecting the validity of the said orders, it is impossible, in my judgment, that upon this appeal, which is from the judgment and decision of the learned judge who presided at the trial court upon the merits of the matter of the petition, a point should be entertained by us affecting the validity of orders not made in the course of the trial\u2014not affecting the matter of the petition which was being tried\u2014not made by the judge of the trial court at all but by a wholly different court\u2014a point in fact which it was not competent for the learned judge of the trial court to have decided and which was wholly collateral to, and forms no part of, the decision of the learned judge upon the merits which alone forms the subject of the present appeal.\nWe should be very careful not to defeat the object which the legislature had in view when it submitted all questions affecting the return of members of parliament and the purity of elections to judicial enquiry in the courts of law, and when after a trial of an election petition it limited an appeal to this court to an appeal from the decision upon any question of law or fact of the judge who has tried the petition.\nIn the present case a trial has taken place, witnesses have been called, examined and heard upon both sides, the merits of the case have been fully gone into and gravely argued by counsel, and the learned judge who tried the petition has pronounced the election to be void for corrupt practices, committed by the sitting member and his agents, whereby the sitting member procured his return as a member of the house of commons. From this decision an appeal has been taken, on which appeal the statute provides that it is the record of the case as tried which shall be set down for hearing in this court, which record presents only the question whether or not the corrupt practices charged in the petition have been committed as the learned judge whose decision is appealed from has found them to have been. If we should now decline to adjudicate upon an appeal from this decision of the trial judge upon the merits so tried and adjudicated upon by him, and should so withhold from the house of commons the report required by the statute to be made to it, in relation to the corrupt practices found by the trial judge to have been committed, upon the ground that he had no jurisdiction to try the case, and that the orders of the 1st and 17th Dec., made by the divisional court, and in obedience to which the parties came before him and he tried the case, were made without any jurisdiction, we shall convert the appeal from one against the decision of the learned judge who tried the case, which is the only appeal authorised by the statute, into an appeal against the orders of the 1st and 17th Dec. and, we shall thus, I fear, be defeating the object of the legislature, which enacted that an appeal shall lie only from the judgment and decision of the judge who has tried the petition, and that upon such appeal it is the record of the case as tried which shall be set down for hearing by this court, and we shall be assuming a jurisdiction which, as we have already decided in the cases above mentioned, we do not possess.\nBut assuming the point to be open upon this appeal there is, in my opinion, nothing in it, for:\u2014\n1st. The time occupied in a session of parliament is, in my opinion, by the express terms of the act excluded in the computation of the time allowed for every step or proceeding in the matter of the petition necessary to be taken in order to bring the petition down to trial, and in such case the six months from the presentation of the petition had not expired when the order of the 1st of December was made, and 2nd, Even if the six months from the presentation of the petition had then expired the order of the 1st of December was, in my opinion, a good and valid order within the provision of the statute as to enlargement of the time for the commencement of the trial.\nNow that the time occupied in a session of parliament is not to be included in the computation of the time allowed for taking the several steps and proceedings necessary or authorised to be taken in respect of and for the purpose of bringing the matter of the petition down to trial and for the commencement thereof is, I think, very apparent if we refer to the steps and proceedings which are necessary or authorized to be taken, and to the statute 38 Vic. ch. 10, the substance of which the revised statute ch. 9 does not alter, although by altering the collocation of the sentences it creates some apparent confusion.\nBy 37 Vic. ch. 10, sec. 9, five days are allowed after presentation of the petition within which it may be served. By sec. 10 five days are allowed after service for the respondent to file any preliminary objections which he may have to urge. By sec. 11 five days were allowed after the dismissal of such preliminary objections, if dismissed, for the respondent to file an answer to the petition, and to serve a copy thereof on the petitioner, and it was by that section enacted that whether such answer should or not be filed, the petition should be deemed to be at issue after the expiration of the said five days, and the court, that is to say the court in which the petition was filed, was authorised at any time thereafter, upon the application of either party, to fix some convenient time and place for the trial of the petition. By sec. 13 it was enacted that notice of the time and place fixed for the trial of the petition should be given not less than fourteen days before the appointed day. By section 14 and the subsequent sections to 21 provision is made for the examination of the parties, petitioner and respondent, after the petition is at issue and before trial for the purpose of obtaining evidence to be used at the trial; of which examination 48 hours notice is required to be given to the party to be examined. So in like manner by sec. 24 the petitioner or respondent may, after issue is joined on the petition, obtain a side bar rule or order of the the court, still meaning the court in which the petition is pending, requiring the adverse party to produce within ten days after the service thereof, under oath, all documents in his custody or power relating to the matters in question, such production being also for the purposes of the trial and to be used as evidence thereat.\nSuch being the proceedings necessary and authorized to be taken before the petition should be brought down for trial and for the purposes of such trial the 38 Vic. ch. 10, sec. 1 enacts that:\u2014\nWhenever it appears to the court or judge that the respondent's presence at the trial is necessary, the trial of an election petition shall not be commenced during any session of parliament, and in the computation of any delay allowed for any step or proceeding in respect of any such trial or for the commencement of such trial under the next following section the time occupied by any such session shall not be reckoned.\nNow the only \"delays allowed for any step or proceed-in \"respect of such trial\" are the several times allowed and prescribed for the several steps and proceedings required or authorized to be taken in order to bring the petition down to trial, as above extracted from 37 Vic. ch. 10; there are no other steps or proceedings in an election petition case either before or after the commencement of the trial, consequently if the words \"and in the computation of any delay allowed for any step or proceeding in respect of any such trial,\" are not construed as applying to such steps and proceedings, no application whatever can be given to them and they become in effect absolutely eliminated from the statute. The words \"such trial\" as used in this section plainly apply to the previous words \"the trial of an election petition, and the words \"such session\" to the antecedent words \"any session of parliament.\" The 2nd sec. of 38 Vic. ch. 10, subject to certain provisions therein contained as to enlargement of the time of trial by the court and other matters to which it is not necessary here to refer, enacted that the trial of every election petition should be commenced within six months from the time when the petition was presented.\nNow, ch. 9 of the revised statutes while it alters the collocation of the sentences in 38 Vic. ch. 10, does not, in my judgment, make any alteration in the substance. It incorporates for consolidation into one act the several acts relating to controverted elections, including the several sections and provisions above extracted from 37 Vic. ch. 10, and as to the point now under consideration, which is the consolidation of 38. Vic. ch. 10 with 37 Vic. ch. 10, it places the sentences of the 1st and 2nd sentences of 38 Vic. in a different order from that in which they are placed in 38 Vic. without, in my opinion, altering the construction. Thus it enacts in sections 32 and 33 as follows:\u2014\nSec. 32. The trial of every election petition shall be commenced within six months from the time when such petition has been presented and shall be proceeded with from day to day until such trial is over; but if any time it appears to the court or a judge that the respondent's presence at the trial is necessary, such trial shall not be commenced during any session of parliament; and in the computation of any time or delay allowed for any step or proceeding in respect of any trial or for the commencement thereof as aforesaid, the time occupied by such session of parliament shall not be included.\n2. If at the expiration of three months after such petition has been presented, the day for trial has not been fixed, any elector may, on application, be substituted for the petitioner on such terms as the court or judge thinks just.\n33. The court or judge may, notwithstanding anything in the next preceding section, from time to time enlarge the time for commencement of the trial, if, on an application for that purpose supported by affidavit, it appears to such court or judge that the requirements of justice render such enlargement necessary.\n2. No trial of an election petition shall be commenced or proceeded with during any term of the court of which the judge to try the same is a member and at which such judge is by law bound to sit.\nNow it cannot be doubted that the words \"such trial\" where they first occur in the above 32nd section relate to the words in the commencement of the section \"the \"trial of every election petition,\" and there is no reason whatever why when the same words occur twice again in the same section they should receive any different interpretation\u2014they all refer to the same words namely, \"the trial of every election petition.\" The contention, however, is that in the sentence, \"and in \"the computation of any time or delay allowed for any \"step or proceeding in respect of any such trial, or for \"the commencement thereof as aforesaid, the time occupied \"by such session of parliament shall not be included,\" \"the above words \"time or delay allowed for \"any step or proceeding in respect of such trial\" do not relate to the times and delays allowed by the statute for steps or proceedings required to be taken in respect of the trial of election petitions generally, but to a case (after all these steps and proceedings have already been taken, and the petition has been brought down to trial), of no trial taking place by reason of the trial judge refusing to commence it because of the respondents presence thereat appearing to him to be necessary, a stage in the case of an election petition when no steps or proceedings in respect to the trial of it remain to be taken, and for which therefore no delays are by the statute provided or allowed. So likewise it is contended that the words \"such session' in the sentence \"the time occupied by such session of \"parliament shall not be included\" have not reference to the precedent words in the section \"any session of \"parliament,\" but only to a session during which a judge may have refused to try a petition upon the ground of his being of opinion that the respondent's presence at the trial is necessary. Such a construction, as I have already shown in my observations upon sec. 1 of 38 Vic. ch. 10, would render wholly nugatory the words \"in the computation of any time or delay allowed \"for any step or proceeding in respect of any such \"trial\" for after the postponement of the trial by a judge upon the ground of the respondent's presence at the trial appearing to him to be necessary, there is no step or proceeding whatever necessary to be taken or provided for in the statute, and for which any delay is allowed thereby. The plain meaning of the section appears to me to be that it is the trial judge who is prohibited from commencing the trial of an election petition during any session of parliament if the respondent's presence at the trial appears to him to be necessary. He is the person to form the opinion as to the necessity of the respondent's presence at the trial, and he is to exercise his own judgment on that question, notwithstanding that the petition may have been sent down for trial regularly by the court in which the petition is pending; and the residue of the section is (as was sec. 1 of the 38 Vic. ch. 10) for the purpose of providing that the time occupied in any session of parliament shall not be included in the computation either of the times and delays allowed by the act for the taking any steps or proceedings necessary to be taken in order to bring the case to trial, or for the commencement thereof The section then will read thus\n\"The trial of every election petition shall be commenced \"within six months from the time when such \"petition\" (that is the election petition to be tried) \"has been presented and shall be proceeded with from \"day to day until such trial is over\" (that is to say the trial of every election petition once commenced shall be proceeded with until the trial is over), \"but if at any \"time it appears to the court or a judge that the respondent's \"presence at the trial is necessary such trial shall \"not be commenced during any session of parliament\" (that is to say, if upon the trial of any election petition coming on at any time, the respondent's presence at the trial or, at such trial, appears to the trial judge to be necessary, the trial of such election petition, or \"such \"trial\" shall not be commenced during any session of parliament) and in the computation of \"any time or \"delay allowed for any step or proceeding in respect of \"any such trial, or for the commencement thereof as \"aforesaid, the time occupied by such session of parliament \"shall not be included.\" That is to say the trial of an election petition shall not in a certain case be commenced during any session of parliament, nor shall the time occupied by such, that is by any session of \"parliament,\" just spoken of, be included in the computation of the times and delays allowed for taking the several steps and proceedings necessary to be taken in order to bring the case of an election petition to trial or for the commencement of such trial. This construction gives effect to every word of the section while the construction contended for by the appellant absolutely eliminates from the section or renders nugatory the chief part thereof as already shown, and the result, as it appears to me, is that while the parties may, if they think fit, during any session of parliament take all the steps and proceedings necessary to be taken in order to bring an election petition down to trial, and may even commence and proceed with the trial, yet they can not be compelled to do so for the time occupied in any session shall not be included in the computation of the times and delays by the act allowed for taking the several steps and proceedings in the cause in respect of bringing the case to trial or for the commencement thereof. This I confess appears to me to be the true, natural and reasonable construction of the statute. Now as to the validity of the order of the 1st Dec, assuming the time occupied in the session of parliament to be included in the computation of six months from the presentation of the petition allowed for bringing the case down to trial. The petition was filed during a session of parliament, upon the 25th April, 1887; the contention of the appellant is that upon the expiration of six months from that date, no rule of court for enlarging the time having been obtained during such six months, the election petition was out of court and that therefore the court had no jurisdiction to make any order in it, and in support of this contention two cases are cited, namely Whistler v. Hancock[28]; and King v. Davenport[29]. In those cases orders had been made dismissing the actions for want of prosecution unless a statement of the plaintiff's claim in the respective cases should be delivered within certain periods named in the orders, and such periods having elapsed without the delivery of such statements of claim it was held that in the terms of the orders eo instanti of the expiration of the periods named in the orders the actions became dismissed, and that thereafter no motion could be made in them; but these cases have no application to the present case for the statute does not what those orders did, it does not declare or enact that election petitions shall stand dismissed or shall be deemed to be out of court unless the trial shall be commenced within six months from the presentation of the petition; it simply directs as a matter of procedure that the trial shall be commenced within six months from the presentation of the petition with this proviso added, in sec. 33 of the act, ch. 9, revised statutes, that notwithstanding such direction the court may from time to time enlarge the time for the commencement of the trial if, on an application for that purpose supported by affidavit, it appears to the court that the requirements of justice render such enlargement necessary; and with this further provision, contained in the 64th sec. of the act, that \"a court \"or a judge shall, upon sufficient cause being shewn, \"have power on the application of any of the parties \"to a petition to extend from time to time the period \"limited by this act for taking any steps or proceedings \"by such party.\" Now in these cases of election petitions the ends of justice may as much require after as before the expiration of six months from the presentation of the petition that the time for commencement of the trial of the matter of the petition should be enlarged, as is the language of one of these sections, or extended which is the language of the other, and as the statute does not enact that the petition shall be deemed to be out of court or shall stand dismissed at the expiration of the six months from presentation of the petition unless the trial shall before then be commenced or an order for enlargement of the time for commencement of the trial shall before then be obtained the case was still in court and in the jurisdiction and under the control of the court upon the 1st December, and upon principle as well as the reasoning of Banner v. Johnson[30], Lord v. Lee[31] I am of opinion that the order of that date was good and valid even though the time occupied in the session be included in the computation of the six months from the presentation of the petition allowed for the commencement of the trial of it. When the legislature enacted that notwithstanding anything contained in the section which directs the trial to be commenced within six months from the presentation of the petition, the court might from time to time enlarge the time for the commencement of the trial if upon an application for that purpose supported by affidavit it should appear to the court that the requirements of justice rendered such enlargement necessary, and in another section that the court should upon sufficient cause shown have power upon the application of any of the parties to the petition to extend from time to time the periods limited by the act for taking any steps or proceeding by such party, I find it difficult to bring my mind to the conclusion that the intention of the legislature was that eo instanti of the expiration of six months from the presentation of the petition without an order having been made for extension of the time for commencement of the trial the court should become paralysed and its jurisdiction absolutely ousted, however much the ends of justice might require that the trial should be proceeded with, and that the corrupt practices charged in the petition should be investigated, but for the reasons already given this point is not, in my judgment, of importance in the present case. Entertaining this opinion I feel it to be my duty to express my opinion upon the merits of the case as the only matter which, in my opinion, is before us in the present appeal our duty in relation to which is plainly, as it seems to me, plainly pointed out in the statute.\nThe objection that the learned judge who tried the case should not, upon the evidence, have avoided the election on the ground of bribery by an agent appears to me to be quite untenable and indeed frivolous in view of what occurred at the trial. After the examination of the above appellant, the then respondent, (taken before a local master before the trial) had been read and after his oral examination at the trial and after much evidence had been given by persons who were his agents and others as to the general conduct of the election, and after evidence had been given upon three specific charges of corrupt acts alleged to have been committed by one McKenzie, the appellant's agent, by loaning money to three persons of the names of Vanier, Saucier, and Tyo with corrupt intent, which charges are contained in items numbered respectively 35, 36 and 37 in the bill of particulars, and after the respondent at the election trial had given all the evidence he had to offer in respect of these charges, the learned judge addressed the respondent's counsel as follows, as appears by the printed case laid before us,\nI will hear you Mr. Cassels, the question of agency being admitted, on the question of corrupt practices by the agent.\nWhereupon the learned counsel addressed the court as follows:\u2014\nThere is no doubt there is an agency. As to the corrupt practices by the agent I am free to admit, it just depends upon how your lordship views the evidence. I am quite free to admit, even if these were bon\u00e2 fide loans, if the loans were induced or brought about by reason of a desire on the part of the agent to procure the votes or to influence the votes whether the loans were bon\u00e2 fide or not I suppose it would be within the statute a corrupt act, and the point comes down to the question of evidence as to what view your lordship takes about it. There is no doubt the facts are suspicious; the very fact of having lent the money on the eve of an election, and the very fact as it were of negotiations for the loans taking place at the time of a meeting, are all circumstances of suspicion. Then of course there is the evidence of these three men for what it is worth to the effect that they themselves stipulated that they should receive the loan as the price of their votes; my impression is that two of them really did not understand what they were saying; that they evidently talked French and rather in a broken way but, still, there is their evidence. As against that there is only the evidence of McKenzie. Now I cannot say one way or the other, and it is for your lordship to determine the fact. It is really a question of fact, for if you think the statement of these three men is correct that they put forward as a reason for the getting of this money that they would vote or not vote then, although the loans are genuine and bon\u00e2 fide, I think within the statute it is a corrupt act.\nThat the question was, as put here by the learned counsel, in effect only to be determined by the judge according to the view he should take of the evidence and of the credibility of the witnesses there can be no doubt, and the argument of the learned counsel seems to me to convey internal evidence of the great difficulty under which he labored of withholding in his argument an expression in justification of the judgment which he expected from the learned judge, namely, that the monies were corruptly loaned. His lordship in reply to this argument of counsel appears by the case to have said as follows:\u2014\nThe way the evidence strikes me with reference to that is, we find an election meeting is being held of some character or another in the interests of Mr. Purcell on that evening; that there are three men who by some peculiar free masonry all learn that they can obtain money, and they attend there for that purpose, men whose needs have been pressing for various periods of time, but who never had made any application in the same quarter for relief; on that evening they met and all three of them made application for loans; all three of them obtained promises of loans and I cannot agree that they did not understand what they were saying because I took particular pains to endeavor to ascertain from them after counsel were through how they desired to place the facts; I think they understood they were obtaining loans, and were obtaining them as a condition for exercising their franchise and I think the way that was managed was this, that Leclair and Rousseau used their influence with these men to negotiate, and that McKenzie advanced the money and kept himself apart from any direct negotiations as to the voting. It seems to me that there is a clear lending of money by McKenzie as agent, using Leclair and Rousseau for the purpose of working out the scheme.\nUpon hearing this enumeration of opinion from the learned judge, the above appellant's counsel said, \"on \"these facts I do not want to waste time explaining the law.\" Now upon this it appears to me that this was an acceptance by the respondent's counsel of the soundness of the opinion of the learned judge upon the question of corrupt practices by the agent, and that the trial would have closed here with the assent of the respondent without any appeal whatever if the petitioner had been willing to waive all claim to a judgment upon that part of the petition which related to the charges of the candidate's connection with corrupt practices, committed by his agents for him and on his behalf, and to the charges of direct bribery and corruption committed by himself personally. But, however that may be, as the cases upon which the learned judge expressed his opinion as above involved matters of fact only determinable by himself and depending upon the view taken by him of the credibility of witnesses examined before himself, an appeal from his determination of such pure matters of fact can not be entertained consistently with the decisions and uniform practice of this court to regard the decision of the trial judge in such cases as final.\nUpon the counsel for the respondent at the trial having expressed himself, as above stated, as unwilling to waste time explaining the law after hearing the judge's opinion on the facts the learned judge enquired of the counsel for the petitioner\u2014\"Do you intend to \"press the personal charges?\" to which the counsel replied \"Yes\"; whereupon the learned judge said\nI shall declare the election void by reason of corrupt practices by an agent so that whatever evidence you desire to further advance will be as to corrupt practices by respondent for the purpose of personal disqualification.\nTo which the petitioner's counsel replied\nThere are other agents\nUpon which the learned judge said\nAs it has been said, and well said, I do not sit here inquisitorially. Having accomplished the purposes of the trial on any issue, I shall decline to receive further evidence for the mere purposes of enquiry. If the Parliament desire, upon my report, to have further inquiry as to corrupt practices in the constituency it will be in their province to appoint a commission for such purpose I shall report as far as the evidence now appears to me that corrupt practices did extensively prevail in the constituency.\nNow what the learned judge intended to convey by these observations was, clearly, as it appears to me, that being satisfied as to the committal of corrupt practices by an agent sufficient to avoid the election, and that corrupt practices did extensively prevail at the election, he would report the latter fact to the House who might institute if they should think fit further enquiries into such general corrupt practice, but that he would only receive evidence during the remainder of the trial upon all personal charges made against the respondent for the purpose of his disqualification.\nNow as to the objection that the learned judge erred in finding the present appellant guilty of bribery and that this judgment should be reversed so far as his finding upon the personal charges is concerned. The argument of the learned counsel for the appellant upon this objection appeared to me, I must confess, to be rested upon what I think was hypercritical criticism of certain passages in the language used by the learned judge in certain conversations which took place between him and counsel during the progress of the trial rather than upon the merits of the case.\nThe learned counsel for the appellant complained of the manner in which the learned judge approached, and proceeded with the trial\u2014that he took a mistaken view of the nature of the evidence required to substantiate charges of the nature of those under consideration\u2014that he ignored in fact the maxim that in a criminal case the accused is entitled to the benefit of a doubt\u2014that in effect he first found that the advances made by McKenzie referred to already as being contained in items 35, 36 and 37 of the bill of particulars were not made with the knowledge and consent of the appellant and that notwithstanding he afterwards gave judgment against the appellant that those advances were made with his knowledge and consent.\nThese grave imputations upon the conduct of the learned judge who presided at the trial might well have been spared without any prejudice to the interests of the appellant, as will appear, I think, upon a careful perusal of the proceedings as reported to us on the appeal case.\nAnd as to the last of those imputations first. The charges involved in items 35, 36 and 37 of the bill of particulars were that one McKenzie, an agent of the respondent at the election, gave to the respective parties named in those items the respective sums therein also mentioned for the corrupt purposes therein also respectively mentioned, and that he did so with the knowledge and consent of the respondent.\nWhen dealing with the learned judge's judgment upon the point of corrupt practices by this agent I have already shewn that after the respondent had given in all the evidence he had to offer upon the charge of the advances having been made corruptly by the agent the learned judge addressing the respondent's counsel said that he would then hear him \"upon the \"question of corrupt practices by the agent,\" thus expressly limiting the question to the first branch of the charge, and after hearing counsel and expressing his opinion that there was a clear lending of money by McKenzie, the agent, for the corrupt purposes charged, he asked the petitioner's counsel whether he intended to press the personal charges, and being informed that he did, the learned judge said that he would declare the election void by reason of corrupt practices by the agent McKenzie, and that he would report that corrupt practices extensively prevailed in the constituency and that the trial should proceed upon the personal charges.\nNow among the personal charges so to be proceeded with were those that the three several sums advanced by McKenzie to the respective persons named in the items 35, 36 and 37 were so advanced with the knowledge and consent of the respondent. Those charges were as much open as any other personal charges against the respondent. Hitherto the action of the judge had been confined to an inquiry whether the advances had been made corruptly by McKenzie. The charge of corruption in the respondent personally in relation to those advances was in no manner concluded by or involved in the result arrived at by the learned judge as to the fact of the advances having been made corruptly by McKenzie. In fact, of necessity, this latter question had to be determined first, and independently of the charge of corrupt knowledge and consent of the respondent, for the monies must be first found to have been advanced corruptly by McKenzie before the question as to their having been so advanced with the knowledge and consent of the respondent could arise. Now that both parties at the trial were well aware that the charge against the respondent personally, involved in the items 35, 36, and 37, remained to be tried appears from this that after two other charges of personal corruption had been entered upon and judgment upon one had, after argument of counsel thereon, been reserved, and the other had been dismissed as not proven, the petitioner's counsel, without any objection or remonstrance whatever, stated that he desired to examine the respondent further in relation to the three notes given by the three persons to whom the monies had been advanced by McKenzie, in fact in relation to the personal charges involved in items 35, 36, and 37, and he did accordingly submit the respondent to a further long and searching examination bearing upon those items and the respondent's general conduct during the election and his credibility, and at the close of the case, as I shall show by-and-bye, the learned judge, not only without objection or remonstrance of respondent's counsel but with his consent, proceeded to express the opinion which he had formed on the charges against the respondent involved in these three items, and in the charge upon which he had reserved judgment, known as the Kennedy charge, for the apparent purpose of curtailing the proceedings and dispensing with the necessity of taking further evidence upon the very numerous charges of the respondent's personal connection with the very general corruption which, in the opinion of the learned judge as already expressed, had prevailed in the constituency at the election.\nNow some discretion must be allowed to a judge presiding at the trial of so very numerous charges of a grave nature as to the mode in which the trial shall be conducted and the time when it may without injustice be closed; and when the mode adopted meets with the approbation and consent of counsel employed at the trial, as it appears to have done in the present case, it seems to me, I confess, to be strange that this mode of conducting the trial should afterwards be impugned as a grave error in the judge, and should be made a ground of appeal against his judgment.\nThe imputation that the learned judge ignored the maxim that in a criminal case the accused is entitled to the benefit of a doubt, and that he took a mistaken view of the nature of the evidence required to substantiate charges of personal corruption which are attended with such consequences as the disqualification of the candidate, rests not upon anything in the matured judgment pronounced by the learned judge after an apparently very careful and complete consideration and analysis of the evidence bearing upon the points dealt with, but upon a conversation which passed between the learned judge and the respondent's counsel during the progress of the trial.\nAt the close of the evidence given in relation to the Kennedy charge, the learned counsel for the respondent having been called upon to say what he had to say upon this charge argued to the effect following:\u2014\nI say it is not proven. In the first place I understand that this charge is one of personal disqualification, and under the authorities when it comes to a criminal charge the court requires a larger amount of evidence than in the ordinary cases of avoiding an election, in fact there should be the clearest possible conviction.\nUpon which his lordship is reported as observing:\nThere should be belief.\nUpon which the counsel for respondent continued:\nPositive belief. If it is doubtful\u2014if the evidence is of a doubtful character\u2014then it being of a criminal nature the court will find in favor of the respondent.\nUpon which his lordship observed:\u2014\nI desire personally to say I have no rule of evidence differing in a criminal from that in a civil case, nor vice vers\u00e2, whether a man is to be mulcted in a sum for damages or imprisonment. When proof has to be given and the proof is given, whether criminal or civil, the consequences must follow. I draw no distinction having regard to the result. The conscience of a jury or a judge must be satisfied, and when the fact is found let the consequences take care of themselves.\nUpon these observations is based the grave charge that the learned judge took a mistaken view of the nature of the evidence required to support the charges and that he ignored the maxim that a person should not be convicted of a crime upon doubtful evidence, and that in case of doubt the accused is entitled to the benefit of it, whereas a less prejudiced and more candid criticism would, I think, lead to the conclusion that the learned judge was guilty of no such error as that imputed to him and that what he intended to convey and what his language does convey in this conversation is that with the Consequences resulting upon the finding of the facts in issue he had nothing to do\u2014that in civil as in criminal cases the common rule is that when the proof which has to be given in order to establish a fact in issue is given \"the consequences must follow\"\u2014and that whether the trial be by a jury or by a judge without a jury \"the conscience of the jury or the judge as the case may be must be satisfied that the proof necessary to establish the fact in issue is given and then when such fact is so established neither jury nor judge have anything to do with the result\"; so reading the learned judge's observations I do not see in what they are open to objection, and that this is the proper reading of them appears further from this, that the respondent's counsel having replied to them that\nNo finding of facts should be given unless the judge is satisfied as to the truth of the facts.\nThe judge concurred in this observation of counsel, saying\nQuite so. I think we may agree upon that definition of the rules of evidence.\nThe minds of judge and counsel having been thus brought into accord upon the subject of this little interlude, the learned counsel proceeded with his argument to its close, insisting upon the insufficiency of the evidence, in his view of it, to establish the charge, and the learned judge reserved his judgment to which I shall now refer for the purpose of showing how unfounded is the imputation that the learned judge took a mistaken view of the duty imposed upon him on the trial of these charges.\nUpon the opening of the court on the morning of the 13th January, the learned judge having asked the petitioner's counsel to what particular point he then proposed to direct his evidence, he replied that he proposed to show that the candidate had knowledge of the general corruption which prevailed at the election. After some further remarks passed between counsel and the judge the latter, who had apparently employed the previous night in studying and weighing the evidence bearing upon the charges as to the knowledge and consent of the candidate to the advances made by McKenzie to the persons named in the items 35, 36 and 37, and upon the Kennedy case, addressed the counsel of both parties as follows\u2014 I may say that I have made up my mind, without announcing what conclusion I have arrived at, on the evidence of Rousseau (this related wholly to the three advances made by McKenzie) and the evidence in respect of Kennedy. It may be that if I declare my opinion in respect of that counsel may feel justified in acting upon it or may not. If the counsel desire it I will give it.\nTo this suggestion counsel consented, that is to say, they consented to the learned judge's then announcing the conclusion he had arrived at upon these charges. The respondent's counsel does not appear to have then entertained the idea that the personal connection of the respondent with the advances made by McKenzie, mentioned in items 35, 36, and 37 was no longer a matter before the court, or to have been taken by surprise at the judge's intimation that he was then prepared to give judgment upon those charges as well as on the Kennedy case; nor did he, either then or after hearing the judgment, complain that in the judge's then giving it there was any irregularity or anything whatever of which the respondent had reason to complain; on the contrary, he assented to the learned judge giving his judgment, who, thereupon, in a clear and exhaustive review, more especially of the evidence bearing upon the charge that the advances made by McKenzie were made with the knowledge and consent of the respondent, and also of the evidence in the Kennedy case, announced the conclusion at which he had arrived. He pointed out that the whole matter he had to decide depended upon the credit to be attached to the evidence of the several persons who had given evidence, and in a judgment which no one, I think, can read without being convinced that the learned judge was fully impressed with the responsibility of the duty he was discharging and was most anxious to arrive at a just conclusion, and to proceed only upon what appeared to him to be undoubted evidence, he concluded as follows:\u2014\nI feel bound, therefore, with regard to the evidence as to Kennedy, to credit the evidence of the bookkeeper; I credit it entirely. I discredit the evidence of Kennedy where it is contradicted and I find with reference to that, that out of monies of the respondent, under the direction of the respondent, the witness Evans, his bookkeeper, paid to Kennedy one hundred dollars for the purpose of being used in the election, and in order to induce Kennedy to procure the return of the respondent.\nI consider this evidence at this point not only in respect of the particular charge but also in connection with the evidence of Rousseau and what took place at Martintown, and finding as I do against the bona fides of the action of the respondent and against his evidence in respect to the transaction with Kennedy, the conclusion to my mind is irresistible that Rousseau is telling what really did occur, when he states that the respondent instructed him that the money might be advanced, and that he was to give that information to McKenzie; for I find that the conduct of the respondent is consistent alone with such a line chosen for himself and that the statement of the respondent that he gave no such instructions\u2014that all the monies advanced by him were advanced for ordinary business purposes, loans upon security of personal credit or responsibility and which he purposes calling in\u2014is not consistent with his conduct, is not consistent with what was done by McKenzie at Martintown, is not consistent with his dealings with Kennedy.\nI therefore find that the action of McKenzie was under instructions, with the privity, consent and knowledge of the respondent and that the money which was paid out by McKenzie was paid out of monies which were placed to his credit by the respondent, and that the use of those monies for corrupt practices, in respect of which I have already avoided the election, was with the knowledge and consent and under the direct instructions of respondent.\nThe learned judge thus held that what evidence the respondent gave in his own favor was not worthy of credit\u2014as was neither the evidence of McKenzie nor that of Kennedy where he was contradicted; and being of that opinion it was impossible for the learned judge, as he very clearly shows in his exhaustive review of the evidence, to have arrived at another conclusion than one in affirmation of the truth of the charges. With a conclusion so arrived at, upon the ground of the view entertained by the judge who tried the case as to the credibility of the witnesses and the degree of credit to be attached to that of each, we cannot interfere without reversing numerous decisions of this court and transgressing the inviolable rule that in such a case a court of appeal cannot interfere.\nHaving announced his judgment as above, the learned judge asked the petitioner's counsel if he desired to offer any further evidence and being answered in the negative proceeded with his judgment as follows:\u2014\nThere must be a time appointed for the trial of corrupt practices. The parties who will be summoned for that trial are the three parties who received the money at Martintown, namely Saucier, Tyo, Vanier, McKenzie and the respondent, and also Kennedy. I do not add to those names the name of the bookkeeper because I am not clear upon the evidence that he knew, although he might have suspected, the purpose for which the money was given, and he was acting under the direct instructions of his employer. It would have been more correct if he had assumed a more independent position in reference to it, but I give him the benefit of the doubt in my mind as to the reasons of his conduct, and I therefore do not require him to be summoned.\nWith respect to Rousseau there is no direct evidence that he did more than act with McKenzie and Purcell at Martintown. I should have added his name to the others did I not think, and I am shut up to the conclusion that he supposed he was acting upon the strength of the section which I read to him, and was giving his evidence under the protection of the section. If I had not given him that information I would not have been free to leave his name out from those who are to be tried for corrupt practices.\nI find as a fact that the evidence he has given is reliable evidence and that his statements were true, and being given in the interests of the public and for the purity of elections I think I would not be carrying out the spirit of the clause if after such information I should require him to answer at the court for the trial of corrupt practices.\nI have extracted this latter part of the judgment of the learned judge as it seems to show how careful he was to give to every one the benefit of any doubt existing in his mind upon the evidence, the contrary of which was so freely imputed to him in the argument addressed to us on behalf of the appellant.\nIn my opinion the appeal should be dismissed, and the judgment of the trial judge should be maintained and reported to the House of Commons, as provided by the statute.\nAppeal allowed with costs[32].\nSolicitors for appellants: MacLennan, Liddell & Cline.\nSolicitor for respondent: E. H. Tiffany.\n[1] The following are the material sections of ch. 9 R.S.C., and upon which the court were asked to put a construction:\n50. An appeal shall lie to the Supreme Court of Canada under this act by any party to an election petition who is dissatisfied with the decision of the court or a judge;\n(a) From the judgment, rule, order or decision of any court or judge on any preliminary objection to an election petition, the allowance of which objection has been final and conclusive, and has put an end to such petition, or which objection, if it had been allowed, would have been final and conclusive and have put an end to such petition; Provided always that, unless the court or judge appealed from otherwise orders, an appeal in the last mentioned case shall not operate as a stay of proceedings, nor shall it delay the trial of the petition;\n(6) From the judgment or decision on any question of law or of fact of the judge who has tried such petition.\n32. The trial of every election petition shall be commenced within six months from the time when such petition has been presented and shall be proceeded with from day to day until such trial is over; but if at any time it appears to the court or a judge, that the respondent's presence at the trial is necessary, such trial shall not be commenced during any session of parliament; and in the computation of any time or delay allowed for any step or proceeding in respect of any such trial, or for the commencement thereof as aforesaid, the time occupied by such session of parliament shall not be included;\n2. If at the expiration of three months after such petition has been presented, the day for trial has not been fixed, any elector may, on application, be substituted for the petitioner on such terms as the court or a judge thinks just.\n33. The court or a judge may, notwithstanding anything in the next preceding section, from time to time enlarge the time for the commencement of the trial, if, on an application for that purpose supported by affidavit, it appears to such court or judge that the requirements of justice render such enlargement necessary;\n2. No trial of an election petition shall be commenced or proceeded with during any term of the court of which the judge who is to try the same is a member, and at which such judge is by law bound to sit.\nSec. 64. The court or a judge shall, upon sufficient cause being shown, have power on the application of any of the parties to a petition, to extend, from time to time, the period limited by this act for taking any steps or proceedings by such party.\n[2] 10 Ont.

The ship went from Valparaiso to Lobos, an island from twenty-five to forty miles off the coast of South America and was afterwards lost.

Appeal from a decision of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick refusing to set aside a verdict for the plaintiff and order a non-suit or new trial.\nThis was an action on a marine policy by which the respondent's ship the \"Minnie H. Gerow\" was insured for a voyage from Melbourne to Valparaiso for orders, thence to a loading port on the western coast of South America and thence to a port of discharge in the United Kingdom The only material question raised in the case is whether Lobos, an island from twenty-five to forty miles distant from the mainland of South America, is a port of loading on the coast under the policy. At the trial the question as to this was withdrawn from the jury, the judge holding that it was well understood by shipowners in St. John that Lobos was a loading port and would be understood to be included in the provision in the policy, and he directed the jury, as a matter of law, that Lobos was such a port.\nThe Supreme Court of New Brunswick affirmed the verdict obtained by the plaintiff at the trial.

S. C. ch. 9. sec. 11\u2014Service of Election Petition\u2014Defective\u2014Art. 57 C. C. P.\u2014Preliminary objections.\nThe service of an election petition made in the Province of Quebec, at the defendant's law office, situated on the ground floor of his residence and having a separate entrance, by delivering a copy thereof to the defendant's law partner who was not a member of, nor resident with, the defendant's family is not a service within sec. 11 ch. 9 R. S. C., and art. 57 C. C. P. and a preliminary objection setting up such defective service was maintained and the election petition dismissed. (Gwynne J. dissenting.) Appeal from the decision of the Superior Court of Lower Canada, (Angers J. presiding,) dismissing the preliminary objections to the election petition.\nThe petition against the return of the respondent Philippe Auguste Choquette as member for the electoral district of Montmagny, was presented on the 25th April, 1887.\nOn the 30th April, 1887, preliminary objections were filed by the respondent, and on the 14th October, 1887, were dismissed by the Superior Court. The present appellant thereupon appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada under sec. 50 (a) ch. 9 R. S. C.\nThe question determined on this appeal was raised by the objections to the service of the petition. The appellant complained:\u2014\n1. That the service was not made when it should have been made.\n2. That it was not made on the person to whom it should have been made.\nBoth appellant and respondent admitted that the question raised was to be decided by the construction placed on sec. 11 of the Dominion Controverted Elections Act, and art. 57 of the code of civil procedure, as applied to the facts of this case.\nThe Dominion Controverted Elections Act sec. 11 says:\u2014\n\"An election petition under this act, and notice of the date of the presentation thereof, and a copy of the deposit receipt shall be served as nearly as possible in the manner in which a writ of summons is served in civil matters, or in such other manner as is prescribed.\"\nArticle 57 of the Code of Civil Procedure reads as follows:\u2014\n\"Service must be made either upon the defendant in person, or at his domicile, or at the place of his ordinary residence, speaking to a reasonable person belonging to the family. In the absence of a regular domicile, service may be made upon the defendant at his office or place of business, if he has one.\"\nAs to the facts of the case, the following was the evidence of the bailiff who made the service\u2014Philippe Gendreau:\u2014\nTranslation.\u2014\"I received the documents in question from Mr. Belleau (solicitor for petitioner). I went to the office of Mr. Choquette, where he actually lives and I served a copy on Mr. Martineau as being the partner of Mr. Choquette. Mr. Choquette, the respondent, practises as an advocate in partnership with Mr. Martineau of whom I have spoken. Their office as advocates and attorneys is in the basement (sous-sol) of the house occupied by the defendant as his ordinary residence, and where his domicile is. I am in the habit of serving Messrs. Choquette & Martineau in their quality of attorneys. Usually to enter the said office you pass by a separate outside door, but you can get there also by the residence of defendant. Those who go to the said office to transact business invariably pass by this separate outside door of which I have just spoken, and not by the residence of defendant. If there are any who pass by this latter way I am not aware of it, and for myself I have never gone through there.\nWhen I effected the said service I spoke to the said Mr. Martineau, partner of the said respondent as attorney, and it was to him also I gave the papers I had to serve. Mr. Martineau does not live in the house with Mr. Choquette the defendant, he goes there only to the office of which I have spoken during office hours; outside of these hours he lives at some distance from there, at his residence, where his wife and children are.\n* * * * *\nCross-examined.\u2014The defendant has no office distinct from his domicile; the basement of the house where the office is is also occupied by the family of the defendant as a residence. The room occupied as his office is in communication with all the other rooms of his house, * *\nRe-examined.\u2014When I said a little while ago that the defendant had no office distinct from his domicile, I intended to say that his office and his domicile are in the same building, and I did not intend to say that the family of Mr. Choquette lived at his office. His family do not live there. I have seen Madame Choquette there several times; I do not know if she goes there habitually.\nMagloire Paquet\u2014I have been employed a long time as a writer in Mr. Choquette's office, both before and since his partnership with Mr. Martineau.\n* * * * *\nHis office and residence are in the same house, but they are separate and distinct the one from the other. Those who go to the office do not pass through the dwelling, but by a door which is on purpose for the office.\nThe family of Mr. Choquette, his wife, his servants, are never seen in the office.\nCross-Examined.\u2014His private dwelling communicates with the office. There is no difference between the separation of the office and the dwelling and the separation of the other rooms of the house in the lower part of the house. The office does not constitute an addition (allonge) nor a building outside the house. It is only a room in the house like all the others.\nPierre Remon Martineau.\u2014I am the partner of the defendant as advocate and attorney, and we have our offices as attorneys in the basement of defendant's house. When the bailiff Gendreau came to serve the petition in this cause I had just arrived at the office, coming from the post office, and he arrived at the same time by another gate. We met each other near the door and he said to me \"I have papers to serve at the office,\" thereupon I asked him in. I sat down at my desk and he put on my desk the papers bearing the title of the present cause, saying that they were an original and a copy of an election petition. I took a glance at them and saw that they were copies of a copy and that he had no original. * * He did not ask if the defendant was there, nor whether he was there or at his own house. There was no other part of the basement of the defendant's house, with the exception of the office, which was occupied; the rest of the basement of the house is a high basement (sous-bassement haut). In summer a part of this sous-bassement is occupied as a kitchen the rest serves as a wood cellar. In winter the person who attends the kitchen in summer makes use of it for washing, and it is necessary to pass through it also to get wood. The office has a special door to go outside by. * * When strangers come to pay a visit and the defendant wishes to bring them into his dwelling he makes them go round outside to get there. The doctor is the only person I have seen pass by the kitchen. The dwelling of the defendant was occupied at this date by his wife and servants and the petition could have been served on them; the defendant himself was there up to noon of the day in question. The doctor of whom I have just spoken is Dr. Marmette uncle of the defendant's wife.\nCross-examined\u2014Q. Will you swear that this part of this house which you call sous-bassement is not habitually occupied by the family of the defendant? A. As I have already said, in summer this part is almost as much occupied by the family, apart from Madame Choquette, as the upper part, but in the daytime and not in the night. I am not able to speak as to the night because I am not there. I have excepted Madame Choquette because I saw her less frequently below than the other members of the family. I know a Miss Bender who went in by the office to reach the house of Mr. Choquette; she was a cousin of Madame Choquette and it was in summer, and I have never seen any other member of the family go in that way. I know that they make the kitchen below in summer but not in winter. I have been in this room used as a kitchen in summer, but not in the others. I have been in the passage and from there have seen wood on the other side of the sous-bassement. I have frequently seen persons going about the sous-bassement. Mr. Choquette to reach his office always comes by the door which communicates with the summer kitchen. Besides the defendant there are members of his family, that is to say Madame Choquette and her little daughter, who have communication between the house and the office, but Madame Choquette comes rarely, the little girl often in summer, because in winter they do not occupy this side room.\"\nBelcourt for appellant.\nBelleau for respondent.\nSir W. J. RITCHIE C. J.\u2014It appears that the appellant was not in Montmagny at the time of the alleged service; the objection in this case is that no copy of this petition was served, not as in Julien v. de St. George,[1], that the evidence of service is insufficient. Now the law expressly declares that the service shall be as nearly as possible in the manner in which a writ of summons is served in civil matters or in such other manner as is prescribed; article 57 of the code of civil precedure points out how such service must be made, viz., either upon the defendant in person or at his domicile or at the place of his ordinary residence, speaking to a reasonable person belonging to the family and it is only in the absence of a regular domicile that the service may be made upon the defendant at his office or place of business if he has one. It is very clear in this case that the service was not upon the defendant in person nor at the place of his ordinary residence, nor was it on a reasonable person belonging to defendant's family upon whom the service could have been made, it being shown he had a domicile and ordinary place of business and reasonable members of his family, but it was at the office or place of business of the defendant on his partner not being a member of his family.\nIt is not for us to inquire whether this was not for all practical purposes as good if not possibly a better service than at his residence on a member of his family; it may or may not have been so; what we have to determine is, was it a legal service which gave the court jurisdiction over the defendant?\nSection 10 Controverted Elections Act clearly contemplates a personal service or service at the domicile, and if this cannot be, then upon some other person, or in such other manner as the court or judge on the application of the petitioner directs.\nI am clearly of the opinion that the service was not a legal service within either the letter or the spirit of the Dominion Controverted Elections Act sec. 11 and art. 57 of the code of civil procedure, and the defendant had a right by way of preliminary objection to ask to have the service declared null and void. Now what are the preliminary objections or grounds of insufficiency which the section contemplates the respondent may urge? They are any he may have against the petition or petitioner or against any further proceeding on the petition. The objection in this case comes peculiarly within this latter category; the respondent says, by it, \"not having been served with the petition in the manner required and prescribed by law, I have not been legally brought before the court having jurisdiction over the petition filed and you have no right to take further proceedings thereon against me.\" If this cannot be treated as a preliminary objection I am at a loss to know when or how the respondent is to assert his objection to the petition being further proceeded with or to allege or show that he has not been properly brought within the jurisdiction of the court in which the petition is filed. I cannot conceive an objection coming more directly under the designation of a preliminary objection to an election petition or a more substantial one than an objection such as this, which alleges that the election petition has not been properly and legally served and so the defendant has not been made subject to the jurisdiction of the court, and therefore, should not be compelled to answer the petition.\nFOURNIER J.\u2014Le pr\u00e9sent 'appel est d'un jugement de l'honorable juge Angers renvoyant les objections pr\u00e9liminaires produites par l'intim\u00e9 contre la p\u00e9tition d'\u00e9lection contestant la validit\u00e9 de son \u00e9lection comme membre de la Chambre des Communes pour le district \u00e9lectoral de Montmagny.\nLa seule question que soul\u00e8ve cette cause est de savoir si l'avis de la pr\u00e9sentation de la p\u00e9tition a \u00e9t\u00e9 l\u00e9galement signifi\u00e9 par les p\u00e9titionnaires \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9.\nL'intim\u00e9 all\u00e8gue que la signification en a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite ni \u00e0 l'endroit, ni \u00e0 la personne indiqu\u00e9s par la loi.\nAu lieu de la signification personnelle, souvent fort difficile \u00e0 faire et assez souvent \u00e9lud\u00e9e, la section 11 de l'acte des \u00e9lections contest\u00e9es a introduit le mode de signification adopt\u00e9 en mati\u00e8res civiles en d\u00e9clarant ce qui suit:\u2014 An election petition under this act, and notice of the date of presentation thereof, and a copy of the deposit receipt, shall be served as nearly as possible in the manner in which a writ of summons is served in civil matters, or in such other manner as is prescribed.\nEn cons\u00e9quence de cette disposition, le service de l'avis de pr\u00e9sentation de la p\u00e9tition devait \u00eatre fait conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l'article 57, C. P. C., de la province de Qu\u00e9bec, d\u00e9cretant comme suit:\u2014\nCette signification se fait soit au d\u00e9fendeur en personne, ou \u00e0 domicile, ou au lieu de sa r\u00e9sidence ordinaire, en parlant \u00e0 une personne raisonnable faisant partie de la famille. A d\u00e9faut de domicile r\u00e9gulier l'assignation peut \u00eatre donn\u00e9e au d\u00e9fendeur, \u00e0 son bureau d'affaire, ou \u00e9tablissement de commerce, s'il en a un.\nDans le cas actuel la signification de l'avis de pr\u00e9sentation de la p\u00e9tition n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite ni au domicile de l'appelant, ni \u00e0 une personne raisonnable de sa famille. L'huissier charg\u00e9 de cette mission s'est rendu au bureau d'affaires professionnelles de l'appelant qui exerce sa profession d'avocat en soci\u00e9t\u00e9 avec M. Martineau. Leur bureau se trouve dans la partie inf\u00e9rieure de la maison o\u00f9 l'appelant a son domicile l\u00e9gal.\nEn vertu des r\u00e8gles de pratique de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure, les avocats pratiquants sont oblig\u00e9s d'\u00e9lire dans le rayon d'un mille du palais de justice, un domicile o\u00f9 ils transigent leurs affaires professionnelles et o\u00f9 leur sont faites toutes les significations de pi\u00e8ces de proc\u00e9dure. C'est au domicile professionnel ou bureau d'affaires que l'avis en question a \u00e9t\u00e9 signifi\u00e9 en le remettant \u00e0 M. Martineau, qui ne r\u00e9side pas avec l'appelant et ne fait pas partie de sa famille. La signification d'apr\u00e8s l'art. 57 ne peut avoir lieu au bureau d'affaires qu'\u00e0 d\u00e9faut de domicile r\u00e9gulier. L'appelant en ayant un, c'est \u00e0 ce domicile que la signification devait se faire. Quoique faite au bureau d'affaires, cependant le rapport fait \u00e0 la cour constate contrairement \u00e0 la v\u00e9rit\u00e9, que cette signification a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement faite au domicile de l'appelant parlant \u00e0 une personne de sa famille. Ce rapport a \u00e9t\u00e9 attaqu\u00e9 comme entach\u00e9 de faux parce qu'il contient l'\u00e9nonc\u00e9 que la signification avait \u00e9t\u00e9 faite \u00e0 l'appelant (d\u00e9fendeur), \"parlant \u00e0 une personne raisonnable de la famille du dit Philippe Auguste Choquette, \u00e0 son domicile, a Montmagny.\"\nL'appelant a fait une preuve compl\u00e8te de la fausset\u00e9 de cet avanc\u00e9 par le t\u00e9moignage de l'huissier lui-m\u00eame qui dit \u00e0 ce sujet: \"Lorsque j'ai fait la signification j'ai parl\u00e9 au dit M. Martineau associ\u00e9 de l'intim\u00e9 (maintenant appelant) comme procureur, et c'est \u00e0 lui aussi que j'ai remis les papiers que j'avais \u00e0 signifier. M. Martineau ne demeure pas chez M. Choquette le d\u00e9fendeur; il y va seulement au bureau dont je viens de parler pendant les heures de bureau, hors de ces heures il demeure \u00e0 quelque distance de l\u00e0, \u00e0 sa r\u00e9sidence o\u00fb sont sa femme et ses enfants.\"\nLe t\u00e9moignage de P. R. Martineau auquel les papiers ont \u00e9t\u00e9 laiss\u00e9s constate que l'huissier les a d\u00e9pos\u00e9s sur son bureau, sans demander si le d\u00e9fendeur \u00e9tait au bureau ou chez lui. Le bureau est la seule partie occup\u00e9e dans le soubassement de la maison, \u00e0 l'exception d'une partie qui sert de cuisine en \u00e9t\u00e9. Ces faits positivement \u00e9tablis font clairement voir que la signification n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 faite conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l'article 57 C. P. C. M. Martineau, quoique l'associ\u00e9 professionnel de l'appelant, n'avait aucune qualit\u00e9 pour recevoir cette signification, parce qu'il n'\u00e9tait pas une personne de sa famille. Il n'\u00e9tait oblig\u00e9, ni l\u00e9galement, ni moralement, d'en rendre compte \u00e0 l'appelant. L'huissier avait toutes les facilit\u00e9s possibles pour faire une signification l\u00e9gale. En cons\u00e9quence des relations d'affaires existant entre M. Martineau et l'appelant on pourrait peut-\u00eatre dire que les int\u00e9r\u00eats de ce dernier \u00e9taient aussi en s\u00fbret\u00e9 entre les mains de son associ\u00e9 que si les papiers eussent \u00e9t\u00e9 remis \u00e0 une servante de sa famille; mais le code n'admet pas d'\u00e9quivalent. Il n'y a que deux mani\u00e8res de faire les significations: \u00e0 la personne m\u00eame et, \u00e0 d\u00e9faut, \u00e0 son domicile parlant \u00e0 une personne raisonnable de sa famille:\nService must be made, dit l'article 57, either upon the defendant in person, or at his domicile.\nLe vice dont est entach\u00e9e la signification n'est pas seulement un d\u00e9faut de forme, une simple irr\u00e9gularit\u00e9, mais c'est la violation d'une formalit\u00e9 essentielle; car dans notre proc\u00e9dure, comme dans le code fran\u00e7ais, il est d'absolue n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 de faire voir \u00e0 qui et \u00e0 quel domicile la signification a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite.\nC'est par l'assignation que le d\u00e9fendeur est oblig\u00e9 \u00e0 compara\u00eetre devant le juge ou la cour, sous les peines du d\u00e9faut. C'est elle qui saisit le juge de la cause et lui impose le devoir de la juger s'il reconna\u00eet qu'il est comp\u00e9tent \u00e0 cet effet. Sans une assignation \u00e0 domicile ou \u00e0 la p\u00e9rsonne, le juge n'a aucune juridiction pour d\u00e9cider la cause. Lorsque les objections \u00e0 l'assignation reposent, comme dans le cas actuel, sur des formalit\u00e9s essentielles, on ne peut pas les traiter comme de simples objections techniques, car, sans leur accomplissement, le juge n'a pas de juridiction. En attaquant la r\u00e9gularit\u00e9 du service de l'avis, l'appelant a soulev\u00e9, comme il en avait le droit, par ces objections pr\u00e9liminaires, une question de droit que la cour aurait d\u00fb juger en sa faveur. Ayant prouv\u00e9 clairement les faits constatant l'ill\u00e9galit\u00e9 de la signification et le code art. 57 C. P. C. exigeant imp\u00e9rativement le service \u00e0 domicile ou \u00e0 la personne, il a droit d'obtenir l'infirmation de ce jugement.\nIl ne peut pas ici s'\u00e9lever de question sur l'existence du droit d'appel. La sec. 50 sec. (a) dit qu'il y aura appel:\u2014\nFrom the judgment, rule, order or decision of any court or judge on any preliminary objection to an election petition, the allowance of which objection has been final and conclusive and has put an end to such petition, or which objection if it had been allowed would have been final and conclusive and have put an end to such petition.\nIl est \u00e9vident que si l'objection qu'il n'y avait pas de signification l\u00e9gale e\u00fbt \u00e9t\u00e9 admise, comme elle aurait d\u00fb l'\u00eatre, elle aurait mis fin \u00e0 la p\u00e9tition et partant la d\u00e9cision \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard est appelable. L'appel doit \u00eatre allou\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens.\nHENRY J.\u2014This is an appeal from a decision of one of the judges of the Superior Court of Quebec during the pendency of the matter before that court under a petition of the respondents, against the election and return of the appellant, the sitting member for the House of Commons, and upon one of the preliminary objections to the petition filed, and urged by the appellant. The petition and accompanying documents were served by the bailiff by handing a copy thereof to the partner in business of the appellant, who is an advocate residing at the town of Montmagny, and during his absence.\nFrom the evidence it appears that the office in question is in the basement of the appellants residence\u2014the dwelling being above it and access to it being by another entrance. Besides the office there is in the basement what is called a summer kitchen, not used in the winter season, and a wood house.\nAn objection under the practice in Quebec was raised to the mode of service which was overruled by the judge, and from this decision the appeal has been taken to this court. The point was fully argued recently before this court and we have to decide it.\nThe 11th section of the Controverted Elections Act provides that:\u2014\nAn election petition under this act and notice of the date of the presentation thereof and a copy of the deposit receipt shall be served as nearly as possible in the manner in which a writ of summons is served in civil matters, or in such other manner as is prescribed.\nWe are, therefore, to ascertain the mode of service of a writ of summons in a civil matter in the Province of Quebec. That is regulated by article 57 of the Code of Civil Procedure, which is as follows\nService must be made either upon the defendant in person, or at his domicile, or at the place of his ordinary residence, speaking to a reasonable person belonging to the family. In the absence of a regular domicile, service may be made upon the defendant at his office or place of business, if he has one.\nThus, we see, that but two modes of service are provided for and the article is imperative. One of the two must, by the article, be adopted where the party to be served has a domicile. In this case it is shown and admitted that the appellant had a domicile.\nHe was not served personally, and does the evidence show that he was served at his domicile in the manner prescribed by the article? To constitute such a service it must be at his domicile, the party making the service, when doing so, \"speaking to a reasonable person \"belonging to his family.\"\nThe service was not in that part of the building in question which formed the domicile or residence of the appellant. The office where the service was made although under the same roof with his residence was specially set apart from the other part of the building occupied as his private residence, and occupied as well by his partner as himself. His partner had an interest therein and control of it to the same extent as he had. He could open and close it at will and eject any one but his partner therefrom. That a door opened into the residence does not alter the character or holding of the office. The office was not generally used as a passage way to the residence as the evidence shows, although on some occasions so used by one party, not of the appellant's family, who was permitted to do so.\nThe service therefore was not at the domicile or residence of the appellant as required by the article. Besides, the party spoken to was the partner in business of the appellant, and not a member of his family. He neither ate nor lived in the residence of the appellant, and how can he be called \"a reasonable person belonging to the family\" residing in the appellant's residence.\nThe service is defective, therefore, in both requisites, and under the practice in Quebec the appellant not having been served in either of the two ways prescribed by the article was not bound to answer any more than he would have been had no service whatever have been made.\nThe learned judge who tried and decided upon the preliminary objections was of the opinion that the service upon the appellants' partner, at their office, should be considered equivalent to the service upon an illiterate servant ignorant of the importance of the documents received. If that question were open for consideration his decision might be sustained but it is not; and we are bound by the express terms and provisions of the article.\nThe objection is not merely a technical but substantial one affecting the jurisdiction of the judge. The article enunciates the principle that such jurisdiction shall be exercised only when the party in question is legally served as prescribed, and in the absence of such service no judge could legally proceed to try the merits.\nIf the learned judge decided there was no regular service, that would have put an end to the petition and involved the conclusion that he had no jurisdiction to proceed further. From such a decision an appeal by the petitioners to this court would have lain. It was to all intents and purposes a preliminary objection involving the fate of the petition and was essentially such a decision as either party might appeal from. I am, therefore, of opinion the appeal should be allowed and the petition dismissed with costs. TASCHEREAU J. concurred with Fournier J.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014On the 26th April, 1887, the above respondents filed a petition, under the provisions of the Controverted Elections Act, in the Superior Court of the Province of Quebec, in which province the electoral district of Montmagny is situated, praying that the election and return of the above appellant as member of parliament for the said district should be set aside and declared null and void by reason of bribery and other corrupt practices alleged to have been committed by the said appellant himself and by his agents on his behalf and with his knowledge and consent. Upon the 30th day of the said month of April and within five days after the service of the petition and accompanying notice the appellant, as required by the 12th section of the Controverted Elections Act, ch. 9 of the Revised Statutes, presented thirty objections in writing of a very peculiar and technical character which he called \"preliminary objections\" against the said petition and the said petitioners and against all further proceeding thereon, in the words of the statute. Two of these objections affected the qualification of the petitioners to present the petition; all the others related to irregularities and those of a very technical character alleged to exist in the presentation of the petition\u2014in the making of the deposit required by law,\u2014in the copy of the petition served\u2014in the service of the petition and accompanying notice, and in the return of the bailiff who effected the service. These objections were dismissed as unfounded by an order of the Superior Court in which the petition was filed bearing date the 14th October, 1887. From this order the appellant has appealed to this court and the only point opened before us was one affecting the regularity of the service of the petition. In my judgment this appeal must be dismissed with costs. It is to my mind very clear that the Controverted Elections Act does not give any appeal to this court upon such a purely technical point of practice as is raised by a question affecting only the manner in which service was effected of the election petition which, as is apparent on the case, the appellant received, a point which is not appealable in any other case or proceeding whatever. The service appears to have been effected by delivery to the appellant's business partner for the appellant at their place of business situate in the dwelling house of the appellant, of copies of the petition and other papers required by law, which papers the appellant's partner immediately upon their receipt by him forwarded to the appellant who received them into his own hands in time to enable him to draw himself the objections which upon the 30th April he filed in court, two of which as already noticed called in question the qualification of the petitioners to present the petition; after taking this proceeding it was in my opinion incompetent for him, as the learned judge of the Superior Court in effect adjudged, to contend that there was some irregularity in the service and therefore the court had not jurisdiction to try these two preliminary objections affecting the merits of the case and to dismiss them if insufficient. The filing of these objections was a proceeding wholly unnecessary, if service had not been effected on the appellant, and inconsistent with the contention that he had not been served with the petition. If he was not served and the case should be proceeded with he had his perfect remedy by prohibition.\nNow that there is no appeal to this court from the decision of a judge upon such a purely technical point of practice as the sufficiency and regularity of the service of the election petition upon the appellant is abundantly clear unless such a purely technical point of practice constitutes a good \"preliminary objection\" in the sense in which that term is used in the statute, and that it does not constitute such an objection is to my mind free from doubt.\nBy the 12th section of the act it is enacted that\nWithin five days after the service of the petition and the accompanying notice the respondent may present in writing any prelimiminary objections or grounds of insufficiency which he has to urge against the petition or the petitioner or against any further proceedings thereon and shall in such case at the same time file a copy thereof for the petitioner, and the court or judge shall hear the parties upon such objections and grounds and shall decide the same in a summary manner.\nNow if any doubt exist as to the meaning of the words \"against any further proceeding thereon\" in the connection in which they appear in this section, all such doubt is removed by the 5th section which shows that what is meant, is not that these words so used should throw open all questions of mere practice affecting the regularity of the service of a petition as \"preliminary objections\" under the statute so as to render any decision upon such purely technical point of practice appealable to this court, but that what is intended is an objection against any further proceeding on the petition by reason of the ineligibility or disqualification of the petitioner thus limiting the preliminary objections in the sense in which that term is used in the statute to points of substance only affecting the sufficiency of the matter stated in the petition, and the qualification of the petitioners to present it.\nThe 5th section shews with what intent the words \"or against any further proceeding\" in the 12th section are used. It enacts that:\nA petition complaining of an undue return or undue election of a member, or of no return or of any unlawful act by any candidate not returned, by which he is alleged to have become disqualified to sit in the House of Commons, at any election may be presented to the court by any one or more of the following persons. (a) A person who had a right to vote at the election to which the petition relates, or\n(b) A candidate at such election; and such petition is in this act called an election petition: provided always, that nothing herein contained shall prevent the sitting member from objecting under section twelve of this act to any further proceeding on the petition by reason of the ineligibility or disqualification of the petitioner, or from proving under section forty-two thereof that the petitioner was not duly elected.\nThis appears to me to be the natural construction of the act, and it avoids what appears to me to be a forced construction, namely, one which would make appealable to this court a purely technical point of practice which is not appealable in any other case or proceeding whatsoever.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellant: Choquette & Martineau.\nSolicitors for respondent: Belleau, Stafford & Belleau.\n[1] 8 Q.

Ritchie C.J. and Strong, Fournier, Henry, Taschereau and Gwynne JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.\nRailway Company\u2014Sparks from engine\u2014Lapse of time before discovery of fire\u2014Presumption as to cause of fire\u2014Defective engine\u2014Negligence\u2014Examination for discovery\u2014Officers of Corporation\u2014R.S.O. (1877) c. 50 s. 136.\nA train of the Canada Atlantic Railway Company passed the plaintiff\u2019s farm about 10.30 a.m. and another train passed about noon. Some time after the second train passed it was discovered that the timber and wood on plaintiff\u2019s land was on fire, which fire spread rapidly after being discovered and destroyed a quantity of the standing wood timber on said land.\nIn an action against the company it was shown that the engine which passed at 10:30 was in a defective state, and likely to throw dangerous sparks while the other engine was in good repair and provided with all necessary appliances for protection against fire. The jury found, on questions submitted, that the fire came from the engine first passing, that it arose through negligence on the part of the company, and that such negligence consisted in running the engine when she was a bad fire thrower and dangerous.\nHeld, affirming the judgment of the Court of Appeal, that there being sufficient evidence to justify the jury in finding that the engine which passed first was out of order, and it being admitted that the second engine was in good repair, the fair inference, in the absence of any evidence that the fire came from the latter, was that it came from the engine out of order, and the verdict should not be disturbed. Held also, Henry J. dissenting, that the locomotive superintendent and locomotive foreman of a railway company are \u201cofficers of the corporation\u201d who may be examined as provided in R.S.O. (1877) c. 50 s. 136[1] and the evidence of such officers as to the conditions of the respective engines and the difference as to danger from fire between a wood burning and a coal burning engine, taken under said section, was properly admitted on the trial of this cause; and certain books of the company containing statements of repairs required, on these engines among others, were also properly admitted in evidence without calling the persons by whom the entries were made.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[2] affirming the judgment of the Divisional Court by which the defendant\u2019s rule nisi for a new trial was discharged.\nThese are actions against the Canada Atlantic Railway Company for damages by fire to the land of the respective plaintiffs, caused by sparks from an engine of the company which passed such lands on August 19th, 1884.\nThe pleadings in the actions were similar and were as follows:\u2014\nSTATEMENT OF CLAIM.\n1. While the plaintiff was possessed of certain growing wood, timber, cord wood, fences, meadow, pasture and surface soil in and upon the plaintiff\u2019s land near to the defendants\u2019 railway and the defendants were possessed of a certain locomotive engine containing fire and burning matter which engine was being driven along the said railway near to the plaintiffs\u2019 said land under the management of the defendants the defendants so negligently and unskilfully managed the said engine and the fire and burning matter there in contained, and the said, engine was so insufficiently and improperly constructed that sparks from the said fire and portions of the said burning matter escaped from the said engine by and upon the plaintiff\u2019s land thereby setting on fire and destroying the said growing wood timber, cordwood, fences, meadow, pasture and surface soil, and the plaintiff lost the use and enjoyment of the same.\nThe plaintiff claims $1,000 damages.\nThe following are the particulars under the plaintiffs statement of claim:\u2014\n1. The damage occurred upon Lot number 15, in the 5th Concession, Ottawa Front, of the Township of Gloucester, in the County of Carleton.\n2. The setting on fire took place on or about the 19th day of August ultimo, A.D. 1884, between the hours of eleven o\u2019clock in the forenoon and twelve o\u2019clock noon, or thereabout.\n3. The locomotive engine, at the time of such damage, was proceeding toward the city of Ottawa.\nSTATEMENT OF DEFFNCE.\n1. The defendants say that they are not guilty by statute 31 Vic., c. 68, s. 21 D.; 34 Vic., c 47, D.; 42 Vic., c 9, s. 27 D.; 42 Vic., c 57, D.\nJOINDER OF ISSUE.\nThe plaintiff joins issue upon the defendants\u2019 statement of defence.\nDelivered the 8th of October, 1884.\nOn the day in question two trains of the company passed the place where the fire occurred and the fire was not discovered for some twenty minutes or more after the last train passed. The evidence given at the trial showed that the last train that passed was in good order and that the other was defective, and that there was an interval of an hour and a half between them. The plaintiff claimed that the first engine was the cause of the fire, which smouldered until it broke out as discovered, and the jury so found. The company say that if either engine caused the fire it was the last and that as the origin of the fire was largely speculative there was no evidence to warrant the verdict. It was also claimed that certain evidence of employees of the road was improperly admitted.\nThe Divisional Court upheld the verdict and refused a new trial and their decision was affirmed by the Court of Appeal. The company then appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nChrysler for the appellants.\nIt is incumbent on the plaintiffs to prove the origin of the fire, which has not been satisfactorily done. The authorities show that there can be no presumption against the company when such a length of time has elapsed between the passing of the train and the discovery of the fire. McGibbon v. Northern and North Western Ry. Co.[3]; Canada Central v. McLaren[4]; N. B. Ry. Co. v. Robinson[5]; Smith v. London and S. W. Ry. Co.[6]; Jaffrey v. Toronto, Grey and Bruce Ry. Co.[7]\nCertain employees of the company were examined for purposes of discovery under R.S.O. ch. 50, sec. 156. The reception of their depositions was objected to at the trial and should not have been received. A portion of the depositions contained expressions of opinion by the deponents and such evidence is not contemplated by the statute. Goring v. London Mutual Fire Ins. Co.[8]\nIt is said that we cannot object to this evidence as we allowed the witnesses to be examined. That is not so. De Brito v. Hillel[9], Fleet v. Perrins[10]. The admissibility of such evidence is also dealt with in the following cases; Moore v. Boyd[11]; Court v. Holland[12]; Proctor v. Grant[13]; Douglass v. Ward[14].\nMcCarthy Q.C. and Mahon for the respondents. As to the claim that the verdict is against the weight of evidence we can only repeat what has been said in two previous cases in this term, that a second appellate court will not reverse the findings of the jury, affirmed by the Divisional Court and the Court of Appeal.\nOn the general question of the liability of railway companies for negligence under circumstances such as the present and where the onus lies to prove such negligence see Vaughan v. Taff Vale Ry, Co.[15]; Pigott v. Eastern Counties Railway Co.[16]; Fletcher v. Rylands[17]; Pollock on Torts[18]; Addison on Torts[19]; Freemantle v. London & North Western Ry. Co.[20]; Dimmock v. North Staffordshire Ry. Co.[21]; Cooley on Torts[22]; Canada Central v. McLaren[23].\nAt the trial the depositions of the employees were objected to as a whole but no objection was taken to the particular portions which might be considered inadmissible. This practice is dealt with in MacLennan\u2019s Judicature Act[24]; And see Mathers v. Short[25].\nSIR W.J. RITCHIE C.J.\u2014(His Lordship read the pleadings in the case and continued:)\nThese are appeals from the judgment of the Court of Appeal. The actions are to recover damages to the crops, timber and soil of two farms adjoining one another, occasioned by a fire which the respondent alleges occurred through the negligence of the defendants in the management of one of their locomotive engines, passing along the defendants\u2019 railway adjoining the land in question. The actions were tried together by consent; the amount of damages was agreed on in the event of the defendants\u2019 liability being established.\nThe question submitted to the jury was: Did the fire arise from any negligence on the part of the company? And the jury found that it did. This verdict was sustained by the Queen\u2019s Bench and Common Pleas Divisional Courts and by the Court of Appeal, Mr. Justice Burton alone dissenting.\nThe contention of the plaintiffs is that No. 4 engine which passed was defective, out of order and threw dangerous fire; that in passing along the track at the place in question fire was thrown from the engine, caught, smouldered, was blown into a flame and did the damage. The company say the evidence offered was insufficient to establish that fact, and that after No. 4 passed, and before the fire was discovered, another engine had passed by, about noon, and so long a time after No 4 had passed that the jury would not be justified in saying that the fire escaped from No. 4 which caused the damage. It was assumed, on the trial and on the argument, that this latter engine was in good repair and in proper working order; at any rate no evidence to the contrary was adduced. On the other hand, all the judges of all the courts agreed, that there was sufficient evidence to justify the jury in finding that No. 4 engine was out of order.\nThe regular time for passing Eastman station, near the farms of the plaintiffs, for the freight train was 11.30 a.m. and for the passenger train 12.01 p.m. On the 19th of August, 1884, the trains passed at or about the regular times, and some short time after the passenger train passed the fire was seen bursting up. Is it to be assumed as an incontrovertible fact that another train having passed, and the fire not having been discovered until an hour after when it appeared in full blaze, entirely rebuts any inference that the fire could have been caused by the first train? If No. 4 only had passed, in an improper condition with respect to fire throwing, and no other train had passed before the fire was discovered, could any reasonable jury have come to any other conclusion than that the fire, though not discovered for an hour, was caused by sparks from this improperly conditioned engine? It appears to me this would have been an almost irresistible inference of fact. How, then, is this met by showing that a train in perfect order passed about an hour afterwards and some quarter or half an hour after that the fire was seen blazing up?\nMr. Justice Burton, the only dissentient judge, was of opinion that there was no evidence to go to the jury, and that the learned judge should have non-suited the plaintiffs. He does \u201cnot question that there was evidence of the alleged faulty construction of engine No. 4 which could not have been withdrawn from the jury\u201d; \u201cbut,\u201d he says:\nThere is not a particle of direct evidence to show what caused the fire. No doubt, if the fire had broken out shortly after the passing of engine No. 4, no other cause for the fire being shown, the jury might properly enough have been asked to draw the inference that sparks from that engine had caused the fire. But I entertain a very strong opinion that no such inference should or ought to be drawn when it was shown that no trace of fire was seen until after the passing of the second engine, upwards of an hour subsequently, in an exceptionally dry season, and that it was discovered some 10 or 15 minutes after the passing of that second engine, it being common knowledge that all engines do emit sparks and cinders which might have caused the injury, notwithstanding that they are of the best construction and are worked without negligence.\nAnd he was compelled to hold that it was a pure question for the judge.\nOn the contrary, I think the evidence in this case could not properly have been withdrawn from the jury, being of opinion there was evidence to go to the jury in support of the respondents\u2019 case. I cannot look upon it as a mere matter of speculation as to which engine the fire came from, but a fact to be determined, resulting from the direct evidence and the fair and reasonable inferences to be drawn therefrom. The jury being justified in finding No. 4 out of order and throwing fire badly, and it being assumed on both sides that the engine of the regular train was in order, I think the fair inference, in the absence of any evidence that the fire came from the regular train, would naturally be that it came from the engine out of order rather than from the one in order.\nBut Mr. Justice Burton seems to think that the time between the passing of No. 4 and the passing of the regular train admitted to be in good order, and the discovery of the fire after the passing of the latter, was an answer in law to the plaintiffs\u2019 case, thus turning what should, in my humble opinion, in view of all the surrounding circumstances, be a presumption or inference of fact into a proposition of law. The defective state of engine No. 4 and it being a wood burning engine and its cinders more likely to do damage than a coal burner; the perfect state of the engine on the regular train and it being a coal burner and its cinders less likely to do damage; the length of time between the passing of the respective trains and the time the fire was discovered; the condition in which it was first seen; the state of the wind; the nature and character of the ground on which the fire broke out; and the reasonable probability of it smouldering, were all, in my opinion, matters for the jury and could not be withdrawn from their consideration; for who, as the judge suggested, bringing their common knowledge to their assistance in relation to such affairs, could be so capable of arriving at a correct conclusion as to whether the fire was caused by one or the other of the engines and, if so, by No. 4, a conclusion to be arrived at dependent as well on direct evidence as on presumptions or inferences of fact, and, therefore, the learned judge was, in my opinion, right in refusing to non-suit, and the jury having found in favor of the plaintiffs I think the verdict should not be disturbed.\nI think the evidence of extracts from the repair book kept in the appellants\u2019 offices of entries of repairs required by engine No. 4, which is alleged to have caused the damage, were admissible in evidence. I was a little doubtful as to the admissibility of Donaldson\u2019s deposition but I cannot say that any wrong or miscarriage has been caused thereby. I cannot think the verdict would have been at all affected by the rejection of this evidence.\nSTRONG J.\u2014Concurred in the judgment of Mr, Justice Gwynne.\nFOURNIES J.\u2014Concurred in dismissing the appeal\nHENRY J.\u2014I have had a good deal of difficulty about this case in more respects than one. The plaintiff in all actions for negligence in which damages have resulted to him is required to prove the negligence. Now we all know that in running railways through this country in dry seasons sparks will come, and we know they will be carried to another portion of the country and remain lighted for a long time and when falling to the ground set fire to combustible substances. There is this difficulty here. There is no evidence at all that the fire was there when engine No. 4 passed. That is the engine that has the bad charac- ter. And there is no evidence that any sparks from that engine caused the fire. The engine that passed an hour afterwards might possibly have emitted sparks which caused the damage. If so the company would not be liable as that engine was provided with the necessary appliances for protection from fire.\nWe have to assume a good deal in this case. We must assume that the fire was there when the second engine passed, and had been smoldering there for over an hour.\nI think that in a case of this kind, depending on circumstantial evidence, the rule is that the plaintiff is bound to prove the reasonable absence of any other cause. I am not going so far as to say that the plaintiff has not done that in this case, and am not in favor of reversing the judgment and setting aside the verdict of the jury, but I feel bound to express the difficulty I have had in arriving at a conclusion.\nAs to the engine No. 4 there is a difference between the evidence for the plaintiff and that for the respondents. That is a matter for the jury and no court will set aside their finding. But there was evidence admitted which I think should not have been received. The depositions of parties on matters of opinion were improperly received. It is hard to say what effect an affidavit such as Donaldson\u2019s would have on the jury, or whether it did not influence their verdict. If improper evidence has been received which might have influenced the jury, and there was not sufficient evidence independent of it, the verdict should be set aside. I have looked into the case and think there was sufficient evidence without this deposition. While expressing this doubt still I concur with the majority of the court.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014I am of opinion that this appeal should be dismissed. I have read the judgment pre- pared by Mr. Justice Gwynne and concur in the views expressed by him.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014By the rules nisi issued at the instance of the defendants in the Divisional Courts of the High Court of Justice for Ontario in which the above actions were respectively brought, the discharge of which rules is the subject of the present appeals, it was ordered that the respective plaintiffs should show cause why the verdict and judgment for the plaintiff obtained in the said respective actions should not be set aside and judgment entered for the defendants or a new trial had between the parties on the grounds following:\n1. That the verdict is contrary to law and evidence and the weight of evidence.\n2. That there was no evidence to go to the jury in support of the plaintiffs\u2019 claim.\n3. That there was no sufficient evidence that the fire which ignited the plaintiffs\u2019 property came from the defendants\u2019 locomotive number four.\n4. That there was no evidence of negligence on the part of the defendants either in the construction or management of the said locomotive.\n5. And on the ground of the improper reception of evidence of the depositions of Moxley, Donaldson and James Ogilvie and of entries in the books of the defendants made subsequent to the fire, and of entries in the said books before and after the said fire, without calling the persons who made the said entries or proving their authenticity, and upon the grounds that the said entries are not evidence against the defendants of the facts alleged therein.\nThe verdicts and judgments in favor of the plaintiffs had been rendered upon the answers of the jury to three questions submitted to them, which questions and answers were as follows:\u2014\nQUESTIONS.\n1. What was the cause of the fire?\n2. Did the fire arise through any negligence on the part of the company?\n3. If you say yes state what, in your opinion, was the act of negligence?\nANSWERS OF THE JURY.\nTo the first of the above questions they answer\nWe agree in the belief that the fire came from engine No. 4.\nTo the 2nd question they answer\nWe believe it did.\nAnd to the third they say\nThe act of negligence on the part of the company consists in running engine No. 4 when, according to their own reports, she was a bad fire thrower and dangerous.\nNow as to entering a non-suit or a judgment for the defendants it is quite impossible that the contention of the defendants should have prevailed. There was evidence that the fire took place within an hour and a half after a locomotive engine of the defendants, which was a wood burner and known as engine No. 4\u2014and within 30 or 40 minutes after another engine of the defendants which was a coal burner and known as engine No 406\u2014had passed the place where the fire originated; the evidence also showed that it originated on the defendants\u2019 property and within the distance of about 20 feet from the railway track\u2014that there was no apparent cause from which the fire might have originated other than those locomotives\u2014that in the same month in which this fire occurred, and previously thereto, fire had taken place frequently along the track after the defendants\u2019 cars had passed, which the witness who testified thereto had himself put out. It was also proved that engine No. 4 had been repeatedly reported between the 1st of June and the 19th of August, on which latter day the fire occurred, by the engine driver, whose duty it was to cause such report to be entered in a book of the defendants kept for the purpose, as wanting repairs. On the 14th June she was thus reported:\nSmoke stack netting wants examining. Elbow on R.H. flue pipe leaking. Side-rod brasses want reducing on R. S. on back crank pin.\nand on the 22nd July, thus:\nNetting on smoke stack wants examining, throws fire bad. Whistle pipe that screws into dome leaking. Boiler wants washing out.\nThere was evidence that in consequence of this latter report some repairs were done to the netting, but the engine, which was an old one, was again reported in like manner on the 1st, 8th, 21st and 23rd of August as requiring divers repairs, not, it is true, pointing to the smoke stack netting, but on the 28th August she was reported again as follows:\u2014\nBig and little end brasses on left hand side wants reducing and lining up. Bonnet on top of smoke stack wants examining\u2014throws fire bad.\nThe depositions of the defendants\u2019 locomotive foreman taken before the trial under an order in that behalf made pursuant to section 156 of ch. 50 R.S.O. were also read in evidence. In those depositions he had deposed among other things that:\u2014\nThere is a cone 24 inches in diameter in engine No. 4. Pieces of charcoal may be forced into the bonnet and after striking the cone and rebounding may wear holes in the netting. The wearing away of the netting is commoner in a coal burner than in a wood burner. A\u2019 larger quantity of fire will escape from a wood-burner than from a coal burner. If in proper order the wood burner is as safe as a coal-burner. If a wood-burner is kept in good order it should not throw dangerous sparks. The cylinder in No, 4 is 15\u00bc inches in diameter by 26 inch stroke. The diameter was increased \u00bc of an inch when repaired\u2014when new it was 15 inches\u2014there are two exhaust nozzles of 2\u215d inch diameter\u2014that is the inside diameter of the outlet. We vary the size of the exhaust nozzle. The exhaust nozzle of No. 4 has not been varied. By making the exhaust nozzle smaller you create a greater vacuum in the smoke box and you increase the draught on the fire. If the exhaust nozzle of the engine is too small it will cause a back pressure on the engine. You have to be particular to the one-eighth of an inch in the exhaust nozzle. If the nozzle is smaller than it should be a pressure will be created and a stronger draught on the fire tubes, and the air of the fire tubes stronger and the lip of the fire particles greater and the tendency will be to throw more unburned fuel into the smoke stack.\nThis witness being called by the defendants at the trial testified, among other things on his cross-examination, that a perforated cone which this engine No. 4 had was harder on the netting than a solid cone\u2014that this netting would wear out sooner over the perforated cone than over the solid one; and being asked what was the effect of enlarging the cylinder and leaving the exhaust pipe the same size it had been before the enlargement of the cylinder, he said that the effect was to make the engine steam freer, but that it would give more forcible draught up the petticoat pipe and would have the tendency to throw the sparks with more force against the bonnet.\nNow, it is impossible for us to hold that this evidence, assuming it to have been properly received, was wholly insufficient to warrant the case being submitted to the jury, and that therefore the plaintiff should have been non-suited; it is equally impossible to hold that upon the findings of the jury in answer to the questions submitted to them judgment should be entered for the defendants. So likewise is it impossible for us to interfere with the findings of jury as against the weight of the evidence. Unless we could say that it was impossible for the fire to smoulder for the space of about an hour and a-half before it was observed, as it was, we cannot say that the jury have arrived at a wrong conclusion in attributing the fire to the engine No. 4, which was proved upon more occasions then one to throw fire badly. Nor can we say that the jury were not justified in concluding that upon the 19th of August she may have been as defective in this particular as she appeared to be on the 22nd July, and on the 28th August notwithstanding the repairs done on the 23rd of July. It is impossible to say that the evidence so strongly preponderates against the finding of the jury as to lead to the conclusion that they have either wilfully disregarded the evidence or failed to understand it.\nThe sole remaining question is as to the motion for a new trial on the ground of the reception of the evidence of the depositions of Moxley, Donaldson and James Ogilvie, officers of the defendant company taken under the order issued in pursuance of the 156 sec. of ch. 50 R.S.O., and of the entries in the defendants\u2019 books as to the condition of the smoke stack netting of the engine No. 4. As to the depositions the only objection taken was as to those of James Ogilvie for the reason, perhaps, that as Donaldson does not appear to have been examined as fully as was Ogilvie, his depositions were not deemed to be of much importance. The objection taken to Ogilvie\u2019s deposition being read was merely that a locomotive foreman, which Ogilvie was, does not occupy such a position as would make his evidence binding on his employers. The statute under which the depositions were taken enacts that:\u2014\nAny party to an action at law whether plaintiff or defendant may at any time after such action is at issue, obtain an order for the oral examination upon oath before a judge or any other person specially named by the court or a judge of any party adverse in point of interest, or in the case of a body corporate of any of the officers of such body corporate touching the matters in question in the action.\nThe statute also provides that the officers of a body corporate so examined may be further examined on behalf of the body corporate of which he is an officer in relation to any matter respecting which he has been examined in chief, and that the depositions shall be taken down in writing by the examiner, and when completed shall be read over to the party examined and shall be signed by him in the presence of the parties, or of such of them as may think fit to attend, and that the depositions so taken, whether they be the depositions of a party to the action or of an officer or officers of a body corporate party to the action, who was or were examined in the place of and for the corporation, should be returned to and kept in the office of the court in which the proceedings are carried on, and that office copies of such depositions might be given out, and that the depositions certified under the hand of the judge or other officer or person taking the same, or a copy thereof certified under the hand of the clerk or deputy clerk of the crown or clerk of the county court, as the case might be, should without proof of signature be received and read in evidence saving all just exceptions. The only difference between this provision of our statute and that of the English Judicature Act in like case is that with us the examination takes place viv\u00e2 voce, in England upon interrogatories. The principle upon which the examination is authorized and the depositions taken upon it are received in evidence is thoroughly explained by Sir George Jessel, Master of the Bolls, in Church v. Wilson[26]. The practice is there shown to have been adopted as a great improvement upon the old equity device for obtaining evidence to be used in a common law suit by a bill of discovery. He there says:\u2014\nThe defect of the old common law system was that it did not allow you in an ordinary action at law to obtain discovery from your opponent, and equity therefore invented the bill of discovery in aid of the plaintiff in the action or of the defendant in the action and gave that discovery and, of course following its own rules as applied to actions at law, it gave a similar remedy where it was a suit in equity. Then came this difficulty, that a corporation, answering not on oath but under their common seal, you could not indict the corporation for perjury and you could not therefore have the usual remedy or sanction whiih enabled you to rely on the discovery, and so to avoid that, the courts of equity allowed you to add an officer of the corporation as defendant to make him answer on oath, because according to the then procedure you could not interrogate him in any other way. In process of time the legislature, thought fit to get rid of the necessity of resorting to courts of equity for discovery by empowering the courts of law to give discovery in common law actions. Then what did the legislature do? It did not adopt the method which was adopted by the courts of equity in suits in equity\u2014that method was both cumbrous and expensive; what it did was this\u2014by enacting the provisions of the 51st section of the Common Law Procedure Act of 1854, which is almost in the words of the provisions of order 31, rule 4: that is recognizing the impropriety of making the officer a party to the action of common law it enabled the person requiring a right to discovery, to get an order to examine the proper officer on interrogatories. Then of course the parties to the action paid all the costs of the proceedings and the officer gave discovery and had nothing further to do with the action. When the legislature inaugurated a totally new system of pleading and established a new court of justice\u2014for that is what the High Court is the first question was, what system should they adopt in it, as there must be but one system for all kinds of action whether common law actions or equity actions, and they adopted the rule which had been adopted in common law actions, and that is the rule inserted in the schedule to the act.\nThen again in the Attorney General v. Gaskill[27], the same learned judge says:\u2014\nOne of the great objects of interrogatories when properly administered has always been to save evidence, that is, to diminish the burden of proof which was otherwise on the plaintiff. Their object is not merely to discover facts which will inform the plaintiff as to evidence to be obtained, but also to save the expense of proving a part of the case.\nThen in Berkeley v. Standard Discount Co.[28]; the same learned judge says:\u2014\nWe have had a long experience under the Common Law Procedure Act of 1854. The only difference between the present rule and section 51 of the Common Law Procedure Act is that in addition to the word \u201cofficer\u201d you have \u201cmember,\u201d but why should this make any difference? * * *\nI am by no means disposed here to lay down any rules which will fetter the discretion of any other judge, but I will state that my own practice has been not to direct a \u201cmember\u201d if it be shown there is an \u201cofficer\u201d who could answer; that is, who had a competent knowledge of the facts. Secondly, I always require to see that the interrogatories are not served on a person who has not the means of answering. But the fact is that the company is served with the application, and the company has as much interest as any body else in seeing that the proper man should answer, because the effect of the answer may be very serious as regards the position of the company. The ordinary practice, I believe, is for the company\u2019s solicitor to act for the officer or member, who is directed to answer and to prepare the answer for him, with the usual advantages which are possessed by the solicitor of the company, and to charge the company with the cost of so doing. I by no means desire to en courage the employment of a separate solicitor in such a case as this. The defendant here is the company and the person interrogated is making discovery on the part of the company.\nIt was, therefore, decided that the person interrogated who had been, but was no longer a director of the company, had no right to refuse to answer the interrogatories until he should be paid his costs of so doing.\nIn the same case Thesiger L.J. says:\u2014\nThe rule upon which the question turns is nothing more or less than an extension of section 51 of the Common Law Procedure Act of 1854, and is, I think, intended to be worked in the same manner in which that action was worked. It is apparent, he says, that the examination by interrogatories which is to take place is not any examination distinct from the examination of a party to the action, but is, as was the case of the officer under the Common Law Procedure Act, an examination of some one who may be called upon to answer as an alter ego of the corporation inasmuch as the corporation cannot itself answer.\nAnd again he says:\u2014\nNow in practice under the Common Law Procedure Act the application was made in chambers against the company, and if they had any objection to the interrogatories the company appeared by their solicitor, but the officer never appeared.\nNow, that the locomotive superintendent and the locomotive foreman were the officers of the company most competent to speak to the condition of the locomotives of the company, and their ability to prevent the escape of fire, and therefore the fittest persons to have been submitted to examination under the statute upon a question of that character, cannot, I think, admit of a doubt; and if there were any it is removed by the fact that the defendants themselves called the locomo- tive foreman and examined him largely upon the same question, and he was, in fact, the only witness whom they did examine upon that question. Then, as to the entries in the defendants\u2019 books as to the condition of engine No. 4, these entries, having been made in a book kept for the express purpose of calling the attention of the mechanical department to something required to be done and having been caused to be made in the book by the driver of the engine whose duty it was to make the entries or have them made, were admissible in evidence. The book in which the entries were made was one which the defendants were bound to produce, and consequently did produce upon an application for inspection of documents in the defendants\u2019 possession containing entries relating to the matter that was in issue. The point, however, of this objection was wholly removed by the defendants themselves having called the driver of the engine No 4, who, although he gave his evidence in a very unsatisfactory manner, a manner which showed the importance in the interest of justice of the entries being themselves received as sufficient evidence of the facts stated therein, could have left no doubt upon the minds of the jury that as he himself could not write he caused the entries to be made in the book for him by some other person or persons who could write, and the mechanical foreman testified that the entries were all seen by him at the respective times of their being made, and were attended to. It was for the jury to say with what effect, having heard all that he said upon the subject.\nThe appeal must, in my opinion, be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellants: Stewart, Chrysler & Godfrey.\nSolicitors for respondents: Mahon & O\u2019Meara.\n[1] R.S.O.

Fournier J. contra.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada (Appeal side) confirming the judgment of the Superior Court.\nOn the 18th November, 1864, the Corporation of the City of Quebec passed a by-law, under the authority of 27 Vic. c. 61, intituled \" A by-law allowing the Quebec Street Railway Company to construct a Railway in certain streets in the City of Quebec,\" by which powers were, subject to certain restrictions and conditions, conferred upon the company appellant, to build and operate a railway in the streets mentioned therein; and by the 25th section of the bylaw, it was enacted :\nThe privilege hereby granted to the said Company shall extend over a period of forty years, from the date hereof, but at the expiration of twenty years, the said corporation may, after a notice of six months to the said Company, to be given within the twelve months immediately preceding the expiration of the said twenty years, assume the ownership of the said Railway, and of all real and personal property in connection with the working thereof, and on the payment of their value, to be determined by arbitration, together with ten per cent, over and above the value thereof.\nAnd the 30th section provided:\nThis present by-law shall not come into force and effect until an agreement based upon the conditions and provisions herein mentioned, shall have been executed by a notarial deed entered into by and on the part of the said Company and the said corporation, on whose behalf the Mayor is hereby authorized to sign the said agreement.\nOn the 9th February, 1865, the Corporation of Quebec and the Quebec Street Railway Company executed a notarial agreement in accordance with the 30th section of the by-law, embodying such by-law and containing the above cited 25th section in these words :\nThat the privilege granted to the said Company by the said by law and by the present deed, shall extend over a period of forty years from the date hereof, but at the expiration of twenty years, the said corporation may, after a notice of six months to the said Company, to be given within the twelve months immediately pre ceding the expiration of the said twenty years, assume the owner ship of the said Railway, and of all real and personal property in connection with the w006Frking thereof, and on payment of their value to be determined by arbitration together with ten per cent, over and above the value thereof.\nThe rights and privileges of the company thus extended for forty years, from the 9th February, 1865, unless terminated in the manner provided by the law and agreement.\nOn the 9th January, 1884, the Corporation of the city of Quebec gave notice to the company that it intended to avail itself of the right stipulated in its favor by the by law, to assume possession of the railway; but subsequently they gave a second notice on the 21st November, 1884, whereby it informed the company that the previous resolution and notice was annulled and that after the 9th February, 1885, at the time and in the manner provided by the by-law, it would assume the possession and ownership of that part of the railway in question situate within the city limits, and of the real and personal property in connection with the working thereof, and would be prepared to pay the value thereof, together with ten per cent over and above, as established by arbitrators; and by the same notice the corporation notified the company of its nomination of F. X. Berlinguet as its arbitrator, and called upon it to name an arbitrator to value the property conjointly with Berlinguet: to this notification no attention was paid by the company, and on the 9th May, following, Berlinguet proceeded alone to value that part of the company's property situated within the limits of the City of Quebec, which he estimated at a sum of $23,806.30 and his award was deposited with a notary and signified to the appellants on the 18th may, 1885. Three days afterwards legal tender of this sum with ten per cent, added was made to the appellants and on its being refused an action was instituted, by which after reciting the several statutes, by-laws, contracts, tenders, &., the corporation concluded that the tenders be declared good and valid; that it be adjudged that it had aright to take possession of the road, horses, harnesses, cars, &c., and that such judgment serve as a title hereto, in favor of the corporation. This action was dismissed by the Superior Court on the ground of insufficient notice.\nThe Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada (appeal side) confirmed this judgment on other grounds, but the majority of the court expressed the opinion that the notice was sufficient, the same having been given within the year but not within the first six months of the year in which the term of twenty years had expired; and the recourse of the city corporation was by the last mentioned judgment reserved.\nThe respondents then brought a second action, claiming that the appellant should be held bound to proceed with the arbitration; that in default of their naming an arbitrator, one should be named by the court on their behalf; and on an award being rendered, upon payment of the amount of the award and ten per cent. in addition, the respondents should be authorized to take possession of said railway and property of the appellant company situate within the limits of the City of Quebec, and that such judgment should operate a title in favor of said respondents.\nTo this second action, the appellants pleaded substantially as in the former action :\n1. Want of sufficient notice.\n2. That in connection with the railway they, the said company, owned a large amount of real and personal property, and that a large amount of their said property was without the city limits.\nThat if the City Corporation had a right to take the railway which was desired, they must take the whole railway and all the property in connection therewith.\n3. That there was no power to force the Street Rail way Company to name an arbitrator or to proceed with the arbitration. Upon these issues, Casautt J. presiding in the Superior Court, whilst stating that his opinion as to the insufficiency of the notice remained the same as when he delivered. the judgment in the first action, considered himself bound by the opinion of the Court of Queen's Bench and gave judgment in favor of the respondents. This judgment being confirmed by the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada (Appeal side) the Quebec Street Railway Company appealed to the Supreme Court.\nIrvine Q.C. and Stuart for the appellants contended :\n1. That the notice could only be given in the first six months of the twentieth year, that is between the 9th February, 1834, and the 9th August, 1884, and must have been to the effect, that on the 9th February, 1885, the Corporation would assume the ownership. Conditional obligations, dependent upon the will of the person in whose favor the obligation is contacted, must always be performed in forma specified et indivisibiliter. Larombi\u00e8re, Obligations ([1]).\n2. The court had no power to force the company to appoint an arbitrator.\u2014The condition of the contract between the parties, gives, upon fulfilment of its pro visions, to the corporation the right to purchase the property of the appellants, at a premium of ten per cent, over the price fixed by arbitrators. No contract of sale is valid unless the price be fixed, or be susceptible of being established, by the joint consent of buyer and seller.\nTroplong ([2]); Duranton ([3]); Delvincourt. ([4]); Lau rent ([5]); Duvergier ([6]); Marcad'e, on C. N. Art. 1562 ([7]); Aubry & Rau ([8]).\nThe remedy of the corporation, if there has been a breach of contract on the part of the appellants, is in damages.\n3. That the corporation was obliged to tender for all the real and personal property in connection with the working thereof, not for a part only.\nNothing was offered for a considerable part of the plant and the necessary buildings because situate out side of the city limits.\nP. Pelletier Q.C. for respondents contended:\n1. That the corporation could give the said notice at any time within the twelve months preceding the 9th February, 1885, but the possession of the railway could not be obtained by the corporation before the 9th February, 1885, and if the notice was given at a date not leaving six months up to the 9th February, 1885, then the full space of six months was to be allowed between the notice and the taking possession of the railway.\n2. Trie appellants having agreed to settle their rights by way of arbitration, it was not competent for them to escape their obligation by refusing to appoint their own arbitrator. The jurisdiction of the Superior Court in the Province of Quebec is unlimited to enforce the contracts between the parties. Such jurisdiction is paramount to the obligations of the contracting parties. It is a remedial power even for cases not provided for.\n3. As to tendering for property outside of the city limits the respondents could have no control and the portion to be taken possession of, contemplated by the by-law and contract, was the portion of the railway within the city limits.\nSir W. J. RITCHIE C.J.-To my mind it is clear that \"after a notice of six months to the said company, to be given within the twelve months immediately preceding the expiration of the said twenty years, \" means that the company are entitled to a full six months notice before the expiration of the twenty years, and that such six months must be within the twelve months immediately preceding the expiration of the twenty years. In this case no such notice of six months was given within the ' twelve months, the notice given having\" been on the 21st November, 1884, which clearly was not a six months notice within the twelve months, the expiration of the twelve months being on the 9th February, 1885.\nI think the judgment of the Superior Court in the first action, which held the notice insufficient, was clearly right and should be restored.\nI think it very clear that the right to assume the road was to be at the expiration of twenty years and at no other time. It is a mistake to say the corporation have the whole year to give the notice : they are bound to give such a notice as will entitle them to assume the road at the expiration of twenty years; the express provision and privilege is, that at the expiration of twenty years the corporation may assume the ownership, but they cannot do this unless 'a notice of six months has been given within the twelve months immediately preceding the expiration of the said twenty years; if they fail to give such a notice the right to assume the ownership of the road at the expiration of twenty years ceases; so long as they give the six months notice within the twelve months they are all right, the six months having reference to the expiration of the twenty years; there was no other time contemplated or fixed for the termination of defendants', or the assumption of plaintiffs', rights in the road but the expiration of the twenty years.\nThe notice given was on the 21st November, 1884, that they would on the 9th February, 1885, assume the possession and ownership, &c. How can this be a good notice in any view of the by-law? It is neither notice of six months within the twelve months, nor any notice of six months at all. The notice of the 21st of November, 1884, that on the 9th of February, 1885, they would assume, &c, is only a notice of two months and nineteen days.\nThe only right the plaintiffs had was to put an end to the defendants' rights on the expiration of twenty years and from that date to assume the ownership, and if they failed to give the notice necessary to accomplish this they failed to avail themselves of the privilege accorded them by the agreement and by-law.\nSTRONG J.\u2014-Under the authority of an act of the Legislature of the late Province of Canada (27 Vic ch. 61) by which the present appellants (defendants in first instance) were incorporated, the City of Quebec passed a by-law, authorizing the company to lay down rails in the streets of Quebec and amongst other things providing as follows:\u2014\nThe privilege hereby granted to the said company shall extend over a period of 40 years from the date hereof, but at the expiration of 20 years the said corporation may after a notice of six months to the said company to be given within the 12 months immediately pre ceding the expiration of the said 20 years assume the ownership of: the said railway and of all real and personal property in connection with the working thereof and on the payment of their value to be determined by arbitration. together with ten per cent, over and above the value thereof.\nThis by-law further provided that the railway was not to go into operation until\nAn agreement based upon the conditions and provisions therein mentioned should have been executed by a notarial deed entered into by and on the part of the company and the said corporation on whose behalf the mayor was thereby authorized to sign the said agreement.\nA notarial deed embodying. an agreement of the same tenor and effect was accordingly duly passed on the 9th February, 1865, The 20 years therefore 'expired on the 9th February, 1885. On the 21st November, 1884, the respondents gave notice that they would take possession of the railway and its property under the expropriation clause mentioned on the 9th February, 1885, that is, within three months from the date of the notice and by the same notice the corporation appointed Mr. F. X. Berlinguet as its arbitrator to value the property according to the provision of the by-law and called Upon the company to name an arbitrator to make the valuation conjointly with Mr. Berlinguet. The company did not appoint any arbitrator and on the 9th May, 1885, Berlinguet proceeded alone to value that part of' the company's property situated within the limits of the City of Quebec which he estimated at a sum of $23,806.30, and his valuation or award to that effect was deposited with a notary and signified to the appellants on the 18th May, 1885. Three days after wards the respondents caused this amount of the valuation with 10 per cent. additional to he tendered to the appellants through the ministry of & notary. They then instituted an action offering to consign the amount of Berlinguet's valuation and the 10 per cent, addition al and concluding for .a declaration of their title, and of the right to the possession of the property. To this action the appellants pleaded a defence in law (demurrer) and a perpetual exception and on the 8th February, 1886 the Superior Court, presided over by Mr. Justice Casault, rendered a judgment dismissing the action on the ground that no notice of six months within the twelve months immediately preceding the expiration of 20 years from the date at which the by-law came in force had been given according to the requirements of the by-law and the notarial deed executed pursuant to its terms.\nThe corporation appealed to the Court of Queen's Bench which latter court affirmed the judgment of the Superior Court but upon other grounds from those which had formed the \u201cconsid\u00e9rants \u201cof the judgment pronounced by Mr. Justice Casault.\nThe respondents then instituted the present action in which they repeated the allegations of their former action and in addition the facts that the first action had been instituted and that the judgment already mentioned had been rendered therein and they concluded that the company be ordered to name an arbitrator to value jointly with the one named by the corporation the property of the company, situated within the city limits, and in default of its so doing that the court should itself name an arbitrator to act for the company and that upon the payment of the amount to be awarded and 10 per cent, in addition the corporation should be authorized to take possession of such property situate within the limits of the city of Quebec and that such judgment should be declared to operate as a title in favor of the corporation. To this action the appellants pleaded, (1) That the company had failed to give the six months notice required by the by-law and agreement; (2) that by the notice stated in the action the company only proposed to assume and pay for so much of the company's property as was comprised within the limits of the city of Quebec whilst the company had in accordance with its powers in that behalf extended its line beyond the city limits and had other property beyond the limits which the city if entitled at all were bound to include in any expropriation under the by-law and agreement. (3) The appellants pleaded a defence en droit, or demurrer, by which they denied the legal sufficiency of the notice set forth in the action, excepted to the power and jurisdiction of the court to appoint an arbitrator for them, and insisted that the acquisition of the rail way and its works and property would be ultra vires of the corporation. Upon issues taken on these pleas and defences the parties went to trial before Mr. Justice Casault who, whilst stating that his opinion as to the insufficiency of the notice remained the same as when he rendered judgment in the first action, considered himself bound by the opinion of the Court of Queen's Bench and therefore rendered a judgment by which the company were ordered to appoint an arbitrator within 15 days. This judgment having been affirmed by the Court of Appeal, two judges (Mr. Jus tice Baby and Mr. Justice Church) dissenting, has now been appealed from to this court.\nI am of opinion that the notice of the 21st November, 1885, was too late. The clause of the by-law and of the agreement executed in pursuance of it, \u02dbalready set forth, clearly contemplate that the assumption of ownership by the corporation shall be at the expiration of 20 years from the date at which the by-law took effect and not later. It is not disputed that the by-law came into force on 9th February, 1865, and that the 20 years consequently expired on the 9th February, 1885. The corporation being in law bound to the utmost exactitude as to time in executing this unilateral clause, were therefore bound to show that they were in a position by a strict and literal observance of all pre requisite conditions to claim the right to assume the ownership on this 9th February, 1885. Then what were the pre-requisites? 1st. They were bound to show that that they had given a notice within twelve months immediately preceding the expiration of the 20 years. The only notice given within that period was the notice of the 21st November, 1884. 2ndly, they had to prove that at the time they claimed the right to assume the ownership of the railway, at the end of the 20 years, they did so after having given to the company a notice of six months. Then, do they show that on the 9th February, 1885, they had given a six month's notice? The only available notice they show that is the only notice given within the immediately preceding twelve months, is that of the 21st November, 1884. But this notice had not been given six months before the 9th February 1885, and as no other notice is suggested to have been given within the twelve months the corporation wholly fail to establish that they have complied with these preliminary requirements and conditions upon which alone they could claim to exercise the unilateral right of pre-emption or expropriation conferred by the by-law and agreement.\nThat an option of purchase of the kind given to the corporation in the present case, being a condition potestative, must be executed literally and strictly as to all its terms and conditions, including time, appears well established both by French and English authorities; Pothier on Obligations ([9]); Demolombe on Con tracts ([10]); Larombiere ([11]); Fry on Specific Performance ([12]); Austin v. Tawney ([13]); Brooks v. Garrod ([14]). Upon this ground alone the appellants are therefore entitled to succeed.\nFurther, it appears very clear that the great weight of French as well as English authority is against the respondents as regards the right of the court to appoint an arbitrator or valuator to make the valuation pro vided for by the agreement. It is universal and elementary law that the price is the very essence of the contract of sale and that no such contract can be considered as completed unless either directly or indirectly the parties are agreed as to the amount and terms of the price. A valuation by an arbitrator appointed by the corporation and one appointed of office by the court for the company after their refusal to appoint one for themselves would not involve any such agreement as to the price as the law absolutely re quires. It is not therefore surprising to find the best commentators almost universally of accord against such a jurisdiction. The jurisprudence of the French courts is also the same way. I refer to the following authorities on this point : Troplong, vente ([15]); Durant on ([16]); Delvincourt ([17]); Laurent ([18]); Zachariae par Masse & Verff\u00e9 ([19]); Marcad\u00e9 on art. 1592 ([20]); Aubry & Rau ([21]); Taulier ([22]); Alauzet, Code de Commerce ([23]); and the jurisprudence is to the same effect in Dalloz Jur. Gren. Vente 380\u2014D. P. 62 1-242 note; Limoges 4 April, 1826, Jur. Gen. Vo. Vente, 381-40; Toulouse, Y March, 1827, Jur. Gen. Vente, 381-20; Paris 6 July, 1812, Jur. Gen. Vol. Vente, 382 (motifs); Montpellier, 13 February, 1828 ib., 195; Jury. Gen. Vente, 380, Trans-Hy., 94, 95, D.P. 62,1, 242 notes; Jur. Gen. Vente, 378; Pau 30 November, 1859, D.P., 60, 2, 36. The English authorities are decisively to the same effect : Milnes v. Gery ([24]); Derby v. Whittaker ([25]); Tillett v. Charing Cross Bridge Co. ([26]).\nThe provisions in the English Common Law Procedure Act as to the appointment of arbitrators by the court in default of an appointment under a contract do not apply to mere valuers Collins v. C. ([27]); Fry on Specific Performance ([28]). The circumstance that art. 15920. N. has not been textually re-reproduced in the C. C. of Quebec can make no difference. There is nothing in the code indicating that there was any intention to alter the law in such an important and radical particular as that which regards the price as an essential of the contract of sale, the rule which is the foundation of this objection. Therefore I think the appellants are entitled to have the judgment appealed against reversed upon this ground also.\nThe objections that the corporation do not propose to assume all the company's property, and that insisting that the by-law and agreement as regards the clause reserving an option of purchase was ultra vires of the corporation, need not be considered and I express no opinion on those points.\nThe appeal should be allowed with costs and the action dismissed with costs to appellants in both the courts below.\nFOURNIER J.\u2014Le 18 novembre 1864, la corporation de la cit\u00e9 de Qu\u00e9bec a adopt\u00e9 un (by-law) r\u00e8glement au sujet de la construction d'un tramway dans ses limites Ce r\u00e8glement est textuellement ins\u00e9r\u00e9 au long dans le contrat notari\u00e9 intervenu entre la cite d'une part et la compagnie appelante de l'autre, par laquelle cette derni\u00e8re s'obligeatt \u00e0 construire le tramway dont il \u00e9tait fait mention dans le r\u00e8glement et le contrat aux conditions et stipulations \u00e9nonc\u00e9es dans ces deux docments. Ces stipulations ont non-seulement la force d'un r\u00e8glement municipal, mais elles ont de plus le caract\u00e8re obligatoire d'un contrat pass\u00e9 en forme au thentique.\nLa clause de ce r\u00e8glement donnant lieu, pour la deuxi\u00e8me fois, \u00e0 un litige entre les parties, sur les m\u00eames questions, est identiquement la m\u00eame que celle contenue dans le contrat, et elle est con\u00e7ue dans les termes suivants:\u2014\nLe privilege accord\u00e8 par les pr\u00e9sentes \u00e0 la dite compagnie, (savoir : , la dite compagnie du. chemin de fer des rues de Qu\u00e9bec) durera pendant quarante ans, mais au bout de vingt ans, la dite corporation aura le droit, apr\u00e8s un avis de six mois donn\u00e8 \u00e0 la dite compagnie dans les douze mois qui pr\u00e8c\u00e8deront imm\u00e9diatement l'expiration des dites ann\u00e8es, de prendre et s'approprier le dit chemin do fer, ainsi que les biens, meubles et immeubles qui serviront \u00e0'son exploitation, en en payant la valeur qui sera estim\u00e9e par arbitrage, et, de plus, dix pour-cent de la valeur ainsi estim\u00e9e.\nLa corporation de la cit\u00e8 de Qu\u00e8bec, apr\u00e8s l'avis de six mois requis par le contrat et le r\u00e8glement, intenta une premi\u00e8re action fond\u00e9e sur une sentence arbitrale rendue par l'arbitre nomm\u00e8 par la dite corporation, apr\u00e8s le refus de l'appelante de nommer son arbitre pour proc\u00e8der \u00e0 l'arbitrage pourvu par le dit r\u00e8glement. L'honorable juge Cross a, dans ses notes sur cette cause, donn\u00e8 l'historique de la premi\u00e8re action, faisant voir pour quels motifs elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 renvoy\u00e9e par la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure, dont le jugement a \u00e9t\u00e9 confirm\u00e9 par celle du Banc de la Reine, \u00e0 l'exception de la partie du dit lustr\u00e8rent d\u00e9clarant que l'avis donn\u00e9 n'\u00e9tait pas suffisant, la cour du Banc de la Reine d\u00e9clarant, au contraire cet avis suffisant et r\u00e9servant a la dite corporation son recours pour une autre action.\nPar sa deuxi\u00e8me action la dite corporation d\u00e9sirant faire ex\u00e9cuter la convention au sujet de l'arbitrage demande qu'il soit ordonn\u00e9 \u00e0 la dite appelante de nommer in arbitre, et qu' a son d\u00e9faut de ce faire ii en soit nomm\u00e9 un par la cour, etc.; que sur paiement du montant qui serait accord\u00e9 par la sentence arbitrale, avec dix par cent en outre de c\u00e9mentant, la corpora tion serait autoris\u00e9e \u00e0 prendre possession du tramway et des autres propri\u00e9t\u00e9s en faisant partie, situ\u00e9s dans les limites de la cite et appartenant \u00e0 la dite appelante et que, le jugement vaudrait titre \u00e0 la dite corporation.\nLa compagnie appelante a de nouveau plaid\u00e9, lo l'insuffisance de l'avis donn\u00e9; 2o que la corporation de la cit\u00e9 de Qu\u00e9bec n'avait le droit de poss\u00e9der ni d'exploiter un tramway comme propri\u00e9taire; 3o qu'elle avait pour lexploitation du tramway des propri\u00e9t\u00e9s mobili\u00e8res et ' immobili\u00e8res dont une grande partie \u00e9tait situ\u00e9e en dehors des limites de la cit\u00e9 que Si la dite cite voulait prendre possession du tramway elle devrait aussi prendre possession de toutes les autres propri\u00e9t\u00e9s qui en faisaient partie; 4o que la dite compagie ne pouvait l\u00e9galement \u00eatre contrainte \u00e0 nommer un arbitre ni \u00e0 proc\u00e9der a l'larbitrage.\nLa principale question est sans doute celle de la suffisance de l'avis requis pour mettre fin au bail fait par le r\u00e8glement. La disposition du r\u00e8glement \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard a donn\u00e9 lieu \u00e0 une diff\u00e9rence entre les deux cours appel\u00e9es \u00e0 juger cette cause. L'hon. juge Casault de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure a maintenu que l'avis pour \u00eatre legal devait ttre donn\u00e9 au moins six mois avant l'expiration des derniers douze mois de la 20me ann\u00e9e. La majorit\u00e9 de la cour du Banc de la Reine a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 au contraire que l'avis tel que donn\u00e9 \u00e9tait suffisant. La clause du r\u00e8glement dit: Mais au bout de vingt ans, la dite corporation aura le droit, apr\u00e8s un avis de six mois donn\u00e9 \u00e0 la dite compagnie dans les douze mois qui pr\u00e9c\u00e9deront imm\u00e9diate ment l'expiration des dites ann\u00e9es, de prendre, etc. Les premi\u00e8res 20 ann\u00e9es du bail devant se terminer le 9 f\u00e9vrier 1885, l'avis fut donn\u00e9 le 21 novembre 1884, par cons\u00e9quent avant l'expiration des derniers douze mois. Il n'y a qu'une condition di impos\u00e9e \u00e0 la formalit\u00e9 de l'avis, c'est qu'il sera donn\u00e9 dans les derniers douze mois; la partie oblig\u00e9e \u00e0 le donner a donc jusqu'\u00e0 la derni\u00e8re minute des douze mois pour donner son avis, et pourvu qu'il soit signifi\u00e9 en dedans des douze mois ii est legal. Le d\u00e9lai pour le donner n'est pas de douze mois, moins six mois, comme ce serait le cas Si l'avis en question devait, comme on l'a pretendu, \u00eatre signifi\u00e9 six mois entiers avant l'expiration des douze mois. La clause ne contient aucune expression qui puisse justifier une interpretation qui r\u00e9duit aux premiers six mois de la derni\u00e8re ann\u00e9e le d\u00e9lai pour donner avis. Il est clairement de douze mois. Ii est vrai que dans le cas actuel l'avis \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 le 21 novembre, les six mois de d\u00e9lai qu'il comporte n'expireront qu'\u00e2pres la 20e ann\u00e9e \u00e9coul\u00e9e. Mais ce sont les termes de la convention qui le veulent ainsi. Les parties ayant jug\u00e9 \u00e0 propos de la conclure de cette mani\u00e8re sans doute parce qu\u2019elles ont pr\u00e9vu qu'il ne pouvait en r\u00e9sulter aucun inconv\u00e9nient. La convention, fait remarquer l'honorable juge Cross, n'oblige pas \u00e0 donner l'avis dans les premiers six mois :\nOn the contrary, it in effect says that it may be given at any time within the whole year, and, therefore, up to the last day of the year.\nLes arguments faits par l'honorable juge Cross pour soutenir l'opinion du Banc de la Reine sur la suffisance de l'avis me paraissent tellement concluants que je crois devoir en citer la plus grande partie :\u2014\nIt is not like the case of a lease, where the law provides for its continuance by regular stated annual terms, and in the absence of a specific agreement, requires as a condition precedent to the tenant's right to continue, a pure notice of a period whose limit is fixed by law, and in default whereof, the law prescribes as a penalty against the lessor and in favor of the lessee, that the lease shall continue for another year.\nThe parties in this instance had in view the termination of their relations at the end of twenty years : that was the main object of the stipulation but it did not necessarily follow that these relations should absolutely cease on the very day of the termination of the twenty years; on the contrary, much necessarily remained to be done after the expiry of the twenty years, in the valuation of the property, the payment of the price with its augmentation, and other like matters, before the relations established between the parties could effectually cease; and this especially required time on the part of the Street Railway company. Hence when the City Corporation had expressly the whole year in which to give the notice, the Street Railway Company could always claim the six months delay after the notice, although it may have carried them nearly six months into the following year. So that although the Street Railway Company might have insisted on terminating their relations to the City Corporation on the exact expiry of the twenty years, yet they were not obliged to do so, but could insist on the full expiry of a | six months notice given to them within the year before being obliged to take measures to relinquish their position: that is, the six months previous notice was stipulated for in their interest, in case they, should require the whole of that time.\nCes motifs me paraissent suffisants pour soutenir la d\u00e9cision de la cour du Banc de la Reine \u00e0 laquelle je crois devoir donner mon concours.\nQuant \u00e0 la question du pouvoir do la corporation de poss\u00e9der et d\u2019exploiter le tramway en question, il est tout-\u00e0-fait inutile de s'en occuper sur cette contestation, bien que l'acte 27 Vict., ch. 61, ne laisse gu\u00e8re de doute \u00e0 ce sujet. Le droit de s'en faire mettre en possession est soul mis en contestation aujourd'hui. Lorsque la corporation voudra exploiter le dit tramway, ii sera temps alors de s'occuper de l'\u00e9tendue des pouvoirs que la loi lui a conf\u00e9r\u00e9e \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard.\nQuant \u00e0 l'\u00e9tendue des propri\u00e9t\u00e9s mobili\u00e8res et immobili\u00e8res qui devaient \u00eatre comprises dans l'\u00e9valuation qui devait en \u00eatre faite par l'arbitrage, elle est d\u00e9termin\u00e9e par l'acte notari\u00e9 pass\u00e9 le 9 f\u00e9vrier 1865, Elle doit se limiter \u00e0 cette partie du tramway qui est situ\u00e9 dans les limites de la cite. Ni le r\u00e8glement ni le contrat no ne donne \u00e0 ce sujet aucun pouvoir \u00e0 la corporation. quant aux propri\u00e9t\u00e9s mobili\u00e8res qui devaient \u00eatre \u00e9valu\u00e9es comme d\u00e9pendances du tramway, cela dolt \u00eatre laiss\u00e9 \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision des arbitres,\nSur la validit\u00e9 de la clause par laquelle les parties se sont engages \u00e0 reforger \u00e0 arbitres la question d'\u00e9valuation du tramway et des propri\u00e9t\u00e9s mobili\u00e8res de la compagnie, la majorit\u00e9 do la cour du Bane de la Reine s'est formellement prononc\u00e9e tout en admettant comme l'a fait l'hon. juge Cross, qu'il y a divergence d'opinion parmi les auteurs. Mais comme le fait observer ce savant juge, la raison semble \u00eatre tout-\u00e0-fait du c\u00f4t\u00e9 de ceux qui maintiennent que cette clause Peut \u00eatre mise en force. Les autorit\u00e9s cit\u00e9es par l'appelante dans son 'factum pour prouver li impossibilit\u00e9 de la mettre \u00e0 ex\u00e9cution n'ont pas d'application au cas actuel. Elles B ne concernent que le cas d'une vente dans laquelle un vendeur et un acheteur ayant promis de laisser la fixation du prix de vente \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision d'un tiers, la question s'\u00e9l\u00e8ve au sujet de la l\u00e9galit\u00e9 du consentement indispensable \u00e0 la validit\u00e9 de la vente. Il ne s'agit pas ici d'une vente, car la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 (les rues de la cit\u00e9) qui fait le sujet de la clause compromissoire est inali\u00e9nable. Il n'y a pas eu et il n'a Pu y avoir vente par l'intim\u00e9e des rues de la cite dont elle a permis l'usage \u00e0 l\u2019appelante pour un certain nombre d'ann\u00e9es. Cette propri\u00e9t\u00e9 est inali\u00e9nable de sa nature. La transaction dont il s'agit ne peut \u00eatre tout au plus qu'un bail dont la consid\u00e9ration re\u00e7ue par la cite serait la facilit\u00e9 des communications offertes aux citoyens pour les transporter en ville. Il est pourvu qu'\u00e0 son expiration la corporation reprendra possession du tramway et de ses d\u00e9pendances en remboursant la compagnie appelante avec en outre dix pour cent. Ce n'est pas une vente, la rue n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 vendue, c'est une simple r\u00e9solution de la convention qui permet \u00e0 l'in tim\u00e9e de rentrer dans sa propri\u00e9t\u00e9 en indemnisant la partie d\u00e9poss\u00e9d\u00e9e de ses frais de construction. La somme \u00e0 payer n'est pas un prix de vente, puisque l'appelante pretend que l\u2019intim\u00e9e ne peut poss\u00e9der le chemin en question. Ce n'est tout au plus qu'une indemnit\u00e9 pour les travaux de lappelante. La prospi\u00e9t\u00e9 devant retourner \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e, au bout de 20 ans, rien n'\u00e9tait plus rationnel et plus conforme aux usages judiciaires du pays que de convenir, comme on l'a fait dans le cas actuel que cc serait en en payant la valeur qui sera estim\u00e9e par arbitrage, et, de plu, dix pour cent cl\u00e9 la valeur ainsi estim\u00e9e. Comme on le voit il ne s'agit nullement de vente et les autorit\u00e9s cit\u00e9es par l'appelante portent \u00e0 faux. Ii s'agit idi seulement de la validit\u00e9 de la clause par laquelle les parties sont convenues que leur contestation au sujet de l'\u00e9valuation \u00e0. faire serait jug\u00e9e par des arbitres. cette clause est-elle valable? Ii y a divergence d'opinion \u00e0 ce sujet entre les auteurs, comme l'a fait observer l'honorable juge Cross. Aussi, je ne me propose pas d'entrer dans la discussion des raisons donn\u00e9es de part et d'autre\u2014ce travail est d\u00e9j\u00e0 fait\u2014je me con tenterai de n'en citer que les parties qui font voir, comme l'a si bien dit l'honorable juge Cross, que la raison est du c\u00f4t\u00e9 de ceux qui soutiennent la validit\u00e9 de cette clause. Voir Dalloz, Rep. de Jurisprudence ([29]).\nMais en supposant que la transaction puisse \u00eatre con sid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme une vente dont le prix doit \u00eatre laiss\u00e9 \u00e0 l'arbitrage d'experts qui seront nommes ult\u00e9rieurement la clause est valable, comme le prouve Dalloz ([30]).\nJe suis d'avis de confirmer le jugement, mais je suis seul de cet avis.\nHENRY J.\u2014By agreement and in virtue of a by-law the appellant company obtained the right to exercise the powers and privileges of a street railway company in the city of Quebec for a period of forty years, and upon one condition only could this right be put an end to, viz : \" the privilege hereby granted to the said company shall extend over a period of forty years from the date hereof, but at the expiration of twenty years the said corporation may, after a notice of six months to the said company to be given within the twelve months immediately preceding the expiration of the said twenty years, assume the ownership of the said railway and of all real and personal property in connection with the working thereof and on the payment of their value to be determined by arbitration together with, ten per cent, over and above the (4) value thereof.\"\nThe notice in this case was given on the 21st. Nov. 1884, and the twenty years expired on the 9th Feb. 1885. I entirely concur in the opinion expressed by the majority of my learned colleagues that the notice is too short. The condition is a condition precedent to the right of the corporation to assume the ownership of the railway after twenty years.\nI also concur with Mr. Justice Strong in holding that the court has no power under the agreement to appoint an arbitrator for the company. If it were the case of expropriation of public land for public use the court, no doubt, would have had power td appoint the arbitrator. But the agreement here distinctly provides that the company's arbitrator should be appointed by themselves and there is no provision that in the case of the refusal of the company to appoint their arbitrator a judge or court can then appoint one.\nI have serious doubts on the other point raised, but it is sufficient for me to say that upon these two grounds I am of, opinion that the present appeal should be allowed with costs and the judgment of the Superior Court in the first action restored.\nTASCHEREU J.\u2014I am of opinion that the notice is defective and therefore the present appeal should be allowed with costs.\nGWYNNE J. \u2014The notice was quite insufficient; there is therefore no necessity to refer to the other points argued.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellants: Caron, Pefitland Sc Stuart.\nSolicitors for respondents : Baillarg\u00e9 & Fellctier.\n[1] 2 Vol. 91 on Art. 1175 C.

Ritchie C.J. and Strong, Fournier, Taschereau and Gwynne JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW BRUNSWICK.\nMarine insurance\u2014Insurable interest\u2014Not disclosed when policy issued\u2014Notice of abandonment\u2014Authority of agent.\nThe part owner of a vessel may insure the shares of other owners with his own, without disclosing the interest really insured, under a policy issued to himself insuring the vessel \"for whom it may concern.\"\nAn agent effecting insurance under authority for that purpose only, may, in case of loss, give notice of abandonment to the underwriters without any other, or special authority.\nAppeal from a decision of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick[1], refusing to set aside the verdict for the plaintiff and order a nonsuit pursuant to leave reserved.\nThe facts of this case are simple. Barss & Co., a Liverpool firm, cabled to one Vaughan, in St. John, N. B., to insure for them $3,500 on the barque \"Landseer.\" Under this authority Vaughan applied for the insurance, and the application asked for insurance \"on our account\" by H. Barss & Co. The policy was made out stating that the insurance was \"for whom it may concern.\" A loss having occurred a claim was made under the policy by H. Barss & Co. and several others who were shown to be interested in the vessel. The company resisted payment on the ground that only the interest of Barss & Co. was insured. Whereupon the policy was sued on by all the owners and\n(Mr. Justice Henry was present at the argument but died before judgment was delivered.) on the trial a verdict was entered for the plaintiffs with leave reserved to the defendants to move for a nonsuit, or to reduce the verdict to an amount agreed upon as representing the interest of Barss & Co. The verdict was sustained by the Supreme Court of New Brunswick, and the defendants appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nWeldon Q. C. and C. A. Palmer for the appellants. There was no authority in Vaughan to insure anything but the interest of Barss & Co. Any authority that Barss & Co. may have had over the interest of the other owners cannot be held to govern the action of Vaughan.\nFurther, there was no constructive total loss. The only evidence of loss is that of the captain, and his evidence is mostly inadmissible as it refers to the proofs of loss which are not evidence of the facts contained in them.\nLastly the notice of abandonment was insufficient. Only the person having authority to insure can abandon, and only the person having authority to transfer the property can insure. The test is whether, independently of the Merchants' Shipping Act, Vaughan could have given a bill of sale of the interest of the owners other than Barss & Co.\nThe cases of Stewart v. The Greenock Marine Ins. Co.[2]; Kaltenbach v. Mackenzie[3]; Jardine v. Leathley[4]. were cited\nForbes for the respondents cited Brown's Parliamentary Cases, Tomlins, 204. McManus v. Etna Ins. Co.[5]; Currie v. Bombay Ins. Co.[6]; Patapsco Ins. Co. v. Southgate[7]; Hunt v. Royal Ass. Co.[8]; Rankin v. Potter[9]. Sir W. J. RITCHIE C. J.\u2014I think there was sufficient evidence to warrant the jury in finding that there was a constructive total loss; that as agent for the assured H. Vaughan had a right to give notice of abandonment; and I think the notice so given was sufficient to convey to the underwriters the intention of the assured to abandon; that defendants having, by their policy, insured the vessel \"on account of whom it may concern\" it was open to the plaintiffs to show an insurable interest and for whose benefit the insurance was effected, the intention of the party directing the insurance determining whose interest the policy protects; and independently of the direct evidence in this case that twenty shares were intended to be insured would seem to appear very clearly from the amount insured, $3,500 on a valuation of $10,000. If the insurance was only on eight shares instead of twenty it would have amounted to only some $1,222 and they would have been paying premiums on $2,278 which they never could have received in case of loss\u2014a most unlikely and unreasonable thing for business men to do\u2014and it was, no doubt, seeing this would be the case that the agent of the company insured \"on account of whom it may concern\" to enable the plaintiffs, in case of loss, to declare the intent and cover all the interest the insured represented and intended to insure, without requiring him to disclose what that interest was at the time of effecting the insurance.\nThe fact of the agent of the insured departing from the words of the application, and using language of a more extended character, would seem to show that the interest was not to be confined to the shares standing in the name of Barss & Co. but was intended to cover all the interest they represented.\nAs to the claim to have a reduction of freight said to have been received by the assured and alleged to belong to the owners, the defendants not having furnished any means of ascertaining the amount, if any, so received there is no amount that can be deducted in this action.\nSTRONG J.\u2014I concur in all respects in the full and very able judgment delivered by Mr. Justice Palmer in the court below.\nFOURNIER, TASCHEREAU and GWYNNE JJ. concurred in dismissing the appeal.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellants: Weldon, McLean & Devlin.\nSolicitor for respondents: J.

S. C. ch. 137 ss. 18 & 19\u2014Judgment of Surrogate\u2014Pronouncing of\u2014Entry by registrar.\nRule 269 of the rules of the Maritime Court of Ontario (1) requires notice of appeal from a decision of that court to the Supreme Court of Canada to be given within fifteen days from the pronouncing of such decision.\nA judgment of the Maritime Court was handed by the Surrogate to the registrar, but not in open court, on August 31, and was not drawn up and entered by the registrar for some time after.\nHeld, Taschereau J. dubitante, that notice of appeal within fifteen days from the entry of such judgment was sufficient under the said rule.\nQuaere\u2014Is such rule 269 intra vires of the Maritime Court?\nAppeal from an order of Henry J. in Chambers dismissing a motion to quash appeal for want of notice required by rule 269 of the rules of the Maritime Court of Ontario.\nThis appeal is in an action in the Maritime Court for Ontario arising from a collision between the plaintiff's tug, the \"Bob. Hackett \"and the steam propeller \"St. Magnus,\" belonging to the defendants. The motion to quash is founded on rule 269 of the Maritime Court which the respondents claim was not complied with.\nRule 269 is as follows: \"A party intending to appeal from a decision of the court to the Supreme Court of Canada must give notice of his intention to appeal to the opposite party within fifteen days from the time of pronouncing the decision appealed from, and otherwise the appeal to be governed by the rules of the Supreme Court.\"\nThe action was tried on March 13th, 1886. On August 31st the Surrogate handed to the registrar his written judgment, but this was not done in open court and no notice was given to the defendants of the intention to deliver judgment. The formal judgment was not drawn up for some days afterwards. Notice of appeal was given within fifteen days from the entry of the judgment, but more than fifteen days after the judgment was given to the registrar by the Surrogate, namely, August 31st.\nSecurity for costs of the appeal by the defendants was allowed by Mr. Justice Henry. The plaintiffs moved before the registrar to set aside the order allowing the security, and, subsequently, to dismiss the appeal; both motions were referred by the registrar to Mr. Justice Henry and both were dismissed. The plaintiffs appealed to the full court from the order of Henry J. dismissing the motion to quash the appeal.\nS. White in support of the motion referred to rule 269 of the Maritime Court, R. S. C. c. 137 s. 19; Supreme Court Act sec. 25 (c). In re New Callao[1].\nMcKelcan Q.C. and Lash Q.C. contra.\nThe Maritime Court can only make rules regulating its own procedure and cannot interfere with the jurisdiction of this court.\nIf the rule is intra vires the time would not run until the entry of the judgment, as the decision was not pronounced in open court and we had no knowledge of it.\nThe following authorities were cited: Hill v. Curtis[2]; Holmes v. Russel[3]; Re Crosley[4]; Re Callao[5]; Herr v. Douglas[6]; Re Manchester Economic Building Society[7]; Re Stockton Iron Furnace Co.[8]; Re Blyth and Young[9]; Little's Case[10]; Pierce v. Palmer[11].\nSir W. J. RITCHIE C.J.\u2014I think the court only had authority to make rules for regulating its practice and procedure, and had no power to make rules affecting the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of Canada. If the rule relied on in this case has that effect it is ultra vires; if it has not that effect it merely relates to practice and procedure, and in that case it could be waived and, in my opinion, it was waived.\nAs there was no judgment delivered in open court on August 31, 1887, I am not prepared to differ from the opinion that the time would not run until entry of the judgment on September 15, 1887, and therefore the appeal is properly before this court.\nSTRONG J.\u2014The action having been heard on the 13th of March, 1886, at Sandwich, the judgment of the Maritime Court was handed (not in court) by the surrogate to the registrar on 31st August, 1887.\nThe judgment or decree was, however, not drawn up until some days afterwards; the exact day on which it was drawn up by the registrar does not appear, but I understood it to be conceded on the argument of the motion, that within fifteen days after the judgment was actually drawn up by the registrar notice of appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada was given. The appeal was perfected by the allowance of the security by Mr. Justice Henry on the 28th of September, 1881\nThe Maritime Court Act, R. S. C. ch. 137 secs. 18 and 19 are as follows:\u2014\nSec. 18. An appeal shall lie to the Supreme Court of Canada from every decision of the court having the force and effect of a definitive sentence or final order.\nSec. 19. The practice, procedure and powers as to costs and otherwise of the Supreme Court of Canada in other appeals shall, as far as applicable, and unless such court otherwise orders, apply and extend to appeals under this act when no other provision is made, either by this act, or the general rules made under this act, or under \"The Supreme and Exchequer Courts Act.\"\nBy rule 269 of the Maritime Court it is provided that:\nA party intending to appeal from a decision of the court to the Supreme Court of Canada must give notice of his intention to appeal to the opposite party within fifteen days from the time of pronouncing the decision appealed from, and otherwise the appeal to be governed by the rules of the Supreme Court.\nAt the time this appeal was taken the Supreme Court Act required notice of an appeal from a final judgment to be given within thirty days from the date of the judgment being pronounced.\nIn the view I take I do not feel called upon to express any opinion as to whether rule 269 of the Maritime Court is ultra vires or not. I am inclined to think it comes within the powers conferred by sec. 19 of R. S. C. ch. 137. But whether this is so or not I consider that the motion to quash must be refused on the ground that inasmuch as the notice of appeal was served within fifteen days of the date at which the order was actually drawn up by the registrar it comes within the terms of rule 269. I do not recognize the handing by the judge to the registrar, not in open court but in his office or perhaps in the street, as a \"pronouncing of a decision\" within the terms of rule 269.\nThen, if we are not to take the date of the 31st of August, 1886, as the time from which the fifteen days began to run, to what other date are we to ascribe the commencement of that period? There is only one other date to which it can be referred, and that is the date at which the registrar completed the judgment, and before the fifteen days, calculated from that time, had run out it is admitted that notice of appeal was duly served.\nThe motion to quash must be refused with costs.\nFOURNIER J.\u2014I concur in the judgment of the Chief Justice.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014I was inclined to think the notice of appeal too late, but I will not dissent on a question of practice.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014I entirely concur in the judgment of my brother Henry in chambers when the matter was before him, and in the judgment of the Chief Justice pronounced in open court to-day.\nMotion refused with costs.\nSolicitors for appellants: Mackelcan, Gibson & Gausby.\nSolicitors for respondents: White & Ellis.\n[1] 22 Ch.

(1877) c. 174 ss. 286-7.\nIn case of a tie in voting on a municipal by-law there is no authority to the returning officer to give a casting vote sec. 152 of R.S.O. (18773 ch. 174 not applying to such a vote[1].\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[2] reversing, the judgment of the Common Pleas Division[3] in favor of the plaintiffs.\nThis was an action to procure delivery to plaintiffs of debentures granted by the township of Cambridge under a by-law passed in 1880. The defence was that the by-law was invalid.\nThe by-law was submitted to the ratepayers and a vote was taken which resulted in a tie. The returning officer on summing up the votes, and finding there was a tie, gave a casting vote in favor of the adoption of the by-law and reported it carried. It was subsequently confirmed by vote of the council and was supposed by the plaintiffs to be in force. The plaintiffs contend that under section 152 of the Municipal Act, R.S.O. ch. 174, the returning officer had power to give the casting vote; the defendants say that that does not apply to an election on a by-law.\nAnother objection was that the debentures to be issued under the by-law were not made payable within twenty years. It was provided in the by-law that the debentures should not issue until the railway was completed and were made payable twenty years after issue.\nThe plaintiffs having succeeded on the hearing and before the Common Pleas Division, the judgment in their favor was reversed by the Court of Appeal on the first of the above grounds of objection, and it was held that the by-law was not passed by a majority of the votes of the ratepayers. The plaintiffs appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada from the judgment of the Court of Appeal.\nChrysler for the appellants relied on secs. 299 and 152 of R.S.O. (1877) ch. 174, and cited Bickford v. Chatham[4]; Hammersmith, &c., Ry. Co. v. Brand[5]; Commissioners Knox Co. v. Aspinwall[6].\nO\u2019Gara Q.C. for the respondents referred to Exchange Bank of Canada v. The Queen[7]; Baroness Wenlock v. River Dee Co.[8]; Tomkinson v. S.E. Ry. Co.[9].\nSir W.J. RITCHIE C.J.\u2014I think the by-law was not carried by a majority of the qualified electors voting to pass the same within the said provisions of the Municipal Act; and I agree with the observations of Mr. Justice Osler of the Court of Appeal. I cannot add anything thereto with advantage. As this must settle the case of the appellants I deem it unnecessary to discuss or determine any of the other questions raised.\nSTRONG J. concurred in the judgment of Mr. Justice Gwynne.\nFOURNIER J.\u2014I concur in the judgment of the court but am very sorry to do so. The township passed the by-law, but there is a doubt as to the right of the returning officer to vote in the way he did.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014I am of opinion that this appeal should be dismissed with costs for the reasons given by Mr. Justice Osler in the court below, and by my brother Gwynne in this court.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014The main question in this case is whether a proposed by-law for granting a bonus to the Canada Atlantic Railway Company introduced into the council of the municipality of the township of Cambridge; and there read a first and second time and submitted to the ratepayers qualified to vote thereon, and subsequently read a third time and purported to have been passed, is a valid by-law binding upon the municipality and its ratepayers, it appearing that upon the taking a poll of the votes of the ratepayers upon the proposed by-law a majority of the qualified voters voting thereat had not voted for the passing and adoption of the proposed by-law. However much it is to be regretted that the contractor for building the railway should be disappointed in receiving the benefit purported to be granted by the muni- cipality of the township of Cambridge, there cannot, I think, be any doubt that, for the reasons ably and fully given by Mr. Justice Osler when delivering the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, the instrument relied upon as a by-law has no validity. It appears that the council of the municipality in the year 1882, for the same reason by resolution in council repudiated the action of the council of 1880 in passing the by-law as ultra vires.\nIt is in the interest and for the protection of the ratepayers that the power which is conferred upon a municipality to incur a debt for granting a bonus to a railway company, is subjected to the express condition that the proposed by-law shall, before the final passing thereof, receive the assent of the ratepayers in the manner provided by the act.\nThe manner provided by the act is:\u2014\n1. Sec. 286. The council shall by the by-law fix the day and hour for taking the votes of the electors, and such places in the municipality as the council shall in their discretion deem best, and where the votes are to be taken at more than one place shall name a deputy returning officer to take the votes at every such place.\n2. They shall publish a copy of the proposed by-law with a notice attached specifying the time and places fixed for taking the votes.\n3. The votes at the polling shall be taken by ballot.\n4. Sec. 307. Every deputy returning officer at the completion of the counting of votes after the close of the poll, shall in the presence of the persons authorized to attend, make up into separate packets sealed with his own seal and the seals of such persons authorized to attend as desire to affix their seals and marked upon the outside with a short statement of the contents of such packet, the date of the day of polling, the name of the deputy returning officer, and of the ward or polling sub-division and municipality containing among other things,\n(a.) The statement of votes given for and against the by law and of the rejected ballot papers.\nSec. 308. Every deputy returning officer shall at the close of the poll certify under his signature on the voters list in full words, the total number of persons who voted at the polling place at which he has been appointed to preside, and shall before placing the voters list in its proper packet, make and subscribe before the clerk of the municipality, a justice of the peace, or the poll clerk his solemn declaration that the voters list was used in the manner prescribed by law, and that the entries required by law to be made therein were correctly made, which declaration shall be in the form of Schedule G to this act, and shall thereafter be annexed to the voters list, he shall also forthwith return the ballot box to the clerk of the municipality.\n5. Sec. 310. The clerk after he has received the ballot papers and statements before mentioned of the number of votes given in such polling papers shall, at the time and place appointed by the by-law, in the presence of the persons authorized to attend, or such of them as may be present, without opening any of the sealed packets of ballot papers, sum up from such statements the number of votes for and against the by-law and shall then and there declare the result and forthwith certify to the council under his hand whether the majority of the electors voting upon the by-law have approved or disapproved of the by-law.\nNow, by the law it was provided, as required by see. 286, above quoted, that\nThe votes of the electors of the said municipality shall be taken on this by-law on the 26th February, 1880, commencing at 9 o\u2019clock in the forenoon and closing at five o\u2019clock in the afternoon of the same day, at the following places and before the following returning officers, that is to say, at polling sub-division No. 1, at the town hall, On\u00e9sime Lefr\u00e9nce, deputy returning officer, and for polling subdivision No. 2, at the school house of section No. 5 in the said municipality, Peter Stewart, deputy returning officer.\nThe On\u00e9sime Lefr\u00e9nce here named as deputy returning officer at polling sub-division No. 1 was also the clerk of the municipality, so that the duties by the act imposed upon a deputy returning officer presiding at a poll and upon the clerk of the township devolved upon him. He acted as the deputy returning officer presiding at the poll at sub-division number one and, at the close of the poll, in the presence of a Mr. Johnstone, acting for the railway company as agent for the by-law, and of a Mr. Cameron acting as agent against the by-law, he made the statement required by the act to be made by the person presiding as deputy returning officer at the taking the poll of votes, which he signed with his name as follows,\nStatement of the returning g officer for electoral division number one, municipality of Cambridge, at the voting held 26th February, 1880.\nNumber of votes for and against the by law.\nFor the by-lawFifty three53\nAgainst the by-lawForty40\nMr. Stewart who was the presiding officer at polling sub-division No; 2 at the close of the poll in that sub-division prepared and signed a similar statement in the presence of a Mr. J.S. Castleman acting as agent for the by-law, and who appears to have been reeve of the township, whereby it appeared that the number of votes given for the by-law\nWere(thirty-four)34\nand against the by-law(forty-seven)47\nNow the polls having been closed and these statements signed and the ballot boxes placed in the hands of the clerk of the municipality, it is obvious that no change could be made in either of the statements otherwise than upon a scrutiny taking place under the provisions in that behalf contained in the act. The duty of the clerk of the municipality was expressly limited by the act to summing up the two statements, the one made by himself as presiding officer at polling subdivision No. 1, and the other by the presiding officer at sub-division No. 2, the number of votes given for and against the by-law and to declare the result and to certify that result under his hand to the council. Such summing up showed 87 votes to have been given for and 87 against the by-law, so that the result clearly was that the by-law had not been approved by a majority of the ratepayers voting at the polls and that the council had no power to read the by-law a third time and pass it. However four days after the close of the poll, namely, on the 1st March, 1880, he signed a paper in his capacity of township clerk whereby he certified that a majority had voted in favor of the by-law. This certificate is attempted to be justified as in point of fact true upon the contention that the township clerk had a right to give, and that upon summing up the votes and finding them to be equal for and against the by-law, he did give, a casting vote in its favor. This right is claimed under sec. 152 of the act which upon an election for councillors gives to the clerk a casting vote in the case of a tie \u201cto decide the election,\u201d and upon sec. 299 of the act which, as is contended, makes sec. 152 applicable to the case of a tie in voting upon a by-law. That sec. 299 enacts that at the taking of a poll upon a by-law which must be submitted to a vote of the ratepayers and approved by a majority before it can be passed\nthe proceedings of such poll and for and incidental to the same and the purposes thereof shall be the same as nearly as may be as at municipal elections and all the provisions of sections one hundred and sixteen to one hundred and sixty-nine inclusive of this act, so far as the same are applicable and except so far as herein otherwise provided, shall apply to the taking of the votes at such poll and to all matters incidental thereto.\nThe inapplicability of section 152 to the case of a poll taken upon a by-law for incurring a debt has been so clearly pointed out by Mr. Justice Osler that it may seem unnecessary to add any thing thereto; apart, however, from the absence of any analogy between an election of municipal councillors and a vote taken upon a by-law requiring approval by a majority of the ratepayers upon a poll of votes taken by ballot before it can be passed, it may be said that as the clerk\u2019s duty is expressly limited to summing up the votes pro. and con. as appearing on the statements signed by the officers presiding at the taking of the polls and thus ascertaining the result and certifying that result to the council, it is plain that special provision is made which in the terms of section 299 excludes the application of section 152. Moreover the giving a vote by the clerk, after the close of the polls, whether he be a ratepayer or not, as his right is contended to be, cannot, I think, be said to be \u201ca proceeding at the poll and for and incidental to the same and to the purposes thereof,\u201d and it is only those provisions of sections 116 to 169 inclusive, w8hich, so far as applicable, and except as otherwise provided by the act, are by section 299 made applicable to voting upon a by-law.\nI concur in Mr. Justice Osler\u2019s judgment also that it is unnecessary now to decide whether promulgation of the by-law does or does not cure the otherwise manifest defect in it in professing to authorize the debentures to be issued under it to run, and the rate to pay them to be levied beyond the period of twenty years from the day prescribed for the by-law to take effect, that being the remotest period allowed and expressly prescribed by section 330 of the act in respect of a by-law, such as that in question here is, namely, \u201ca by-law for contracting a debt (by borrowing money or otherwise,) for any purpose within the jurisdiction of the council.\u201d In the present case it is sufficient to say that the defect which has rendered the document in question utterly void, and, in fact, no by-law, cannot be cured by the promulgation clauses of the Municipal Institutions Act. These clauses apply only to by-laws which it was competent for the council of the municipal corporation to pass, as is provided by the 321st section. Now, by section 559 of the act it was not within the competency of the municipal corporation to give to the proposed by-law in question here, a third reading and to pass it as it had not received the assent of the rate payers in the manner provided by the act.\nThe appeal therefore must be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellants: Stewart, Chrysler &Godfrey.\nSolicitors for respondents: O\u2019Gara & Remon.\n[1] Sec. 299 of the act provides \u201cThat the proceedings at the poll (that is in voting on the by-law) and for and incidental to the same and the purposes thereof shall be the same, as nearly as may be, as at municipal elections, and all the provisions of sections 116 to 169 inclusive of the act, so far as the same are applicable, and except so far as is herein otherwise provided, shall apply to the taking of votes at such poll and to all matters incidental thereto. Sec. 152. In case it appears upon the casting up of the votes as aforesaid (at a municipal election) that two or more candidates have an equal number of votes the clerk of the municipality * * whether otherwise qualified or not, shall, at the time he declares the result of the poll, give a vote for one or more of such candidates so as to decide the election.\n[2] 14 Ont.

J., and Fournier, Taschereau and Gwynne JJ.\n(Mr. Justice Henry was present at the argument of this appeal but died before judgment was delivered.)\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF QUEEN\u2019S BENCH (MANITOBA).\nChattel mortgage\u2014Possession of goods under\u2014Right of mortgagor to sell\u2014Proviso as to\u2014Ordinary course of trade\u2014Seizure of goods under execution\u2014Justification for.\nIn a chattel mortgage containing no redemise clause there may be an implied contract that the mortgagor shall remain in posses\u00adsion until default, of equal efficacy with an express clause to that effect ; and such an implied contract necessarily arises from the nature of the instrument, unless it be very expressly excluded by its terms. Porter & Flintoff (6 U. C. C. P. 33S) distinguished.\nIn a chattel mortgage of the stock in trade and business effects of a trader there was a proviso to the effect that if the mortgagor should attempt to sell or dispose of the said goods the mortgagee might take possession of the same as in case of default of pay\u00adment.\nHeld,\u2014That this proviso only prohibited the sale of the goods other than in the ordinary course of business. Ritchie C.J. contra.\nThe mortgagee of the chattels seized the mortgaged goods under an execution in a suit for the debt secured by the mortgage. The execution was set aside as being against good faith. In an action for the wrongful seizure and conversion of the goods,\u2014\nHeld\u2014That the mortgagee could not justify the seizure under the mortgage.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench (Man.) ([1]), setting aside a verdict for the plain tiffs and ordering a judgment of non-suit to be entered\nThe facts, which are more fully set out in the judgment of Mr. Justice Gwynne, may be stated as follows:\u2014 This was an action of trespass and trover against the defendants for entering the plaintiffs\u2019 shop and carrying away and converting to their own use the plaintiffs\u2019 goods and a continuance of such trespass for the space of ten days.\nThe plaintiffs being indebted to the defendants in the sum of $800 and upwards agreed to give security for their debt on the understanding that they be allowed to carry on their business and the time of payment be extended for six months. This was assented to and a chattel mortgage was executed by the plaintiffs, the consideration for which was the amount of the debt, and the time of payment the six months\u2019 extension agreed upon.\nAs soon as this mortgage was registered judgment was signed in the suit which the defendants had brought to recover their said debt and execution was issued under which the sheriff seized the plaintiffs\u2019 stock in trade and sold it, a bailiff being in possession of the same in plaintiffs\u2019 shop for about ten days. On application to a judge the writ of execution was set aside as being contrary to good faith, and this action was brought in which plaintiffs obtained a verdict with $1,484 damages, the jury, under the direction of the presiding judge, making a special assessment of damages for the goods taken by the sheriff which were not covered by the mortgage. This verdict was set aside by the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench, and a non-suit ordered on the ground that under a plea denying the plaintiffs\u2019 title to the goods the defendants could set up the title of Ashdown under the chattel mortgage, and that under that mortgage they were entitled to enter and take the goods. The plaintiffs then appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nEwart Q.C. for the appellants.\nThe goods were seized under execution and when the execution has been set aside the defendants cannot claim that they took possession under their mortgage. At all events evidence of the mortgage was not admissible under the counts for trespass. Leake v. Loveday ([2]); Corbett v. Shepard ([3]); Hatch v. Holland ([4]).\nThe mortgage gave the mortgagee a license to enter and take possession on default and such license should be specially pleaded. Kavanagh v. Gudge ([5]); Samuel v. Coulter ([6]); Young v. Smith ([7]); Bingham v. Bettinson ([8]); Closter v. Headly ([9]); Watson v. Waltham ([10]).\nThe covenant in the mortgage was that the goods should not be sold without the written consent of the mortgagee. The defendants allege a breach of this covenant and must show that no written consent was given, of which there was no evidence. Moreover, selling the goods in the ordinary course of business would not be a breach of the covenant. Walker v. Clay (10).\nA redemise clause is not necessary to entitle the mortgagor to remain in possession of the goods mortgaged. Albert Y. Grosvenor Investment Co. (11); Wheeler v. Montefiore (12); Bingham v. Bettinson; Moore v. Shelley (13).\nThe defendant had an option to take the goods under the execution or under the mortgage, which option was never exercised. Cadwell v. Pray (14).\nClearly the court had no power to order a nonsuit. The plaintiffs had a right to retain their verdict, at all events, for $266 the amount assessed as damages for taking the goods not covered by the mortgage. Robinson Q.C. for the respondents. The right of a mortgagor to maintain actions in respect to goods mortgaged by a deed like the present, where there is no redemise clause, is dealt with by a number of cases both in England and Ontario. Porter v. Flintoff ([11]); Ruttan v. Beamish ([12]); McAulay v. Allen ([13]); Paterson v. Maughan ([14]); and the following which are especially to be considered, Bunker v. Emmany ([15]); Bingham v. Bettinson ([16]); and Whimsell v. Giffard ([17]). The English cages are dealt with in the judgment of the court below, delivered by Mr. Justice Taylor. National Mercantile Bank v. Hampson ([18]); Walker v. Clay ([19]); Taylor v. McKeand ([20]); Payne v. Fern ([21]).\nIt is clear that the verdict for the plaintiffs cannot stand as the evidence shows that the goods were worth much less than the damages allowed and the plaintiffs cannot recover more than their interest in the goods. Clark v. Newsom ([22]); Brierly v. Kendall ([23]); Toms v. Wilson ([24]).\nPrima facie the sale by the plaintiffs was unlawful and to justify it a written consent by the mortgagee must be shown.\nEwart Q.C. in reply. The jury have a right to take into consideration the loss of the business and give damages therefor, and the court will not cut down their verdict to mere inventory prices.\nSir W. J. RITCHIE C.J. It is clear these executions so improperly issued did not justify the sheriff in disposing, on behalf of the defendants, of the goods in the manner in which they were disposed of. The sheriff had a writ; he entered under it, seized, sold the defendant\u2019s goods; and by such sale levied the judgment debt. These executions haying been set aside as being improperly issued it is not now, in my opinion, open to the defendants to contend that they can ignore and repudiate such entry and dealing\u2019 with the plaintiffs\u2019 goods and set up that they were taken under another authority and for a purpose different from that of levying the money supposed to be due on the executions to the judgment creditors. The sheriff\u2019s officers at the time had a warrant and, according to the directions in the writs, took the goods and disposed of them according to the exigencies of the writs; as execution creditors they could only justify taking possession for the purpose of levying the debt under the executions by the hands of the sheriff. The sheriff acted bond fide under the writs and had no authority, express or implied, to act for the defendants under the mortgage and did not profess so to act; he entered and seized and sold the goods by virtue of the writs to him directed and for no other cause.\nThe defendants cannot justify the acts of the sheriff. I do not think the cases of the dismissal of a servant for one cause and justifying for another, or distraining for one cause and justifying for another, are at all applicable to this case. The right of a man to do an act with regard to the property of another depends upon the authority or right which he really has to do the act. What right had the defendants to send the sheriff into the plaintiffs\u2019 premises to seize and sell the plaintiffs\u2019 goods under a writ which they had caused to be improperly issued and which was subsequently set aside?\nThe defendants cannot justify as mortgagees, inasmuch as they never acted, or claimed to act, in relation to the seizure and sale of these goods, under the mortgage or any forfeiture thereunder.\nI think that construing this bill of sale as the mortgagor contends would, unquestionably, be to enable the mortgagor to effectually destroy the security. If the mortgagor is at liberty to sell and dispose of his whole stock in trade, and appropriate the proceeds for his own support and maintenance, or otherwise dispose of them for his own use, it is difficult to see in what consists the use or value of the security.\nOne can well understand that a man might mortgage a stock of merchandize and sell the goods in the usual course of trade if there was a provision that he should keep the stock up to its value at that time, or that he should apply the proceeds of the sales to the payment of the debt secured by the mortgage; but without any obligation to do one or the other, in the face of an express covenant not to sell without permission in writing, it is difficult to understand how there can be an implied covenant that he may carry on his trade and from time to time sell and dispose of his stock in the course of his business, without being bound to keep the stock up or account for the proceeds, and so utterly destroy the security of the mortgagee.\nIt may well be that the mortgagee might be willing that the mortgagor should continue his business, knowing that at any time he had it in his power to prevent further sales, if the selling of the goods was without his consent first had and obtained in writing, and he considered further sales would interfere with the value of his security.\nThere was, therefore, in my opinion, a forfeiture which the defendants might have acted on but did not, but instead thereof relied on the executions which have failed to sustain their acts, and the plaintiff is, therefore, entitled to recover the value of the goods seized, less the amount of the mortgage, and also damages for the sheriff\u2019s unlawful entry, seizure and sale. I think there should be a new trial to ascertain these damages, the amount awarded being entirely too high and not justified by the evidence, unless the parties consent to a reduction of the damages as suggested by Mr. Justice Gwynne.\nFOURNIER J.\u2014I have read the judgment prepared by Mr. Justice Gwynne in this case, and I entirely agree with the views he has expressed therein. I think the appeal should be allowed.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014I am of opinion that this appeal should be allowed with costs, and concur with my brother Gwynne in the conclusion which he has reached.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014(After setting out the pleadings in the case, the order setting aside the execution and the pertinent facts established by the evidence, His Lordship proceeded as follows):\u2014\nBy the chattel mortgage the plaintiffs, who were described therein as hardware merchants, sold and assigned to the defendant Ashdown, therein called the mortgagee, all and singular the entire stock of hardware, tinware, paints and oils and all other the goods, wares and merchandise of every description whatsoever belonging to the plaintiffs in and about the store occupied by them in the town of Pilot Mound, &c, to have and to hold to the said mortgagee, his executors, administrators and assigns, to his and their own use, provided always, and the said mortgage was declared to be made upon the express condition, that the said mortgage and everything therein contained should cease, determine and be utterly void to all intents and purposes, anything therein contained to the contrary notwithstanding, if the plaintiffs, their executors or administrators, should pay or cause to be paid to the mortgagee on the 1st March, 1884, the sum of $84180 with interest from the 1st of August, 1883. This sum included the whole of the amount which was due by the plaintiff to the defendants jointly and to the mortgagee himself alone. The mortgage contained no redimise clause, that is to say, no clause providing in express terms that until default the mortgagors should continue in possession of the goods assigned, but it contained a clause that:\nIn case default shall be made\u2019 in the payment of the said sum of money in the said proviso mentioned or of the interest thereon or any part thereof, or in casa, the mortgagors shall attempt to sell or dispose of or in any way part with the possession of the said goods and chattels or any of them, or to remove the same or any part thereof out of the said store and premises, or suffer or permit the same to be seized or taken in execution without the consent of the mortgagee, his executors, &c, to such sale, removal or disposal there-of first had and obtained in writing, then and in such case it shall and may be lawful for the mortgagee, his executors, &c, with his or their servant or servants and with such other assistants as he or they may require, at any time during the day to enter into and upon any lands, &c,. where the said goods and chattels or any part thereof may be and to break and force open any doors, locks, bars, &c., for the purpose of taking possession of and removing the said goods and chattels, and upon, from and after taking possession of such goods and chattels aforesaid, it shall and may be lawful, and the mortgagee, his executors, &c., and each or any of them is and are hereby authorized and empowered, to sell the said goods and chattels or any of them or any part thereof at public auction or private sale as to them or any of them may seem meet, and from and out of the proceeds of such sale in the first place to pay and reimburse himself or themselves all such sums of money as may then be due by virtue of these presents and all such expenses as may have been incurred by the mortgagee, his executors, &c., in consequence of the default, neglect or failure of the mortgagors, &c, in payment of the said sum of money with interest thereon as above mentioned, or in consequence of such sale or removal as above mentioned, and in the next place to pay unto the mortgagors any surplus.\nThe clause empowering the mortgagee to sell would I apprehend, if a case should arise requiring adjudication upon this point, be construed as empowering him to act only in such a manner as a mortgagee in possession with a power of sale is required by equity to do; that is to say, to sell the goods in such a manner as should be reasonably conceived to be best calculated, in the interest of the mortgagors as well as of the mortgagee, to obtain the best price that possibly could be obtained for them; not to sacrifice the property by a wanton, careless, vexatious sale, at a ruinously inadequate price, but to take all prudent measures calculated to secure as good a sale as possible.\nFor the present I shall assume that the mortgage authorized the mortgagee to take immediate possession of the goods upon the execution of the mortgage and to sell them under the power of sale contained therein in such a manner as a mortgagee in possession might do, deferring the consideration of the question whether it did or not to the last.\nIt is apparent from the evidence that, whatever the chattel mortgage may have authorized to be done, the defendants, in authorizing and causing to be done the acts which were done, did not, in point of fact, act or intend to act under and in pursuance of the powers vested in them by the chattel mortgage. But that, on the contrary, they acted and at the time intended to act in defiance of, and in repudiation of, the power of sale vested in them by the mortgage and in a manner quite inconsistent with such power; for on the very day that, in adoption of the mortgage on the real estate, they caused that mortgage to be registered, within, it may be, two or three days from the date of their acceptance of the chattel mortgage and their causing it to be registered, without any complaint whatever that, and before they had, so far as appears, any reason whatever to believe or suspect that, the mortgagors had done anything in violation of the terms of the mortgage, and without any inquiry whether they had or not, in apparent disregard of the mortgage they put a writ of fieri facias issued at their suit, and the mortgage put a writ of fieri facias issued at his suit, in the hands of the sheriff to be executed upon the goods in question as the goods and chattels of the plaintiffs, liable to the satisfaction of the moneys directed to be levied under the said writs, and they caused the goods to be sold under these writs and another shortly after-wards issued by the mortgagee the defendant Ashdown, and so caused them to be sold at the sacrifice usually attending sales by sheriffs under executions; and upon their right to issue such writs of execution and to cause them to be executed being contested in court, upon the ground that the plaintiffs had executed the said two mortgages on realty and on their stock in trade upon an arrangement that they should be permitted to carry on their business until the 1st March, 1884, they resisted the plaintiffs\u2019 application to set aside the said writs of fieri facias and persistently insisted upon their right to issue them and to have caused the goods to be sold thereunder and to retain the moneys realized by the sale thereof; and to\u2019 the very last, by their pleadings on the record, insisted that the sale under the said writs of fieri facias was good, denying the plaintiffs1 pleading that they and all proceedings had thereunder had been vacated and set aside; and, that contention failing them, they insisted that, notwithstanding the writs and all proceedings had thereunder had been set aside, still the seizure and sale of which the plaintiffs complained having been completed, and the moneys arising from such sale realized, before the order setting aside the said writs was made they have a right to retain the benefit of their seizure and sale under the executions as good and valid in law.\nNow there having been but one continuous act of trespass of which the plaintiffs complained, and those being the circumstances under which it was committed, it is impossible for the defendants to get over the facts proved and their consequences, namely, that the defendants acted not in virtue of any authority vested in them by the chattel mortgage but in defiance and repudiation of it; and their claim now to avail themselves of any benefit the chattel mortgage might have given them simply amounts to this: that admitting they did not act under the power of sale contained in the chattel mortgage but under an authority quite inconsistent therewith, namely, writs of execution issued upon judgments obtained regularly as they contend against the plaintiffs, still they ask that as the defendant Ashdown might have, as they contend he might have, taken the goods and have sold them under the power of sale contained in the mortgage, the jury in estimating the amount of the damages to which the defendants have exposed themselves by acting in defiance of the chattel mortgage, should take into their consideration by way of reduction of damages what the defendant Ashdown might have done but did not. To this the jury might well say, that what the defendants in fact did exposed the plaintiffs to the vexatious, unnecessary and wrongful expense of the sheriff\u2019s fees, possession money and poundage, &c, amounting to $103.25, and to an injurious sacrifice of their goods at a sheriff\u2019s sale under execution, which could not reasonably have been suffered if the mortgagee had sold the goods under the power in that behalf contained in the mortgage; so that whatever protection the chattel mortgage might have given the defendants if they had acted under it, they cannot get over the indisputably established fact that they did not act under it but in defiance of it, and the plaintiffs under the issues joined by them upon the defendant\u2019s fourth plea are entitled to such substantial damages as a jury under all the circumstances, including this last, may find to be reasonable.\nNow as to the construction of the chattel mortgage. There can be doubt that the courts of Upper Canada have held, but not without dissent, that Porter v. Flintoff ([25]) is an authority that in the case of a chattel mortgage, in form precisely similar to the present, being executed without an express redemise clause the mortgagor is not entitled to possession of the chattels mortgaged until default, and that therefore the mortgagor cannot maintain any action against the mortgagee for taking possession of the chattels, even though such possession should be taken before any default committed. In McAulay v. Allen ([26]); and Samuel v. Coulter ([27]), the majority of the Court of Common Pleas at Toronto held themselves to be bound by Porter v. Flintoff so deciding and by Ruttan v. Beamish ([28]), as affirming it. In Samuel v. Coulter, however, Hagarty C. J. suggested that the plaintiff should seek his remedy in appeal when Porter v. Flintoff might be reviewed. The point comes up now for the first time, so far as I am aware, in appeal. In Porter v. Flintoff\u2019 the question whether there might not be gathered from the terms of the mortgage an implied contract that the mortgagor should remain in possession until default, which would be as effectual as an express clause to that effect, does not appear to have been very much, if at all, discussed. I remain of the opinion which was expressed by me in McAulay v. Allen and Samuel v. Coulter, that the point so assumed to have been decided by Porter v. Flintoff was not at all necessary to a decision upon the precise point adjudged in that case, and that as it was not, the judgment in Porter v. Flintoff was not binding upon the point when it should be, as it was in those cases, especially raised. The judgment in Porter v. Flintoff (1) is supportable upon the authority of the principle upon which Watson v. MacQuire (2) proceeded, namely, that they constructive possession which follows the property in personal chattels is sufficient to enable a mortgagee of chattels which still are in the actual possession of the mortgagor to maintain an action of trespass de bonis asportatis against a stranger who in such form of action cannot set up the jus tertii; and that a sheriff who seizes the chattels in the possession of a mortgagor is, as to the true owner, the mortgagee, such stranger, unless he shall make it appear that the writ of fieri facias under which he seized the goods issued upon a judgment obtained against the mortgagor at the suit of a creditor against whom the mortgage was fraudulent and void under the statute as conveyances fraudulent against creditors. In Ruttan v. Beamish (3) the point did not arise at all; that was an action of detinue and trover brought by a mortgagor of chattels against the mortgagee after default, which, of course, could not be maintained unless after the default the mortgage had been discharged by payment in full. In neither of those cases was it necessary to decide what was the right of the mortgagor to the possession of the goods as against the mortgagee before default.\nThe authorities in England, are to my mind, conclusive that in a mortgage of personal chattels there may be an implied contract that the mortgagor shall remain in possession until default of equal efficacy as an express clause to that effect (4); and that such an implied contract necessarily arises from the nature of the instrument unless it be very expressly excluded by its terms. In Wheeler v. Montefiore ([29]) there was a proviso in the mortgage that on non-payment of the mortgage debt on the 24th June following it should be lawful for the mortgagee to enter upon the premises where the chattels mortgaged were and to sell them; there was no provision that the mortgagor should retain possession until default. Lord Denman in giving judgment says ([30])\u2014\nThere is no covenant that Franks (the mortgagor) shall continue in possession until the 24th June, but looking at the whole deed we are of opinion that the plaintiff\u2019s right to take possession did not attach until the 24th June.\nHereby clearly determining that a right to retain possession may by implication arise from the terms of the deed as effectually as if there were in it an express redemise clause. So in Albert v. Grosvenor Investment Company ([31]) Cockburn C.J. says ([32]):\u2014\nThis is the case of a mortgage whereby the mortgagor transfers the property in certain goods to the mortgagees, but subject to the mortgagor\u2019s right of redemption, and there are certain clauses in the deed, the result of which is that the mortgagees cannot seize and sell the goods unless the mortgagor makes default in paying the instalments of \u00a32, which he is bound to do each successive Monday.\nAnd Lush J. ([33]) says:\u2014\nIt is also true the property in the goods passed by the deed to the mortgagees, but though it is not specially said so in the deed the mortgagor had clearly reserved to him a special property in the goods until he had made default, and he had, therefore, a right of action for seizing and selling the goods without default.\nIn ex parte Allard ([34]), Lord Justice James referring to the deed then before the court which was a composition deed says:\u2014\nIt appears to me that we must decide this case upon a consideration of what was the real and true bargain between the parties at the time when the arrangement for a composition was made. What was it they meant to do and did do in substance and intention? It appears to me that what they intended was this, that in consideration of the composition the business was to be carried on by the son alone (not by the mother) in the usual way in which such business is carried on, and that in carrying it on he was to exercise such a control over the assets as would enable him to raise money for the purpose of paying the composition. It would be utterly inconsistent with this intention that the debtors should have no power to deal with the trade debts which were then outstanding. An implied authority was given to deal with them to that extent. All that it is necessary for us to say is that the implied authority given to the debtors goes to the extent of authorizing any dealing with the assets in the ordinary course of business or for the purpose of raising money to carry on the business or to pay the composition.\nThe learned Chief Justice in the court below holds this language to be applicable to a composition deed only and not to apply to a chattel mortgage of his stock in trade executed by a trader, but this distinction, as it appears to me, rests upon no foundation, for the ordinary object and intent of a trader in executing a chattel mortgage upon his stock in trade, upon getting an extension of time for the payment of his debt to the wholesale trader with whom he deals, is to enable him to continue carrying on his trade in the ordinary course of business until the day named in the mortgage for payment of his debt equally as such is the object and intent in the case of a composition deed. I can see no distinction whatever in substance between the two cases and the language of the learned judges in the Court of Appeal in ex parte Allard ([35]) is, in my opinion, equally applicable to the present case.\nSo in National Mercantile Bank v. Hampson ([36]), in which the point came up on the pleadings the defence having been specially pleaded, the mortgagee of chattels brought an action of trover against a purchaser of some of the goods from the mortgagor and the defendant pleaded that he bought the goods in the ordinary course of business and without notice that they were not the property of the vendor. Lush J. held the defence good, saying:\u2014\nHaving regard to the terms of the bill of sale there was an implied license for the grantor to carry on his business * * * and any bond fide purchaser from him would have a good title.\nSo in Walker v. Clay (1), Grove J. says:\nThe object of the bill of sale is to permit the t grantor to carry on his business of an inn keeper and horse-dealer, and it must therefore be taken to have contemplated this sale. In his character of publican the grantor would of course be entitled, and the bill of sale must be taken to have intended him to be entitled, to sell wine and beer to his customers.\nAnd Lindley X says:\nThe object of the bill of sale is obviously not to paralyze the trade of the grantor, but to enable him to carry on his trade, and the bill of sale would be worthless if we were to construe it otherwise.\nAnd he concludes by saying that the title of the defendant who was a purchaser from the grantor of the bill of some of the chattels covered thereby is, to his mind, an extension of the doctrine that a bona fide purchaser for value without notice is to be protected. This observation was simply an enunciation of the principle upon which a purchase of personal chattels from one who has the possession of them only, the property in them being in another, can be maintained against the true owner, and he says in substance that one who purchases bond fide from a trader goods in the ordinary course of the trader\u2019s business stands in the position well known in equity of a bona fide purchaser for value without notice. But this exposition of the principle upon which a purchase of chattels from a mortgagor in possession is maintained against the true owner does not at all detract from the weight of the decisions which hold that an implied right for a mortgagor of chattels to continue in the exercise of his business, and to sell the chattels mortgaged in the ordinary course of business, may be gathered from the terms of the instrument, not can it be construed as qualifying the judgment of Lindley J. himself in that very case that the grantor of the bill of sale then before him had such an implied right, and that the court could not hold otherwise without making the bill of sale worthless. It was the fact of the sale having been made in the ordinary course of the grantor\u2019s business that, although there was no express proviso in the instrument that he might continue to carry on his business, made the purchaser\u2019s title good although the vendor had not the property in the thing sold. Upon this principle it was also held in Taylor v. McKeand ([37]) that a purchase from a trader, a mortgagor of goods, which the jury found to have been sold with a fraudulent intent by the mortgagor and not in the ordinary course of business, could not maintain title against the mortgagee although the purchaser was ignorant of the fraud and bought bond fide\u2014thus showing that the title of the purchaser depends on the fact of the sale to him being made in the ordinary course of the vendor\u2019s business. A trader, mortgagor in possession of chattels, has no right whatever to sell otherwise than in the ordinary course of his business, but to sell in the ordinary course of his business he has, from the very nature of a chattel mortgage and the purpose for which it has come into use among traders. So that on a sale made in the former case a purchaser cannot acquire title but in the latter he can. Payne v. Fern (2) is precisely to the same effect.\nThese authorities abundantly establish that a right of the mortgagor to retain possession of the mortgaged property until default may be gathered by implication from the terms of the instrument as well as from an express proviso contained therein.\nIn construing the mortgage before us we must bear in mind that the usual intent and common object of the mortgage of the stock in trade of a trader being executed by him is not to effect a winding up of his business, or as Lindley J. expresses it in Walker v. Clay \u201cto paralyse his trade,\u201d but to enable him to carry on his business in the ordinary course of his trade until default in payment of his debt on the day named in the mortgage for that purpose. In the present case the evidence expressly states that to have been the object and intent of the mortgagors, but apart from this evidence we must regard them as having executed the mortgage with that object and intent which is the usual and natural object and intent of traders in such cases. It was because these instruments had come into use among traders without a transfer of the possession to the mortgagee, the mortgagor still continuing to carry on his trade disposing of his stock in trade as before, that the Legislature of Canada, as far back as the year 1849, passed an act which, with certain amendments made thereto, is still in force, prescribing the contents and mode for the execution and registration of those instruments\u2014that is to say\u2014mortgages of chattels not accompanied with an actual and continued change of possession, to make them valid as against creditors of the mortgagors or subsequent purchasers or mortgagees in good faith. It was because of the common use of those instruments by traders as security to their creditors while the mortgagor traders continued in possession of the chattels mortgaged, carrying on their trade, disposing of their stock mortgaged as before, that the Legislature interposed to regulate the instruments as to their contents, their mode of execution and their registration, and ever since they have become a common assurance in use between traders, and recognized by the Legislature for the express purpose of enabling the trader debtor to continue carrying on his business, disposing of his stock in trade in the ordinary course of his business until default, while vesting the property in the stock in trade in the mortgage creditor, giving him a security in preference to other creditors. A similar statute, apparently copied in great measure from the Canada Statute, was passed by the Legislature of Manitoba in 1875. It is, however, contended that by reason of the clause as to the mortgagee taking possession not being limited to the case of default in payment of the mortgage debt, but in the same sentence providing also that \u201cin case of default in the payment of the said sum of money in the proviso mentioned or of interest thereon or in case the mortgagor shall attempt to sell or dispose of or in any way part with the possession of the said goods and chattels or any of them or to remove the same or any part thereof out of the said store (or) suffer or permit the same to be seized or taken in execution without the consent of the mortgagee, his executors, &c, to such sale, removal or disposal thereof first had and obtained in writing,\u201d &c, that the effect of this proviso is that although the mortgagor is entitled to retain possession of the goods until the time specified for payment of the mortgage debt; if he should do nothing whatever with them and in fact ceases carrying on his business, he loses all right to possession of the goods if he presumes to continue his business and attempts to sell a single article in the ordinary course of his trade without such consent in writing of the mortgagee. So to hold would be to defeat the intent and object of the mortgagors in executing the mortgage, and would not only have the effect of utterly paralysing their trade but would leave them completely at the mercy of the mortgagee, and would convert the instrument from its well known character of a security intended to enable the mortgagors to continue carrying on their business as before until the time specified for payment of the mortgage debt, into an instrument designed to enable the mortgagee, at his own sole will and pleasure to wind up the trader\u2019s business, for the \u2018 mortgagee might altogether refuse his consent to the business being carried on, or might withhold it unless the mortgagors should consent not to purchase any new goods, not to replenish their stock, and to pay over daily to the mortgagee every cent to be realized from the sale of the mortgaged stock, and thus compel the mortgagors to submit to wholly new terms, quite different from the arrangement, contained not only in the chattel mortgage but also in the mortgage on realty, that the mortgagors should have until the 1st March, 1884, to pay their debt. There is no more efficacy in the word \u201c sell\u201d in the clause under consideration than in the words \u201c dispose of,\u201d and \u201c removal \u201d is but a mode of \u201c disposing of,\u201d Having regard, therefore, to the character of the instrument, and to the fact that its well known and recognized use among traders is to enable the trader, mortgagor, to continue carrying on his trade, these words \u201c sell or \u201cdispose of\u201d in the connection in which they are used in the clause under consideration, which is the ordinary form that has always been in use, must be construed in the same sense as the words coupled with them, viz; \u201cor remove them or any of them out of the said store, or part with the possession of them or any of them, or permit or suffer them to be seized in execution,\u201d and to be intended to prohibit only any sale or disposition of the goods other than in the ordinary course of business, and the doing of any thing which might prejudice the mortgagees\u2019 right to take possession upon default in payment at the time specified as by removal to another place which would defeat the mortgage altogether unless some new provision should be made; for the description of the goods mortgaged, and the only mode of identification of them provided by the mortgage is in the store of the mortgagors where they were when the mortgage was executed; or by suffering the goods to be taken in execution which might expose the mortgagee to litigation, but to permit the mortgagors to carry on their business and to sell the stock in trade in the ordinary course, as is usual among traders executing such instruments; any other construction would defeat the plain object of the mortgagors in executing the instrument and the very purpose for which the instrument has come into use as a commercial security; it would be also contrary to the plain intention of the mortgagee in the present case, for the defendant, Ashdown, while his legal agent McDonald was in treaty with the plaintiffs for security for their debt, writes a letter to them in answer to one received from them wherein he says:\u2014\nI note what you say re goods but as the amount now owing by you to this firm and to Ashdown & Co. is so much in excess of what I intended, I will simply hold your order in hand and be prepared to ship immediately that I hear you have came to satisfactory arrangements with McDonald re the past.\nTrusting this will be satisfactory and that your utmost expectations re the fall trade may be realized, I remain, &c.\nJust consider to what extent the defendants\u2019 contention now goes\u2014that although they had taken as part of the security which constituted one transaction a mortgage upon real estate which had cost the plaintiffs $1,040, and upon which there remained due upon a prior mortgage only the sum of $120 with some interest thereon, and had taken a mortgage upon the whole of the plaintiffs\u2019 stock in trade of about the value of the whole of the mortgage debt, viz., $847, still if the plaintiff should, after executing these mortgages, proceed to sell a single thing in the ordinary course of their trade the mortgagee might instantly enter the plaintiffs\u2019 shop and take and sell the whole of their stock in trade and receive the proceeds on account of the debt which by the terms of the mortgage on the real estate as well as of the chattel mortgage was not payable until the 1st March, 1884. In fact that by giving these two mortgages the traders had only acquired the right of keeping their stock in trade insured upon the shelves in their shop, unsold unless, in order to obtain permission to sell in the ordinary course of their trade, they should submit to such other terms, however extravagant, the mortgagee should insist upon. Can it be supposed that any persons in their senses could have executed those instruments which the plaintiffs\u2019 executed with that intent or that the defendants could have received them as executed with that intent?\nThe only construction that the clause under consideration can, in my judgment, receive, is that the qualification as to the mortgagors\u2019 right to \u201c sell and dispose of \u201c the goods mortgaged is that if sold otherwise than in the ordinary course of business the mortgagee might enter, &c, and that they had a perfect right to sell in the ordinary course of their trade.\nThere is but one other point in the judgment of the court below requiring to be noticed. The case of the defendants now attempting to set up rights which they claim to have under the chattel mortgage in justification of the acts committed by them, after having failed on their justification under the writs of fieri facias upon the sufficiency of which they rested to the last moment, is compared to the case of a master having said that he dismissed his servant for one cause which would have been insufficient, resting upon a different cause on an action being brought for a wrongful dismissal. But there is no analogy whatever between the two cases. There is no question here as to the right in which the defendants merely said that they acted\u2014the question is not as to what the defendants may have said at different times, different from the defence now set up, but as to what they did in point of fact, which they have also pleaded by way of justification upon the record and as to which there is no dispute or contradiction whatever. The fact is undisputed that the goods in question were seized and taken from the plaintiffs\u2019 possession and sold only under one authority, namely, the writs of fieri facias under which the defendants justified; that is an act of the defendants, not an assertion merely; it is an act which now that it has been established in evidence cannot be got over or laid aside and the sole question is: Was that act justified? It was a seizure in plain disregard of the chattel mortgage and inconsistent with it. There is no pretence that the goods were ever seized or taken under the powers contained in the chattel mortgage. If they had been taken under it they would have been taken as the property of the mortgagee, the defendant Ashdown alone, the plaintiffs\u2019 right to retain possession of which had been forfeited for violation of the terms upon which they were left in their possession. If that had been the ground of defence it must have been specially pleaded as justifying under a forfeiture insisted upon as having been incurred by the misconduct of the plaintiffs, and Ashdown alone as mortgagee could have set up that justification, and the other defendant as his servant which also would have required a special plea. But, it is useless to refer to the mode in which such a defence could be set up, as the act which is complained of, namely, the seizure which has been proved to have been authorized only by the writs of fieri facias and was in point of fact only made under them was not authorized by the chattel mortgage. Seizure under the writs was in violation of the chattel mortgage, and was in fact a repudiation of it, for being taken under executions issued upon judgments obtained by the defendants the goods were by the defendants themselves authorized to be seized as the property of the plaintiffs to satisfy the execution which the defendant Ashdown swore issued in the ordinary course, and so for the purpose of thereby realizing satisfaction of judgment debts by sale of property thus admitted to be the property of the plaintiffs, a position quite at variance with the defendants or either of them having title to, and property in, the goods under the mortgage. In fact the act of seizure and sale under the writ of fieri facias is now as much unauthorized by and in violation of the chattel mortgage as it was when the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench in Manitoba (which now by its judgment holds that act to have been authorized by the chattel mortgage) set aside the writs as in violation of the mortgages executed by the plaintiffs and in breach of the agreement contained therein.\nThe appeal must be allowed with costs. But as to the damages. The jury have found the value of the goods to have been at the time of the seizure $986. This may be a large estimate, but I do not think we could interfere with the finding of the jury upon that point. The only amount realized by the sheriff\u2019s sale has been $256. Upon the above estimate of the value of the goods seized and wrongfully sold, the plaintiffs would be entitled to $730, but the jury by their verdict have given to the plaintiffs $1,484 as for damages which by their answers to the questions put to them is plainly intended to be in excess of the whole of the plaintiffs\u2019 debt to the defendants jointly and to Ashdown alone of $852. I do not see how it is to be made to appear upon the record in this case that the amount of $1,484 for which alone judgment could be entered upon their verdict against the defendants jointly, is in excess of the judgment debts due to the defendants jointly, and to the defendant Ashdown alone, so as to give to the plaintiffs the benefit intended by the jury\u2014which would entitle them to have satisfaction entered on all the judgments and a release also of the real estate mortgage. These judgment debts have in fact, so far as we know, been satisfied only to the extent of $256 realized by the sheriff\u2019s sale. If the defendants have realized anything out of the real estate mortgaged, the amount, if any, so realized should not be deducted from the amount to be recovered in this action. I think, therefore, the better way to deal with the case will be to render a verdict for the plaintiffs for the difference between the sum of $256 realized by the sheriff\u2019s sale and the true value as found by the jury of the goods so sold and for such further amount as may be reasonable for the wrongful act of the defendants, leaving them to apply for a remedy by way of set off or otherwise to have allowed to them so much of the said several judgment debts as may really remain due after giving credit to the plaintiffs for the said sum of $266 realized by the sheriff\u2019s sale, and such other sums, if any, as may have been realized out of the mortgaged real estate or any other estate of the plaintiffs. The equities between the parties as to entering satisfaction of the judgments and the release of the mortgage of the real estate can thus at the least possible expense be effectually disposed of.\nThe damages of $1,350 awarded by the jury cannot, I think, be sustained\u2014that sum does not seem to be warranted by any just and rational view of the evidence. Ample justice would I think be done by a verdict for the plaintiffs for $1,000, and if the plaintiffs will consent to a rule to be drawn up upon their consent, for the verdict, being reduced to that amount upon the footing above stated as to the defendants setting off against that verdict the balance remaining due in respect of the three above named debts of the plaintiffs to the defendants jointly and to the defendant Ashdown alone, after giving credit to the plaintiffs as above mentioned, then the rule for a new trial in the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench, in Manitoba, to be discharged with costs, but if the plaintiffs will not so consent then that rule to be made absolute for a new trial for excessive damages upon payment of costs.\nIn setting off the mortgage debt it is to cease to carry interest upon and from the day upon which the verdict was rendered.\nThe reduction of the judgment by such set-off will, of course, not prejudice the plaintiffs\u2019 right to full costs in the action.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellants: Ewart, Fisher & Wilson.\nSolicitors for respondents: Biggs & Dawson.\n[1] 4 Man.

Q.) \u2014Constitutionality of \u2014 43 Vic. ch. 19 (D).\nThe inspector of licenses for the revenue district of Montreal charged R. a drayman in the employ of J. H. R. M. & Bros., duly licensed brewers under the Dominion Statutes, 43 Vie. ch. 19, before the court of Special Sessions of the Peace at Montreal with haying sold beer outside the business premises of J. H. R. M. & Bros., but within the said revenue district in contravention of the Quebec License Act, 1878, and its amendments, and asked a condemnation of $95 and costs against R. for said offence. Thereupon J. H. R. M. & Bros, and R., claiming inter alia that being licensed brewers under the Dominion Statute, they had a right of selling beer by and through their employees and draymen without a provincial license, and that 41 Vie. ch. 3 (P. Q.) and its amendments were ultra sires, and if constitutional did not authorize his complaint against R.. caused a writ of prohibition to be issued out of the Superior Court enjoining the court of Special Sessions of the Peace from further proceeding with the complaint against R.\nHeld Per Ritchie O.J. and Strong, Fournier and Henry JJ., that the Quebec License Act and its amendments were intra sires and that the court of Special Sessions of the Peace at Montreal having jurisdiction to try the alleged offence and being the proper tribunal to decide the question of facts and of law involved, a writ of prohibition did not lie.\nPer Taschereau and Gwynne J J., that the case was one which it was proper for the Superior Court to deal with by proceedings on prohibition.\nPer Gwynne J. The Quebec License Act of 1878 imposes no obligation upon brewers to take out a provincial license to enable them to sell their beer, and therefore the court of Special Sessions of the Peace had no jurisdiction and prohibition should issue absolutely. APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada (Appeal side) ([1]) affirming the judgment of the Superior Court ([2]).\nThe proceedings in this case were commenced before the Court of Special Sessions of the Peace sitting in the city and district of Montreal by the issue of a summons and complaint by M. C. Desnoyers, Esq., Police Magistrate, against the appellant Andrew Ryan, upon the complaint of the present respondent, W. B. Lambe, Esq., Inspector of Licenses for the Revenue District of Montreal, charging the said Andrew Ryan with having sold intoxicating liquors without a license.\nThe declaration is as follows;\n\"William Busby Lambe de la cite de Montr\u00e9al dans le district de Montreal Inspecteur des Licences pour le District du Revenu de Montr\u00e9al au nom de Notre Souveraine Dame La Reine poursuit Andrew Ryan de la cite de Montr\u00e9al dans le dit district de Montr\u00e9al commer\u00e7ant.\n\"Attendu que le dit Andrew Ryan n'etant muni d'aucune licence pour la vente de liqueurs enivrantes en quelque quantite que ce soit, a, en la dite cite de Montr\u00e9al dans le district du Revenu de Montr\u00e9al, dans le dit district de Montreal, le sixieme pour de juin en l'annee mil huit cent quatre-vingt deux et a diff\u00e9rentes reprises avant et depuis, vendu de la liqueur enivrante contrairement au Statut fait et pourvu en pareil cas: Par lequel et en vertu du dit Statut le dit Andrew Ryan est devenu possible du paiement de la somme de quatre-vingt-quinze piastres courant.\n\"En consequence le dit Inspecteur des Licenses de-mande que jugement soit rendu sur les premises et que le dit Andrew Ryan soit condamn\u00e9 a payer la somme de quatre-vingt quinze piastres courant, pour la dite offense avec les frais.\" And the summons is as follows:\nCanada,\nProvince de Qu\u00e8bec,\nDistrict de Montreal,\nCite de Montr\u00e8al\n\"A Andrew Ryan, cormorant de la cite de Montr\u00e9al, dans le district du Revenu de Montr\u00e9al: \u2014\nLes pr\u00e9sentes sont pour vous enjoinder d\u2019\u00eatre et de comparaitre devant moi le soussign\u00e9 Mathias Charles Desnoyers, Ecuyer, Magistrat de Police pour le district de Montr\u00e8al a une Session de la Cour des Sessions Sp\u00e9ciales de la Paix, qui se tiendra au Palais de Justice en la cite de Montr\u00e9al dans le dit district, le quinzeme jour de juin courant a dix heures de l'avant midi ou devant tel Juge de Paix ou Juges de Paix pour le dit district, qui sera ou seront alors present, ou presents, aux fins de r\u00e9pondre a la plainte port\u00e8e con tre vous par William Busby Lambe, Ecuyer, de la cite de Montr\u00e9al dans le district de Montr\u00e9al Inspecteur des Licences pour le district du Revenu de Montreal, qui vous poursuit au nom et de la part de Sa Majeste, pour les causes mentionn\u00e8es dans la declaration ciannex\u00e9e; autrement jugement sera rendu contre vous par d\u00e9faut.\n[L S.] Donn\u00e8 sous mon seing et sceau ce dixi\u00e8me jour de Jour dans l'annee de Notre Seigneur mil huit cent quatre-vingt-deux au Bureau de Police dans la cite de Montr\u00e8al dans le district susdit.\n(Signe) M.

That during\" the whole of the said term and up to the pre sent time it has always been the custom and usage of trade of brewers to send around through the country their drays with beer which beer was sold by their draymen during their trips to the said customers.\n\"That on the occasion charged in the said information the said defendant was a servant and drayman of the said from of J.

M.\nBefore any decision was given in this case, which is still under advisement, J. H. R. Molson, J. T. Molson and Andrew Ryan doing business under the firm of JL H. R. Molson & Bros., applied by petition to the Superior Court for a writ of prohibition to prohibit the said M C. Desnoyers, Police Magistrate, from further proceeding upon the said summons and complaint, on the ground that Ryan committed no offence whatever against any act of the local legislature:-\n(a) Because there is no act of the legislature of the Province of Quebec, which authorizes the said complaint and prosecution.\n(b.) Because the pretended act of the legislature, upon which such prosecution is founded is not an act of the legislature of the Province of Quebec, but purports to have been made and enacted by Her Majesty the Queen, Her Majesty the Queen having no right or title to pass acts binding on the Province of Quebec.\n(c) Because the pretended act intituled The Quebec License Law of 1878,\" under which the said prosecution is instituted, is entirely illegal, null and void and unconstitutional, the same not being passed by the proper body gifted with legislative powers upon the subject in the Province of Quebec.\n(d) Because the said act purports to treat of and regulate criminal procedure.\n(e.) .Because the penal clause is by fine and imprisonment.\n(f) Because your said petitioner Andrew Ryan being in the employ and being the drayman of your other petitioners, and acting under their orders, the act of your petitioner Ryan selling the said intoxicating liquor, to wit, beer, 'was the act of your other petitioners, co-partners, who in their license from the Government of the Dominion of Canada, were authorized and empowered so to sell such intoxicating liquor.\n(g.) Because your said petitioners, co-partners, being licensed brewers, had the right of selling by and through their employees. and draymen, without any further license whatsoever under the provisions of the Quebec License Act of 1878.\n(h.) Because the Legislature of the Province of Quebec have no right whatsoever to limit or interfere with the traffic of brewers duly licensed by the Government of Canada\nThat under these circumstances the said court of Special Sessions of the Peace and the said Mathias C. Desnoyers have unlawfully and improperly taken jurisdiction over the said Andrew Ryan, your petitioner, and the other petitioners, and that it has become necessary for them for their own preservation to apply for a writ of prohibition to prohibit the said court of Special Sessions of the Peace, sitting at the said city of Montreal, and the said Mathias C. Desnoyers from taking jurisdiction over them your petitioners, and further proceedings on the said summons and complaint.\nThe respondent, in his quality of inspector of licenses, intervened to support the complaint and; to contest the writ of prohibition, and after issue joined and admissions filed by the parties of the matters of fact set forth in the proceedings, the Superior Court held that the Quebec License Act of 1878 stud, its amendments were constitutional stud, that a writ of prohibition did not lie on appeal to the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada (Appeal side) the judgment of the Superior Court was confirmed, but the holding that prohibition did not lie was reversed.\nW. H. Kerr Q.C. for the appellants and Geoffrion Q. C. and N, H. Bourgonin for the respondent.\nIn addition to the points of argument and authorities relied on in the court below ([3]) the learned counsel for the appellants cited Lloyd on Prohibition ([4]); High on Mandamus ([5]); and counsel for the respondent cited Simard v. corporation du cornte de Montmorency ([6]); High on Extraordinary Legal Remedies ([7]); Griffith v. Rioux ([8]); Dion v. Chauveau ([9]); and Lapointe v. Doyon ([10]); Cot\u00e9 v. Paradis ([11]).\nSIR W. J. RITCHIE C.J. In view of the cases determined by the Privy Council, since the case of Severn v. The Queen ([12]) was decided in this court, which appear to me to have established conclusively that the right and power to legislate in relation to the issue of licenses for the sale of intoxicating liquors by whole sale and retail belong to the local legislature, we are bound to hold that the Quebec License Act of 1878, and its amendments are valid and constitutional. By that act sec. 2 the sale of intoxicating liquors without license obtained from the government is forbidden. By section 1 the words \" intoxicating liquors \" mean inter alia ale, beer lager, &c. Section 71 provides, that whosoever without license sells in any quantity whatsoever intoxicating liquors in any part of this province muni cipally organized is liable to a fine of $95.00 if such contravention takes place in the City of Montreal. And section 196 of 41 Vic. ch. 3, provides for the courts which shall have power to try actions or prosecutions for breach of this law in these words:\nAll actions or prosecutions where the amount claimed does not exceed one hundred dollars, may be, optionally with the prosecutors, brought before the Circuit Court, but without any right of evocation therefrom to the Superior Court or before two Justices of the Peace in the judicial district or before the judge of the sessions of the peace or before the court of the recorder or of the police magistrate or before the district magistrate; but if the amount claimed exceeds one hundred dollars they shall be brought before the Circuit Court or the Superior Court, according to the competency of the court, with reference to the amount claimed.\nThe code of procedure by article 1031 provides for the issue of writs of prohibition in these words; Writs of prohibition are addressed to courts of inferior jurisdiction whenever they exceed their jurisdiction.\"\nThe only question that I can discover that we have to determine in this case is: Had the police magistrate before whom the complaint was made by the inspector of licenses for the district of Montreal and who issued the summons in this case jurisdiction over the matter of this complaint and jurisdiction and authority to try the offence charged in the declaration or information and summons? If he had, no prohibition in my opinion can be awarded. On this point, it seems to me, the authorities are clear and conclusive. In the Mayor of London v. Cox ([13]) Wiles J. delivering the opinion of the judges in the House of Lords says:\u2014\nIn cases where there is jurisdiction over the subject matter, pro libation will not go for mere irregularity in the proceedings, or even a wrong decision of the merits, Blaquiere v Hawkins ([14])\nAnd again he says:\u2014\nThe proceeding in prohibition, therefore, does not stand upon the footing of an action for a wrong in a prohibition for want of juris diction for the question is not whether the party or the court has done a wilful wrong but whether the court has or has not jurisdiction.\" Rde v. Jackson ([15]).\nAnd again:\nThe law upon this question of discretion is thus stated in the judgment of the Queen's Bench, in Burder v. Veley ([16]) Ig called upon we are bound to issue a writ of prohibition as soon as we are duly Informed that any court of inferior jurisdiction has committed such a fault as to found our authority to prohibit, though there may be a possibility of correcting it by appeal\nThe question then remains, what are the defects that authorize and require us to issue the writ of prohibition? The answer is, that they are in every case of such a nature as to show a want of jurisdiction to decide the case before them Gardner v Booth ([17]) In whatever stage a that fact is made manifest to us either the crown or one of its subjects, we are bound to interpose.\nLord Cranworth says ([18]), delivering judgment in the House of Lords in the same case:\nWhere an inferior court is proceeding in a cause which arises on a subject over which it has jurisdiction, no prohibition can be awarded till the party sued in the inferior court sets up a defence on some ground raising an issue which the inferior court is incompetent to try. Until that is done no ground for prohibition has been shewn.\nProhibitions by law are to be granted at any time to restrain a court to intermeddle with or execute any-thing which by law they ought not to hold the plea of ([19]). In Toft v. Reyner ([20]) it was held that the court had no power to issue a prohibition to the judge of a county court, in a matter that was within his jurisdiction. In this case it was stated that the plaintiff had already recovered judgment against the defendant in an action for the same debt in the borough court of Cambridge, and that his goods had been taken and sold under that judgment and the plaintiff who was present admitted such statement to be true. A prohibition was moved for to restrain the county court judge on the ground that the matter being res judicata he had no jurisdiction, that his jurisdiction ceased when the defendant's plea was admitted to be true, but per Wilde C.J.'.\u2014\nWhether the plea was good, or bad was a matter of law which, he J was bound to decide and his decision was final.\nAdding:\nA mistake in that respect would, ordinarily speaking, be matter of error; but the act creating these county courts has taken away that form of remedy: there is no ground therefore, for granting a prohibition, which lies only where the inferior court has assumed to to act without or beyond its jurisdiction.\nAnd Maule J. says:\u2014\nThis might have been error if the writ of error had not been taken away in these cases \u2022 and that shows that it is not ground for a prohibition.\nAnd Williams J. says '.\nI am of the same opinion. The ground of this application is neither more or less than that the judge of the county court, in deciding what it was competent for him to decide, has made a mistake in point of law and that clearly is not a case in which prohibition lies.\nIn Ellis v. Watt ([21]) per Maule J:\nYour application is for a prohibition which can only be granted when the inferior court had not jurisdiction to proceed,\nWrits of prohibition are, therefore, framed to restrain inferior courts in cases where the cognizance of the matter belongs not to such courts, but, this is the first time I have heard it propounded that they can be used to restrain courts from intermeddling with matters over which they are specially authorized to take cognizance and hold plea. Can there be a doubt as to the Police Magistrate having authority to hear and determine this matter? If so how is it possible for the Police Magistrate to decide whether or not there was a breach of the License Law by the sale of intoxicating liquors without license contrary to the provisions of the Quebec License Act until he hears the case? If the defendant's contentions are correct, which I more than doubt and he establishes them before the Police Magistrate, he will have furnished a defence and be entitled to acquittal. If not correct and the recorder holds they do not amount to a defence he will be bound to convict and the defendant will be left to any remedy he may have by way of appeal or otherwise as he may be advised. It was in my opinion unquestionably for the Police Magistrate to say whether the sale if proved was lawful or unlawful which question it is clear is quite impossible for him to determine without hearing the case, and whether his determination was right or wrong either in matter of law or of fact, it was no question of jurisdiction. The justice may give an erroneous decision either of law or of fact or of both though no person has a right to assume that he will do so, and if he does, if he acts within his jurisdiction his decision is conclusive, unless appealed against, and Whether appealable or not it is no case for \"prohibition\nTo determine, in the case before us, whether Ryan has been guilty of a breach of the license act, questions of fact as well as of law are by defendant's own showing, necessarily involved, the determination of which is now in progress of trial before a tribunal having jurisdiction over the subject matter in controversy, and the only ground on which prohibition appears to me to be asked is the assumption that the judge will decide, not only the questions of law, but those of fact incorrectly against the defendant. There certainly is no usurpation of jurisdiction in this case and no issue which the inferior court is incompetent to try; on the contrary, the only issue in the case namely whether the defendant was, or was not, guilty of selling liquor without a license, contrary to the provisions of the Quebec license act of 1878, could only be tried under and by virtue of the section before referred to and under which section, in my opinion, M. C. Desnoyers the police magistrate, had unquestionable jurisdiction and constituted the legal and proper tribunal to deal with any alleged infringement of the said act, and therefore no cause is shown to justify the issue of a writ of prohibition, and this appeal should be dismissed with costs\nSTRONG J.-Apart altogether from the reasons given by the Court of Appeal, and from the other points raised and argued here, and exclusively for the reasons and upon the authorities stated and referred to by me in a judgment delivered in the case of Poulin v. Quebec ([22]) to which I now desire to add a reference to the cases and authorities collected in Short on Information\u2019s ([23]), a work recently published, I am of opinion that a writ of prohibition did not lie in the present case and that this appeal should therefore be dismissed with costs.\nFOURNIER J.

Molson & Brothers, doing business as brewers under a license as such brewers from the Dominion Government to sell the liquors brewed and manufactured by them at Montreal.\nThe questions to be decided in the action were arranged to be submitted for the decision of the justice who issued the writ, and were substantially embodied in admissions signed by the counsel of both parties, and are in substance the points raised by the pleas in this action.\nThe case was submitted for the consideration of the justice, but before any decision by him a writ of prohibition was issued by the Superior Court; and, after argument before that court, the learned judge decided substantially that the local license act of 1878, did not supersede the act of the Dominion as to brewers' licenses, and that Ryan was justified in selling beer as he did but inasmuch as the justice had jurisdiction to decide the matters of fact and law and that as the decision of the justice could be reviewed by a higher court by means of a writ of certiorari the court quashed the writ of prohibition. That judgment was affirmed but apparently for other reasons, by the Court of Appeal at Montreal, and from the latter judgment an appeal was taken to this court.\nThe question then is as to the applicability of the writ of prohibition to the circumstances of this case\nThe writ of prohibition is an extraordinary judicial writ issuing out of a court of a superior jurisdiction and directed to an inferior court for the purpose of preventing the inferior tribunal from usurping a jurisdiction with which it is not legally vested. It is an original remedial writ, and is the remedy afforded by the common law against the incroachments of jurisdiction by inferior courts; and is used to keep such courts within the limits and bounds prescribed for them by law. Such being the object, and I may say the only one, it should be upheld where it can be legitimately employed.\nBlackstone says: ([26]).\nA prohibition is a writ issuing properly out of the Court of King's Bench, being the King's prerogative writ, but for the furtherance of justice it may be now also had in some cases out of the Court of Chancery Common Pleas or Exchequer, directed to the judge and parties of a suit in any inferior court commanding them to cease from the prosecution thereof upon suggestion that either the cause originally or some 'collateral matter arising therein does not belong to that jurisdiction but to the cognizance of some other court.\nHigh on Extraordinary Remedies ([27]) says;\nThe court does not lie for grievances which may be redressed in the ordinary course of judicial proceedings. * * Nor is it a writ of right granted ex dubito justitiae, but rather one of sound judicial discretion, to be granted or withheld according to the circumstances of each particular case. Nor should it be granted except in a clear case of want of jurisdiction in the court whose action it is sought to prohibit.\nOn an application for the writ the want of jurisdiction about to be exercised should be clearly shown and regardless of the law and facts to be considered by the court sought to be prohibited the sole question is as to its \"jurisdiction to deal with them. If that is not clearly shown the issue of the writ would be unjustifiable.\nI have carefully considered the petition for the writ of prohibition in this case and the admissions of the counsel but neither contains any allegation of the want of jurisdiction of the justice who issued the writ between the original parties and therefore it must be presumed that such, jurisdiction existed. See Short on Prohibition ([28]). If so, there is no justification shown for the issue of the writ of prohibition, Besides I hold that under the law the justice before whom the case was originally brought had ample jurisdiction to try all the issues raised before him, and no court by prohibition could prevent him from the performance of the duty imposed upon him by law by a decision on the of fact and law involved.\nAfter his decision a review of it may be had by a Superior Court as pointed out in the judgment of the Superior Court; but under the law as to the writ of prohibition that writ could not be interposed even if his judgment would be unappeasable or could not in any way be reviewed by a higher court.\nI will not discuss the merits of the case as between the original parties, as they should in the first place be disposed of by the justice, the only tribunal, in my opinion, at present having power to deal with them\u00bb I think therefore the appeal in this case should be dismissed and the judgments of the two courts below affirmed with costs.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014Upon the question of prohibition I dissent from the majority of the court and I think with the court below that the writ of prohibition lies in such, a case as the present. It will be remarked that although the judgment of the Court of. Queen's Bench is reversed on the question of prohibition yet the appellant fails on his appeal.\nOn the merits of the case the majority of the court being of opinion that no writ of prohibition lies in the present case it is useless for me and I think wrong to express an opinion, as what I would say about it would be merely obiter dictum. GWYNNE J. The questions involved, in this case are.\n1. As to the procedure by writ of prohibition according to the law prevailing in the Province of Quebec; and\n2. As to the proper determination, upon the merits, of the issue joined in the proceedings in prohibition, this latter question depending upon the validity and construction of an act of the legislature of the Province.\nThe judgment of Willes J. delivering the unanimous opinion of the judges consulted by the House of Lords in The Mayor of London v. Cox ([29]) and which is an authoritative and almost an exhaustive treatise upon all questions of prohibition under the law of England, affirms as well established law that the courts that may award prohibition being informed either by the parties themselves or by any stranger that any court temporal or ecclesiastical, doth hold plea of that whereof they have no jurisdiction, may lawfully prohibit the same as well after judgment and execution as before; that in whatever stage of the proceeding in the inferior court; whether on the face of the complaint itself or by collateral matter set up by way of plea to that complaint, or in evidence in the course of the proceedings in the inferior court, or by affidavit, the fact is made to appear to the court having power to award prohibition that the case is of such a nature as to show a want of jurisdiction in the inferior court to decide the particular case, prohibition lies either at the suit of a stranger or of a party even though there might be a remedy by appeal from the judgment of the inferior tribunal, citing upon this latter point Burder v. Veley ([30]); a fortiori if in the particular proceeding in the inferior court there be no appeal from the judgment of that court prohibition will lie, and to an application for a prohibition, or upon the determination of an issue, whether of law or-of fact, joined in the proceedings in prohibition, it cannot be urged as a sufficient objection to the writ going absolutely that in case of a conviction by the inferior tribunal the party might have a remedy by certiorari to quash the conviction; indeed, the writ being issuable at the suit of a stranger. as well as of a party shows that the right to it could not be affected by any such suggestion. In the above case of The Mayor of London v. Cox, Wiles J. referring to the writ being issuable of the-suit of stranger says:\nIn this respect prohibition strongly resembles mandamus where the Court of Queen's Bench exercises a discretion as to whether the writ shall 20 but the writ once granted must be met by a return showing a legal answer.\nAnd he adds:\nThe writ however, although it may be of right in the sense that upon an application being made in. proper time, upon sufficient materials, by a party who has not by misconduct or laches lost his right, its grant or refusal is not in the mere discretion of the court, is not a writ of course, like a writ of summons in an ordinary action, but is the subject of a special application to the court upon affidavit which application, and the proceedings thereupon, are now regulated by the Act 1 Wm 4 ch. 21\nBefore that act the declaration on \"prohibition was qui tam, and it supposed a contempt in disobeying an imaginary precedent writ of prohibition.\nThe act of William 4th enacted that:\nIt shall not be necessary to file a suggestion on any application for a writ of prohibition, but such application may be made on affidavits only: and in case the- party applying shall be directed to declare in prohibition before writ issued, such declaration shall be expressed to be on behalf of such party only, and not as heretofore on behalf Of the party and of His Majesty, and shall Contain and set forth in a concise manner so much only of the proceeding in the court below as may be-necessary-to show the-ground of the application without alleging the delivery of a writ or any contempt and shall conclude by praying that a writ of prohibition may issue to which declaration the party, defendant may demur or plead such matters by way of traverse or otherwise, as may be proper to show, that the writ ought not to issue, and conclude by praying that such writ may not issue; and judgment shall be given that the writ of prohibition do or do not issue as justice may require, and the party in whose favor judgment shall be given, whether on non-suit, verdict, demurrer or otherwise, shall be entitled to the costs attending the application and subsequent proceedings and have judgment to recover the same.\nThe practice under this statute seems to have been in accordance with, the ancient usage, that when upon the affidavits filed for and against the application it clearly appeared that the jurisdiction of the inferior court to adjudicate in the particular case could not be questioned, the court would neither grant the rule nor put the parties to the expense of a declaration and proceedings in prohibition, so in like manner if it should clearly appear that the writ ought to go absolutely, it was granted at once without requiring a declaration in prohibition; but if it appeared open to doubt whether the writ should or should not be finally granted, if the question was arguable, and always upon the demand of the party against whom the application was made, then the applicant was ordered to declare in prohibition in order that the points to be argued should be brought before the court in the shape of precise issue either of law or of fact upon record. See Lloyd v. Jones ([31]); In re Chancellor of Oxford ([32]) In re Dean of York ([33]); Mossop v. G, N. Ry. Co, ([34]) In re Aykroyd ([35]); Remington v. Dolby ([36]).\nSubsequently the practice upon applications for writs of prohibition to issue, addressed to judges of the county courts, was regulated by 13-14 Vic. ch. 61, and 19-20 Vic. ch. 108 the 42nd section of which latter act enacts that;\nWhen an application shall be made to a Supreme Court or a judge thereof for a writ of prohibition to be addressed to a judge of a county court, the matter shall be finally disposed of by rule or order, and no declaration or further proceedings in prohibition shall be allowed.\nNow the practice in the Province of Quebec is regulated by the code of civil procedure, the 1031st article of which code enacts that writs of prohibition are applied for obtained and executed in the same manner as writs of mandamus and with the same formalities thus placing the proceedings for writs of prohibition in all respects upon the same footing as writs of mandamus' which in some respects, as said by Willes J. in the Mayor of London v. Cox ([37]), they strongly resemble.\" Now the procedure in the cases of mandamus by the code of civil procedure is as stated in article 1023 as follows; \u2014\nThe application is made by petition supported with affidavits setting forth the facts of the case and presented to the court or judge who may thereupon order the writ to issue and such writ is served in the same manner as any other writ of summons.\nAnd article 1024 enacts that '.\n\u201cThe proceedings subsequent to the service are had in accordance with the provisions contained in the first section of this chapter.\"\nWhich provisions are; that the defendant may set up against the petition such preliminary exceptions, or exceptions to the form as they deem advisable, and the plaintiff may demur to the pleas set up in defence; that the defendant is bound to appear on the day fixed in the suit, and if he fails to do so, the petitioner proceeds with his case by default within three days from the filing of the answer the petitioner must proceed to. prove the allegations of the petition in the same manner as proof is made in ordinary cases, and after closing of his proof and within a further delay of two days the defendant is bound to adduce his proof\u2014-as Soon as the proof of the defendant is closed the petitioner may be allowed to produce evidence in rebuttal, if there is occasion for it if he does not either of the parties may inscribe the cause upon the merits, giving the opposite party notice of at least one day before the day fixed.\nIn accordance with the practice so prevailing in the Province of Quebec, John Henry R. Molson, John Thomas Molson and Adam Skaife trading in partnership as brewers, under the name of John H. R. Molson & Brothers, who were not parties to the proceedings in the inferior court hereinafter mentioned, and Andrew Ryan, who was the sole party named in such proceedings, presented their petition to the Superior Court for the district of Montreal, wherein, in short substance, they alleged that the said Messrs. Molson & Brothers were duly licensed by the Dominion Government, under and in pursuance of an act of the Dominion Parliament, to carry on the trade and business of brewers in the Province of Quebec that they carried on such their trade and business in the city of Montreal; that it always has been and is the custom of the trade of brewers in the Province of Quebec for brewers to send out their draymen for the purpose of delivering to their customers the beer manufactured by the said brewers; that the petitioner Andrew Ryan is, and for some time has been the servant and drayman of the said Messrs. Molson & Brothers, employed by them, according to the said custom of the trade of brewers to sell and deliver for and on their behalf, to their customers, the beer manufactured by them the said Messrs. Molson & Brothers in quantities not less than in dozen bottles, containing not less than three half points each, and in kegs holding not less than five gallons each; that on the 10th of June, 1882, William Busby Lambe of the city of Montreal exhibited an information and complaint against the said Andrew Ryan before Mathias C. Desnoyers, police magistrate of the said city of Montreal, and procured a summons to be signed by the said police magistrate, addressed to the said Ryan, whereby he was commanded to appear before the said police magistrate at a session of the court of Special Sessions of the Peace to be held in the court house of the said city of Montreal, on a day therein named, to answer the said information and complaint of the said Lambe,\u2014\nFor that he .the said Ryan not having any license for the sale of intoxicating liquors in any quantity whatever, had in the Said city of Montreal, on the 6th day of June, A 1882, and upon divers occasions before and since sold intoxicating liquors contrary to the statute in such case made and provided, whereby and in virtue of the said statute the said Andrew Ryan had become liable to the payment of a fine of the sum of ninety-five dollars; which sum that the said Ryan should be condemned to pay for the said offence, the said Lambe prayed judgment.\nThe petition further alleged that the said Ryan appeared to said summons and complaint, and pleaded thereto as follows:\u2014\n\"That he is and at the time mentioned in the said information was a servant and employee of the firm of J H R. Molsonn & Brothers, brewers, of the city of Montreal who hold a license from the Dominion Government under the Provisions of an act of the parliament Of Canada and who have been in business as such brewers in Montreal for eighty years, that during the whole of the said term, and up to the present time it has always been the custom and usage of the trade of brewers to send around through the country their drays with beer, which beer was sold by their dray-men during their trips to the said customers. That on the occasion charged in the said information the said Ryan was the agent, servant, and drayman of the said firm of J. H: R. Molson & Brothers.\nThat if he &, the said Ryan, sold any beer whatever, he so sold it as the agent and drayman of the said J. H R Molson &.Bros ., and under and by virtue of their authority under the said license, and sold it according to the custom and usage of trade in the said province ever since brewers were first established therein.\nThat the said John H. R. Molson & Brothers being licensed under the provisions of the said act of the parliament of Canada, are not liable to be taxed either by or through their employees and draymen under the provisions of any act passed by the legislature of the province of Quebec, and the said Ryan further alleged that he was not guilty in manner or form as set forth in the said information and summons, wherefore he prayed dismissal of the said prosecution.\"\nThe petition then alleges that, notwithstanding the said plea of the said Ryan to the jurisdiction of the said police magistrate, and otherwise, the said police magistrate took jurisdiction over the said Ryan and proceeded with the said case and that after certain admissions made in the said case (the nature of which will appear further on) the said case was taken in advisement.\nThe \"Petition then insists that the act under which the said prosecution was instituted, namely, the Quebec License Law of 1878 and its amendments are unconstitutional, illegal, null and void, and moreover that they do not apply to and that the said court of Special Sessions of the Peace have no jurisdiction to try, the said Ryan for the pretended offence so charged against him and the petitioners'' grounds for this contention are stated (among others for it is not necessary to set these all out) to be.\n1st That there is no act of the legislature of the province of Quebec which authorizes the said complaint and prosecution.\n6th. Because the petitioner Andrew Ryan, being in the employ and being the drayman of the other petitioners, the act of the petitioner Ryan in selling the said beer was the act of the said other petitioners' copartners who by their license from the Government of the Dominion of Canada were authorized and empowered so to sell such intoxicating liquor.\n7th Because the petitioners the said Messrs. Molson and Brothers, being licensed brewers had the right of selling by and through their employees and draymen without any further license whatsoever under the provisions of the Quebec License Act of 1878; and\n8th. Because the Legislature of the Province of Quebec have no right whatever to limit or interfere with the traffic of brewers duly licensed by the Government of Canada.\n\"Wherefore the petitioners prayed remedy and that a writ of our Lady the Queen of. prohibition to the said court of Special Sessions of the Peace sitting in the city of Montreal, and to the said Mathias C. Desnoyers, police magistrate for the city of Montreal, holding the said court do issue to prohibit the said court and the said Desnoyers from further proceedings upon the said summons and complaints. \"\nUpon this petition the writ of prohibition issued as prayed and in the form prescribed by the 1031st and 1023rd articles of the Code of Civil Procedure, and having been duly served upon the police magistrate and the court V of Special. Sessions of the Peace, the said William B Lambe in his quality of inspector of licenses for the district of Montreal, was permitted to intervene under the provisions of the articles of the Code of Civil Procedure in that behalf, 154 to 158 inclusive, and pleaded that by the 71st section of the Quebec License Act of 1878, whoever, without being licensed for that purpose, should sell in the city of Montreal in any quantity whatever any intoxicating liquors is \"liable for each offence to a fine of ninety-live dollars; and that the said Andrew Ryan, on the 6th day of June 1882 in the city of Montreal sold intoxicating liquor as alleged in the complaint laid before the dolice magistrate; that the said Andrew Ryan admitted the sale in question before the said police magistrate; that the said Quebec License Law of 1878 and its amendments are constitutional, that it was in due form passed by the Legislature of the Province of Quebec in conformity with the British North America Act of 1867 that by force of the 92nd section of the said British North America Act the Legislature of the Province of Quebec has the right to pass the license law in question; that assuming the said John H. R. Molson & Brothers, brewers, to have the right in virtue of the license which they have to sell without any other license beer of their own manufacture, still the said Andrew Ryan had no right to hawked it about through the city of Montreal or to sell it outside of the premises of the said brewers without being provided with the license required by the Quebec License Law. That moreover the said Molson & Brothers themselves have no right in virtue of their license to sell their beer outside of their premises without a license of the Province of Quebec. That in virtue of the 196th section of the said Quebec License Law of 187 , every action or prosecution in which the sum demanded does not exceed $100, may be tried before the police magistrate, and that the said Mathias C. Desnoyers was such police magistrate. That under these circumstances the prosecution instituted against the said Andrew Ryan was legally instituted and came under the jurisdiction of the said police magistrate, who had in consequence the right to hear and decide it\nTo this intervention the petitioners pleaded in answer:\u2014\nThat the so-called license law of the Province of Quebec of 1878 referred to in the said intervention as well as its amendments is unconstitutional, inasmuch as the same was passed ultra vires of the Province of Quebec, and that each, all, and every of the said clauses referred to in the said intervention and moynes d'intervention are unconstitutional and ultra vires of the said. Province of Quebec. And the said petitioners aver as they have already in their said petition averred, that even supposing that the said license law and its amendments are valid and constitutional, yet the said petitioners, Molson & Brothers, being duly liceised brewers at the said city of Montreal and the said petitioner, Andrew Ryan, being in their employ, and their agent, were, under their said license, under the provisions of the Dominion Acts of Parliamento justified and entitled to sell the beer according to the usage and custom of trade in the said province.\nAnd the petitioners admitting' the prosecution, defence and admissions set up in the said intervention denied the liability of the said Andrew Ryan to the penalty claimed from him, and, also, denied the jurisdiction of the said court of Special Sessions and of the said police magistrate to take jurisdiction of the said cause.\nTo this the intervenant replied insisting that all the allegations of his said intervention were well founded in law.\nThe parties to the said cause in prohibition were thus at issue.\nNow the admissions referred to in the said intervention as having been made in the said cause in the said inferior court before the said police magistrate, are precisely the same as have also been made in the cause in prohibition for the determination of the issues joined between the parties to that proceeding, and are as follows;\n1 That the firm of John H. R Molson and Brothers are brewers in Montreal and have carried on their business for a number of years past, and that they were duly licensed brewers under a license issued by the Dominion Government un ler and by virtue of the act 43 Vic ch. 19 intituled: \" The Inland Revenue Act of 1880.\"\n2. That the said Andrew Ryan was at the time of the offence alleged, in the information, to have been committed by him in the employ of the said firm of John. H. It. Molson and Brothers, as drayman, and that he was paid his wages as such drayman by a monthly salary, and by a commission on the moneys by him collected for the sale of beer manufactured by the said Molson & Brothers in the brewery mentioned in their said license\n3. That the sale in question was made outside of the said brewery, but in the revenue district of Montreal, and that the said Andrew Ryan, as drayman of the said firm, sold to a buyer who had not given his order at the office of the said firm, at the domicile of the said buyer.\n4. That it has been the immemorial custom and usage in the said city of Montreal for a drayman employed by brewers to sell and furnish beer to customers of the said brewers in the same manner as the said sale was effected without taking out a license.\n5. That the Local Legislature of Quebec have refunded to the brewers licensed by the Dominion Government the amount of the license fee imposed by the act of the Local Legislature upon such brewers, owing to and after the decision in the case of Severn and the Queen decided in the Supreme Court of Canada at Ottawa.\nNow proceedings in prohibition having been regularly instituted in accordance with the \"provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure of the Province of Quebec by a writ and declaration in prohibition to which an answer has been filed and a replication thereto, and issue having been joined in such proceedings upon the matters to be determined by the Superior Court in which such proceedings were instituted, it is obvious that these issues so joined, whatever they were and whether of law or of fact must be determined by the court in which such proceedings are pending. That court cannot evade the responsibility of passing its judgment upon those issues, by a suggestion that the points raised or any of them, are points which the inferior court, (whose jurisdiction under the facts and \" circumstances pleaded is disputed,) is competent itself to decide, and that if it should pronounce an erroneous judgment, then an application may be made to the Superior Court to interfere by certiorari. It is out of the question to suppose that the law, which provides such a precise procedure for bringing to issue in the Superior Court the questions to be determined in prohibition cases could sanction such a mode of dealing with them.\nIn the present case, the facts pleaded being admitted, the only questions to be determined were questions of law involving the construction and validity of a Statute of the Province of Quebec of which statute the act complained of and brought under the notice of the inferior court was alleged to be an infringement. It seems to be nothing short of a repudiation of those rights (which are of the essence of, and the inalienable prerogative of a superior court of common law) to say that the inferior court, whose jurisdiction in the given case was disputed, was as competent as the Superior Court to determine those question of law.\nIf the jurisdiction of an inferior court over a particular state of facts depends upon the construction and validity of an act of a Provincial Legislature, and if issues be joined in a proceeding in prohibition properly instituted in a Superior Court, raising a question as to the construction and validity of such Provencal act, how is it possible to contend that the Superior Court in which such issue is pending can evade the duty of determining it? In Brymer v. Atkins ([38]) it is said to be an ancient and essential maxim of common law, that not merely courts of common law of inferior jurisdiction, but that all courts of special jurisdiction, created by act of parliament must be limited in the exercise of that jurisdiction by such construction as the courts of common law, that is to say the Superior Courts, may give to the statute. Upon this principle a question having arisen in Care v. Capper ([39]), upon a motion for a writ of prohibition after sentence in an ecclesiastical court in a matter of tythe whether the court had not proceeded upon an erroneous construction of an act of parliament, the applicant was directed to declare in prohibition that the question of the construction of the statute which involved some doubt should be brought up for solemn adjudication, (the court thus directing that to be done in the particular case, which, in the case before us has been done by the authority of the Code of Civil Procedure in the province of Quebec), and the question having been raised by a demurrer to the declaration in prohibition, it was adjudged that the construction of the statute by the ecclesiastical court was erroneous, and that therefore the prohibition should go, although after sentence and although the objection did not appear upon the face of the libel in the ecclesiastical court, but was collected from the whole of the proceedings in that court, Gould v. Gapper ([40]).\nNow in the case before us the questions raised by the issue joined in the proceeding in prohibition are:\n1. Does the Quebec License Act of 1878 and its amendments impose any obligation upon brewers duly licensed as such by the Dominion Government to carry on the trade of brewers in the Province of Quebec to take out any, and if any, what license required by such the Quebec License Acts to entitle the brewers to dispose of the subject of their trade and of their manufacture within the said province ?\n2 If the Provencal statute does impose such obligation, is the statute, quoad the imposition of such obligation, intra vires of the Provincial Legislature ? and\n3. Is the sale and delivery by brewers in the city of Montreal, through the agency of their draymen, of the beer manufactured by them to their customers at the dwelling houses or places of business of the latter under the circumstances appearing in the proceedings in p ohibition here, an infringement of the Quebec License Act of 1878, subjecting the brewers' drayman to the penalty imposed by the 71st or any other section of such license act? Every one of these questions must be answered in the affirmative to give to the police magistrate in the city of Montreal jurisdiction over the act complained of and the person charged with having committed it. And these questions were, by the procedure of the Province of Quebec in prohibition cases, as much before the Superior Court for its determination as they would have been before the Superior Court in England if, as in Gould v. Gapper, the parties applying for a writ of prohibition had been ordered to declare and had declared in prohibition, and issues had been joined thereon for the express purpose of obtaining the judgment of the Superior Court upon the questions, which, in the present case, equally as in Gould v. Gapper, involved the construction of the statute in virtue of which the inferior court could only have had if it had, any jurisdiction over the subject matter or the person who had done the act complained of.\nThe manner in which the Superior Court dealt with these issues so joined in a proceeding duly instituted according to the course and practice of the court was this: It adjudged the Quebec License Act in question to be intra Vires of the Provincial Legislature but declined to adjudicate upon the questions whether it did or not impose any obligation upon brewers duly licensed as such by the Dominion Government under the Dominion Act 43 Vic. ch. 19 to take out any and if any what license from the Provincial Government to entile them to dispose of the subject of their trade manufactured by them ? or whether the sale and delivery by Messrs. Molson & Brothers through the agency of their drayman of the beer manufactured by them, to their customers at the dwelling houses or places of business of the latter, under the circumstances appearing in the proceedings in prohibition, was an infringement of the Quebec License Act of 1878 and its amendments, subjecting their drayman Ryan to the penalty imposed by the 71st section of the said act\nThe learned judge presiding in the Superior Court referred these questions to the police magistrate; thereby submitting in effect to the court of inferior jurisdiction the determination of the issues joined in a proceeding duly instituted in the Superior Court, intimating as a reason for so doing, that the petitioner Ryan if' condemned in the inferior court, might then apply to the Superior Court by writ of certiorari But the writ of certiorari is a mode merely of informing the court of the particulars of the question brought up by that writ for its decision and it only issues after judgment while we have already seen it is the inalienable right of the superior courts of common law to entertain and decide all questions affecting the jurisdiction of the courts of common law of inferior, and indeed of all courts of special limited jurisdiction, by proceedings in prohibition at whatever stage the proceedings in the inferior court may be. And when issue is joined in proceedings in prohibition duly instituted as they have been here, the court in which they have been so instituted becomes seized of the issues that it is the inalienable right of the litigants to have judgment upon these issues rendered by the court, and in the proceeding in which the issues are 'joined. ' That the Superior court therefore has erred in the judgment rendered by it, whatever may be the proper judgment to be rendered upon the questions raised, cannot, I think, admit of a doubt. Upon appeal to the Court of Queen's Bench at Montreal in appeal that court dismissed the appeal, a majority, of the learned judges of that court against two dissentients, holding that although the proceedings in prohibition were duly instituted, the judgment of the Superior Court which declined adjudicating upon the issues joined therein is free from error. In support of this judgment the case of the Chavkieh decided in the Court of Queen's Bench in England ([41]) is relied upon, but a reference to that case will show that it is not at all analogous to the present case.\nThat was not a case presenting to the court for its decision certain issues joined in proceedings in prohibition duly instituted. It was not a case raising a question as to the proper construction of a statute upon which depended the jurisdiction, if any, which an inferior court had under the circumstances of the particular case all the material facts of which appeared upon the record in the Superior Court, and upon admissions of the parties. If upon an application for a prohibition in England, in a similar case to the present one, the applicant had been directed to declare in prohibition and if he had done so and if by the pleadings to that declaration issues had been joined raising questions similar to those raised in the present case such a case, would have been analogous to the present but in such case there can be no doubt that the Court of Queen's Bench would have decided and finally determined all the issues, to raise which the applicant for the writ of prohibition had been directed to declare in prohibition. But the question was not at all as to the jurisdiction of a court of common law of inferior jurisdiction, which are questions peculiarly within the cognizance of a superior court of common law to decide, and the question which was raised was disposed of on the rule nisi for a writ of prohibition as we have seen to be the practice in England when the court entertains no doubt as to the point raised, and for that reason does not require the party to declare in prohibition; the rule was to show cause why a writ of prohibition should not issue to prohibit the High Court of Admiralty, itself a high court of record having jurisdiction in all matters relating to international and maritime law and expressly by 24 and 25 Vic. ch. 10 \"over any claim for damage done by any ship\" from further proceeding with a cause of damage instituted by or on behalf of the owners of the steamship Batavier against the Charkieh, which was alleged on affidavit to be a steamship of the Egyptian Government \u2022 and the sole ground of the application was that she was the property of a foreign government.\nBlackburn J. in giving judgment says:\nTaking every fact brought before us on the part of the persons applying for the prohibition to be true the case would be this; that the Khedive of Egypt is a Sovereign Prince as I assume for the pre sent purposes, although that may be disputed hereafter: and is owner of the vessel in question: she was sent to this country for repairs a collision then takes place in the Thames at the time the vessel was his property, and his officers were on board and in possession of her. Now the question arises whether the Court of Admiralty having jurisdiction to administer maritime law and international law against foreign vessels, could proceed With the cause for damage be cause by international law, such a ship is privileged, and cannot be proceeded against in a foreign court There is authority for saying? that courts of justice cannot proceed against a sovereign or a state and think there is also authority for saying they ought not to proceed, against ships of war or national vessels: and it is obviously desirable that this rule should be established, otherwise, wars might be brought on between two countries. But there is another question - what is the liability of a vessel which is the property of a foreign state, when she causes damage by a collision to another vessel, she not being a ship of war, but a ship which happens to be national property and apparently employed on a mercantile adventure ? Doss the circumstance of her being the property of a foreign state oust the jurisdiction of the Court of Admiralty ? Now, (he says), we are asked to prohibit the Court of Admiralty entertaining that which Lord Stowell, perhaps the highest authority upon these matters, declared was a difficult question of international law. It seems to me that this question can be better decided by a court which has almost a peculiar jurisdiction over matters relating to international law. It does seem to me that the Court of Admiralty has jurisdiction to determine the facts and to decide whether international and maritime law do allow the circumstances stated to be a defence to a claim against the Charkieh: and if that court is wrong in its judgment the Privy Council can set it right and their decision would be final. I do not see how it can be said that the Court of Admiralty is exceeding its jurisdiction in entertaining the suit as a question of International law; and taking that view of it, I think the court ought not to be prohibited\nIt thus appears that the court refused to interfere by prohibition because the sole question raised was one of international law which the High Court of Admiralty and not the Court of Queen's Bench had peculiar jurisdiction to administer, subject only to an appeal to quite a different court from the Court of Queen's Bench the judgment of which appeal court was by law final and conclusive The court in fact did decide the only point presented to it, namely, that the fact of the Charkieh, being the property of a foreign sovereign, did not oust the jurisdiction of the High Court of Admiralty over the claim for damage to the Batavier, but in the present case, although it has always been the undoubted right of the superior courts of common law to enquire into and adjudicate upon all complaints against Inferior temporal courts for acting without, or in excess of their jurisdiction, when duly brought before them by proceedings in prohibition, and although it is the undoubted duty of such courts towards the litigants in such proceedings in prohibition to decide all issues joined therein between the parties thereto, yet the Superior Court, in which the proceedings in prohibition in the present case were pending, declined to exercise such its right and to discharge such its duty.. it is obvious therefore that between the present case and that in re the Charkieh, there was no analogy whatever. The case must therefore now be dealt with upon its merits.\nIf the provisions of the Quebec License Act now under consideration are identical with the provisions of the Ontario Act, 37 Vic. ch. 32, in respect of the point in question we must be bound by the judgment of this court in Several v. The (Queen ([42]) which is no more at variance with the judgments rendered in Russell v. The Queen ([43]); Hodge v. The Queen ([44]); In the matter of the acts of the Dominion Parliament. 46 Vic, ch. 30 and 47 Vic ch. 32([45]) and Suite v. The Corporation of Three Rivers ([46]), than were those judgments at variance, as they were at one time erroneously supposed to be, with the judgment in The City of Fredericton v. The Queen. All of those judgments rest upon the foundation that laws which make, or which empower municipal institutions to make, regulations for granting licenses for the sale of intoxicating liquors in taverns, shops, &c, and for the good government of the taverns and shops so licensed, and for the preservation of peace and public decency in the municipalities and for the repression of drunkenness and disorderly and riotous conduct, and imposing penalties for the infraction of such regulations, are laws which, as dealing with subjects of a purely local, municipal, private and domestic character are intra vires of the Pro- vincial Legislature. But Severn v. The Queen proceeded. wholly upon the construction of item 9 of sec. 92 of the British. North America Act and in that case the late learned chief justice of this court, Sir William B. .Richards, held, and a majority of this court concurred with him, that the obligation imposed by the Ontario act, 37 Vic. oh. 32 upon brewers to take out a provincial license to enable them to dispose of the beer manufactured by them was in effect an obligation in restraint of the manufacturing by them of the article of their trade which in virtue of a license from the Dominion Government, issued upon the authority of an act of the Dominion Parliament they were authorized to carry on, and that the item 9 of sec. 92 of the British North America Act did not authorize the Provincial Legislatures to impose any such obligations upon brewers. That the words a and other licenses i in that item in connection with the preceding words, \"shop, saloon, tavern .and auctioneers\" must be construed, having regard to the general scope of the scheme of confederation, as referring to licenses ejusdem generis with the preceding licenses spoken of in the item such as licenses on billiard tables victual ling houses, houses where fruit, &c, are sold, hawkers, peddlers, livery stables, intelligence offices, and such like matters of purely municipal character, and that those words could not consistently with a due regard to the intent of the framers of the scheme of confederation, as appearing in the British North America Act be construed as giving to the Provincial Legislatures power to put a restraint upon the manufacture of an article of a trade authorized to be carried on by an act of the Dominion Parliament. So understanding the judgment in Severn v. The Queen whether it be in point of law, sound or otherwise, it may well stand consistently With, and is not shaken by Russell v. The Queen, or any other of the above cases and it is still a judgment binding upon this court and all courts in this Dominion. But the question still remains to be considered, namely whether the provisions of the Quebec License Act of 1878 are upon the point under consideration, so identical with the provisions of the Ontario Act as to make the judgment in Severn v. The Queen ([47]) applicable in the determination of the present case. The two acts when compared appear to be very different and so great is this difference as regards the point under consideration as to convey to my mind the idea that the draftsman of the Quebec Act of 1878, framed it with the object of complying with the judgment in Severn v. The Queen(l), which had been rendered five or six weeks before the passing of the act, and to avoid its being open to the objection of ultra vires, which that judgment had pronounced the Ontario Act to be open to. The Ontario Act while professing to have no intention to interfere with any brewer, distiller or other person duly licensed by th.6 Government of Canada for the manufacture of spirituous liquors, in the manufacturing such liquors, did nevertheless in effect do so by enacting that to enable any such brewer, distiller, &c, to sell the liquor manufactured for consumption within the Province of Ontario he should first obtain a license to sell by \"whole-sale under sec 4 of the act. The \" license by wholesale,'1 and which brewers were thus required to take out was a license to sell in quantities not less than five gallons in each cask or vessel at any one time or in not less than one dozen bottles of at least three half-pints each or two dozen bottles of at least three-fourths of one pint each, at any one time, in any other place than inns, ale or beer houses, or other places of public entertainment, and the act imposed a penalty upon brewers and distillers in case they should sell the liquor manufactured by them respectively without taking out such wholesale license.\nNow the Quebec Act of 1878 and its amendments contain no provision of such or the like nature as that in the Ontario Act upon, which the judgment in Severn v. The Queen ([48]) proceeded, and when we refer to the act in virtue of which license fees or duties had ' been collected from brewers in the Province of Quebec before the judgment in Severn v. The Queen (1), which license fees, as appears in the pleadings and admissions in the case now before us were refunded by the Provincial Government in consequence of, and in submission to, that judgment, we find that the only authority under which such license fees so refunded had been collected was contained in sections 12 13 and 14 of 86 Vic. oh. 3 as amended by 37 Vic. ch. 3 and that there is no similar enactment or provision contained in the act of 1878 or its amendments while that act repeals all the previous acts; a fact which seems to confirm the view I have taken that it was the intention of the Provincial Legislature in passing the License Act of 1878 to comply with the judgment of this court in Severn v The Queen (1).\nThere is no such license as the \u201cwholesale license \" of 36 Vie. ch. 3 required to be taken out by the act of 1878 or its amendments. All the licenses (as regards the sale of intoxicating liquors) which the License Act of 1878 as amended requires to be taken out are licenses:\n1. To keep an inn and for the sale of intoxicating acquires therein. The word \u201c inn \" being defined to be a house of entertainment, wherein intoxicating liquors are sold;\n2. For the sale of intoxicating liquors in a club,\n3. For the sale of intoxicating liquors in a restaurant or railway buffet.\n4. For a steamboat bar-for the sale therein of intoxicating liquors.\n5. For the sale of intoxicating liquors at the mines or in any mining district or division. 6. A retail shop license.\n7. A wholesale liquor shop license, and\n8. A license to sell for medicinal purposes or for use\nin divine worship in municipalities in which a prohibitory by-law is in force.\nNow by 43-44 Vic ch. 11, a wholesale liquor shop is that wherein is sold at one time intoxicating liquors in quantities not less than two gallons imperial, or one dozen bottles of not less than one pint imperial measure each; and a retail liquor shop is defined to be that wherein are sold at any one time intoxicating liquors in quantities not less than one pint imperial measure. Now those licenses are required to be taken out for the sole purpose of enabling the Provincial Government to raise a revenue for the purposes of the province. That this must be held to be the sole object of the Quebec License Act of 1878 and its amendments, appears not only from item 9 of sec. 92 of the British North America Act but from an act of the Provincial Legislature, 46 Vic. ch. 5, passed for the express purpose of remedying what the Legislature conceived to be a defect by reason of its not being so stated in the acts of 1878 and 1880. By this act 46 Vic. it is declared:\nThat the duties payable for licenses imposed by sec. 63 of the Quebec License law of 1878, as replaced by sec. 17 of the act 43-44 Vic. ch. 11, were so imposed in order to the raising of a revenue for the purposes of this province under the powers conferred upon the Legislature of this Province by the 9th paragraph of sec. 92 of the British North. America Act of 1867.\nNow the Provincial Government cannot under the acts in question, raise any revenue by the issue of any licenses other than those expressly named in the acts as subjected to duty, and a person not engaged in a business, which by the acts or one of them is subjected to a license tax cannot be compelled to take out and consequently cannot be punished for not taking out, one of the licenses upon which a duty or tax is imposed by the acts. In order to raise a revenue by taxation of any kind, the thing to be taxed must be expressly-stated in the act imposing the tax. .But none of the licenses named in the acts relate to the business of a brewer. His business is to manufacture beer and to sell the beer manufactured by him. The acts impose no tax upon his business, he cannot, therefore, be compelled to contribute to the Provencal revenue by taking out, nor can he be punished for not taking out, a license authorizing him to keep an inn, a restaurant or railway buffet, a steamboat bar or a retail or wholesale liquor shop none of which nor all of them together if taken out would enable him to carry on the business of a brewer or authorize him to dispose of the article manufactured by him The Messrs Molson & Brothers, although they should be possessed of every one of the above named licenses would be as liable for the act which is the subject of prosecution in the inferior court now under consideration as they are now not having any of such licenses. Brewers therefore are not required, by the acts in question, in order to carry on their business to take out any of the licenses which, for the purpose of raising a revenue, are subjected to a fee or tax. The intervenient in his pleading in intervention contends that admitting that the said Molson & Brothers are entitled in virtue of their license from the Dominion Government to sell the beer of their manufacture without any other license still Andrew Ryan had no right to hawk or peddle the beer through the city of Montreal, and to sell it outside of the premises of the said brewers, without being supplied with the license required by the Quebec License Act, and that moreover the Messrs Molson & Brothers themselves had no right to sell their beer outside of their premises without a license of the Province of Quebec, but as brewers are not, nor is their business, taxed by the acts in question, and they are not required by any of the acts to take out a license from the Provincial Government to enable them to carry on their trade and. as none of the licenses which are by the acts subjected to a tax or duty, would give them any greater authority to sell their beer on. the premises where it is manufactured any more than elsewhere, they must have the same right to sell and deliver the beer manufactured by them at the residences or places of business of their customers whether they be licensed inn, restaurant or steamboat, barkeepers or others equally as at the premises where the beer is manufactured, unless the provision in the acts as to peddlers license applies which is the only license which can be referred to in the pleadings in intervention: but apart from the absurdity of brewers by delivering their beer to their customers at their residences or places of business being deemed to be peddlers, the act expressly provides that no person is obliged to take out a license to peddle and sell goods, wares, &c, of their own manufacture excepting drugs, medicines and patent reme dies whether peddled and sold by himself or his agents or servants.\nMr. Geoffrion, however, contended that although none of the licenses, named in the act authorized to be done the act which is the subject of the prosecution instituted against Ryan, nevertheless the penalty sought to be recovered is exigible; but the object of imposing a penalty is to prevent the revenue being defrauded by a party doing without a license that, for doing which the act has required a license to be taken out, upon which for the purposes of revenue a tax is imposed. Accordingly the provincial statute 46 Vic. ch. \u00f3 already referred to, and which was passed, as stated in the preamble, because doubts had arisen as to the constitutionality of certain provisions contained in the Quebec License Act of 1878 and the amendments thereto, and that it was expedient to make such provision as would ensure the collection of the revenue derivable from the duties imposed and payable for the different licenses specified in the above mentioned act as amended; and which to remove the above doubts declared that the duties payable for licenses imposed by the Quebec License Act of 1.878 as amended by the act of 1880 were imposed in order to the raising of a revenue for the purposes of the Province, enacted that\nAny person neglecting or refusing to pay the license duty payable by him shall be liable for Such neglect or refusal to a fine equal to the amount of such duty and one half of such amount added thereto .\nNow this provision (although in a statute passed since the prosecution in the present case was instituted, still as the statute was passed for the purpose of declaring the intent of the act of 1878 and its amendments) throws much light if such were necessary upon the construction to be put upon the 71st clause of the act of 1878 under which the prosecution in the present case was instituted, for the persons, who are subjected to penalties for infringing an act passed for the purpose of raising a revenue for the use of the province by the imposition of a tax upon certain licenses are, by legislative declaration, shown to be those only who neglect or refuse to pay the license duty payable by them respectively; now these must be persons who assume to do some or one of the acts for the doing of which the statute has required a license to be taken out upon which a specific duty has been imposed. The doing anything for the doing of which there is no license specified in the act nor any duty imposed can never be held to be an infringement of the act.\nThe 71st sec. of the act of 1878 as amended by the act of 1880 enacts that:\nAny one who keeps, without a license to that effect still in force as hereinabove prescribed, an inn, restaurant, steamboat-bar. railway buffet or liquor shop for the sale by wholesale or retail of intoxicating liquors or sells in any quantity whatsoever intoxicating liquors in any part whatsoever of this province, municipally organized, is liable for each contravention to a fine of $95, if such contravention takes place in the city of Montreal, and $75 if it has been committed In any other part of the organized territory; and if the contravention takes place in the new organized territory, the penalty is $35\u2014any one who keeps without a license to that effect still in force as by law prescribed a temperance hotel is liable for each contravention to a fine of $20.\nNow in view of the object of the act being to raise a revenue for the purposes of the province by a tax upon certain licenses particularly specified in the act, required to be taken out for the doing certain things mentioned in such licenses respectively the plain construction of the above section, is that any person who in any part of the Province of Quebec which is municipally organized, shall in contravention of the act do any of those things enumerated in the section as only authorized to be done under a license as in the act prep scribed, without the license as prescribed by the act appropriate to the things done shall be liable, &c.; and if the contravention takes place in new organised territory the penalty is $35.\nThere can be no contravention of the act unless the thing done is a thing for the doing which one of the licenses particularly specified in the act upon which a duty is imposed is required to be taken out. If there be no license specified in the act for authorizing to be done the thing complained of, the doing such thing is no contravention of the act and there being, no license specified in the act for the doing what Ryan has been prosecuted for doing, neither he nor the Messrs. Molson & Brothers, whose servant only Ryan was, in doing what is complained of is so liable to any prosecution as for an infringement of the act. The act in fact imposes no obligation upon brewers to take out any license to enable them to dispose of the beer manufactured by them, which is the simple character of the act complained of; in this respect, it differs in its frame, and as it appears to me designedly, from the Ontario Act which was under consideration in Severn v. The Queen (1), but as it imposes no tax upon brewers disposing of the beer manufactured in the manner complained of, the inferior court bad no jurisdiction in the matter of the prosecution instituted against the Messrs. Moslon & Brothers' drayman, and the prohibition should be ordered to be issued from the Superior Court absolutely as prayed for with costs to the petitioners in all the courts.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellant: Kerr, Carter & Goldstein.\nSolicitor for respondent: N.

Henry J. dissenting.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] affirming the judgment of the Queen\u2019s Bench Division by which the verdict for the plaintiffs at the trial was set aside and the action dismissed.\nThe defendants had been contractors with the Government of British Columbia for the construction of the Esquimalt Graving Docks, but failing to carry on the work to the satisfaction of the Government the contract was taken out of their hands. They believed however, that its restoration could be effected, and entered into an agreement with the plaintiffs by which the latter were to complete the work and receive 90 per cent. of the profits, the agreement recit- ing that the defendants had agreed to take the plaintiffs into their service for the purpose of completing the contract. This course was adopted in consequence of the contract with the Government containing a clause which prohibited them from sub-letting.\nThe plaintiffs at the time of making this agreement were aware of the fact that the defendants had lost the contract, and had examined its various provisions, but reliance was placed on the political influence of the plaintiff, Mitchell, for its restoration. After the execution of the agreement Mitchell went to British Columbia and used every endeavor to induce the Government to restore the contract to the defendants but was finally obliged to return without accomplishing his object. The plaintiffs then brought their action claiming $100,000 as damages for breach of contract to take them into defendants\u2019 service, and $25,000 for moneys expended on the work.\nThe defendants claimed that the condition of their contract with the Government was known to the plaintiffs when the agreement was made; that it was made on the express understanding that it was not to take effect unless the contract was restored; and that it was not intended to create the relation of master and servant between the parties the agreement being made in the form it was on account of the clause against sub-letting.\nThe plaintiffs recovered a verdict on the trial which was set aside by the Queen\u2019s Bench Division and their judgment was confirmed by the Court of Appeal. The plaintiffs then appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nMcCarthy Q.C. and Mahon for the appellants.\nThe principle governing the position of parties to a contract, the performance of which becomes impossible, is well defined in Anson on Contracts[2] citing the case Jacobs v. Cr\u00e9dit Lyonnais[3].\nThis doctrine is dealt with in a line of decisions be-; ginning with Paradine v. Jane[4], and followed by. Clark v. Glasgow Ass. Co.[5]; Medeiros v. Hill[6]; Hills v. Sughrue[7].\nOther authorities bearing upon the questions involved here are Kearon v. Pearson[8]; Thiis v. Byers[9]; Pollock on Contracts[10]; Barker v. Hodgson[11].\nIt is only where the continued existence of the circumstances prevailing when the contract was made is essential to its performance that the impossibility of performing it will discharge the parties. Anson on Contracts[12]; Brown v. Royal Ins. Co.[13]; Jones v. St. John\u2019s College[14].\nThe Court of Appeal decided this case against the plaintiffs on the authority of Cunningham v. Dunn[15]. But that case was decided on a very different state of affairs from the one now under discussion. The jury there found that the plaintiff was aware of the disability when the contract was made and the defendant did not become aware of it until later. The court expressly decided the case on the ground that both parties were in fault. Further, Cunningham v. Dunn was decided on the authority of Ford v. Cotesworth[16], which clearly is no authority for the judgment for the Court of Appeal here.\nThe following cases, also, were cited: Brecknock Canal Co v. Pritchard[17]; Hadley v. Clarke[18]; Atkinson v. Ritchie[19]; Spence v. Chodwick[20]; Jervis v. Tomkinson[21]. O\u2019Gara Q.C. for the respondents.\nMitchell represented that his influence was sufficient to obtain a restoration of the contract, and the agreement was made in consequence of such representation.\nBoth parties know that the contract was out of defendants\u2019 hands, and the agreement must be construed in the light of the circumstances.\nIt was impossible for the defendants to carry out their agreement, and as the plaintiffs knew of the disability they are not entitled to recover. Anson on Contracts[22]; Campbell on Sales[23]; Clare v. Lamb[24]; Cato v. Thompson[25].\nMcCarthy Q.C. in reply. The contract is to be construed according to its terms and not by extraneous matter. Taylor on Evidence[26].\nThere was a clear covenant either express or implied that the defendants would give as the work progressed and we are entitled to the benefit of it. Samson v. Easterby[27]; Salton v. Houston[28]; Lainson v. Tremere[29]; Addison on Contracts[30].\nSIR W.J. RITCHIE C.J.\u2014Both parties knew the contract had been cancelled and, no doubt, thought the Government of British Columbia would restore the contract to McNamee. It is quite clear that the plaintiff was fully impressed with the conviction that the retention of the contract would not be persisted in. In this state of the case both parties contracted and both parties were disappointed; the Government of British Columbia refused to give the contract back to McNamee. The fulfilment of the contract on either side was, therefore, prevented, by reason of a known difficulty of which both parties were aware and which both, at the time of entering into the con- tract, thought could be overcome.\nBoth parties in this case appear to have been ready and willing to perform their undertaking, and doubtless would have done so but they were prevented by the refusal of the Government of British Columbia, a power over which neither party had any control.\nIt is clear that unless the contract was restored by British Columbia there could be no performance on either side. We cannot shut our eyes to the state of facts thus existing and known to both parties, and with reference to which the plaintiff and defendant were negotiating with a view to arriving at a right construction of the agreement into which the parties finally entered. It is our duty to construe the contract with the aid of the surrounding circumstances, influenced in the construction not only by the instrument but also by the circumstances under which, and the objects for which, it was entered into and with reference to the intention of the parties at the time it was made. Reading the contract in the light of the surrounding circumstances I think what both parties contemplated was, an agreement based on the restoration of the contract to McNamee, which both parties thought would be obtained through their united efforts and influence; failing in this the contract necessarily fell through, because, without the fault of either party, it could be fulfilled by neither, it not, in my opinion, being contemplated that any liability should arise on either side until the restoration should be obtained through their joint endeavors. If the contract was restored then the agreement became capable of fulfilment but not before; in other words, conditional on the restoration of the contract. The government having refused without the fault of either party, the non\u2011fulfillment of the agreement happened without fault on either side. This was not a contract the performance of which was dependent on the con- tinued existence of a given state of things, but the opposite, the performance was dependent on the action of the Government of British Columbia over which neither party had any control.\nIn the absence, then, of any express or implied contract or warranty on either side that the consent of the Government of British Columbia would or could be obtained, a matter in which both parties were equally interested and which, from the evidence, it is obvious both parties were to use their endeavors to obtain and which the plaintiff Mitchell thought they had sufficient political influence to accomplish, can this contract be construed into a positive contract on the part of the defendant to procure such consent? On the contrary, looking at the surrounding circumstances, must it not be construed as subject to an implied condition on both sides that it was not to take effect, as it could not, in the event of the refusal of British Columbia to give back the contract to the defendant? Though it may appear on its face to be presently operative both parties must have known that it was not intended to operate, because it could not operate until the happening of a given event. The agreement being silent on the subject there was nothing, in my opinion, to prevent the defendant from showing by parol testimony that it was not intended to, because it could not, take effect until the happening of something else. To hold that the agreement was not to have effect if the Government of British Columbia refused to restore, neither varied nor contradicted the writing. As was said in Wallis v. Littell[31] \u201cit but suspended the commencement of the obligation.\u201d\nTherefore, in my opinion, the refusal of British Columbia was a common misfortune, so to speak, excusing both parties from the performance of the contract, and the loss must remain where it falls. I do not wish to be understood as ignoring what I consider firmly established that where a party has, either expressly or impliedly, undertaken, without any qualification, to do anything and he does not do it he must make compensation in damages, though the performance was rendered impracticable by some unforeseen cause over which he had no control. Ford v. Cotesworth[32]. The principles to be gathered from Lindley v. Lacey,[33]; Taylor v. Caldwell,[34] and Appleby v. Myers[35], in my opinion clearly sustain the views I have expressed.\nIn Lindley v. Lacey23. Keating J.\u2014\nThe principle you are contending for was recognized in a still more recent case in this court, Wallis v. Littell[36]. There, the plaintiff declared upon an agreement by the defendants to transfer to him a farm which he (the defendant) held under Lord Sydney, \u201cupon the terms and conditions of the agreement under which the same was held by the defendant under Lord Sydney.\u201d The defendant pleaded that the agreement declared on was made subject to the condition that it should be null and void if Lord Sydney should not, within a reasonable time after the making of the agreement, consent and agree to the transfer of the farm to the defendant; and it was held that it was competent to the defendant to prove by extraneous evidence this contemporaneous oral agreement, such oral agreement operating as a suspension of the written agreement, and not in defeasance of it. In giving judgment, Erle C.J. said: \u201cIn Pym v. Campbell[37] and Davis v. Jones[38], it was decided that an oral agreement of the same effect as that relied on by the defendant might be admitted, without infringing the rule that a contemporaneous oral agreement is not admissible to vary or contradict a written agreement. It is in analogy with the delivery of a deed as escrow; it neither varies nor contradicts the writing, but suspends the commencement of the obligation.\u201d Byles J.: All these cases proceed upon the principle that extraneous evidence is always admissible to apply the agreement.\nByles J.:\u2014\nI am of the same opinion. I think there was a prior collateral oral agreement relating to the bill, which the subsequent written agreement did not in any manner interfere with. The written agreement is altogether silent as to the payment of that bill: and there is nothing therein which is at all inconsistent with the prior agreement. The case of Harris v. Rickett[39] seems to me to be precisely in point. But, independently of that, it appears that the original agreement between the parties was, that the bill in the hands of Chase should be taken up by Lacey; and that was to be the ground work of the subsequent arrangement. That being so, Pym v. Campbell[40], Davis v. Jones[41], and two recent cases in this court, viz., Wallis v. Littell[42], and another which has not been referred to, show that evidence may be given of a prior or a contemporaneous oral agreement which constitutes a condition upon which the performance of the written agreement is to depend. If evidence may be given of an oral agreement which affects the performance of the written one, surely evidence may be given of a distinct oral agreement upon a matter with respect to which the subsequent written agreement is altogether silent; more especially if, as here, in addition to its being a stipulation it was also a condition. The justice of the case is evidently in accordance with our view of the law.\nTaylor v. Caldwell[43]. Blackburn J.:\u2014\nThere seems no doubt that where there is a positive contract to do a thing, not in itself unlawful, the contractor must perform it or pay damages for not doing it, although in consequence of unforeseen accidents, the performance of his contract has become unexpectedly burthensome or even impossible. The law is so laid down in Roll. Abr. 450, condition (G) and in note (2) to Walton v. Waterhouse[44] and is recognized as the general rule by all the judges in the much discussed case of Hall v. Wright[45]. But this rule is only applicable when the contract is positive and absolute, and not subject to any condition either express or implied, and there are authorities which, as we think, establish that principle that where, from the nature of the contract, it appears that the parties must from the beginning have known that it could not be fulfilled unless when the time for the fulfilment of the contract arrived some particular specified thing continued to exist, so that, when entering into the contract they must have contemplated such continuing existence as the foundation of what was to be done; there, in the absence of any express or implied warranty that the thing shall exist the contract is not to be construed as a positive contract, but as subject to an implied condition that the parties shall be excused in case, before breach, performance becomes impossible from the perishing of the thing with- out default of the contractor.\nThere seems little doubt that this implication tends to further the great object of making the legal construction such as to fulfil the intention of those who entered into the contract. For in the course of affairs men in making such contracts in general would, if it were brought to their minds, say there should be such a condition.\nAppleby v. Myers[46]. Blackburn J.:\u2014\nThe whole question depends upon the true construction of the contract between the parties. We agree with the court below in thinking that it sufficiently appears that the work which the plaintiffs agreed to perform could not be performed unless the defendant\u2019s premises continued in a fit state to enable the plaintiffs to perform the work on them; and we agree with them in thinking that if by any default on the part of the defendant, his premises were rendered unfit to receive the work, the plaintiffs would have had an option to sue the defendant for this default, or to treat the contract as rescinded, and sue on a quantum meruit. But we do not agree with them in thinking that there was an absolute promise of warranty by the defendant that the premises should at all events continue so fit. We think that where, as in the present case, the premises are destroyed without fault on either side, it is a misfortune equally affecting both parties; excusing both from further performance of the contract, but giving a cause of action to neither.\nSTRONG J.\u2014Apart altogether from the ground upon which the judgment of the Court of Appeal is founded I am of opinion that this appeal cannot be sustained.\nIt was pointed out by Mr. O\u2019Grara in the course of his very able argument for the respondent that the indenture of the 29th of July, 1882, does not contain any covenant on the part of the respondents which, consistently with the facts in evidence, they can be held to have broken. The instrument in question contains the following recital:\u2014\nAnd whereas the parties hereto of the first part have agreed to take into their services the said parties of the second part and pay them ninety per cent. of the price stipulated in the said in part recited indenture of the 24th day of February, one thousand eight hundred and eighty, to be paid to them the said parties of the first part and the said parties of the second part hereby agreeing thereto for the material to be used in and the construction of the said works. It also contains the following covenants on the part of the respondents:\nAnd the parties of the first part in consideration of the premises hereby covenant with the parties of the second part that they will be paid by the parties of the first part ninety per cent. of the amount of every estimate issued on the said works until the completion thereof, and also for all other works in excess of those in the said in part recited contract mentioned or referred to.\nAnd an additional covenant as follows:\u2014\nAnd it was further agreed that they the said parties of the second part shall be paid out of every subsequent estimate by the parties of the first part ninety per cent. of such estimate until the final completion of the works in the said in part recited indenture mentioned and of all the works and material in excess thereof connected therewith.\nThere are no other express covenants on the part of the respondents, contained in the agreement of which it can be suggested there has been any breach.\nThe recital of an agreement to pay ninety per cent. of the price stipulated to be paid by the contract is restricted and limited by the subsequent express covenants (already set forth) contained in the operative part of the instrument, and according to those covenants the 90 per cent. to be paid is to be so paid out of the amount of every estimate issued, and consequently would not become payable unless estimates were actually issued. Now it is not, and cannot be, pretended that any estimate was issued subsequent to the 29th July, 1882, the date of the indenture. There has, consequently, been no breach of any of these covenants.\nIf it is contended, in answer to this, that a convenant on the part of the respondents to procure the forfeiture of the contract to be rescinded and the works to be restored to the respondents, in order that the appellants might be afforded an opportunity to do the work and thus earn the 90 per cent, is to be imported into the agreement by implication, the plain answer to it is that, having regard to the facts disclosed in the evidence that at the date of the agreement between the appellants and respondents the Government of British Columbia had, pursuant to the provisions of the original contract, taken the works out of the respondents\u2019 hands, and that this fact was well known to all parties, such an implication would be warranted neither by principle nor authority. It is indeed true, as was said in Churchward v. The Queen[47], and in Thorn v. The Commissioners of Public Works[48], and as was held by this court in McLean v. The Queen[49], that if one contracts to do work the preparation for which involves outlay and expense, a corresponding agreement, in the absence of any express provision, will be implied on the part of the person with whom he contracts to furnish the work; but no authority can be cited to show that such an implication will be made when, from circumstances known to, and in the contemplation of, both parties at the date of the agreement to do the work, it was, and has since continued to be, beyond the power of the party to comply with such a stipulation. If any implied term is to be read into the instrument it can only be one imposing on the respondents the obligation of permitting the appellants to perform the work in the event of the Government of British Columbia allowing the respondents to go on and complete their contract, an event which never happened. This point was distinctly taken by the counsel for the respondent at the trial but was overruled by the learned judge and, as I think, erroneously overruled. It seems to me to be decisive of the case.\nGranting, however, that there had been such a provision as is now sought to be implied expressed in the agreement in the most clear and unequivocal terms, I should still have been of opinion, with both the courts below, that without overruling the cases of Cunningham v. Dunn[50], Ford v. Cotesworth[51], Bailey v. De Crespigny[52], Thorn v. City of London[53], Taylor v. Caldwell[54], and Clifford v. Watts[55], it would have been impossible to have come to any other conclusion than that reached by the judgments under appeal. I do not regard these cases as establishing that circumstances such as we have here are to be considered as affording a defence by way of excuse of performance, but as showing that, in cases similar to the present, the absolute terms of the contract are to be qualified and construed as subject to the condition that their performance shall become possible.\nI do not pursue this subject further for I entirely agree with everything contained in the judgment of the learned Chief Justice of the Court of Appeal, though I prefer to rest my own judgment on the ground first mentioned.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nFOURNIER J.\u2014The evidence in this case shows very clearly that McKenna took the contract which McNamee had with British Columbia knowing perfectly well that such contract had been set aside. Of this fact there is no doubt. It is also very clear that McKenna undertook to exercise his influence with the Government of British Columbia to effect a restoration of the contract. He was sure of his influence with the Government and depended entirely on that. If he has not been successful in his negotiations McNamee is not to blame.\nI think the appeal should be dismissed.\nHENRY J.\u2014I think this matter requires the discus- sion of certain principles, well known and acted on in many cases. One of the leading principles laid down is, that where a party undertakes to pay another, and the other sustains damage, an action lies; and if a party undertakes to do something, and engages another man to perform the work, it is no answer for the former to say \u201cyou knew I had no contract.\u201d What does the law say? It says that is no excuse. The law is that if a party undertakes to employ another to perform certain work, although he himself has not the work to do, he is liable.\nSuppose a man engages another to put up a residence and the other employs men to get out stone and timber; after these are supplied the former says \u201cI did not get the contract; you knew I hadn\u2019t it and promised to assist me; you did assist me but I did not get it;\u201d who is liable?\nWhat are the circumstances of this case? McNamee had a contract in British Columbia for constructing certain public works. He did not proceed with the work as fast as the government thought he should and they took the contract out of his hands. Before the government did anything on the work negotiations took place for its restoration.\nIf McKenna sustained no damage he has no action, but if he did under all the decisions he is entitled to compensation. I think the appeal should be allowed.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014I am of opinion that the appeal should be dismissed.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014What the appellants contracted to acquire and what the respondents agreed to assign to them was, as plainly appears by the evidence, the respondents\u2019 interest in a contract which they had had With the Government of British Columbia, but which in pursuance of certain provisions contained therein had been put an end to by that Government, and which the appellants, and it may be also the respondents, entertained the hope that either by the influence of the appellants alone, or by their influence jointly with that of the respondents, they should be able to get restored. The indenture executed for the purpose of giving effect to the intention of the parties assumed the shape it did for the express purpose of obviating a difficulty which would have stood in the way of their getting the contract restored, for that contract contained a clause avoiding it in the case of any sub-letting of it. This indenture contains no express covenant that the contract which the respondents had had with the Government of British Columbia was still in existence in full force and effect. The insertion of such a covenant in the instrument would have been quite inconsistent with the facts known to both parties and with their manifest intention; to imply such a covenant or one to the effect that the forfeited contract would be restored by the Government of British Columbia would be equally inconsistent with the plain intention of the parties. What the appellants contracted for was the benefit such as it was of the respondents\u2019 contract with the British Columbia Government in the condition in which it then was and which was known to the appellants, and that benefit such as it was they got.\nI concur therefore that the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellants: Mahon & O\u2019Meara.\nSolicitors for respondents: O\u2019Gara & Remon.\n[1] 14 Ont.

C.\nWhere the sale of real estate by the wife, duly separated as to property from her husband, to her husband's creditor is shown to have been intended to operate as a security only for the payment of her husband's debts, such sale will be set aside as a contra. vention of art. 1301 C. C. (P. Q).\nPer Strong J.dissenting. The trial judge's finding in the present suit that the deeds of sale were not simulated should be affirmed.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada (Appeal side) reversing the judgment of the Superior Court in favor of the appellants.\nThe faces of the case may be briefly stated thus:\u2014\nOn the 14th of January, 1876, Robert H. Klock and his brother and then partner, James Klock, purchased from Elizabeth Richie, wife of the respondent Richard Chamberlin, by whom she was duly authorized, a certain piece of land in the township of Hull in the district of Ottawa, known as the equal third part of the south half of lot number nineteen in the second range of lots in the said township, and containing 34 acres 1 rood and 38\u2153 perches of land in superficies, for the sum of one thousand dollars, the receipt of which was acknowledged in the deed in which a right of redemption (r\u00e9m\u00e9r\u00e9) during three years was reserved by the seller upon her paying to the purchasers the price of sale with interest at 15 per cent.\nOn the 23rd February,1877, the purchasers finding that Mrs. Richie could get more than the price they had paid agreed to add seven hundred dollars to the price, and continued the right of redemption upon payment of the original price and interest, with the additional sum of seven hundred dollars and interest at 10 per cent, per annum; and finally, on the 23rd February, 1878, the purchasers finding that Mrs. Richie could again get a larger price, again increased the . price by the sum of one thousand and seven hundred dollars and ninety-one cents, which was also added with interest at ten per cent. per annum to the price of redemption, &c.\nThese deeds were all executed under private seal in presence of witnesses, and were duly attested and registered.\nOn the 29th December, 1880, James Klock transferred his share in the property to the said R. H. Klock, and on the 11th May, 1881, the latter brought an action against Mrs. Chamberlin for possession of the property, making Mr. Chamberlin a party for the purpose of assisting his wife.\nTo this action, besides the general issue, the defend ant pleaded two exceptions, alleging that the deeds in question were simulated and that Elizabeth Richie never received the consideration money mentioned in the deeds, but that these moneys were in reality paid by R. H. and J. Klock to creditors of Richard Chamberlin, part of it being retained by them for debts due them by him, and that the alleged sales were in reality mortgages for securing the repayment with exorbitant interest of moneys advanced to her husband, and to which she was induced by him to put her signature. The consideration mentioned in the three deeds of sale was shown to have been employed to the extent of seventeen hundred and seven dollars and ninety one cents to secure the debts due by R. Chamberlin to the appellants and others; and in appellants' books produced at the trial it was shown that the transaction was originally entered as a mortgage.\nThe Superior Court dismissed the defendant's plea, and held that the deeds were not simulated deeds.\nThe Court of Queen's Bench considered that the defendant had proved the essential allegations of her plea and, reversing the .judgment of the Superior Court, dismissed the plaintiff''s action, reserving to him his recourse on the said three deeds for any sum of money which Elizabeth Richie may have received out of the consideration money mentioned in the deeds beyond the sum of $1,707.22 &c., &c.\nFleming Q.C. for appellants. The transaction was simply a contract of sale with the right of redemption, and it is solely when there is fraud against the law prohibiting usury that a contract of sale with right of r\u00e9m\u00e9r\u00e9 can be assimilated to a pignorative contract and because it is a disguised contract of antichresis. The wife has a right to sell her property and pay her husband's debts with the price; she can borrow money and pay her husband's debts with it. The knowledge on the part of the purchaser or of the lender that the wife says she will pay her husband's debts cannot affect the validity of the deed; in this case no such knowledge was proved. Pothier ([1]); Merlin ([2]); Troplong ([3]); Bouchier v. McLean ([4]); Hamel v. Panet ([5]); Merlin ([6]); Guyot ([7]); D\u00e9nisart ([8]). The learned counsel then argued on the facts that the sale was not simulated and the consideration was for necessaries furnished the family for which the wife was responsible.

Morse ([15]).\nAylen for respondent. The entry in the plaintiffs' books is an admission that the debt was due by the husband and the transaction between them and the defendant, Elizabeth Richie, is a mortgage\u02d9 and not a sale. Moreover it is conclusive from the fact that the same property purports to have been sold by and to the same parties three times. A person can imagine three mortgages one after the other contracted by and to the same parties, and all in force at the same time, but not three sales. The fact that the plaintiff and his partner appear to have bought the second time from the defendant Elizabeth Richie is an acknowledgment that the right of property had not passed to them by the first deed. And as the whole three transactions are alike, the presumption is that the intention influenced the parties at the first two existed and influenced them at the time of the third contract. Sirey C. C., under art. 1166 ([16]). The whole transaction was for the purpose of evading art. 1301 CO., P.Q.\nIf the premises indicate simulation, and that the deeds were not intended to convey and did not convey the right of property in the land therein described, or anything more than a mortgage thereon to the plain tiff and his partner, the defendants' plea for the dismissal of the plaintiffs' action purely and simply is (on the authority of Guyot quoted by Merlin under the word pignoratif, hereinbefore cited, and of numerous other jurists) well founded. See Troplong Vente, Tome 2nd, art. 1659 No. 695 et seq. and 1 Demolombe No. 696.\nThe following authorities were cited and relied on: Merlin ([17]); Buckley v. Brunelle ([18]); Walker u.

I think the transaction was not a bona fide sale by the wife but was a mere evasion of the article of the civil code 1301 whereby the plain tiffs and her husband sought to secure from the wife payment to plaintiff and his partner and other creditors of her husband the amounts of their respective debts.\nThe evidence of Kenny convinces me that it was a collusive transaction between plaintiff and Chamber lin the husband, and the entry in plaintiff book under date of February 7th, in which he debits the husband with interest of $1,000 mortgage due Jan. 14th, 1879, shows that the transaction was not a sale but a loan to Pay the debts of plaintiffs and the other creditors of the husband.\nThe unsatisfactory evidence of the plaintiff entirely confirms me in these conclusions.\nSTRONG J.\u2014Was of opinion that the appeal should be allowed and. the judgment of the Superior Court restored for the reasons contained in the consid\u00e9rants of the judgment of Mr. Justice MacDougall.\nFOURNIER J.\u2014L'action des appelants originairement dirig\u00e9e contre Elizabeth Richie, \u00e9pouse s\u00e9par\u00e9e de biens de Richard Chamberlin, l'intim\u00e9 \u00e8s qualit\u00e9, est fond\u00e9e sur trois diff\u00e9rents actes de vente d'une m\u00eame propri\u00e9t\u00e9 appartenant \u00e0 la dite dame Elizabeth Richie.

Elle a plaid\u00e9 \u00e0 cette action par d\u00e9fense au fonds en fait et par deux exceptions:\u2014par la premi\u00e9re elle all\u00e8gue que les actes en question ne contiennent pas des ventes r\u00e9elles, mais qu'au contraire ces actes sont feints et simul\u00e9s, et n'ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pass\u00e9s dans cette forme que pour garantir le paiement d'argent avanc\u00e9 et pr\u00eat\u00e9, et non pas dans le but de transf\u00e9rer la propri\u00e9t\u00e9, et de fait n'ont pas transf\u00e9r\u00e9 la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 y d\u00e9sign\u00e9e.\nPar la 2me exception, elle all\u00e8gue encore que ces actes sont feints et simul\u00e9s \u00e0 la connaissance des appelants, et qu'ils n'ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faits que dans le but d'\u00e9luder l'effet de l'article 1301 du code civil; qu'\u00e0 la connais sance des dits appelants, la dite Elizabeth Richie n'a consenti les dits actes que dans le but d'obtenir de l'argent pour payer les dettes de son mari envers le demandeur, l'appelant, son associ\u00e9 et d'autres cr\u00e9anciers; que cet argent a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 la. connaissance de l'appelant et de son associ\u00e9 et par eux-m\u00eames employ\u00e9 \u00e0 payer les dettes de son mari. La, Cour Sup\u00e9rieure si\u00e9geant \u00e0 Aylmer, appel\u00e9e \u00e0 d\u00e9cider ce litige, a donn\u00e9 gain de cause \u00e0 l'appelant. Son jugement, porte en appel \u00e0 la cour du Bane de la Reine, a \u00e9t\u00e9 infirm\u00e9 \u00e0 l'unanimit\u00e9 des juges pr\u00e9sents. C'est de ce dernier jugement dont il s'agit maintenant.\nLes faits \u00e9tablis en preuve justifient pleinement le jugement de la cour du Bane de la Reine. Il ne peut pas y avoir l'ombre d'un doute que ces trois actes de vente d'une m\u00eame propri\u00e9t\u00e9 ne sont que des actes simul\u00e9s et nuls, et ne contiennent pas les v\u00e9ritables conventions des parties. La propri\u00e9t\u00e9 vendue appartenait \u00e0 Elizabeth Richie, femme s\u00e9par\u00e9e do biens, dont le mari \u00e9tait endett\u00e9 envers les appelants et vivement press\u00e9 par eux de s'acquitter. Elle ne leur devait rien. C'est dans le but d'assurer le paiement de leur cr\u00e9ance contre le mari qu'ils se sont faits consentir les divers actes de vente en question, pour trois prix diff\u00e9rents. Cette propri\u00e9t\u00e9, prouv\u00e9e valoir $5,000, est vendue par le premier acte pour $1,000, par le deuxi\u00e8me $750 et enfin $1000 par le troisi\u00e8me. Le fait de ces trois ventes successives, entre les m\u00eames parties, de la m\u00eame propri\u00e9t\u00e9, pour trois prix diff\u00e9rents, prouvent \u00e0 l'\u00e9vidence que l'intention des parties n'\u00e9tait pas de faire une vente s\u00e9rieuse pour un prix d\u00e9termin\u00e9 d'apr\u00e8s la valeur de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9. Il manque donc dans ces divers actes un \u00e9l\u00e9ment essentiel pour qu'il y ait eu vente, d'apr\u00e8s l'autorit\u00e9 suivante. Aubry et Rau ([25]).\nle prix doit \u00eatre s\u00e9rieux. Il ne saurait \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme tel, lorsqu'il pr\u00e9sente, avec la valeur r\u00e9elle de la chose vendue, une dis proportion telle, qu'il est \u00e9vident que les parties n'ont pu y voir un \u00e9quivalent r\u00e9elle de cette chose. Note 26, Pothier nos. 18 et 19; Duranton XVI, 100 et 104: 1, Duvergier 148 et suivant. Zachari\u00e6, \u00a7 349, texte et note 23. Il ne faut pas confondre un prix non s\u00e9rieux ou d\u00e9risoire avec Un prix qui serait seulement entach\u00e9 do vilet\u00e9. La vilet\u00e9 du prix n'autorise pas l'action en rescision dans les cas pr\u00e9vus par l'article 1674. Au contraire une venee dont le prix serait d\u00e9risoire devrait \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme manquant do prix, et par cons\u00e9quent comme inexistante.\nBien que les parties aient donn\u00e9 \u00e0 leurs transactions la forme de l'acte de vente, il est \u00e9vident que leur in tention n' \u00e9tait pas de faire une vente s\u00e9rieuse. Le proc\u00e9d\u00e9 si \u00e9trange et si absurde des trois actes en question n'est qu'un d\u00e9guisement de leur v\u00e9ritable convention. Il est clair que l'objet des appelants n'\u00e9tait pas d'acqu\u00e9rir la propri\u00e9t\u00e9, mais seulement de se procurer une hypoth\u00e8que pour assurer le remboursement des avances qu'ils faisaient sous forme de prix de vente en m\u00eame temps que le paiement des autres cr\u00e9ances qu'ils avaient d\u00e9j\u00e0 contre 1e mari de la dite Elizabeth Richie consid\u00e9r\u00e9es comme autant d'hypoth\u00e8ques sur une propri\u00e9t\u00e9 qui valait beaucoup plus que les diverses sommes dues et avanc\u00e9es; cette transaction pr\u00e9sente au moins une apparence raisonnable, mais elle cesse alors d'\u00eatre une vente et n'est plus qu'une hypoth\u00e8que. En r\u00e9alit\u00e9 c'est un pr\u00eat qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait et non une vente. C'est aussi l'interpr\u00e9tation que l'appelant R. H. Klock a donn\u00e9 \u00e0 cette transaction en en faisant l\u2019entr\u00e9e dans son livre de compte o\u00f9 il en fait mention comme d'un\nMortgage, 7th. February, 1879, interest of $1,000 mortgage due January 4th, 1879, $150.\nIl est vrai que cette entr\u00e9e ne concerne que le premier acte, mais les deux autres n'\u00e9tant que la r\u00e9p\u00e9tition du premier doivent n\u00e9cessairement conserver aussi le caract\u00e8re de pr\u00eat et ne peuvent en cons\u00e9quence justifier les conclusions de laction r\u00e9clamant la possession de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9.\nCes pr\u00e9tendus actes de vente ne sont pas seulement nuls comme entach\u00e9s de simulation, mais ils le sont encore parceque \u00e0 la connaissance des appelants, ils n'ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faits par Elizabeth Richie, femme s\u00e9par\u00e9e de biens, que pour assurer le paiement des dettes de son mari envers les appelants et d\u2019autres cr\u00e9anciers.\nLa qualit\u00e9 de femme s\u00e9par\u00e9e de biens d'Elizabeth Richie est admise. La preuve \u00e9tablit que Richard, Chamberlin, son mari, \u00e9tait endett\u00e9 et qu'il y avait plusieurs jugements contre lui. On volt par le t\u00e9moignage de W. R. Kenney, employ\u00e9 par R. W. Klock pour faire \u00e0 Elizabeth Richie, la pr\u00e9tendue venderesse, la remise des diverses sommes stipul\u00e9es comme prix de vente, que l'emploi qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait de ces diverses sommes n'\u00e9tait pas \u00e0 son b\u00e9n\u00e9fice. Kenney, apr\u00e8s avoir re\u00e7u l'argent de R. M. Klock et l'avoir remis, pour la forme, \u00e0 Elizabeth. Richie, celle-ci lui rendit imm\u00e9diatement un montant suffisant pour payer le juge ment de Lauzon contre son mari, environ $463.74; aussi une autre somme de $229.00, montant de la dette du mari aux appelants. La somme de $700.00 pay\u00e9e lors de la deuxi\u00e8me vente fut employ\u00e9e \u00e0 payer une hypoth\u00e8que consentie par la dite Elizabeth Richie en faveur de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 du Service Civil. La somme de $107.91 montant de la troisi\u00e8me vente fut aussi remise par les appelants \u00e0 Kenney, qui la remit \u00e0 la dite dame Elizabeth Richie. Sun ce montant elle lui rendit de suite $321788 pour payer les appelants de la balance du compte que leur devait son mari, $150.00 pour int\u00e9r\u00eat d\u00fb sur la premi\u00e8re vente, $282 pour acquitter un juge ment de T. B. Poitras contre son mari, $174.13 due \u00e0 R. W. Sayer, $34 due \u00e0 Greenleese par Chamberlin, $42.00 montant d'un jugement contre son mari en faveur de Dame veuve C. W. Church. Ii ajoute qu'il agissait comme une sorte d'agent des Klocks en remettant ces argents \u00e0 la dite Dame Richie, et comme l'agent de cette derni\u00e8re en faisant les paiements qu'il \u00e9num\u00e8re.\nCette preuve ne laisse aucun doute sur le fait qu'une tr\u00e8s grande partie de l\u2019argent provenant des pr\u00e9tendues ventes n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 remise \u00e0 la dite Dame Richie que dans le but de d\u00e9naturer la transaction et de t\u00e2cher de lui donner l'apparence d'une transaction faite par elle m\u00eame pour son avantage personnel et dont elle avait profit\u00e9 en touchant elle-m\u00eame les deniers. Mais le voile dont on a essay\u00e9 de couvrir la transaction, laisse trop clairement voir que l'argent pay\u00e9 n'\u00e9tait pas destin\u00e9 \u00e0 rester entre les mains de la dite Dame Richie car il est aussit\u00f4t repris par los appelants pour se payer eux-m\u00eames, et d'autres cr\u00e9anciers, auxquels ils s'int\u00e9ressaient. Ii est donc \u00e9vident que les dites pr\u00e9 tendues ventes n'ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faits que pour en arriver \u00e0 se procurer les moyens de payer les dettes du mari de la dite Dame Richie et sont par tant nulles et sans effet comme contraires \u00e0 l'article 1301 du Code Civil. Cet article dit:\nLa femme ne peut s'obliger avec ou pour son mari, qu'en qualit\u00e9 de commune; toute obligation qu'elle contracte ainsi en autre qualit\u00e9 est nulle et sans effet.\nLa nullit\u00e9 cr\u00e9\u00e9e par cet article est d'ordre public et a toujours \u00e9t\u00e9 prononc\u00e9e par les tribunaux chaque fois qu'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 prouv\u00e9 qu\u2019une obligation en apparence con tract\u00e9e par la femme seule, \u00e9tait en r\u00e9alit\u00e9 pour les affaires de son mari. La jurisprudence sur cette question est bien \u00e9tablie par nombre de d\u00e9cisions qui ne permettent pas d'\u00e9lever de doute \u00e0 ce sujet. Il serait tout-\u00e0-fait inutile d'entrer dans la consid\u00e9ration des points de droit soulev\u00e9s \u00e0 ce sujet dans cette cause; car on peut consid\u00e9rer la discussion sur les questions comme \u00e0 peu pr\u00e9s \u00e9puis\u00e9e. Te me contenterai donc de r\u00e9f\u00e9rer \u00e0 quelques unes des principales causes o\u00f9 il a \u00e9t\u00e9 question de l'application de l'article 1301.\nUne de celle o\u00f9 la question a \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9e avec le plus de d\u00e9veloppement et de science par les avocats qui y \u00e9taient concern\u00e9s, est celle de Buckley y. Brunelle et vir. ([26]). L'honorable juge en chef Dorion occupait pour l'appelant et l'honorable juge Rainville pour les intim\u00e9s. Dans le rapport de cette cause on trouvera tous les arguments de part et autres et une revue com pl\u00e8te des autorit\u00e9s pour et contre. Cette belle et savante \u00e9tude de la questien a fait dire avec justice \u00e0 l'honorable juge Mondelet:\nEn discutant les questions les avocats de part et d'autre ont fait preuve d'une grande habilit\u00e9, et avec un luxe extraordinaire d'\u00e9ru dition l\u00e9gale, nous ont fait remonter aux sources v\u00e9n\u00e9r\u00e9es de notre droit jusqu'au senatus-consulte Vill\u00e9ien et nous ont aide dans nos d\u00e9lib\u00e9rations, des opinions de presque tons les commentateurs, sur cette fameuse disposition l\u00e9gale.\nLa lecture du rapport suffira pour faire voir que quels que soient les moyens d\u00e9tourn\u00e9s employ\u00e9s pour \u00e9luder l'article 1301, si la preuve peut porter ces faits \u00e0 Ia connaissance de la cour celle-ci annullera toute obligation contract\u00e9e directement ou indirectement par la femme en violation de cet article.\nDans la cause de Belanger et cie. v. Brown ([27]), dont les faits out une grande analogie avec ceux de la pr\u00e9 sente, le m\u00eame principe a re\u00e7u son application. Le r\u00e9sum\u00e9 de la d\u00e9cision est en ces termes:-\nThat a deed of sale made by a wife commune en biens to a third party of her propre for a pretended consideration of $400 when the real consideration was a lease of movables by the third party to her husband will be set aside as a contravention of C.C, 1301.\nL'honorable juge Berthelot qui a prononc\u00e9 le juge ment dans cette cause dit au sujet de la vente du bien propre de la femme:\u2014\nLa femme qui vend sont propre pour payer la dette de son mari on pour garantir ses obligations ei l'aider dans son commerce, ne s'oblige pas seulement comme commune, mais elle s'oblige directe mont pour son mari, et c'est Ce que la loi a en vue de prohiber sous quelque forme que ce soit, pour assurer la fortune de la femme de l'atteinte des mauvaises affaires do son mari.\nLe d\u00e9fendeur a rapport\u00e9 dans son factum l'opinion qui est donn\u00e9e comme celle du juge Meredith lors du jugement dans la cause de Boudrier v. McLean en appel:-\nA married woman unquestionably has the power of alienating her own propres to pay the debt of her husband.\nSi cette proposition est vraie, en droit abstraitement parlant, ce no peut \u00eatre que lorsque la femme re\u00e7oit r\u00e9ellement le prix do son propre, et l'emploie librement \u00e0 payer la dette de son mari, mais non pas dans ce cas-ci, lorsqu'elle le vend pour faire faire commerce \u00e0 son mari.\nCette maxime ne peut pas plus pr\u00e9valoir dans cette cause plus qu'elle n'a pr\u00e9valu dans la cause de Boudria v. NcLean auquel jugement le juge Meredith a concouru.\nLa preuve a \u00e9tabli d'une mani\u00e8re positive que dans le cas actuel la plus grande partie du pr\u00e9tendu prix de vente a \u00e9t\u00e9 employ\u00e9e \u00e0 payer les dettes du mari.\nDans la cause de Walker et vir. v. Crebassa Junior ([28]), la d\u00e9cision est ainsi r\u00e9sum\u00e9e:\u2014\u2014\n10. Que dans l'esp\u00e8ce actuelle la vente faite au d\u00e9fendeur, par la demanderesse s\u00e9par\u00e9e de biens, de certains immeubles qui lui sont propres, doit \u00eatre rescind\u00e9e sur le principe qu'aucune valeur n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 prouv\u00e9e lui avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 pay\u00e9e. 20. De plus, par la cour inf\u00e9rieure, que les engagements contract\u00e9s \u00e0 cette vente par la demanderesse l'avant \u00e9t\u00e9 pour les dettes de son mari, sont nuls en vertu de la 55me section du ch. 37 des statuts refondus du Bas-Canada.\nCette disposition contient le principe consacr\u00e9 par l'article 1301 C.C.et est con\u00e7ue dans les termes suivants:\nNulle femme mari\u00e9e ne pourra se porter caution ni encourir de responsabilit\u00e9 en aucune autre qualit\u00e9 que comme commune en biens avec son mari pour les dettes, obligations on engagements contract\u00e9s par le mari avant le mariage ou pendant la d\u00fbr\u00e9e du mariage, et tons engagements contract\u00e9s par une femme mari\u00e9e en violation de ces dispositions seront absolument nuls et de nul effet.\nDans cette cause comme dans celle dont il s'agit ici, la femme \u00e9tait s\u00e9par\u00e9e de biens et vendait une de ses propri\u00e9t\u00e9s pour payer une dette de son mari.\nDans La cause de La Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de Construction de St. Hyacinthe v. Brunelle et vir. ([29]), il a \u00e9t\u00e9 jug\u00e9 par l'hon. juge Sicotte: 1o. Que la femme mani\u00e9e et s\u00e9par\u00e9e de biens ne peut s'engager en aucune mani\u00e8re pour les affaires de son mari, et que si elle le fait, son engage ment sera cass\u00e9 et annul\u00e9 comme fait en fraude et en violation des lois d'ordre public. 20. Que pour savoir si l'obligation contract\u00e9e au nom de la femme seule, l'a \u00e9t\u00e9 pour les affaires de son mari, il convient de s'en-1 qu\u00e9rir de toutes les circonstances dans lesquelles l'obligation a \u00e9t\u00e9 contract\u00e9e et d'avoir \u00e9gard aux pr\u00e9somptions qui d\u00e9coulent des faits prouv\u00e9s. 30. Que dans l'esp\u00e8ce, bien que l\u2019obligation ait \u00e9t\u00e9 contract\u00e9e par la d\u00e9fenderesse seule, en faveur de la demanderesse, il r\u00e9sulte des faits prouv\u00e9s, que la demanderesee a contract\u00e9 avec le mari de la d\u00e9fenderesse et que cette derni\u00e8re a consenti une obligation hypoth\u00e9caire, en faveur de la demanderesse, pour compl\u00e9ter et assurer les transactions de son mari.\nDans la cause de Rh\u00e9aume v. Caille et vir. ([30]) il a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cid\u00e9 par l'honorable juge Johnson:\nThat an obligation made by a wife to repay money advanced for her husband's use is an absolute nullity: and even a representation by the wife to the lender that the money was for herself does not affect the case.\nIi serait inutile de multiplier d'avantage les d\u00e9cisions, car elles sont touets au m\u00eame effet. Quant aux opinions des jurisconsultes on en trouvera une collection \u00e0 peu pr\u00e9s compl\u00e9te dans la cause de Buckley v. Brunelle et vir. ([31]). Le principe sur lequel reposent les d\u00e9cisions cit\u00e9es plus haut est un article du code civil sur l'interpr\u00e9tation duquel nos cours ont \u00e9t\u00e9 unanimes Pour lui donner tout son effet il suffit de prouver, quelles que soient les voies indirectes employ\u00e9es pour obtenir l\u2019obligation de la femme mari\u00e9e, qu'en r\u00e9alit\u00e9 cette obligation n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 contract\u00e9e pour son b\u00e9n\u00e9fice, mais bien pour celui de son mari. Tout se r\u00e9duit donc \u00e0 une question de preuve. Celle faite en cette cause n'a pas laiss\u00e9 de doute sur le caract\u00e8re des transactions dont ii s'agit. Ii n'y a pas d'autres conclusions \u00e0 tirer de la preuve que celle que les di. vers actes de vente dont il s'agit sont feintes et simul\u00e9es et n'ont pris cette forme que pour. dissimuler Le fait que l\u2019obligation de la femme \u00e9tait contract\u00e9e en partie pour son mari. En cons\u00e9quence, ces actes sont nuls comme contraires \u00e0 l'article 1301 du Code civil et ont \u00e9t\u00e9 justement d\u00e9clar\u00e9s tels par le jugement de la Cour du Bane de la Reine qui doit \u00eatre confirm\u00e9. Appel renvoy\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens.\nHENRY J.-I am of opinion that this appeal should be dismissed There is evidence that the deeds of sale were simulated and were in truth a transaction by which the wife undertook to secure the payment of her husband's debts. The entries in the appellants' books as well as other documentary evidence, clearly show that the alleged sale was intended to operate as a mortgage. Now the law is very plain, and although it is unfortunate for the party who pays out his money under such circumstances he cannot expect course of justice to help him to get possession of property in contravention to art. 1301 of the civil code.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014Je concours dans le jugement de la majorit\u00e9 de cette cour. Au fond il ne s'agit que d'une question de fait, savoir: si les actes de vente consentis par madame Chamberlin en faveur de l'appelant sont simul\u00e9s. La cour d'appel ainsi que trois juges de cette cour sont d'avis que ces actes ont \u00e9t\u00e9 simul\u00e9s. Je con cours sur la question de fait, quant \u00e0 la question de droit elle ne peut souffrir aucune difficult\u00e9. Je suis d'avis que l'appel doit \u00eatre renvoy\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014The question in this case is simply one of fact, namely, whether the instrument of the 14th Jan., 1876, was executed as, and was intended to be, an absolute bon\u00e2 fide sale of the lands therein mentioned by Elizabeth Richie, or was it intended to operate by way of security only for the debts of her husband with the knowledge of the plaintiffs, while assuming the appearance of a sale for the purpose of evading the nullity imposed by article 1301 C.C.\nThe learned judges of the Court of Queen's Bench of Montreal in Appeal, have rendered judgment to the effect that it was executed with the intent of Operating as such security only and with intent to evade article 1301. I see no reason for differing from, on the contrary, I entirely concur in, this judgment\nThe instruments of the 23rd Feb., 1877; and 23rd Feb., 1878, which simply impose further charges upon the lands and qualify Mrs. Richie's right of redemption of the lands as expressed in the instrument of the 14th January 1876, unless and until those further charges should he also paid, support this conclusion, and the entry in the account of Mrs. Richie's husband in the plaintiffs' books, of the item, under date Feb. 7. 1879, of $150000 for interest on $1,000.00 mortgage, due \"Jan. 14th, 1879,\" and for which sum the plaintiff took additional security from the husband, puts the matter in my judgment beyond all doubt\u2014that sum of $150000 was a year's interest at 15 per cent. on the $1000.00 mentioned as the consideration of the deed of the 14th January, 1876 which sum was by that deed expressed to be payable by the wife, and only in the event of her redeeming the lands under the provision in the deed in that behalf contained. The plaintiffs having subsequently taken security from the husband for a year's interest due on the 14th Jan. 1879 on the $1,000.00 mentioned in the deed of Jan. 1876 speaking of it as a mortgage in the account kept in their own books with the husband, places beyond all doubt that the deed of Jan. 1876 was executed by way of security only for the husband's debt, and the form given to that deed is explicable only as by way of evasion of the article 1301. The deed therefore is wholly void and, it failing, the plaintiffs can have no better title by the subsequent deeds whatever use was made of the money which constituted the consideration for them respectively, the greater part of which. however, was, with the knowledge of the plaintiffs advanced by them for payment of the husband's debt to themselves and others upon the security of the additional charges, expressed in the deeds, respectively imposed by Mrs. Richie upon the lands mentioned in the deed of Jan. 14th, 1876. The appeal should there fore be dismissed with costs and the judgment below varied so as to dismiss simply the plaintiffs' action in the Superior Court with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for appellant: J.

Ritchie C.J. and Strong, Fournier, Henry, Taschereau and Gwynne JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.\nWritten instrument\u2014Construction of\u2014Lease or license\u2014Authority to work\u20148 Anne ch. 14 s. 1.\nIn an indenture describing the parties as lessor and lessees respectively the granting part was as follows: \u201cDoth give, grant, demise and lease unto the said (lessees) the exclusive right, liberty and privilege of entering at all times for and during the term of ten years from 1st January, 1879, in and upon (describing the land) and with agents, laborers and teams to search for, dig, excavate, mine and carry away the iron ores in, upon or under said premises, and of making all necessary roads, &c., also the right, liberty and privilege to erect on the said premises the buildings, machinery and dwelling houses required in the business of mining and shipping the said iron ores, and to deposit on said premises all refuse material taken out in mining said ores.\u201d There was a covenant by the grantees not to do unnecessary damage and a provision for taking away the erections made and for the use of timber on the premises and such use of the surface as might be needed.\nThe grantees agreed to pay twenty-five cents for every ton of ore mined, in quarterly payments on certain fixed days, and it was provided how the quantity should be ascertained. It was also agreed that the royalty should not be less than a certain sum in any year. The grantees also agreed to pay all taxes and not to allow intoxicating drinks to be manufactured on the premises or carry on any business that might be deemed a nuisance. There were provisions for terminating the lease before the expiration of the term and covenant by the lessor for quiet enjoyment.\nIn an interpleader issue, where the lessor claimed a lien on the goods of the lessees for a year\u2019s rent due under the said indenture by virtue of 8 Anne ch. 14 sec. 1,\nHeld, per Ritchie C.J., and Henry and Taschereau JJ., that this instrument was not a lease but a mere license to the grantee to mine and ship the iron ores, and the grantor had no lien for rent under the statute. Strong, Fournier and Gwynne JJ. contra.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] affirming the judgment of the Queen\u2019s Bench Division[2] by which a verdict for the defendants on the trial was set aside and judgment entered for the plaintiff.\nThis is an interpleader issue under the following circumstances:\nThe defendant Lynch having obtained judgment against the Hastings Iron Co., the goods and chattels in question were seized under an execution issued on said judgment. The plaintiff claimed that $2,400 was due him for rent of the premises on which the goods were seized, under the statute 8 Anne ch. 14, and the issue was brought to test his right to the goods on such claim. The defendant Barnum was made a party as being interested in said judgment.\nThe sole question to be determined in this case is whether the instrument under which the plaintiff claims such rent to be due is a lease or a mere license. Such instrument is as follows:\u2014\nThis indenture made in duplicate this twelfth day of November, in the year of our Lord One Thousand Eight Hundred and Seventy-Eight, in pursuance of the Act respecting short forms of leases.\nBETWEEN Frederick Elisha Seymour, of the Township of Madoc in the County of Hastings and Province of Ontario, gentleman, known hereinafter as the lessor of the first part, and Charles J. Pusey, of Sodus Point, in State of New York, gentleman, and A.W. Humphreys, of the city of Brooklyn, in the State of New York, gentleman, jointly and severally, and known hereinafter as the lessees of the second part. WITNESSETH: That the said party of the first part, for and in consideration of the rents and royalties to be paid, and of the covenants, agreements and conditions hereinafter named to be kept and performed by the said parties of the second part, their heirs, executors, administrators, assigns and successors hath and by these presents doth give, grant, demise and lease unto the said parties of the second part, their successors or assigns, the exclusive right, liberty and privilege of entering at all times, for and during the term of ten years from the first day of January, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and seventy-nine, in and upon that certain tract of land situated in the township of Madoc aforesaid, consisting of the west half of lot number eleven, in the fifth concession of the said Township of Madoc, containing by admeasurement one hundred acres of land, be the same more or less, reserving that portion thereof occupied or hereafter to be occupied as roadway by the Belleville and North Hastings Railway, and with agents, laborers and teams, to search for, dig, excavate mine and carry away the iron ores in, upon or under said premises, and of making all necessary roads for ingress and egress to, over, and across the same, to public roads or places of shipment; also the right, liberty and privilege to erect on the said premises the buildings, machinery and dwelling houses required in the business of mining and shipping the said iron ores, and to deposit on said premises all refuse material taken out in mining said ores. The said parties of the second part to do no unneccessary damage to said premises, and at the termination of this indenture, and for three months thereafter, as well as during its continuance, the said parties of the second part, their successors and assigns are to have the right to take down and remove their erections before named and to take away ores mined, and to use such timber as may be found on the premises as may be required in carrying on mining operations and such use of the surface as may be needed for all other purposes appertaining thereto.\nIn consideration whereof, the parties of the second \u2022 part, their heirs, executors, administrators, assigns and successors agree to pay to the party of the first part, his heirs and assigns, twenty-five cents of lawful money of Canada for every ton of twenty-two hundred and forty pounds of clean and merchantable iron ore mined and taken away from the said premises by them the quantity of the iron ore so taken away to be ascertained by the scales and records of the Belleville and North Hasting Railway Company or the books of the lessees of said railway, access to whose books and. records is hereby assured to the lessor, whenever desired by him in order to ascertain the quantity of ore shipped and the amount of royalty due to him Payments of royalty are to be made quarterly on first days of January, April, July and October in each and every year at the village of Madoc, in the county of Hastings, during the continuance of this lease, the first payment to be made on the first day of April, one thousand eight hundred and seventy-nine.\nThen follows certain covenants by the lessees as to getting out a specified quantity of ore each year, due payment of the royalties, payment of taxes, &c., and a provision for termination of the lease before the expiration of the term. There is also a covenant by the lessor for quiet possession and a warranty of title.\nOn the trial a verdict was given for the defendants, the learned judge holding that the above instrument was not a lease but a license. The Queen\u2019s Bench Division reversed this decision and on appeal to the Court of Appeal the court was equally divided and the judgment of the Queen\u2019s Bench Division was sustained. The defendants then appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nNorthrup for the appellant.\nThere is only the one question to be determined, namely, whether this document is a lease within the statute of Anne or a mere license to dig and mine.\nThat it cannot be held to be a lease is clear on the authority of Doe d. Hartley v. Wood[3].\nIn the case of Roads v. Overseers of Trumpington[4] relied on by the respondents the circumstances were very different and that case does not apply.\nClute for the respondent.\u2014The document is called a lease by the parties and contains the usual provisions of a lease. The lessee had the exclusive right of entry. Roads v. Overseers of Trumpington4 is strongly against the appellant.\nSir W.J. RITCHIE C.J.\u2014(After reading the material portion of the lease his lordship proceeded as follows):\nThe only question in this case is as to the character of the instrument of the 12th November, 1878, made between the plaintiff of the first part and Pusey and Humphries of the second part. Was it a lease of the premises mentioned or a mere license to enter and search and take the iron ore? If a lease it is conceded that the respondent should succeed.\nI think it is no lease but an exclusive license or liberty to enter on the premises mentioned in the instrument for the purpose of searching for and severing and carrying away the iron ores in, upon or under the said premises.\nThe intention of the parties must be collected from the terms of the instrument. The language of the statute under which it is claimed these goods are not liable to be taken, 8 Anne ch. 14, is as follows:\u2014\nNo goods or chattels whatsoever lying and being in or upon any messuage, lands or tenements which are or shall be leased for life or lives for term of years at will or otherwise, shall be liable to be taken by virtue of any execution.\nAnd in the second clause, which applies to the fraudalent removal of goods different words are used:\nAny messuages, lands or tenements, upon the demise whereof any rents are or shall be reserved or made payable.\nI have been unable, after a most careful perusal and consideration of the document in question, to discover evidence of any intent of the parties that the lands in question shall be leased for a term of years, in other words, that the grantor or licensor should divest himself of the possession of the premises and the licensee should come into it for a determinate period, but the contrary; all that was granted was liberty to search for and work the mines of iron ore, a grant of a smaller interest than might have been passed by the licensor. Had the parties intended that there should be a demise of the land as well as the right to enter, search for, dig and work it might have been done in simple, plain language, which I fail to see in this deed. There is a very broad distinction between a privilege to search for and obtain minerals and a sole and exclusive occupation of the land itself. Humphrey v. Brogden[5], very clearly shows that while the possession of the surface and the mine may go together the two may be separated and then they are as distinct as several closes, and in Keyse v. Powell[6], Lord Campbell delivering the judgment of the court said:\u2014\nThe surface and the minerals maybe dissevered in title, and be come separate tenements, as appears abundantly from the cases cited; Curtis v. Daniel,[7]; and Humphreys v. Brogden[8]\nThe deed seems to me to express, very intelligently and but for the difference of judicial opinion I should say very clearly, what the licensor intended to grant, viz., in the language of the deed:\nThe exclusive right, liberty and privilege of entering at all times for and during the term of ten years from the first day of January, in the year of Our Lord one thousand eight hundred and seventy-nine, in and upon that certain tract of land situated in the township of Madoc aforesaid, consisting of the west half of lot No. 11, in the 5th concession, of the said township of Madoc, containing by admeasurement 100 acres of land, be the same more or less\/reserving that portion thereof occupied or hereafter to be occupied as road way by the Belleville and North Hastings Railway, and with agents. laborers, and teams,\nTo do what?\nto search for, dig, excavate, mine and carry away the iron ores in, upon or under said premises, and of making all necessary roads for ingress and egress to, over, and across the same, to public roads or places of shipment; also the right, liberty and privilege to erect on the said premises the buildings, machinery and dwelling houses required in the business of mining and shipping the said iron ores, and to deposit on said premises all refuse material taken out in mining said ores.\nHere we have not a word as to the occupation or possession of the land except as may be necessary to the mining and shipping the ores discovered on the land authorized to be searched for, but simply a right of entry for a specific purpose and the liberty of erecting the buildings, &c., required in the business of mining and shipping the ores, and for which authority was given to search and mine and carry away; but we have a very significant intimation that the provision quoted was not to apply to the possession and occupation of the land, for the deed, after providing that the parties of the second part should do no unnecessary damage and that at the termination of the indenture and for three months thereafter, as well as during its continuance the parties of the second part should have the right to take down and remove their erections and to take away the ores mined, it then proceeds to deal with the use of the surface; after providing that the licensee may use such timber as may be then found on the premises as may be required in carrying on mining operations, it proceeds to provide for the limited use of the surface in these words:\nand such use of the surface as may be needed for all other purposes appertaining thereto.\nThat is, appertaining to the mining operations. Does not this show, negatively, that the licensee is not to have the use or possession of the surface not needed for the positive purposes specified? It appears to me to show conclusively that the possession of the surface and the mine were treated as separate and distinct closes and that the privilege of the use of the timber was confined to what might be required in carrying on mining operations and the use of the surface was confined to purposes appertaining to mining operations and to those alone, and that there was no intention to interfere with the rights of the licensor beyond what was incident to those operations, and therefore that the deed was not intended to interfere with the licensor\u2019s dealing with the surface subject always to the rights of the licensee with reference to searching for and working the mines of iron ore.\nI therefore think this instrument cannot be so construed as to prevent the licensor, subject to such rights of the licensee, dealing with and using the surface of the land as if this deed had not been made, either by using it for agricultural purposes or, should a mine of coal or other mineral be discovered on this land, working such a mine or granting a precisely similar privilege or right of entry to any other parties to enter and search for coal or any other minerals and if discovered to work the mine so discovered upon the same terms and conditions as expressed in this license, not, however, interfering, by himself or his licensees, with the rights and privileges granted under the deed in this case with respect to the iron ores, the entry under this deed being merely in reference to the iron ore no other mines or rights in other mines being available to the licensee tinder this license.\nIn consideration of the rights and privileges conferred the parties agree to pay 25 cts. for every ton of 2,240 pounds of clean and merchantable iron ore mined, payments to be made quarterly, the first payment to be made on the first of April, 1879, and the parties agree to mine, &c., in each year a certain number of tons, and the parties of the second part agree to pay all taxes and perform all statute labor assessed upon the premises and not to allow any manufacture or traffic in any intoxicating drinks upon said premises, and will not carry on any business that may be deemed a nuisance thereupon. There is a provision for the termination of the license on non-fulfilment of the conditions and covenants for quiet possession and a covenant that the licensor will warrant and secure the parties \u201cin the rights and privileges herein granted them from all and every other person or persons whatsoever;\u201d which rights and privileges are simply, in my opinion, a license to enter and search and mine the iron ores found and not to meddle or interfere with the surface or the mines beyond the limited permission given to use the surface as before referred to. I can discover nothing in these last provisions which are calculated to interfere with the construction I have indicated or to give the licensees any other and larger rights to or interests in the lands as lessees thereof beyond what is given them by the express terms of the deed.\nSTRONG J.\u2014The action in the court below was an interpleader issue directed to try the right to certain property seized in execution on the 7th of January, 1884, by the sheriff of Hastings under a writ of fieri facias tested the 7th day of January, 1884, issued out of the Queen\u2019s Bench division of the high court of justice of Ontario, upon a judgment of that court recovered by John Lynch at his suit against the Hastings Iron Company; in this issue the respondent, Frederick Elisha Seymour, was plaintiff and the appellant, John Lynch, was defendant.\nThe goods in question were seized on the west half of lot No. 11 in the 5th concession of Madoc.\nThe respondent claimed one year\u2019s rent as against the execution amounting to $2,400, under a lease bearing date the 12th day of November, 1876.\nThe property seized has been sold by the sheriff, and the money, $750, is now in the sheriff\u2019s hands to abide the result of the interpleader issue.\nThere was at the time of the seizure $6,500 due for rent under the lease.\nThe lease in question is set out in the report of the case before the Queen\u2019s Bench division in 7 O.R. 471.\nThe respondent claims the proceeds of sale of the goods to satisfy his rent under 8 Anne, ch. 14.\nThe appellant resists this claim upon the ground that the instrument or the 12th of November, 1878, is a license and not a lease, and that the statute of Anne does not apply. The question for determination is as to whether the instrument of the 12th of November, 1878, is a lease or a mere license.\nThe issue was tried before Mr. Justice Patterson without a jury, who gave judgment for the appellants the execution creditors, holding that the instrument in question was not a lease but a license. This judgment was reversed by the Queen\u2019s Bench division and that decision was afterwards affirmed by the Court of Appeal, the judges in the latter court being equally divided in opinion, the Chief Justice and Mr. Justice Burton adopting the view of Mr. Justice Patterson, and Mr. Justice Osier and Mr. Justice Ferguson agreeing in opinion with the Queen\u2019s Bench division. The defendants in the issue, the execution creditors, have now appealed to this court.\nAfter some hesitation and fluctuation of opinion I have come to the conclusion that the view of the Queen\u2019s Bench Division and of the learned judges who agreed with them in the Court of Appeal was correct, and that the appeal must be dismissed. \u2018\nThere can be no question that if we are to construe this indenture as conferring upon the lessees an exclusive right of entry upon the land\u2014that is, a right to enter exclusive of the grantor\u2014it amounts to a demise of the land itself. Roads v. Trumpington[9]; Chetham v. Williamson[10]. The words of grant or demise are as follows:\u2014\nWITNESSETH: That the said party of the first part, for and m consideration of the rents and royalties to be paid, and of the covenants, agreements and conditions hereinafter named to be kept and performed by the said parties of the second part, their heirs, executors, administrators, assigns and successors hath and by these presents doth give, grant, demise and lease unto the said parties of the second part, their successors or assigns, the exclusive right, liberty and privilege of entering at all times, for and during the term of ten years from the first day of January, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and seventy-nine, in and upon that certain tract of land situated in the Township of Madoc aforesaid, consisting of the west half of lot number eleven, in the fifth concession of the said Township of Madoc, containing by admeasurement one hundred acres of land, be the same more or less, reserving that portion thereof occupied or hereafter to be occupied as roadway by the Belleville and North Hastings Railway, and with agents, laborers and teams, to search for, dig, excavate mine and carry away the iron ores in, upon or under said premises, and of making all necessary roads for ingress and egress to, over, and across the same, to public roads or places of shipment; also the right, liberty and privilege to erect on the said premises the buildings, machinery and dwelling houses required in the business of mining and shipping the said iron ores, and to deposit on said premises all refuse material taken out in mining said ores. The said parties of the second part to do no unnecessary damage to said premises, and at the termination of this indenture, and for three months thereafter as well as during its continuance the said parties of the second part, their successors and assigns are to have the right to take down and remove their erections before named and to take away ores mined, and to use such timber as may be found on the premises as may be required in carrying on mining operations and such use of the surface as may be needed for all other purposes appertaining thereto.\nThese words are, no doubt, to a certain extent ambiguous, for it is not clear whether it was intended to give the lessees an exclusive right of entry, with the power to excavate, mine and carry away iron ore superadded, or whether it was the intention merely to give an exclusive license to excavate and carry away the ore and for that purpose, and as incidental thereto, to enter upon the land. The respondent, of course, contends for the* latter construction and the appellant for that first mentioned.\nThe first observation which it occurs to me to make is. that as there is a real ambiguity in the expressions used the deed is to be construed most strongly contra proferentem, that is, against the grantor; and we are, therefore, to ascribe to it an operation which would confer upon the grantee the largest interest which the words will admit, and this requires us to read the language used in the sense contended for by the respondent, as granting an exclusive right of entry and so amounting to a demise. If, therefore, there was nothing else in the deed confirmatory of this construction I should, upon this consideration alone, be prepared to concur in the judgment of the Queen\u2019s Bench division.\nThere are, however, other provisions in the instrument which seem to me to be conclusive of the question in controversy. The lessees are to be at liberty to erect on the premises buildings, machinery and dwelling houses. Now it is not to be doubted that it was intended that these erections should be and remain, during the term, in the exclusive possession of the lessees who were guaranteed the quiet enjoyment of them, and if the exclusive possession of these houses and buildings was to be in the lessees it follows, of course, that the land on which they were erected should also be and remain in the like exclusive possession of the lessees. Then how is it possible to say that it was intended to discriminate between the land occupied by these erections and the other land comprised in the lease? Further, the liability to pay taxes and perform statute labor is imposed on the lessees, a provision altogether inconsistent with the notion that they are to have no interest in the land beyond that of mere licensees. The lessees also covenanted not to allow any manufacture of, or traffic in, intoxicating drinks upon the premises, and this covenant they could not properly perform unless they had the exclusive occupation and possession of the land itself. They also undertook not to carry on upon the premises any business which might be deemed a nuisance, a provision which, by itself, plainly implies an exclusive occupation by them. There is also the claim of re-entry which, although if it stood alone, might have been insufficient to have stamped the character of a lease on the instrument yet, when considered with the other clauses mentioned, is a circumstance of great weight as warranting the inference that the lessees were to have an exclusive occupation.\nAll these provisions, although they might not be conclusive if it were not for the ambiguity before pointed out in the operative words of demise, yet, taken in conjunction with those words and with the principle of construction which requires the deed to be read most strongly against the grantor, leave in my mind no doubt that the Queen\u2019s Bench Division rightly held this instrument to be a lease, operating as a demise of the land itself and not a mere license to mine and take away the minerals.\nThere is a plain distinction between this case and that of Doe d. Hartley v. Wood[11], for in that case the instrument which was held to be a license contained no words of demise, like those we find in this indenture, of the exclusive right of entry.; had there been such words there can be little doubt, from what is said by Lord Tenterden C.J. in giving the judgment of the court, that the decision would have been different.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nFOURNIES J. was also of the opinion that the appeal should be dismissed.\nHENRY J.\u2014I entirely concur in the views contained in the judgment delivered by the learned Chief Justice. This document must be read in connection with the surrounding circumstances and with the knowledge derived from the admissions of the parties.\nThe instrument undertakes to give to the parties named as the lessees, their heirs, executors, &c., the exclusive right, liberty and privilege of entering at all times. What is the meaning of that? It is the exclusive right of entering at all times on the land of the lessor. No more than that. If they were only to enter once it would have been very easy to say, in so many words, \u201cwe lease you the land for so many years on these conditions.\u201d But here the words used are \u201cgive, grant, demise and lease.\u201d These are words referring to certain absolute conveyances of land and have a well known, definite meaning which can be applied to the construction of any document. Here, under a grant or demise for ten years the grantees had an exclusive right to enter at all times. Now, as I stated before, if they were only to enter once why was it necessary to provide that they could enter at all times?\nThe privilege of entering at all times was given for the purpose of allowing the grantee to search for, dig, excavate, mine and carry away the iron ores, and to make all necessary roads for ingress and egress over the premises to public roads or places of shipment. But if the grantees were to have a lease of the land there was no necessity to give them this special license. They were also to have the, right, liberty and privilege of erecting on the premises the buildings, machinery and dwelling houses required in the business of mining and shipping the said iron ores. That is a limited license. They were to erect buildings on the land but for a special purpose. There is no general authority under this document to put up dwelling houses, stores or barns, but a special authority to erect certain buildings required in the mining of said ores.\nThen there are other provisions. The grantees were to deposit on the premises all refuse material taken out in mining said ores. These parties had a license to work, to mine, to take and carry away the ore, and here was a special authority given them to pile their refuse stuff on the premises. Again, they were to do no unnecessary damage, and were to be allowed the use of the timber on the premises for their mining operations \u201cand such use of the surface as might be needed for all other purposes appertaining thereto.\u201d Their use, then, of the surface was limited and they were to have a special right to use such timber on the premises as might be required for their purposes. Now looking at the whole of this document what does it after all amount to? Could any one say that this was a lease which would deprive the lessor from working, say, a coal mine found on the land? That is the way documents of this kind are to be looked at. We must look to see what the words in it apply to, and if they only apply to the subject of license we must construe them accordingly. Words that are inapplicable should not be considered.\nI would, therefore, look at this document with the construction I think the whole of it bears, taking it altogether and leaving out the effect of the two or three words \u201cgrant, demise, &c.\u201d These words we must limit, I take it, in this way\u2014\u201cI grant you, demise to you, etc., the special right of doing so and so for ten years.\u201d It is not a lease by which anything more* than this is given.\nUnder these circumstances I cannot come to the conclusion that this is a lease. Under the statute referred to the grantor has no lien for rent and therefore I think the judgment should be in favor of the execution creditors. The appeal should be allowed and the judgment of the court below reversed.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014The question in this case, which seems to be a very simple one at first sight proves to be not so clear after all. On the trial Mr. Justice Patterson ruled that it was a license; the Queen\u2019s Bench Division held it a lease and in the Court of Appeal two judges held it the one and two the other. In this court we are divided, three to three. I am of opinion that it is a license and not a lease. Mr. Justice Ferguson calls it a lease coupled with a license.\nMy judgment would be to allow the appeal. I would adopt the reasoning of Mr. Justice Burton in the Court of Appeal. GWYNNE J.\u2014In my opinion the indenture is a lease of the whole lot with liberty to search for and take out ore in any part of it, and the provision near the end, as to taking timber, and as to dealing with the surface, is to enable the lessee to use the timber for mining purposes and so to deal with the surface as might be necessary for mining purposes, which acts could not be done by a lessee of land as a farm; the condition of these acts being authorized being that they should be done bon\u00e2 fide for mining purposes.\nAppeal dismissed without costs.\nSolicitors for appellants: Denmark & Northrup.\nSolicitors for respondent: Clute & Williams.\n[1] 12 Ont.

The indictment contained two separate and distinct counts. In the first count the defendant was charged with having committed perjury in a deposition which he had given on the 1st day of April 1885, when he was examined as a witness in a case then pending in the Superior Court, wherein he, Downie, was plaintiff, and Frederick W. Francis was defendant.\"\n\u201cBy the second count, the defendant was charged with having committed perjury on the 8th day of April 1887 when examined on faits et articles on the the contestation of a saisie avv\u00eat or attachment made in the same cause in the hands of one Benjamin Cl\u00e9ment.\"\n\u201cAfter the close of the case for the prosecution the first count of the indictment was withdrawn from the consideration of the jury by the court, on the ground that there was no legal proof of the swearing of the stenographer by whom the deposition had been taken, and the defendant was directed to proceed to his evidence on the second count. The assignment of perjury in this count was as follows:\"\n\u201cAnd further the jurors of Our Lady the Queen, upon their oath present that:\u201d\n'' Heretofore, to wit, in a certain suit bearing the number one thousand and eight among the records of the Superior Court for the District of Montreal, in which Donald Downie of the City of Montreal advocate, was plaintiff, and Frederic W. Francis was defendant, upon the contestation of a writ of saisie arr\u00eat after judgment issued therein by the said Donald Downie against the said Frederick W Francis, in the hands of Benjamin Cl\u00e9ment in his quality of curator as garnishee, whose declaration declared that he owed the said Frederick W Francis a life rent which life rent the said Frederick W. Francis contended was unseizable by reason of its being an alimentary allowance, he the said Donald Downie was during the trial of the issues raised upon the said garnishee\u2019s declaration duly examined, on the part of the said Frederick W. Francis, upon interrogatories sur faits et articles, and was then and there duly sworn, to wit, on the eighteenth day of April 1887, before the Honorable Mr. Justice Ouimet then holding the Superior Court at the City of Montreal aforesaid, and did (sic) (the word '' then \" is not in the indictment,) and there upon his oath aforesaid, falsely, wilfully and. corruptly depose and. swear in substance and to the effect following: that he owes nothing either legally or morally in any way for board or other small items, all of which debts had been paid by him, the said Donald Downie long ago. That the said Frederick W. Francis from about the early part of one thousand eight hundred and eighty till towards the end of one thousand eight hundred and eighty-one, owed him, the said Donald Downie for everything which went to make up the necessaries of life, not only for the rent of his rooms, but his whole living during that period of time without any interruption scarcely except a day or two at a time, when he might have been elsewhere, he lived at his the said Donald Downie's expense altogether. That he the said Donald Downie always paid his own board. That he and the said Frederick W. Francis lived together during one thousand eight hundred and eighty and one thousand eight hundred and eighty-one. That the said Frederic W. Francis lived with him the said Donald Downie and depended upon him exclusively for his livelihood (sic) and the said Frederick W. Francis had no means of any kind: The negative averments to this second count of the indictment are as follows:\n\u201cWhereas in truth and in fact the said Donald Downie did at the time of answering the said interrogatories sut faits et articles and does still owe for board and other small debts, and more particularly to one Madame Duperrousel and to one Larin, and all of such debts had not then and have not yet been paid and he did not pay his board wherever he lived and he did then and does now owe for that purpose; and whereas in truth and in fact the said Frederick W. Francis from the early part of one thousand eight hundred and eighty till towards the end of one thousand eight hundred and eighty-one did not owe the said Donald Downie for everything which went to make up the necessaries of life, and did not owe him for rent of his rooms and his living during the whole or any considerable part of that time, and did not during that period live altogether at the said Donald Downie's expense without any interruption scarcely and in truth and in fact the said Frederick W. Francis did not, during the years one thousand eight hundred and eighty and one thousand eight hundred and eighty-one, depend exclusively upon the said Donald Downie for his livehood (sic) and it is entirely false that the said Frederick W. Francis had no means of any kind.\"\n\u201cBut on the contrary during that period from the month of December, one thousand eight hundred and seventy-nine, to and including November, one thousand eight hundred and eighty (sic) (the word, he, is omitted in. the indictment), received from his mother's estate divers sums of money, amounting in all to fifteen hundred and forty dollars, which he used for his support and otherwise, and during the period from February, one thousand eight hundred and eighty-one, to August, one thousand eight hundred and eighty-one (at which date the said Frederick W. Francis left for the city of New York in the United States of America, and was absent for more than one year) the said Frederick W. Francis incurred personal debts at different places and to different people for rooms and board which were charged against himself.\"\n\u201cAnd the said Donald Downie did thereby commit wilful and corrupt perjury.\"\nIn September last the defendant moved to quash the indictment as illegal, irregular, vague and insufficient in law for among other reasons.\n\u201c7thly. Because the plaintiff has not set out or alleged in said indictment clearly or legally the depositions or answers of defendant against which perjury is assigned, nor recited intelligibly any part thereof, in the manner in which he is bound to do in order that the same may be negatived by him, the matters and allegations against which perjury is assigned not being positive or precise statements and not being positively and precisely negatived by the plaintiff in the said indictment as required by law, said affirmative averments being merely relative terms and matters of opinion, not being positively negatived nor susceptible of being precisely or positively denied in the terms and manner required by law.\"\n\u201cThis motion to quash was rejected. The defendant pleaded not guilty and at the trial which took place before me in the term of November last, the prosecution adduced evidence on both counts but having failed to prove the first count, that count as already stated, was withdrawn from the jury, who brought in a verdict of guilty on the second count.\"\n\"The record in the case of Downie against Francis was proved, including the writ of saisie arr\u00eat in the hands of Benjamin Cl\u00e9ment, as curator, the declaration of Clement as garnishee, the contestation of the saisie arr\u00eat by Francis, the rule for faits et articles the oath taken by Downie before judge Ouimet and his answers on faits et articles and the signature thereto.\"\n\"The following are the most important parts of the oral evidence adduced by the prosecution to prove the other faces on which perjury was assigned.\"\n\u201cFrederick W Francis, the private prosecutor. Became acquainted with Mr. Downie, the defendant in 1878. My mother was interdicted at the end of 1879 and I commenced to act as curator in 1880. I became intimate with defendant in the Spring of 1880 I went to board at Mr. Downie's house. Up to that time I lived on the money I drew from the estate of my mother From the beginning of 1880 till October 1880, I drew from that source something over $1500. Mr. Downie was aware of my circumstances from the end of May 1880. In May 1880 I was indebted to him for board. At the end of May 1880 or end of June 1880 he capiased me for the amount of about $42 or $40 odd dollars I owed him for board till that time. Mr. Mercier the bailiff arrested me and I settled the next morning and this settled all accounts between myself and Mr. Downie up to that time.\"\n\u201cIn June and July of that year, I boarded at Frank Larin's and a few weeks at Mde. Duperrousel. Mr. Downie paid nothing for my board or for necessaries of life to Mr. Larin or Madame Duperrousel, during that time. I paid for my own board to these parties. During the entire month of August 1880 I was at Lachute and may have run to Montreal for a day or two, but substantially I was there all the month. Mr. Downie was there also I returned to Montreal in the end of August or the first September. The expenses of the party consisting of Mr. Downie, his sister, two Misses Burroughs, Mr. c. S. Burroughs, Wm. Burroughs and myself, were paid by us all in equal shares of $10 a piece. I paid my share. After returning to Montreal, I boarded at Frank Larin's in September and October of 1880. Mr. Larin sued me for part of my board which I have not paid. To the best of my belief Mr. Downie was boarding at Larin's in September and October. He did not pay my board and was sued for his own board at the same time that I was sued myself.\"\n\u201cIn October I was removed from the curatorship of my mother and Benjamin Cl\u00e9ment was appointed conseil judiciaire. From that time October till the end of 1880 I received $40 from the curator Cl\u00e9ment. It was to Downie's knowledge, for he received $14 or $15 of the $40, and he received this $14 or $15 on an order I gave him on Cl\u00e9ment. I paid my board or was charged with it from October 1880 to the end of 1880. Mr. Downie paid nothing for me during that time. During January, February and March, 1881, I had part of a room rented on Bleury street at Mrs. Radfordss with Mr. Downie and one Hipple. Mr. Downie paid one month, Hippie paid another month and Mrs. Radford still holds me responsible for another month.\"\n\u201cAfter March 1881 I lived at the Victoria Hotel in this city, Latour street. In April, May, June, July and August I incurred an indebtedness for my board towards Britain proprietor of the hotel.\u201d\n\"Having read answers of Mr. Downie on faits et articles in the case of Downie, Francis & Cl\u00e9ment, tiers saisie. what is stated in Downie's answers as averments of second count of the indictment is untrue.\"\nJohn Murray Smith, Manager of the Bank of Toronto, at Montreal, deposed he had paid to Francis the last witness; as curator to his mother two dividends of $525 each. The first was paid after the 1st December 1879 and the second after the 1st June 1880.\"\nM\u00e9dard Edouard Mercier Bailiff: \" in May or June 1880 I executed a capias at the instance of Downie against Francis and arrested the latter on a claim of about $40 for board, I think, up to that time. Francis settled by giving me a cheque for debt and costs.\n\"Benjamin Cl\u00e9ment, said:\u2014\" I am curator to the mother of Francis. Since January, 1881 and from 15th October, 1880, I was her conseil judiciaire. Mary Power is the mother of Francis, After I came judicial adviser I paid Francis $5, $10, $5 and $24.76. I paid Downie on the 23rd November 1880 on an order from Francis $7.50 on account of $15.\"\nEliza Osbert, femme de Aubain Duperrousel, dit:\u2014 Je connais le d\u00e9fendeur Downie, et Francis. Ils venaient \u00e0 mon restaurant en 1880. Downie me doit de l'argent pour pension vers 1880. Ii venait avec Francis pendant qu'il Downie; pensionnait chez moi. Francis ne me doit rien. Il m'a toujours pay\u00e9 tout Ce qu'il me devait. Je ne puis dire qui m'a pay\u00e9 la pension mensuellement, mais Francis a toujours pay\u00e9 les extra. Tant qu'ils ont pensionn\u00e9 ensemble la pension a toujours \u00e9t\u00e9 pay\u00e9e quelquefois par l'un et d'autres fois par l'autre.

I kept Princess Louise hotel in Montreal in 1880. Both boarded with me during that year. They kept separate accounts. They were boarding with me at two different periods of the year, first in the spring of 1880. Mr. Francis paid me his board and in the fall Francis did not pay his board and I obtained judgment against him for a balance of his board and I still hold him responsible for that balance. Mr. Downie never paid any thing for Mr. Francis' board.\"\n\"Mr. Downie left \u00e1 balance due me for board for which I have got a judgment against him. I have not been paid, but my estate has gone into insolvency. I have never been paid, but I went into insolvency in 1883, and Mr. St-Amand, who got the judgment, has been paid since my estate went into insolvency three years ago. My judgment against Francis has not been paid and is still due to my estate. Mr. Francis paid almost all the extras they had and if Francis had no money I would charge them to him.'\n\u201cUpon the application of the private prosecutor through Mr. Kerr his counsel and with the permisi\u00f3n of the court the addition in schedule A hereto annexed was made to the present case to form part thereof as if inserted immediately before the words, after the hearing of the motion on the present page. After the hearing of motions in arrest of judgment and for new trial made on behalf of the defendant Downie, I reserved for the decision of the Court of Queen's Bench, appeal side, under the authority of the section 259 of the revised statutes of Canada, C. 174, the following questions:\u2014\n\u201c1st. Was the assignment of perjury on that part of the defendant\u2019s answers on faits et articles, that the said Frederic w. Francis from about the early part of one thousand eight hundred and eighty till towards the end of 1881 owed him the said Donald Downie, for everything which went to make up the necessaries of life, not only for the rent of his rooms, but his whole living; during that period of time without any interruption scarcely, except a day or two at a time when he might have been elsewhere he lived at his the said Donald Downie's expense altogether that the said Frederick W. Francis lived with him the said Donald Downie and depended upon him exclusively for his livelihood,\" sufficiently negatived in the negative averments of the indictment as, above indicated, to authorise the prosecution to prove special facts not specifically alleged in the negative averments such as that he, Francis, bad paid to Downie in May or June 1880 $42 for having boarded at his house in the month of May 1880 that he had paid his board to Madame Duperrousel and part of his board to Francis Larin and was held liable by the latter for part of his board during the months of September and October 1880, that he was also held liable for part of his board at Mrs. Radford\u2019s during the months of January February and March 1881, and by Britain for having boarded at the Victoria Hotel in the months of April, May, June, July and August 1881, and also that he, Downie had received from Francis an order on Benjamin Cl\u00e9ment for $15, on account of which Cl\u00e9ment had paid him Downie, $7.50 in November 1880.\"\n\u201cIf the evidence of the above facts was legal the verdict should be sustained.\" \u201c2ndly. Should the evidence so adduced be held to have been illegally allowed could a general verdict be given on the assignments of perjury based on the other facts sworn to by Downie, which assignments of perjury were properly negatived and proved but were comprised in the same count?\"\n\u201cIf the evidence adduced on part of the charges made in the indictment be held to have been illegally allowed but that it is held that a general verdict could be given, there being other charges in the same count which were properly proved then the verdict should be upheld. If on the contrary a general verdict could not be given under the circumstances, the verdict should be set aside and either the motion in arrest of judgment or the motion for a new trial which were made by the defendant should be granted.\"\n\u201cNo sentence was passed and the defendant was admitted to give bail for his appearance at the sittings of the Court of Queen's Bench, Criminal side, on the first day of March next.\"\n(Signed) \" A.

Added upon application of prosecution.\n\"The evidence for the prosecution having been closed, the defendant; through his counsel, Mr. St-Pierre submitted that there was no sufficient evidence to go to the jury. I ruled against him and he then produced several witnesses and among others Jane McCandish wife of Isaie Radford and George Britain.\"\nHall Q.C. for the Crown objects to the hearing of the appeal for want of jurisdiction on two grounds:\n1 That from a decision of the court of crown cases reserved there is no appeal.\n2. That no leave to appeal was granted or applied for. The objections were overruled. McCarthy Q.C. and McIntyre for the prisoner.\nThe indictment was defective in not alleging \"the particular matters in which, the perjury consisted. Bradlaugh y. The Queen ([1]); Rex v. Hepper ([2]); Rex v. Parker ([3]); Rex v. Sparling ([4]).\nAnd this defect is not cured by the verdict Iley-mann v. The Queen ([5]); Aspinall v. The Queen ([6]); The Queen v. Goldsmith ([7]); Rex v. mason ([8]). Hall Q.C. for the crown cited The Queen v. Webster ([9]); The Queen v. Watkinson ([10]); The Queen v. Adams ([11]); Taschereau's Criminal Law ([12]).\nSir W. J. RITCHIE C.J. Concurred with Strong J.\nSTRONG J.\u2014\u2014This was a case reserved for the opinion of the Court of Queen's Bench by the learned Chief Justice of that court (who presided at the trial of the appellant on an indictment for perjury) pursuant to the Revised Statutes of Canada, chapter 174, section 259, making provision for the reservation and disposition of any question of law arising on the trial of a person who may be convicted upon an indictment for treason, felony or misdemeanor,\nThe Court of Queen's Bench affirmed the convection but were not unanimous in that \"judgment one of the learned judges, Mr. Justice Cross, having dissented from the majority of the court. The defendant was therefore entitled by section 268 of the act before referred to (as amended by chap. 50 of the acts of 1887) to appeal, as he has done, to this court. The question we have to determine is of course limited to the point of law reserved by the case stated by the Chief Justice for the opinion of the appeal side of the Court of Queen's Bench and we are not at liberty to take into consideration any other matters of law even though they may appear on the record or on the face of the proceedings stated in the case reserved.\nThe indictment contained two counts. The first count having been abandoned by the crown need not be further mentioned. The second count upon which the trial proceeded charged the defendant with having falsely and corruptly sworn to certain statements in answering interrogatories on faits et articles in a case before the Superior Court wherein the appellant was plaintiff and one Frederick William Francis was defendant. There are three distinct statements alleged to have been sworn to by the defendant on which perjury is assigned in this second count. As regards the first and third of these statements no question has been reserved, and with them we have now nothing to do, being entitled to assume upon the case reserved that the assignments as regards them were properly pleaded and that the evidence received at the trial as relevant to those charges was legally admissible. The objection to the sufficiency of the count which we have to consider relates to the second of these statements and the assignment of perjury applicable to it.\nThe indictment alleges that the appellant swore that Francis from about the early part of 1880 till towards the end of 1881 owed him, the said Donald Downie, for everything which went to make up the necessaries of life not only for the rent of his rooms but his whole living; during that period of time without any interruption, scarcely, except a day or two at a time when he might have been elsewhere, he lived at his the said Donald Downie\u2019s expense altogether; that the said Frederick W Francis lived \" with him the said Donald Downie and depended upon him exclusively for his livelihood and the said Frederick W. Francis had no means of any kind.\u201d Upon this perjury is assigned by purely negative averments in the terms of the allegation itself, without any averment of the affirmative facts by which such negative was to be established. The questions reserved were whether the sworn statements of the defendant so alleged to be false were sufficiently negatived in the negative averments of the indictment as above indicated to authorise the \"prosecution to prove special facts not specifically alleged in the negative averments, such as that he, Francis, had paid to Downie in May or June 1880 $42.00 for having boarded at his house in the month of May 1880; that he had paid his board to Madame Duperrousel and part of his board to Francis Larin and was held liable by the latter for part of his board during the months of September and October, 1880; that he was also held liable for part of his board at Mrs. Radford\u2019s during the months of January, February and March, 1881, and by Britain for having boarded at the \"Victoria Hotel in the months of April, May, June, July and August, 1881; and also that he, Downie, had received from Francis an order on Benjamin Clement for $15 on account of which Clement had paid him, Downie, $7.50 in November, 1880.\nIf the evidence of the above facts was legal the verdict was to be sustained.\n2ndly Should the evidence so adduced be held to have been illegally allowed could a general verdict be given on the assignments of perjury based on the other facts sworn to by Downie, which, assignments of perjury were properly negatived but were comprised in the same count.\nIf the evidence adduced on part of the charges made in the indictment should be held to have been \" illegally allowed, but it should be held that a general verdict could be given, there being other charges in the same count which were properly proved, then by the terms of the case reserved the verdict should be upheld. If on the contrary a general verdict could not be given under the circumstances, the verdict should be set aside and either the motion in arrest of judgment or the motion for a new trial which was made by the defendant should be granted.\nThe questions thus raised are virtually questions not of evidence but of pleading. For it cannot be doubted for a moment that the evidence objected to was relevant to establish the perjury assigned in the second assignment before referred to. It is said, however, that the indictment was so vague and general on this head that no evidence should have been admitted in support of the negative averments of perjury before set forth and that the evidence of the witnesses stated in the case should therefore have been rejected. As authorities for this proposition the appellant relied on two cases, Rex v. Hepper ([13]), and Regina v. Parker ([14]). In my opinion neither of these cases sustains the appellant's contention. The first case, that of Rex v. Hepper (1), was an indictment for perjury which had either been found in the Court of King's Bench or removed there by certiorari the record in which (the defendant having of course pleaded) had been sent down for trial on the civil side at the nisi prius sittings held before the Chief Justice, Lord Tenterden, who by reason of his powers being limited to the trial of the issue contained in the completed record sent to him to try, had therefore no juris- diction to entertain a motion to quash. the indictment, to admit a demurrer, or to arrest the judgment. The indictment was for perjury against an insolvent debtor for falsely swearing that his schedule contained a full and true account of all his debts and the assignment was in terms a bare negation of the oath without any affirmative allegation showing in respect of what omitted debts the falsity consisted. The Chief Justice holding that the indictment would for its vagueness and generality have been bad on demurrer, and that a conviction if obtained would be rendered ineffectual by an arrest of judgment, refused to try the case (all he could do) and accordingly struck it out of his paper It is to be observed that in this case of The King v. Hepper the indictment contained but the single assignment mentioned and not other charges in respect of which the pleading would have been good as in the present case. It is to be remarked of this case that it stands alone and no similar authority has been cited or can be found. In the present case it was properly held that a demurrer would not have been sustained nor could the judgment have been arrested for the mere generality of the pleading. The decision of the learned Chief Justice on both these points has the support of the highest authority, the opinion of the judges who advised the House of Lords in the case of Mulcahey v. The Queen ([15]), delivered by Mr. Justice willes and the decision of the House proceeding on the advice so given, particularly that of Lord Chelmsford, the first being a distinct authority that after a general verdict upon a count framed as this is the generality of the terms in which one of the three distinct charges of perjury contained in this count was assigned would be no ground for arresting the judgment and the opinion of Lord Chelmsford distinctly laying it down that there can be no demurrer to a part of one of the counts of an indictment. The consequence is that it is impossible to say that this pleading was bad. Then if the pleading is to be considered as sufficient, the only other remaining objection can be that of relevancy. No case can be produced in which relevant evidence has been rejected upon the trial of an indictment after a plea of not guilty upon the ground of the insufficiency of the pleading The force of this was felt by Lord Chief Justice Tindal in Regina v. parker the other case cited by the appellant who told the counsel objecting to the evidence that he ought to have demurred and that not having done so he did not see how the evidence could be excluded. It is true that in that case the Chief Justice afterwards prevailed upon the prosecution to withdraw the evidence objected to, but that was no ruling or decision but merely an appeal to the sense of justice and fairness of the counsel for the crown Lord Chief Justice Tindal's observation in this case that one of the assignments might have been demurred to separately from the other assignments contained in the same count is most distinctly overruled by Lord Chelmsford\u2019s observations in Mulcahey v. The Queen where he says:\nI have always understood that a d\u00e9murer must be to the entire count or plea and not to a part of it.\nIt is therefore apparent that the King v. Hepper is not an authority sufficient to sustain this appeal, and further, that upon principle and apart from authority the appellant must fail since the only possible objection to the admissibility of the evidence in question could be that it was irrelevant to the issue raised by the plea of \" not guilty,\" a proposition which could not possibly be for a moment entertained. Further, the objection that this mode of pleading is vicious as being too vague and general whether regarded as one of a substantial or a technical character is I think met by the following language of Mr. Justice Willes in delivering the opinion of the judges in Mulcahey v. The Queen already alluded to. That very learned judge. there said:\nMoreover, and this is the substantial answer to these objections, an indictment only states the legal character of the offence and does not profess to furnish the details and particulars. These are supplied by the depositions and the practice of informing the prisoner or his counsel of any additional evidence not in the depositions which it may be intended to produce at the trial. To make the indictment more particular would only encourage formal objections upon the ground of variance which have of late been justly discouraged by the legislature.\nThese observations certainly throw much doubt on the case of Rex v. Hepper if they do not actually discredit it as an authority but it is sufficient for the present purposes to say that the last named case does not,or the reasons given, apply to the question raised on this appeal and apart from it there is not a shadow of authority to support the d\u00e9tendant's pretension.\nThe conviction must be affirmed.\nFOURNIES J. was of opinion that the appeal should be allowed for the reasons given by Mr. Justice Cross in the Court of Queen's Bench.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014The only question before us is that which was reserved under sec.259 of ch. 174 of the Revised Statutes of Canada namely whether in an indictment for perjury the perjury charged was sufficiently assigned to authorise the prosecution to give evidence of certain particular facts which were tendered and received in evidence for the purpose of establishing the perjury as assigned in the indictment.\nThe indictment charged that the defendant Downie in a certain suit among the records of the Superior Court for the district of Montreal, iu which the said Downie was the plaintiff and one Frederick W. Francis of a writ of saisie arr\u00eat after judgment issued therein by the said Downie against the said Francis in the hands of Benjamin Clement in his quality of curator as garnishee whose declaration declared that he owed the said Francis a life rent, which life rent the said Francis contended was unseizable by reason of its being an alimentary allowance, he the said Downie was during the trial of the issues raised upon the said garnishee's declaration duly examined on the part of the said Francis upon interrogatories sut faits et artides, and was then and there duly sworn, &c, &c., and did upon his oath falsely, wilfully and corruptly depose and swear in substance, and to the effect following ([16]).\nThis being the defendants oath as stated in the indictment the perjury charged was assigned as follows ([17]).\nNow the evidence, as to the admissibility of which the question was reserved, was that of persons with whom Francis had boarded during different parts of the periods named in the assignment of perjury, namely, between the months of December 1879 and November, 1880, and between the months of February and August, 1881, for the purpose of establishing that during those periods Francis was supplied with board and lodging by those persons at his own charge and not at all at the charge and expense of Downie, and also evidence of Downie having, in November, 1880, received from Clement the curator of Francis' mother's estate the sum of $7.50 on account of a draft for $15 made by Francis upon Clement in Dowhie's favor and also that Francis having been arrested by Downie about June, 1880, paid to him $42 for boarding in Downie's house in May 1880.\nThe evidence was, in my opinion, clearly admissible. The case is very different from that of Rex v. Hep per ([18]) to which it has been likened. In that case the indictment charged that the defendant had in an oath taken by him in the Insolvent Debtor\u2019s Court falsely, wilfully and corruptly sworn that a schedule filed by him in the court contained a full, true and perfect account of all debts due to him at the time of presenting his petition to the Insolvent Court, and the assignment of the perjury was that in truth and in fact the said schedule did not contain a full true and perfect account of all debts due to him at the time, &c, in naked negation of the terms of the oath without averring wherein the schedule was untrue, imperfect and defective. The defendant thus was in effect charged with having falsely, wilfully and corruptly omitted to insert in the schedule something which was within his knowledge and which it was his duty to insert, the omission of which made the schedule which he had sworn was a true statement of all debts owing to him to be false, without pointing out what was the particular matter omitted which made the statement in the schedule to be false. The indictment in the present case is very different \\ the perjury assigned in it is not a simple negation of the truth of the defendants oath although that, perhaps would have been sufficient, having regard to the nature of the oath which in substance, was that Francis owed Downie, from the early part of 1880 until towards the end of 1881, for everything which went to make up the necessaries of life, not only for the rent of his rooms but his whole living during that period of time without interruption scarcely\u2014that he, Downie and Francis lived together during the years 1880 and 1881 and that Francis had no means of any kind but depended upon him, Downie, exclusively for his livelihood. And the assignment besides denying all this to be true, points out in the paragraph beginning with, the words \" but on the contrary &c, &c.,\" the particular parts which are relied upon as false wherein it is alleged what means Francis had, and that during certain named periods he supported himself at his own cost and was not at all supported by Downie: and the evidence given (the admissibility of which is under consideration) was in support of the averments contained in that paragraph. It was not at all necessary that in order to be allowed to prove the averment that Francis had supported himself during certain named periods or any part of such periods the indictment should have gone further and stated where Francis lived during those periods and, if at hotels or lodging houses, the names of such hotels and lodging houses and of the proprietors of them and the amounts which accrued due to each the utmost that the defendant could have any right to be informed of was that during certain periods the prosecutor intended to prove that Francis had maintained himself at his own cost and charges and that he was not maintained by Downie as the latter had sworn he had been.\nAppeal dismissed without costs\nSolicitor for appellant: S.

J. and Strong, Fournier, Henry and Gwynne JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF QUEENS BENCH FOR LOWER CANADA (APPEAL SIDE).\nElevator\u2014Negligence of employees\u2014Liability of landlord\u2014Damages\u2014Art. 1054, C. (7.\u2014 Vindictive damages\u2014Cross-appeal.\nOn the 13th April, 1883, C. an architect, who had his office on the third flat of a building in the City of Montreal, in which the landlord had placed an elevator for the use of the tenants, desiring to go to his office went towards the door admitting to the elevator and seeing it open entered, but the elevator not being there, he fell into the cellar and was seriously injured. In an action brought by C. against R., the landlord, claiming damages for the suffered injury and loss, it was proved at the trial that the boy, an employee of R. in charge of the elevator, at the time of the accident had left the elevator with the door open to go to his lunch leaving no substitute in charge. It was shown also that C. had suffered seriously from a fracture to his skull, had been obliged to follow for many months an expensive medical treatment and had become almost incapacitated for the exercise of his profession. C. had been in the habit of using the elevator during the absence of the boy. The trial judge awarded C. $5000 damages, and on appeal to the Court of Queen's Bench (appeal side) P. Q. that amount was reduced to $3000 on the ground that C. was not entitled to vindictive damages. On appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada;\nHeld, affirming the judgment of the court below, that R. was liable for the fault, negligence and carelessness of his employee ([1]), and that the amount awarded was not unreasonable.\nHeld also, that the sum of $5000 awarded by the Superior Court was not an unreasonable amount and could not be said to include vindictive damages, but as no cross-appeal had been taken the judgment of the Superior Court could not be restored.\nAppeal from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada, rendered on the 30th of September, 1887, by which the judgment of the Superior Court of the 30th June, 1885, for $5,000 was reformed and the damages awarded respondent reduced to the sum of $3000 with interest and costs.\nThis was an action of damages brought by the respondent against the appellant under the following circumstances :\nThe respondent, who is an architect residing in the city of Montreal, was lessee of two apartments in the building known as the Ottawa Hotel, of which building the appellant is proprietor. By the lease it was stipulated that the respondent should have the right to use the elevator in the premises.\nOn the 18th April, 1883, during the existence of the lease, the respondent entered the building from the street, and desiring to go to his office went towards the door of the elevator, and not seeing the appellant's employee, but seeing the door of the elevator open which indicated that the elevator was at its place to receive him, the respondent advanced to enter the elevator and fell through the opening to the cellar, where he was afterwards picked up unconscious and nearly dead. He was immediately taken to the hospital, and remained for many days between life and death. His skull was fractured and he was incapacitated from attending to his business for about a year.\nTo the respondent's action the appellant pleaded: That if the said plaintiff met with the accident and suffered injury and loss, as set out in the said plaintiff's declaration, it was through his gross negligence and wilful acts;\n\" That the said plaintiff without any right so to do was in the habit of bursting open the door leading to the elevator in question and of removing the fastenings to the same, and of making use of said elevator, notwithstanding the protestations of the said defendant and notwithstanding that defendant frequently notified the plaintiff to cease from interfering with and making use of said elevator.\"\nAt the trial in addition to the facts above stated it was proved that the elevator was in the care of an employee of the appellant, a lad aged fourteen years, and that on the 18th of April, 1883, the boy left the elevator on the level of the ground floor with the door open, and went out to take his lunch, and during his absence the accident happened.\nAs to damages it was proved that the respondent had suffered for many months and was obliged to undergo medical treatment for a period of over a year; had paid to one physician alone the sum of one hundred and eighty dollars, had been left an invalid and lost the sense of hearing in his right ear; had lost his client\u00e9le and had been kept away from his business, (which had been bringing him an income of about $2000 a year) for a period of over twelve months.\nThe Superior Court presided over by Mr. Justice Jett\u00e9 condemned the defendant to pay to the plaintiff the sum of $5000 by way of damages, but the Court of Queen's Bench sitting in appeal reduced the damages to the sum of $3000, on the ground that appellant was not liable to any vindictive damages, but only to such actual damages the respondent had suffered, and that such damages should, under the circumstances have been established at such reasonable amount as would indemnify the respondent for his loss.\nCarter for appellant.\nThe only point which I can press upon the court is that there was contributory negligence on the part of the respondent who was an architect. The evidence shows that the respondent was in the habit of making use of the elevator without the use of the boy who was in charge. Every person ought to be on their guard when using an elevator. Wharton on Negligence ([2]); Dalloz, Rep., Gen., Vo. Imprudence, ([3]).\nSaint Pierre for respondent was not called upon.\nSIR W. J. RITCHIE C. J.\u2014We do not think it necessaro to call upon the counsel for the respondent in this case. A grosser case of negligence could not be submitted for the opinion of the court. Considering the public and extensive use of elevators I think that we would be giving a most unjust judgment if we allowed this appeal. It is much like the case where a person opens his store and leaves a trap door open at the entrance. If a customer came in and fell into the trap could it be said he was guilty of contributory negligence The appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nSTRONG J.\u2014I should be prepared in this case to restore the judgment of the Superior Court, but as the other members of the court are of a different opinion I concur in simply dismissing the appeal with costs. I am quite satisfied that this is a case in which negligence is established beyond all question. It is the duty of the proprietors of elevators to see that they have in their employ careful and competent employees, and if they omit this duty they are responsible to those who in lawfully using the elevators may suffer from their neglect. There is not the slightest evidence of contributory negligence. I am of opinion that the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nFOURNIER J.\u2014As there has not been a cross-appeal taken I am of opinion that the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench should be confirmed.\nHENRY J.\u2014If there had been a cross-appeal, I might have been disposed to restore the judgment of the Superior Court. I think there was negligence here for which the appellant was liable. It is very much like the case of a man leaving his horse on the street unguarded, in such a case if damage results the owner is responsible. The evidence in this case fully justifies the verdict and the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014I entirely concur with my brother judges. I think that the amount awarded by the superior court was not unreasonable. $5000 damages can by no means in such a case as the present be said to be vindictive damages. It is a misapplication of the term\u00bb\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellant: Kerr, Carter & Goldstein.\nSolicitors for respondent: Saint Pierre, Globensky & Poirier.\n[1] Art 1054, C.

S. C. c. 174 s. 183\u2014Punishment.\nAn assault with intent to commit a felony is an attempt to commit such felony with\u00e9n the meaning of sec. 183 of R. S.

C. c. 162 s. 38[2].\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Supreme Court British Columbia, affirming a conviction against the appellant for an assault with intent to commit rape.\nThis is an appeal from the judgment of the Supreme Court of British Columbia on a writ of error, a single question of law being involved, namely, whether on an indictment charging that the prisoner \"violently and feloniously did make an assault, and her, the said R., then violently and, against her will, feloniously did ravish and carnally know against the form, etc.,\" there could be a conviction of \" assault with intent to commit rape.\" On such conviction the appellant was sentenced to two years imprisonment.\nThe Supreme Court of British Columbia affirmed the conviction by a divided court, the Chief Justice and Mr. Justice Crease giving judgment for, and Gray and Walkem JJ. against it. The prisoner then appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nChristopher Robinson Q.C. for the appellant referred to R. S. C. c. 162 ss. 34, 36, 38 ; c. 174 ss. 183, 191; c. 181 s. 24 Subs 2 ; and cited the following authorities, Reg v. Thomas[3] ; Reg. v. Collins[4] ; Reg. v. Dungey[5] ; Reg. v.

Proc.[10].\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by Mr. Justice Strong as follows\u2014\nSTRONG J.\u2014This is an appeal from the decision of the Supreme Court of British Columbia upon a writ of error brought by the present appellant Edwin John who, having been indicted and tried for a rape on the person of one Mary Ann Radford, had been acquitted of the felony but found guilty of the misdemeanor of having assaulted the prosecutrix with intent to commit the offence charged. The verdict of the jury as rendered was in the following terms : \" The prisoner is not guilty of the felony whereof he stands indicted but is guilty of assault with intent to commit rape.\" The prisoner's counsel upon this verdict being returned contended that the jury could not find such a verdict upon an indictment for the felony, that although they might have convicted the prisoner of an attempt to commit the felony under sec. 183 of R. S. C., ch. 174, yet a conviction of an assault with \" intent \" to commit rape was not a conviction for an \" attempt \" as warranted by that enactment. The Chief Justice of British Columbia, before whom the prisoner was tried, refused to reserve the point under the statute and sentenced the prisoner to two years' imprisonment. The prisoner then brought his writ of error. The court on the argument of the writ of error being composed of four judges was equally divided, the Chief Justice and Crease J. being of opinion to affirm the conviction and Gray and Walkem JJ. being of opinion that it ought to be quashed. In order to allow an appeal to this court Mr. Justice Gray withdrew his judgment.\nI am of opinion that the decision appealed against was right and ought to be affirmed. It is, of course, beyond question that at common law a proceeding such as this, a conviction for a misdemeanor upon an indictment for felony, would be wholly unsustainable. Some statute must, therefore, be invoked as sanctioning such a departure from the ordinary course of the common law. The statute upon which the conviction is rested is that already referred to \" The Criminal Procedure Act,\" R. S. C., ch. 174 by the 183rd sec. of which it is enacted :\u2014\nIf on the trial of any person charged with any felony or misdemeanor it appears to the jury upon the evidence that the defendant did not complete the offence charged, but that he was guilty only of an attempt to commit the same, such person shall not by reason thereof be entitled to be acquitted, but the jury shall be at liberty to return as their verdict that the defendant is not guilty of the felony or misdemeanor charged, but is guilty of an attempt to com- mit the same ; and thereupon such person shall be liable to be punished in the same manner as if he had been convicted upon an indictment for attempting to commit the particular felony or misdemeanor charged in the indictment ; and no person tried as lastly mentioned shall be liable to be afterwards prosecuted for committing or attempting to commit the felony or misdemeanor for which he was so tried.\nThis, as it appears to me, is the only enactment to which this conviction can be referred. Section 191 of the same act (ch. 174)authorises the conviction of any person, indicted for a felony which includes an assault against the person, of the assault alone although the assault may not be charged in terms, the accused being acquitted of the felony. This, however, means only a common assault and not an assault such as that the jury have in terms found the prisoner guilty of here, viz., \" an assault with intent to commit rape.\" The question is therefore really reduced to this : Is an \" assault with intent to commit rape \" an attempt to commit the felony charged within the meaning of section 183 ? I am of opinion that prim\u00e2 facie, and unless there is some other enactment shewing a contrary intention and therefore calling for a narrower construction of section 183, that it clearly is so. This opinion is founded on the considerations that an indictment for the common law misdemeanor of an attempt to commit a felony always alleged the particular overt act of which the attempt consisted and, further, that inasmuch as an attempt to commit a crime is, as Mr. Justice Stephens defines it[11] \" an act done with intent to commit that crime and forming part of a series of acts which would constitute its actual commission if it were not interrupted \" (a definition which has the support of ample judicial authority as the learned author shews in the illustrations appended to his text,) so the converse holds good that an assault with intent to commit rape is an attempt to commit that offence. I have not the slightest doubt, therefore, that if the present conviction depends on the construction to be placed on section 183 alone that we ought to hold it good.\nThen the other statutory provisions material to be considered are the following. Section 24, sub-section 2 of Chap. 181 R. S. C. enacts that\nEvery one who is convicted on indictment of any misdemeanor for which no punishment is specially provided shall be liable to five years imprisonment.\nAnd section 38 of chapter 162 enacts that\nEvery one who assaults any woman or girl with intent to commit rape is guilty of a misdemeanor and liable to Imprisonment for any term not exceeding seven years and not less than two years.\nThis last provision, no doubt, declares that an assault with intent to commit rape shall be a misdemeanor, but this was already the law, for an assault with such intent was, as before shewn, an attempt to commit the felony which was by itself always a common law misdemeanor, in addition to which the mere assault, independently of the aggravation, was also a common law misdemeanor. The only purpose and effect, therefore, of this section 38 was, as it seems to me, to affix a new and precise punishment to this particular species of the misdemeanor of attempting to commit a felony, viz. imprisonment with a maximum limit of seven years and a minimum limit of two years. Therefore nothing contained in this section 38 took this particular species of offence out of the category of attempts to commit felonies in which it was obviously before included at common law, so as to make it a new statutory misdemeanor in which there could not be a conviction upon an indictment for the felony ; on the contrary the whole object of the section manifestly was to define the punishment for an offence which always constituted a misdemeanor at common law, and for which the 183rd section of the Procedure Act had provided there might be a conviction on an indictment for the felony. Then if this is so the 24th section, sub-section 2, of the Punishments Act, chap. 181, can have no bearing on the question of the validity of the conviction. As already shown it provides for the punishment, by a lesser degree of imprisonment than is affixed to the offence of an assault with intent to commit rape, of misdemeanors for which no punishment is specially provided.\nBut a different punishment is specially provided for the offence of an assault with intent to commit rape, and according to section 183, if the case comes within that section, the punishment so specially affixed is that which is to be awarded when a party is convicted on an indictment for the distinct and substantive offence of attempting to commit the felony. The question, therefore, really comes back to this: Is an assault with intent an attempt within the meaning of section 183, of which a party can be convicted on an indictment for rape ? And having regard to the older authorities and precedents, to the definitions given by Mr. Justice Stephens, and to what seems to me to be an incontrovertible proposition requiring no demonstration that an assault with intent to commit rape is ex necessitate an attempt to commit that offence, I must hold that sec. 38 of ch. 162 and section 183 of the Procedure Act both apply and that the conviction must be, therefore, affirmed.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for appellant: Theodore Davie.\nSolicitor for respondent: Paulus Emilius Irving.\n[1] R. S. C. c. 174 s. 183. If on the trial of any person charged with any felony or misdemeanour it appears to the jury upon the evidence that the defendant did not complete the offence charged, but that he was guilty only of an attempt to commit the same, such person shall not, by reason thereof, be entitled to be acquitted, but the jury shall be at liberty to return as there verdict, that the defendant is not guilty of the felony or misdemeanor charged, but is guilty of an attempt to commit the same ; and thereupon such person shall be liable to be punished in the same manner as if he had been convicted upon an indictment for attempting to commit the particular felony or misdemeanor charged in the indictment. * * *\n[2] R.

Prior to the assignment a meeting of the creditors of the firm was held at which the plaintiff Kl\u0153pfer was present, and he assented to the assignment and was appointed an inspector of the estate.\nThe plaintiffs subsequently obtained a judgment against the said firm of McKenzie & McKinnon and issued an execution under which a portion of the good assigned to the defendant was seized. The defendant having claimed the goods under the assignment, an interpleader order was issued on the trial of which the plaintiffs endeavored to impeach the vali- dity of the defendant\u2019s deed. It was held, however, that the plaintiffs having assented to the deed were estopped from disputing its validity, and judgment was given for the defendant.\nAfter this decision the plaintiffs filed a claim against the insolvent estate, and on declaring a dividend their claim was included; another creditor of the estate then formally notified the defendant not to pay a dividend to the plaintiffs who, the notice alleged, had forfeited their right to participate in the benefit of the assignment by attacking the deed. The plaintiffs brought an action for their dividend.\nOn the trial judgment was given in favor of the defendant, which was affirmed by the Divisional Court. The decision of the latter court was afterwards reversed by the Court of Appeal. The defendant then appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nMcLennan Q.C. for the appellant.\nThe Court of Appeal has decided that a creditor may attempt to destroy an assignment by the debtor and failing to do so may still claim the benefit of the deed which was the subject of such attempt. It is submitted that the authorities are against such a right. Field v. Lord Donoughmore[3], Watson v. Knight[4], Re Meredith[5].\nMcCarthy Q.C. for the respondent referred to the following authorities: Ellison v. Ellison,[6]; Harley v. Greenwood[7]; Thorne v. Torrance[8]; Spencer v. Demett[9]; Clough v. London and North Western Ry. Co.[10]; Jewett v. Woodward[11]. Sir W.J. RITCHIE C.J.\u2014I think the respondent had a perfect right to test the validity of the assignment, and on its being established to come in and claim their share of the estate under it.\nSTRONG, J.\u2014The facts of this case which are few and simple are contained in documentary evidence and the admissions of the parties, no oral evidence of witnesses having been adduced at the trial. They may be shortly stated as follows:\u2014\nOn the 4th of May, 1883, the firm of McKenzie & McKinnon, carrying on business at the town of Meaford, executed a deed of assignment for the benefit of creditors whereby they assigned to the appellant all their stock in trade, goods, chattels, debts, lands and other property upon trust, to sell and convert the estate and get in the debts and, after paying the costs and expenses attending the execution of the trust, to apply the residue of the fund \u201cin or towards the payment of the debts of the said debtors in proportion to their respective amounts without preference or priority.\u201d The respondents Grardner & Walker, a partnership firm carrying on business at Gruelph, were creditors of the assignors for a considerable amount over $3000.00, their debt being the largest in amount of the assignor\u2019s liabilities.\nThis deed appears to have been communicated to the respondents and they acquiesced in it. Mr. Justice Osler before whom the interpleader issue, to be hereafter mentioned more particularly, was tried, has found that Kloepfer, acting for his firm, attended a meeting of creditors called by the appellant as assignee under the deed, on the 14th of May 1883, and assented to a resolution appointing him one of the trustees to act on behalf of the creditors in assisting the assignee to wind up the estate, and further that he acted as such trustee in inspecting and reporting on the stock, and that he was also present and did not dissent when a resolution was passed to pay certain arrears of wages to the men employed in the manufactory which had been carried on by the assignors. A few days afterwards, however, the respondents brought an action against the assignors, recovered judgment by default, issued execution thereon, and caused the property assigned to be seized thereunder, contending that the assignment was invalid because it contained unreasonable conditions to which creditors were not bound to assent. Thereupon, the appellant having claimed the property seized, the sheriff applied for an interpleader order which was made by the master in chambers. By this order an issue, in which the appellant was the plaintiff and the respondents defendants, was ordered to be tried in order to ascertain whether the property in the goods seized was in the appellant at the time of the seizure by the sheriff. It was further ordered that in default of security being given by the claimant (the appellant) the goods should be sold and the price paid into court and this was accordingly done. The interpleader issue came on to be tried before Mr. Justice Osler without a jury at the autumn assizes in 1883, when the learned judge found the facts before mentioned as to the respondents\u2019 conduct in acting under the deed of assignment, and upon that held the respondents estopped from impeaching the deed as execution creditors, and determined the issue in favor of the appellant. Thereupon, the appellant having prepared a \u201cfirst dividend sheet\u201d and having by it collocated the respondents as creditors entitled to a dividend on their debt to the amount of $962.64, James Cleland, one of the largest creditors of the insolvents, served the appellant with a written notice not to pay the dividend upon the ground that the respondents \u201chad forfeited their right to share in the estate through their having endeavored to destroy the trust.\u201d The ap- pellant then having refused to pay over the dividend, the respondents brought this action to compel payment, to which the appellant set up as a defence the proceedings already mentioned under the respondents\u2019 execution. The action was tried before the late Chief Justice of the Queen\u2019s Bench Division without a jury, when no evidence having been taken, but the before mentioned facts being admitted, that learned judge found for the defendant in the action, the present appellant. An order nisi subsequently obtained to enter the verdict for the plaintiff was after argument before the Queen\u2019s Bench Division discharged, Mr. Justice O\u2019Connor dissenting. The respondents then appealed to the Court of Appeal, by which court the judgment of the Queen\u2019s Bench Division was reversed, and judgment was ordered to be entered for the plaintiffs in the action (the present respondents) for the full amount of their claim. From this last judgment the present appeal has been taken.\nThe judgment of the Queen\u2019s Bench Division, which is reported in the 10th volume of the Ontario Reports, appears to have proceeded upon the grounds that the respondents had by their conduct forfeited their prima facie rights under the deed; and the cases of Field v. Lord Donoughmore,[12]; Watson v. Knight,[13]; Meredith v. Facey,[14], were relied on as authorities for this position. The dissenting judgment of Mr. Justice O\u2019Connor puts in forcible language what he considered to be an unanswerable objection to the reasoning upon which the opinion of the majority of the court was founded, namely, that the respondent having in the interpleader issue been met by the deed, and held to be bound by it, could not afterwards be deprived of the benefit of the trusts contained in it. The judgment of the Court of Appeal which was delivered by Mr. Justice Osler, rests the case on two distinct having been originally entitled as cestuis que trusts under the deed irrespectively of any acts of acquiescence on their part, could not by reason of any subsequent conduct involving a repudiation of the trusts be considered to have forfeited their rights to the benefits secured to them in common with the general body of creditors. The other ground taken by the Court of Appeal was that put forward by Mr. Justice O\u2019Connor in the Queen\u2019s Bench Division, that the appellant having in the interpleader issue set up the deed and the respondents\u2019 acquiescence in it to defeat the execution, could not afterwards be permitted to withdraw from the respondents the benefits which it assured them.\nIt appears to me that on both these grounds the judgment of the Court of Appeal is correct and ought to be sustained. The deed appears on its face to be a perfectly good and valid deed of assignment for the benefit of creditors, such as is expressly excepted from the avoidance of preferential assignments and other deeds intended to defeat and delay creditors contained in the Revised Statutes of Ontario chapter 118 sec. 2. The respondents were therefore bound by it and had no alternative but to accept the benefit of the trusts created in favor of the general body of creditors or to forego their rights altogether. In this state of things it is out of the question to say that by taking proceedings in repudiation of the deed, or by any course of conduct adverse to it, they can be deemed to have worked a forfeiture of their rights under it. A court of equity never proceeds in p\u0153nam, and to enforce such a forfeiture would be nothing less than to inflict a penalty upon the respondents as a punishment for their conduct.\nIf instead of the respondents having been originally bound by the deed, and therefore entitled to the bene- fits conferred by it, their right to claim under it had been dependent on their election to take under or against it, and then having first rejected it they had sought to be let in to participate in the trusts, the case would have been different, and as in the cases cited they could justly have been met by the objection that having chosen to act adversely to the trust they were not entitled to claim benefits which they had thus distinctly repudiated.\nIn all the cases referred to in the judgment of the Queen\u2019s Bench Division the parties seeking to come in under the assignment had not been originally parties to the deed, and having had the option of either accepting or rejecting the terms, and having in the first instance chosen the latter alternative, were asking the court to give them the benefit of that which they had formerly disclaimed; in other words they were asking relief inconsistent with the position which they had deliberately chosen to assume, seeking to \u201capprobate\u201d that which before they had \u201creprobated,\u201d a course which the law will not permit. The difference between such cases and the present is obvious and consists in this, that in the case now before us the creditors had no liberty of choice, but were bound by the deed ab initio.\nBut aside altogether from this, the principal ground upon which the Court of Appeal have rested their judgment, I am of opinion that the reasoning upon which Mr. Justice O\u2019Connor\u2019s judgment proceeded and which is also adopted by the Court of Appeal affords a conclusive answer to the appellant\u2019s contention. The objection now made to the respondents\u2019 claim to be paid in common with the other creditors their proportionate share with the insolvents\u2019 estate is that they attempted to enforce their execution, but in this attempt they were defeated by the deed and their previous acceptance of the trusts contained in it. Who ever heard of a party being held bound by a deed so far as to be barred from setting up claims adverse to it, and yet being at the same time deprived of advantages secured to him by the same instrument? It is a universal principle of law, common to all systems, and founded on the most obvious principles of justice and reason, that a party who is compelled to accept a disadvantageous position shall nevertheless be entitled to any incidental advantages which he can claim consistently with that position. The maxim of law is: Qui sentit commodum sentire debet et onus, but the converse maxim, Qui sentit onus sentire debet et commodum,[15], is also true, and the principle which the respondents invoke in this case, is summed up and comprehensively included in this general rule of law. To say that the respondents, in the circumstances in which they have been placed, are not to be permitted to participate in the division of the trust estate would be indeed to compel them to bear the onus, but to withhold from them the advantages of the situation which the appellant has placed them in.\nIt therefore follows that even if the respondents were not originally bound by the deed, as I think they were, they are now, by reason of their adoption of it before bringing their action, and by reason of the effect which has been given to it at the instance of the appellant in the interpleader proceeding, concluded by it, and being thus concluded they are entitled to share its advantages like any other creditor.\nThe appeal must be dismissed with costs.\nFOURNIER J.\u2014I am in favor of dismissing this appeal for the reasons given by Mr. Justice Osler in the Court of Appeal.\nTASCHEBEAU and GWYNNE JJ. concurred in the reasons given by Strong J. in favor of sustaining the judgment of the Court of Appeal.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellant: Wilson & Evans.\nSolicitors for respondents: Coffee, Field & Wissler.\n[1] 14 Ont.

S., had a number of creditors in Montreal. J., one of such creditors, preferred a criminal charge against S., sent a detective to Yarmouth with a warrant, caused such warrant to be indorsed by a local magistrate and had S. brought to Montreal, when the other creditors there issued writs of capias for their respective claims. The father of S. came to Montreal and in consideration of the release of S. on both the civil and criminal charges transferred all his property for the benefit of the Montreal creditors, and S. was released from gaol having giving his own recognizance to appear on the criminal charge. In the settlement to the claims of the creditors was added the costs of both the civil and criminal suits. In a suit to set aside the transfer as being obtained by duress and to stifle the criminal prosecution, the evidence showed that the creditors, in taking the proceedings they did, expected to obtain the security of the friends of S.\nHeld, affirming the judgment of the court below, that the nature of the proceedings and the evidence clearly showed that the criminal process was only used for the purpose of getting S. to Montreal to enable the creditors to put pressure on him, in order to get their claims paid or secured, and the transfer made by the father under such circumstances was void.\nAppeal from a decision of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia[1] affirming the judgment at the hearing in favor of the plaintiffs.\nOne Melbourne J. Sheehan, a trader doing business in Yarmouth, N. S., became insolvent and made an assignment to the defendant Thomas W. Johns in trust for the benefit of his creditors. Sheehan had a number of creditors in Montreal, one of whom caused a criminal charge to be preferred against him and sent a detective to Yarmouth with a warrant for his arrest on such charge. The warrant having been indorsed by a magistrate in Yarmouth, Sheehan was arrested and conveyed to Montreal where he was kept in gaol for several weeks. While there several of the other creditors issued writs of capias against him.\nThe plaintiff Sheehan, father of the said Melbourne J. Sheehan, went to Montreal in obedience to a subpoena issued by the prosecutor on the criminal charge, and after a consultation with his son he had an interview with the creditors who agreed to release the son on the civil suits, and use their influence to procure his release on the criminal charge, on condition of a release in favor of the creditors of the father's preferred claim in the assignment by the son to Johns and the payment by the father of the costs, both in the civil and criminal suits, the latter to be secured by the assignment of a mortgage held by the father. This was assented to and the necessary deeds were executed by the father and the son was released from gaol, the criminal matter being satisfied by his own recognizance.\nThe plaintiff Sheehan subsequently transferred his said preferential claim and mortgage to the plaintiff, Thomas R. Jones, as security for a debt of his son, and an action was brought by Jones and Sheehan to have the transfers in favor of the Montreal creditors set aside as having been obtained by duress, and in pursuance of an agreement to stifle the said criminal charge. At the hearing one of the creditors in giving evidence said that in taking proceedings against the son it was expected that his friends would come to his aid, that it was understood he had a father who was worth money.\nAt the trial all the issues were found in favor of the plaintiffs and such findings were confirmed by the full court. The defendants then appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nGreenshields for the appellants contended that the evidence showed no dealings by the Montreal creditors with the criminal charge. They only undertook to release their own claims against the son. They were entirely within their right in issuing the writs of capias. C. C. P. art. 798.\nIt cannot be said that there was any stifling of the criminal charge for the charge is still pending, the prisoner being on bail.\nHarrington Q.C. for the respondents was stopped as the court was unanimous that the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nSir W. J. RITCHIE C. J.\u2014I think it very clear that the defendants used the criminal process for the purpose of extorting from this old man the transfer of his property, and I think that no court having proper respect for itself would sanction such a proceeding.\nSTRONG, TASCHEREAU and PATTERSON JJ. concurred.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014The whole proceedings of the appellants by which they obtained the assignment which the court in Nova Scotia has avoided were, in my judgment, a monstrous outrage upon justice and the appeal, therefore, should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for appellants: S.

E. I., and urging them, if they had the slightest doubt of the guilt of the prisoner they were trying, to temper justice with equity. The prisoner was convicted.\nHeld, affirming the judgment of the Court of Crown Cases reserved in Nova Scotia, that although the remarks of the clergyman were highly improper it could not be said that the jury were so influenced by them as to affect their verdict.\nA witness was called at the trial to give evidence as a medical expert and in answer to the crown prosecutor he said, \"there are indicia in medical science from which it can be said at what distance small shot were fired at the body. I have studied this\u2014not personal experience, but from books.\" He was not cross-examined as to the grounds of this statement and no medical witnesses were called by the prisoner to confute it. The witness then stated the distance from the murdered man at which the shot must have been fired in the case before the court, and on what he based his opinion as to it giving the result of his examination of the body.\nHeld, Strong J. and Fournier J. dissenting, that by his preliminary statement the witness had established his capacity to speak as a medical expert, and it not having been shown by cross-examination, or other testimony, that there were no such indicia as stated, his evidence as to the distance at which the shot was fired was properly received.\nAppeal from a decision of the Court of Crown Cases Reserved for the Province of Nova Scotia affirming the conviction of the prisoners (appellants) for murder. The defendants, William Preeper and Jane Doyle, were jointly indicted for the murder of one Peter Doyle, and two questions were reserved under c. 174, s. 259 R. S. C. for the consideration of the justices for crown cases reserved in the Province of Nova Scotia.\n1 As to certain observations made by a clergyman in his sermon in the presence and hearing of the jury.\nThe learned judge says\u2014\"It was my instruction to the jury, and the officers in charge of them, that they should not separate while out of court nor permit any person whatever to converse with them on the subject of the trial. These instructions were repeated several times during the course of the trial, and particularly on the adjournment] of the court on the evening of Saturday the 7th day of April aforesaid.\"\nOn the morning of Sunday, the 8th day of April aforesaid, the whole twelve jurors attended service at a church known as the Grafton Street Methodist Church in the City of Halifax, being accompanied by, and in charge of, the deputy sheriff. What occurred while such jury was present in such church is set out in the affidavit of Mr. F. H. Oxley, which is as follows:\u2014\nThe jury who tried the above cause attended the said service, and the Reverend William Brown was the officiating clergyman and preached a sermon on the said occasion.\nThe subject of the said sermon was the parable of the \"Prodigal Son,\" and the principal argument of the preacher was to point out the justice and certainty of punishment for wrong doing.\nThe preacher also stated that all persons were free agents and had the opportunity of choosing their course in life, and if they did wrong the merited punishment would follow as a result of their own act.\nAs an instance, illustrating his argument, he referred to the case of Millman, a prisoner then under sentence of death for murder in the Province of Prince Edward Island.\nHe also stated that he observed in his audience the men of the jury, who for several days had been separated from the community considering the fate of the prisoners accused of the murder of Doyle, and that although he realized it was not for him to instruct them in the matter yet he felt it was his duty to remind them that unless they were clearly satisfied of the guilt of the prisoners their judgment should be tempered with equity.\nThe question whether the verdict can stand after such an address made to the jury, tending as it does to interfere with the administration of justice and from which inferences might be drawn by the jury hostile to the prisoners, is one of the questions reserved by the trial judge.\n2. One Norman McKay, a doctor of medicine, was produced as a witness on behalf of the crown and gave evidence establishing his competency to speak as a medical expert but not as an expert in any other particular. In his capacity of medical expert he gave evidence of the character of the injuries, the organs involved, the cause of death, etc. The death of deceased was caused by a charge of shot from a shot gun, which gun was found so lying in relation to the body as to render it material to be known at the trial what distance from the body of deceased the muzzle of the gun was at the moment the fatal shot was discharged. In the course of Dr. McKay's direct examination he was asked the following question by the counsel prosecuting for the crown:\u2014\n\"From your knowledge of medical science in this respect, and from your examination in this case, at how great or less a distance would the muzzle of the gun be from a human body at the time of the discharge?\"\nThis question was at once objected to by counsel for the prisoners but allowed by the judge. The answer given by the witness was as follows:\u2014\n\"Judging from what I saw, from the nature of the wound, and its appearance, I would say that the muzzle of the gun was not nearer than twenty inches, and not further away than three feet, when it was discharged.\"\nThe question of Dr. McKay's competency to be asked and to answer the above question was also reserved.\nA copy of the notes of the whole of the testimony of said Dr. McKay given on said trial was appended to the reserved case.\nBy these notes it appears that after stating that he was a medical man of the Nova Scotia Medical Board, and a graduate of the University of Halifax and Royal College of Surgeons, England, and had conducted an autopsy on the body of Peter Doyle, after describing minutely the examination he made and the wound and shot he found, and the probing of the wound and the upward course pursued by the shot in the body, the witness proceeds to state that\u2014\n\"There are indicia in medical science from which it can be said at what distance small shot were fired at the body. I have studied this\u2014not personal experience\u2014but from medical works. I examined the wound of deceased for the purpose of discerning this fact. Mr. Weeks asks witness: \"From your knowledge of medical science in this respect, and from your examination in this case, at how great or how less a distance would the muzzle of the gun be from a human body at the time of the discharge?\"\nMr. Henry objects to this question and it was allowed subject to the objection. The witness answered:\u2014\n\"Judging from what I saw, from nature of wound and appearance, I would say that the muzzle of the gun was not nearer than twenty inches, and not further away than three feet, when it was discharged. The carrying capacity of the gun, and the nature of the charge, and the condition of the gun as regards cleanliness and the shape of the hole would modify the distance as given by me. There are cases on record where the gun at a much greater distance than I have described produced such a wound as I have described. Death would be instantaneous from such a wound as I have described. In my opinion it would be impossible for a man after receiving such a wound to walk six feet, turn and sit down. If a man had been shot standing upright, and I found him at a distance of six feet sitting down after such a wound as I have described, I would expect to find blood all down his legs and pants and into his shoes, and probably on the ground, if it were possible for a man to do that, for with such a wound the heart would cease to beat instantly, after such a wound.\nCross-examined: I never witnessed a case from wound to the heart: I speak entirely from books and experience of other men: I mean that a party shot in this way could not make a step in the sense of walking: one reason I have for saying the gun was not nearer than twenty inches was that I saw no traces of burning: when a man is clothed with shirt and under shirt would not expect any burning at all: in giving my opinion as to distance of muzzle I do so on assumption there was no clothing on: independently of burning altogether I can say that it could not have been nearer than twenty inches: I never saw in any work on the subject a statement of the number of inches which might intervene between muzzle of gun and wound: in reference to burning I based my opinion as to distance, not so much as to the absence of burning as from the size of the wound and the jagged nature of the edge.\nThe Court of Crown Cases Reserved affirmed the conviction, McDonald C.J. and Mr. Justice McDonald dissenting. The prisoners then appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nHenry Q.C. and Harrington Q.C. for the appellants. We will first deal with the question of expert evidence reserved in the case. It is stated in the case and admitted that this evidence is most material. There are two primary objections to the evidence. First, that the subject upon which Doctor McKay was examined was not in itself a subject of expert testimony, but was a matter of ordinary knowledge.\n2. If it were the witness has not given such evidence as would show that he was skilled in the science to which it relates.\nAs to the first objection the following authorities were referred to: Wharton on Crim. Ev.[1]; Carter v. Boehm[2]; Milwaukee & St. Paul Ry. Co. v. Kellogg[3]; Campbell v. Rickards[4].\nAs to the first question reserved the learned counsel cited Commonwealth v. Roby[5]; United States v. Gibert[6]; The King v. Wooler[7].\nLongley, Atty. Gren. of Nova Scotia, for the respondent referred on the question of expert evidence to Rogers on Law and Medical Men[8]; Lawson on expert Evidence[9]; Roscoe on Crim. Ev.[10]; Taylor on Ev.[11]; Archbold's Cr. Pl.[12]; McNaghten's Case[13]; Rex. v. Wright[14]; Collier v. Simpson[15]; Rowley v. London & North Western Ry Co.[16]; 1 Taylor's Med. Jur.[17]\nOn the first question reserved the learned Attorney General cited The Queen v. Kennedy[18].\nHenry Q. C. in reply cited New England Glass Co. v. Lovell[19]; Kennedy v. The People[20]; Taylor on Med. Jur.[21]; Rogers on Law and Medical Men[22]; Wharton & Still\u00e9's Med. Jur.[23].\nSir W. J. RITCHIE C. J.\u2014After stating the points reserved and the substance of the judges' notes at the trial, his lordship proceeded as follows:\u2014\nAs to the first point, that the observations of the clergyman caused a mis-trial, there can be no doubt, I should think in the minds of all right thinking persons, that in referring, in the presence of the jury, to the trial and the jury, the clergyman entirely mistook his duty and laid himself open to the very grave charge of interfering with the administration of justice. But though his interference was most improper and unjustifiable, and worthy of the severest censure, I am constrained to agree with the court below that the observations made were not necessarily adverse to the prisoner or calculated to bias the minds of the jury against the prisoner, nor do I think the result of the trial was influenced by what the jury heard. The irregularity, therefore, is not, in my opinion, sufficient to invalidate the trial and verdict.\nAs to the second question reserved, if the objection to the question was to the competency of the witness to answer it it was a preliminary question for the judge with reference to which the prisoner's counsel might have cross-examined the witness or offered evidence to establish the witness's incompetency.\nIn this case the witness does not appear to have been cross-examined and no evidence was offered on the prisoner's behalf to show a want of capacity.\nThe case states that Dr. McKay was produced as a witness on behalf of the crown, and gave evidence establishing his competency to speak as a medical expert but not as an expert in any other particular, and he was not, it appears to me, asked to speak in any other capacity than as a medical man.\nIn the absence, then, of any cross-examination as to the witness's capacity or qualification, or any evidence before the question was answered to establish, as a preliminary question to be decided by the judge, that the question was not one of medical or surgical skill, and therefore Dr. McKay was not an expert, agreeing as I do with the learned judge who tried this case that the presiding judge must form his opinion of the witness's capacity to speak as an expert from the testimony before him, I think on the prim\u00e2 facie evidence before the judge he was justified in allowing and could not properly have refused to allow the question to be answered because it was distinctly put to the witness as a question of medical science or skill. This the question and answer beyond all doubt established, for the question is:\nFrom your knowledge of medical science in this respect and from your examination in this case, at how great or how less a distance would the muzzle of the gun be from a human body at the time of the discharge?\nThis was the question objected to and the answer to it was:\nJudging from what I saw, from the nature of the wound and its appearance, I would say that the muzzle of the gun was not nearer than twenty inches, and not further away than three feet when it was discharged. If the question was open to objection at the time it was put, it seems to me such objection was removed by the course pursued at the trial and it is not now open to the prisoner.\nThe prisoner's counsel did not confine his cross-examination to the competency of the witness, but appears to have interrogated as to the reasons the witness had for saying the muzzle of the gun was not nearer than 20 inches, one of which was that he saw no traces of burning and he says:\nIndependently of burning altogether I can say it could not have been any nearer than twenty inches.\nAnd again:\nIn reference to burning I based my opinion as to distance not so much as to the absence of burning as from the size of the wound and the jagged nature of the edges.\nHere the witness was clearly speaking as a medical expert, and thus the counsel brought out the very evidence he had, at a previous stage of the case, himself objected to. Had he intended to rely on the objection previously taken in my opinion he should, on cross-examination, have refrained from bringing out the very same testimony to which, on the direct examination, he had objected, thus making it his own.\nUnder all these circumstances I think the appeal should be dismissed.\nSTRONG J.\u2014In this case I am compelled to differ from the Chief Justice and, I believe, from the majority of the court. I am of opinion that the judgments of the Chief Justice and of Mr. Justice McDonald in the court below were correct and that the question objected to was improperly allowed.\nThere can be no doubt as to the rule established in practice and by incontrovertible authority, that no evidence of matters of opinion is admissible except where the subject is one involving questions of a particular science in which persons of ordinary experience are unable to draw conclusions from the facts. The jury must, as a general rule, draw all inferences themselves and witnesses must speak only as to facts.\nThe only ground on which the ruling of the learned judge at the trial, as to the admissibility of this evidence, could be sustained is that the matter is one involving experience and skill in medical science. I cannot agree in the opinion that it is. Following the line of argument of the Chief Justice of Nova Scotia I think the evidence depends on other considerations than those of medical science, namely, the description of the gun, the size of the bore, the charge of powder and other facts, none of which came within the range of that peculiar observation and study which qualifies a medical expert to pronounce an opinion. It appears to me very obvious that a person familiar with the use of fire-arms, for instance a gun-maker or an instructor of musketry accustomed to test and use such weapons, would be more competent to pronounce an opinion on a point of this kind than a medical man, and that, in the absence of evidence from such a source, the jury should have been left to draw their own conclusions from the facts.\nThe admissibility of the witness as an expert, competent to state an opinion on the point in question, was, of course, entirely a question for the judge, and it was for him to say, in the first instance, whether Dr. McKay's testimony on this head came within the required condition. But this ruling of the learned judge, though on a question of fact, is open to review on appeal.\nThe witness himself says that he had no personal experience in the use of fire-arms, which I think is conclusive against the admissibility of his evidence, for I cannot agree that the witness is to be considered as establishing his own competency by merely stating that here were indicia known to him from his professional studies, from which he was enabled to form a judgment as to the distance from the deceased at which the gun which inflicted the fatal wound was fired.\nAs regards authority it is remarkable that no English case in point is to be found. This, it seems to me, is in the prisoner's favor since, if such evidence was admissible, the reports would have contained records of, at least, some instances in which it had been admitted.\nAmerican authority is in the prisoner's favor for although there is no case in which the facts are precisely similar the cases of Kennedy v. The People[24]; Cooper v. The State[25]; Cook v. The Stale[26] are all decisions which lay down principles at variance with those enunciated by the court below and establish that the evidence ought not to have been admitted.\nAs to the other question I entirely agree with the observations of the Chief Justice with reference to the impropriety of the clergyman's address, and also in the opinion that it did not affect the regularity of the proceedings.\nMy conclusion is that the appeal should be allowed and the conviction quashed.\nFOURNIER J.\u2014I think the evidence of Dr. McKay, produced as an expert, should not have been allowed. His knowledge of the matters as to which he testified was very slight. He was brought as an expert to speak, from his own experience and knowledge, as to what distance the gun must have been from the body when fired. This is what he says himself:\u2014\nThere are indicia in medical science from which it can be said at what distance small shot were fired at the body. I have studied this\u2014not personal experience\u2014but from books.\nThis being a matter of opinion, and not a fact at all, unless he was really an expert should not have been allowed. The character of the evidence must have had great weight with the jury.\nI agree with the opinion expressed by Chief Justice McDonald in the court below, and I think the conviction bad on this ground.\nThere is another objection as to which I agree with the observations made by all the judges in both courts. It was certainly a great indiscretion on the part of the clergyman to make the remarks he did in the presence of the jury, but the remarks were of such a general character that I do not think the jury could have been influenced by them. I agree with the observations censuring such conduct.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014I am of opinion that this appeal should be dismissed.\nAs to the first objection raised by the appellant, that is to say, the one relating to what the Rev. Mr. Brown said in the course of his sermon, in the presence of the jury, there is nothing in it. The reverend gentleman, far from saying anything hostile to the prisoner, actually appealed to the mercy of the jury in his favor. But even if he had expressed himself in terms that might have been construed against the prisoner that would not nullify the verdict. The case of The Attorney General v. Wright[27], is altogether against the appellant on this point.\nThe second point is whether the answer of Dr. McKay to the following question was rightly admitted in evidence:\u2014\nFrom your knowledge of medical science in this respect, and from your examination in this case, at how great or how less a distance wonld the muzzle of the gun be from a human body at the time of the discharge? The answer was as follows:\u2014\nJudging from what I saw, from the nature of the wound and its appearance, I would say that the muzzle of the gun was not nearer than twenty inches, and not further away than three feet, when it was discharged.\nThe contention is, that this was a question which could only have been put and answered by an expert, and that the witness was not shown to have been an expert on that subject.\nThe witness further said:\u2014\nThere are indicia in medical science from which it can be said at what distance small shot were fired at the body. I have studied this\u2014not personal experience\u2014but from books.\nIn cross-examination he says:\u2014\nI based my opinion as to the distance, not so much as to the absence of burning as from the size of the wound and jagged nature of the edge.\nI am of opinion that this evidence was admissible for the reasons given by my brother Gwynne, whose elaborate notes I have read. I could add nothing to his reasoning on the subject.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014The appeal in this case must, in my opinion, be dismissed. As to the point reserved in relation to the observations made by the minister in his sermon to his congregation knowing the jury who were charged with the case of the accused to be present, it is obvious that the case of the appellant could not have been prejudiced by such observations for, however unseemly it was for the minister to assume to address any observations to the jury under the circumstances, the particular observations were in the interest of the accused and substituting the word \"mercy\" for \"equity\" were such as might have been addressed to the jury by the judge who tried the case.\nThe other point reserved relates to the propriety of the surgeon who made the post mortem examination of the deceased being permitted to express his opinion as to certain facts which he observed on the post mortem examination. After he had given evidence of the injuries which he found upon the body of the deceased\u2014of the nature of the wound (a gun shot wound) which was the cause of death\u2014of its external appearance and its internal effects\u2014and having stated that he had examined the wound particularly with a view of discerning the distance which the gun might have been from the deceased at the time of the infliction of the wound he was asked\u2014\nFrom your knowledge of medical science in this respect, and from your examination in this case, at how great or how less a distance would the muzzle of the gun have been from the body at the time of the discharge?\nTo this question although objected to (the objection having been overruled) the witness replied as' follows,\nJudging from what I saw\u2014from the nature of the wound and its appearance I would say that the muzzle of the gun was not nearer than twenty inches and not further away than three feet when it was discharged. The carrying capacity of the gun and the nature of the charge, and the condition of the gun as regards cleanliness and the shape of the hole would modify the distance as given by me. There are cases on record where the gun was a much greater distance than I have described and produced such a wound as I have described. In my opinion it would be impossible for a man after receiving such a wound to walk six feet, turn, and sit down. If a man had been shot standing upright and I found him at a distance of six feet sitting down after such a wound as I have described, I would expect to find blood all down his legs and pants and into his shoes and probably on the ground, (if it were possible for a man to do that) for with such a wound the heart would cease to beat instantly after such a wound.\nAssuming the admission in evidence of this opinion to have been an irregularity, the verdict of the jury does not for that reason become necessarily vitiated. It is not every irregularity that will vitiate a verdict, but only such an one from which it clearly appears, or can at least be reasonably affirmed that the case of the accused has been or may have been unjustly prejudiced thereby.\nNow, it is difficult to conceive how such prejudice could hare arisen in the present case, by reason of this opinion of the surgeon who had made the post mortem examination, for he stated fully the facts observed by himself, upon which his opinion was founded as to the particular fact inferred from those which he had' observed; if those facts did not justify the opinion the attention of the jury could not have failed to have been drawn thereto both by counsel for the prisoner and by the judge, and that this was done by the prisoner's counsel appears from the cross-examination of the witness. If the opinion was well founded I cannot see how it can be said that any injustice was done to the prisoner by its admission, and if upon cross-examination or otherwise it could have been shown to have been founded on insufficient facts it is not likely to have had any effect upon the jury. The contention, however, is not that the opinion was not well-founded, but that the question which the jury had to decide, namely, as to the guilt or innocence of the prisoner, should have been left to them without the aid of the opinion of the witness upon the fact as to which he gave the opinion, and that the mere admission of the opinion as evidence constituted such an irregularity as in point of law avoids the verdict. No case directly in point has been cited in support of this proposition and, in my opinion, it is not one for which the ends of justice demand that a precedent should be made. But the admission of the opinion in evidence did not, in my judgment, constitute any irregularity; the opinion was one the admission of which was justified by precedent as coming within a recognized exception to the general rule. It is not necessary to discuss here how far the authority of Carter v. Boehm[28], Durrell v. Bederley[29], and Campbell v. Richards[30], has been shaken by modern decisions, for the opinion given by the witness in the present case was not upon a question which was the very one which the jury had to decide, as were the questions upon which the opinions of the insurance broker were offered in evidence in the above cases.\nThe questions in these easels were\u2014whether, in the opinion of the witnesses offered, certain matters not disclosed to underwriters were material to have been and should have been disclosed and whether, if they had been disclosed, the policies would have been entered into. This was the very point which the juries in those cases had to decide. Here the case is very different; the question which the jury had to pass upon was the guilt or innocence of the prisoner in respect to the felony with which he was charged. This was not the question upon which the opinion of the surgeon in the present case was called and given. His opinion was formed upon facts observed by himself on the autopsy which he had made on the body of the deceased, and was given as to another fact deducible from the facts which had come under his direct observation and which, although it may have been as material to enable the jury to arrive at a just conclusion upon the question they had to decide as any other fact in evidence in the case was material to that purpose, still his opinion so given can by no means be said to have been one upon the very point the jury had to decide so as to make it inadmissible upon that ground.\nThe contention, however, is that, and it is no doubt in general terms true that, facts only should be stated to the jury and the inferences to be drawn from those facts should be left to them, and that therefore the witness's evidence should have been confined to the facts which came under his observation, leaving the jury to draw from his narrative of those facts their inference as to the other fact if it was material: but the object of all judicial enquiry is to elicit truth, and when a medical man gives evidence upon the trial of an indictment for homicide as to matters observed by him upon a post mortem examination of the deceased his evidence from the nature of the case must for the most part be given in the form of his opinion; and when an inference as to the existence of a fact not seen is to be drawn from the facts which were observed by himself on the post mortem, his opinion as to the inference is not at all in the nature of a decision on a fact to the exclusion of the jury, but is evidence of a new fact not to admit which, if the fact inferred be relevant to the point in issue and which the jury have to decide, would be to reject what was essential to the investigation of truth; the fact which was sought to be established by the opinion of the surgeon who made the post mortem was as to the distance which the gun from which was discharged the charge of shot which caused the death of the deceased may have been from his body when discharged; that may have been an important fact which, in connection with other facts appearing in evidence, may have materially aided in enabling the jury to arrive at a sound and just conclusion upon the question they had to decide, namely, the guilt or innocence of the prisoner.\nNow the external appearance of the wound, its shape and the jagged nature of the edge as well as the internal effects found, were matters which gave to the skilful anatomist and professional observer exceptional opportunity and peculiar knowledge enabling him to arrive at a correct judgment as to the fact to establish which the question was put to him, which no one but an actual and competent observer of the wound, its character and its effects, could possibly have had, and which no narrative of the appearance of the wound could convey to a jury who had no opportunity of seeing the wound itself even if they had the skill to observe its internal effects. The opinion, therefore, of the surgeon who did observe the wound and who, as he says, examined it for the express purpose of forming an opinion upon the fact as to which the question was put to him was evidence which was admissible as to the fact inferred, and which was proper to be submitted to the jury; indeed the case of Kennedy v. The People[31] upon which the learned counsel for the appellant chiefly relied is an authority in support of this view, for there it was held by the Court of Appeals for the State of New York that the opinion of the surgeon who made the post mortem as to the amount of force necessary to produce the wound which he found upon the deceased was properly received in evidence. Now in the present case the question objected to was one pointing precisely to the degree of force necessary to make with a charge of shot the wound which the witness found upon the deceased, the force in such case being to be estimated by the distance which the gun from which the charge of shot came may have been from the body in order to make the wound such as he found it to be. Mr. Wharton, in his work on criminal evidence, gives very many instances of the admission of the opinions of witnesses as evidence under circumstances similar to the present as, for example, among others that certain hair upon a club was in the opinion of the witness human hair and resembled the hair of the deceased\u2014that a certain substance was hard pan\u2014that a certain person appeared to be in fear\u2014that on being held to answer he looked as if he felt badly\u2014that the appearance of a blood-stain indicated that the spirt came from below; and he lays it down as a general rule, in the justice and propriety of which I entirely concur, and in support of which he cites several authorities of the courts of the United States, namely, that it is not necessary for a witness to be an expert to enable him to give an opinion as to matter depending upon special knowledge when he states the facts upon which he bases his opinions. In Alcock v. The Royal Exchange Ins. Co.[32], the Court of Queen's Bench, consisting of Lord Denman C. J., Coleridge, Wightman and Erle JJ., held that in an action for a total loss of an insured vessel, the captain having abandoned her, and the defence being that there had been no total loss, a witness might be asked whether from what he had observed of the captain's habits in \"A\" before the voyage he could form any judgment as to his general habits of sobriety or intoxication.\nSo in an action for words spoken or written a witness may be asked whether there had taken place any thing which gave a peculiar character to the expressions used; and if there had he may then be asked what in his opinion was the meaning intended by the expressions. It is quite a common practice that a surgeon who has made a post mortem examination of a deceased person on a case of homicide, should be asked whether a wound which he found to be the cause of death had been in his opinion caused by a blunt or a sharp instrument, whether a particular instrument produced and shown to the jury could or could not, in his opinion have inflicted the fatal wound[33].\nNow, any intelligent person provided he had examined the wound could form a sound judgment upon questions of this nature, but the opinion of an intelligent surgeon who had made the post mortem examination and who had applied his skill and judgment in ascertaining the precise extent of the injury internally as well as externally is no doubt the most competent person to give light upon the points to a jury who had no opportunity, and had not, perhaps, skill sufficient to enable them intelligently to examine the wound if it could have been, shown to them and to observe the extent of its effects.\nSo in the present case there can be no doubt that a skilful surgeon who had carefully observed not only the external appearance of the wound but the intensity of its internal effects had exceptional advantages and knowledge which the jury could not have had for estimating at what distance the gun when discharged may have been from the deceased in order to have inflicted a wound of the nature, extent and intensity which he found the wound to be which caused the death of the deceased, and as the jury were entitled to have laid before them the best evidence which can be procured upon all matters relevant to the determination of the issue they had to decide, the evidence was, in my opinion, quite proper to have been received, and to have been submitted to them for such weight as they might think it to be entitled to after a cross-examination of the witness and after hearing such other evidence, if any, as had been adduced calling in question the soundness of the opinion of the witness as resting upon the facts upon which he said he had based it, and hearing the comments of counsel.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for appellant: H.

S.C\u2014 Construction of\u2014Juror-\u2014Personation of\u2014Irregularity\u2014Cured by verdict.\nB. having been found guilty of feloniously having administered poison with intent to murder moved to arrest the judgment on the ground that one of the jurors who tried the case had not been returned as such.\nThe general panel of jurors contained the names of Joseph Lamoureux and Moise Lamoureux.

The sheriff served Joseph Lamoureux's summons on Mo\u00efse Lamoureux, and returned Joseph Lamoureux as the party summoned.

C. clearly covered the irregularity complained of. Strong and Fournier JJ. dissenting.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada on a case reserved by Mr. Justice Henri Taschereau at the Criminal Assizes of the district of Terrebonne, January, 1888.\nThe case reserved was as follows:\nThe indictment in this cause found by the Grand Jury alleged that the accused on the 29th of August, 1887, in the Parish of St. Benoit, District of Terrebonne, had feloniously administered to Francois Xavier St. Denis, one ounce of a certain poison called \" Paris Green,\" with the intent then and there to commit murder, on the person of the said Francois Xavier St. Denis.\nThe trial of the accused took place on the 14th, 16th & 17th of January instant, and terminated in a verdict of guilty rendered by the petty jury sworn for the trial.\nAfter the rendering of the verdict, the advocate for the accused made the following motion in arrest of judgment:\n\"Motion of the said Osias Brisebois, for arrest of judgment in this cause and that the verdict rendered against him on the 17th day of January instant be set aside and annulled and that the said Osias Brisebois be, if not liberated and discharged, at least afforded a new trial, to be held immediately, or at the approaching criminal assizes for this district, for among other reasons the following:\n\" Because it appears by the record and the minutes of this court that during the trial in this cause Joseph Lamoureux a resident of the Parish of St. Monique, in the said district, duly qualified and found on the list of petty jurors duly revised for the district of Terrebonne, deposited in the office of the sheriff of this district, and\u060c further, found and mentioned on the panel of petty jurors, bound to serve and to act as such during the trial of the said Osias Brisebois, did not answer himself in person to the calling of his name, but that another person, of the name of Mo\u00efse Lamoureux, also a resident of the said Parish of St. Monique, in said district, answered falsely and illegally to the calling of the said name of Joseph Lamoureux and did serve and Was sworn as a petty juror under the name of Joseph Lamoureux in the trial of the said Osias Brisebois, instead and in place of the said Joseph Lamoureux.\"\nOn this motion the advocate of the prisoner and the deputy of the Attorney General produced respectively affidavits and documents by means of which the following facts are established:\nThe general list of persons qualified as jurors contains at the same time the names of Joseph Lamoureux and of Mo\u0457se Lamoureux both described as farmers of the Parish of St. Monique, concession of La C\u00f4te des Saints.\nThe special panel of petty jurors bound to serve during the term contained the name of Joseph Lamoureux, farmer, St. Monique.\nAlthough the properties of the said two persons are situated in the said concession of La C\u00f4te des Saints, it appears that Mo\u0457se Lamoureux only had his residence on the road in front of the said concession, while Joseph Lamoureux had built on the road in front of the neighbouring concession of La C\u00f4te St. Jean.\nThe sheriff went himself to make the service on the petty jurors and going to the domicile of Mo\u00efse Lamoureux and without ascertaining his Christian name asked him if he was the only Lamoureux living in this concession. On the reply being in the affirmative by the said Mo\u00efse Lamoureux who believed, and who still appears to believe, that Joseph Lamoureux belongs to the concession of La C\u00f4te St. Jean, the sheriff gave to the said Mo\u00efse Lamoureux personally the summons intended for Joseph Lamoureux. Mo\u0457se Lamoureux obeyed this summons, answered during all the criminal term, and in particular at the trial of the accused cused, to the name of Joseph Lamoureux, was sworn as a juror in the said trial of the accused in the accused of any challenge, and thus formed part of the jury which rendered against the accused a verdict of guilty.\nIt is further in evidence that the accused at the time of the trial, and before, knew Mo\u0457se Lamourx, although he did not know his Christian name.\nThe evidence and these documents produced do not show that the prisoner had any cause of challenge against Mo\u0457se Lamoureux who served under the name of Joseph Lamoureux.\nThe special panel for the term did not contain the name of Mo\u0457se Lamoureux.\nOn this motion and in view of these facts I did not pronounce sentence against the accused,who was remanded to prison, and I thought it my duty to reserve the question for the consideration of the judges of the Court of Crown Cases Reserved; although an important precedent exists in the matter, reported in the 3 vol. of the Q.L.R.,P.212, Reg. v. Fiore,and although the 246th sec. of ch.174 of the Revised Statutes of Canada appears applicable to the case, I have found the question sufficiently special to merit the consideration of the honorable tribunal to which I have referred it\nThe Court of Queen's Bench Mr. Justice Tessier dissenting refused to interfere with the verdict and the prisoner then appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nLeduc (Belcourt with him) for appellant.\nF. X. Mathieu for respondent.\nThe points and cases relied on by the counsel are fully reviewed in the judgments hereinafter given.\nSir W. J. RITCHIE C.J. This was a case reserved under the Revised Statutes ch. 174 sec. 259 which enacts that every court before which any person is convicted on indictment for any treason, felony or misdemeanor, and every judge within the meaning of \"The Speedy Trials Act,\" trying any person under such act, may, in its or his discretion, reserve any questing of law which arises on the trial, for the consideration of the justices of the court for crown cases reserved, and thereupon may respite execution, &c.\"\nI am of opinion this was not a question arising at the trial, but it was an objection raised subsequent to the trial, and which could only be determined on a writ of error and could not be reserved and disposed of in a summary manner on affidavits. I am therefore of opinion that as this was not a question arising on the trial which could be reserved, the Court of Queen's Bench in Montreal had no jurisdiction to adjudicate on the case and consequently we have none, the prisoner's remedy, if any, being by writ of error. Mr. Justice Gwynne has permitted me to peruse what he has written and will read on this point, and as he has discussed the point so fully and I entirely agree with what he has written and with the conclusion at which he has arrived I have nothing further to add. I do not wish it, however to be understood that there should be a writ of error granted in this case, or to express any opinion as to what should or would be the result, if a writ of error was granted.\nIt has been also contended that this case comes within and is covered by sec. 246 of ch. 174 of the R. S. C. which enacts inter alia: \" Judgment, after verdict upon \" an indictment for any felony or misdemeanor shall \" not be stayed or reversed * * for any misnomer or \" mis-description of the officer returning such process \" ( jury process), or of any of the jurors,\u2014nor because \" any person has served upon the jury who was not \" returned as a juror by the sheriff or other officer.'' If I am right in the view I take upon the first point the determination of this question is not necessary for the disposal of this case, therefore without expressing a positive opinion I may say I incline very strongly to the view that if this case does not come within the very words of the act it is within the spirit and scope of the enactment and within the intent, policy and object if the legislature or, as Lord Coke expressed it, to suppress the mischief and advance the remedy.\nSTRONG J.\u2014I am of opinion that we ought to allow this appeal, quash the conviction and order a new trial.\nThe prisoner was indicted for a statutory felony\u2014administering poison with intent to commit murder\u2014 and was convicted. At the conclusion of the trial and before sentence, it was discovered that Mo\u0457se Lamoureux, one of the jurymen by whom he had been tried, had not been returned on the panel, but had either by mistake or design, which it does not appear, answered to the name of Joseph Lamoureux, a juryman who had been duly returned on the panel, and thus by personating the latter had been sworn in his place. The learned judge before whom the trial took place. reserved the case for the opinion of the Court of Queen's Bench on its appeal side pursuant to section 259 of the Criminal Procedure Act. The case having been argued before the Court of Queen's Bench, that court affirmed the conviction; one of the learned judges however, Mr. Justice Tessier, having differed from his colleagues, the prisoner was enabled to appeal to this court, which be has done,\nI am of opinion that Mellor's case (1), which has been relied on as a conclusive authority against this appeal, has no application here. In the first place the learned judges who there held there had been no mistrial, did so on the ground that William Thorniley, who by mistake appeared and was sworn in answer to the name of Joseph Henry Thorne, the person actually called, was himself a juror, whose name was contained in the panel duly returned by the sheriff. The prisoner in that case was not able to make the objection that he was tried by a jury, one of whom had no authority to try him. The case there was merely one where one juror was mistaken for another, and it is upon this circumstance that the judgments of those judges who held there had been no mistrial were principally rested, as will be seen from the clear statement of the argument from that point of view presented in the judgment of Mr. Justice Byles. The same argument is not available here, in answer to the prisoner's objection that he has been illegally tried, for it is manifest that only eleven out of the twelve jurors who had the prisoner in charge had authority to try him.\nNext, I cannot agree with the learned chief justice of the Queen's Bench in the opinion that this is an objection covered by the 246 section of the Criminal Procedure Act, (R. S. C. cap. 174). That section is a transcript, so far as the clause is concerned which enacts that a verdict shall not be \" stayed or reversed because any person has served upon the jury who was not returned as a juror by the sheriff or other officer,\" of the English Statute 7 Geo. 4c. 64 s. 21. This enactment was not referred to in Mellor's case for the very obvious reason that it did not apply since both the juror called and the juror who presented himself and was sworn in his stead had been legally \" returned as jurors by the sheriff,\" and therefore, the case did not come within the terms of the statute. Here, however, the person sworn on the jury was not duly returned and therefore it has been said that the statute applies. There is, however, in the present case something more than the irregularity which the statute Was designed to cure, the mere serving on the jury of a person not duly returned by the sheriff to serve. Not only was the juror who illegally served here not duly returned, but he personated one who was duly returned, and in that way a wrong has been practised on the prisoner, a wrong which, if done knowingly, was undoubtedly a high contempt of court and an indictable offence, and if done innocently and by mistake may nevertheless have greatly prejudiced the prisoner on his trial. If section 246 covers a case like this, so it would also cover a case where the personation of the juror was the result of a deliberately planned fraud, a conspiracy between the juror actually summoned and a stranger personating him, with the very purpose and design of introducing upon the jury a person whose object it might be corruptly to convict the prisoner. It is impossible to suppose that the statute could apply to validate the trial in such a case, and if it would not it must also be inapplicable in the present case.\nThe whole tenor of the reasoning of the judges who thought there was no mis-trial in Mellor's case favors this view.\nFurther Mellor's case can be no authority against the prisoner on the question of mis-trial. Of the fourteen learned judges who composed the court in that case, two, Chief Baron Pollock and Mr. Justice Wiliiams, gave no opinion on this point, but rested their judgments exclusively on the ground that the court had no jurisdiction to entertain the question reserved. The remaining twelve judges were equally divided on this point\u2014six, including Lord Campbell C.J., Cock burn C.J., Coleridge and Wightman JJ., and Watson and Martin BB., holding distinctly that there had been a mis-trial, whilst the remaining six judges were of a contrary opinion. It is evident, therefore, that on this point of the nullity or validity of the trial Mellor's case can be of no decisive authority, and we are thrown back on the preceding authorities and on the reasons, apart from authority, for and against the view contended for on behalf of the prisoner, reasons which are stated with great force and lucidity in the opposing judgments delivered in Mellor's case. As regards the effect which this case of Mellor ought to have upon our decision on this appeal, I cannot, however, refrain from saying that although their judgments were neutralized by the voices of an equal number of judges on the opposite side, yet the weight of high authority and of great names is decidedly with the six judges who pronounced for the prisoner, and I more especially refer to the two most distinguished judges whose names head the list, who successively filled the office of Lord Chief Justice of England, and whose pre-eminence as great common law judges cannot be questioned,\u2014Lord Campbell and Sir Alexander Cock-burn.\nThe only authority in which the facts resemble those in the present case, where a juryman whose name was on the panel and who had been duly summoned in his proper name was personated by a stranger whose name was not on the panel and who had received no summons to serve is the civil case of Hill v. Yates ([1]), where the Court of Queen's Bench did certainly refuse a rule nisi for a new trial on this ground. I consider that case, however, to be virtually disposed of in the judgment of Lord Campbell in Mellor's case where its unsoundness is most conclusively demonstrated. The reasons thus given by Lord Campbell are in the main the same as those which I have already stated as being an answer to the argument raised on behalf of the crown that the prisoner's objection in the present case Was met by the 246th section of the Criminal Procedure Act, viz., that if the irregularity were to be considered as a ground of challenge only, and as not invalidating the trial, the consequence would be, that there would be no remedy, where the wrongful substitution of a stranger for a juror took place with the deliberate and malicious intent of prejudicing the prisoner on his trial. These reasons seem to me un-answerable in a case like the present, where the juror regularly called has been personated by one who was not himself on the panel whatever weight they ought to have in a case like Mellor's where the person sub stituted was himself a juror, duly summoned and on the panel, and thus legally selected and having authority for the trial of the prisoner subject only to the latter's right of challenge. I am of opinion, therefore, that we ought not to consider ourselves bound by Hill v. Yates, more especially as that case was not a decision of a Court of Error or Appeal but of a court of first instance only, and moreover a decision pronounced in a civil cause and on a motion for a new trial.\nAs regards the comparative weight of the reasoning. apart from authority, upon which the respective views of the learned judges in Mellor's case are supported it seems to me that the reasons of Lord Campbell and the judges who agreed with him far outweigh the arguments put forward by those who held opposite opinions.\nIn Mellor's case the arguments against the prisoner on the point of mis-trial appear to have been principally of two kinds, first those which depended on the important circumstance, which distinguishes that case from the present, that the person who was there substituted for the juror called was himself a juror, whose name was regularly upon the panel, a consideration which makes all the reasons so based entirely inapplicable here, and secondly arguments deduced from considerations of public policy, and the inconvenience of a judicial decision which might open the door to a class of frivolous, technical objections tending in some instances to a failure of justice in the administration of the criminal law. That public inconvenience may possibly be occasioned by holding the objection now raised by the prisoner a ground for invalidating the conviction, may to a certain extent be true but that does not constitute a sufficient reason why a prisoner should be deprived of a fair trial, as he certainly might be if the contrary rule should now be enunciated by authority. The fallacy in the argument thus derived from public policy and convenience is that those who advance it contemplate that this species of fraud on the law, by the personation of jurors in criminal cases will only be perpetrated in the interest of prisoners, whereas it is apparent that it may also be resorted to by those who may seek to injure and prejudice prisoners in their trials, and so long as the last alternative is possible an argument derived from the mere probability that such an abuse of justice will be more frequently practised on behalf of accused persons than against them ought not to prevail. In other words, there is no higher policy known to the common law of England than that which seeks to assure to every person brought under criminal accusation an absolutely fair and impartial trial. The courts have it in their own power to protect themselves, at least in a great degree, against any misapplication of a rule of procedure, involved in a decision of this appeal in favor of the prisoner by enforcing greater caution and diligence on their own officers, by seeing that proper accommodation is provided for jurymen summoned on the panel so that they may be kept apart from the crowd of mere spectators who throng the courts, and by enforcing exemplary punishment when a case of wilful personation is discovered; by these means the anticipated evil which, after all, is probably chimerical, will seldom be likely to cause a failure of justice. But even though the danger were a hundredfold greater it ought not, in my judgment, to weigh for a moment against the sacred right of a prisoner to have a fair trial, a right which it is impossible he can in the future enjoy if the judicial sanction of a court of appeal is now given to proceedings by which the prisoner was not only deprived of his right of challenge but possibly tried and convicted by a juror who may have introduced himself upon the jury for the express purpose of prejudicing the trial against him. Lord Campbell, in his judgment in Mellor's case, answers this argument from public inconvenience thus conclusively:\nThere may certainly be a dread that frivolous objections to procedure in criminal cases may be encouraged by our decision; but it is no frivolous objection that the prisoner on a trial for murder was, without any fault of his own, deprived of his right to challenge one of the jurymen who tried him, and I hope the Judges may safely rely upon their own efforts, and, if necessary, upon the aid of the legislature, to repress mere technicalities, which seek to screen guilt instead of protecting innocence.\nSir Alexander Cock burn in his judgment is equally pronounced against this argument derived ab inconvenienti. We have therefore these great chief justices, both of whom were most experienced criminal lawyers and who had both served in the office of Attorney General before their promotion to the bench, repudiating in the most clear and emphatic manner this argument by which it was sought to infringe on a prisoner's right to a fair trial. I have never read or heard that either of the chief justices was liable to be influenced by sentimental considerations in favor of prisoners; the traditions of the profession are, as I have always heard, rather to the contrary; we may therefore safely assume, that in a case like the present they would have considered the nullity of the trial beyond all doubt or question. In short Mellor's case, so far from being authority against the prisoner on this point as to the validity of the trial, is in truth a strong one in his favor, inasmuch as the opinions of the six judges (including the two chief justices) who there pronounced for the prisoner are, a fortiori, applicable here, whilst the opinions of the six judges, who were there against the prisoner applied to an. irregularity of a totally different kind from that which occurred on the trial now under consideration. I am, therefore, of opinion .that there was such a miscarriage in the trial of the appellant. that at common law the whole proceeding was a nullity Further, I hold that the trial having thus been illegal and void at common law, the 246th sec. of the Criminal Procedure Act does not for the reasons before stated cure such irregularity and that it has therefore no, application whatever to the case.\nNext it is argued for the crown that the 259th:sec. of the Criminal Procedure Act providing for the-reservation of questions of law arising on the trial of indictments does not apply, and Mellor's case is again invoked as an authority for this proposition also. Here, again, I Have to determine against the crown, The great argument against the jurisdiction in Mellor's case was that there was no power conferred on the court to issue a venire de novo, so that if the conviction should have been quashed the prisoner must have gone free. The court there, like the court for crown cases reserved under the present statute, was a purely statutory court, and had no authority save such as was conferred upon it by the express words, or by necessary implication from the express words, of an act of Parliament. Had the facts been as here showing indubitably that there had been a mistrial, and had the statute conferred the powers now given by sec. 268 of the Criminal Procedure Act, and which applied to the Court of Queen's Bench as well as it applies to this court, authorizing the granting of a new trial, (a substitution for the common law remedy of a venire de novo) where \" the conviction is declared bad for a cause \" which makes the former trial a nullity so that there \" was no lawful trial in the cause;\" had, I say, the English statute conferred such a power as this the principal ground of the argument against the jurisdiction in Mellor's case would have entirely failed. As the act of parliament now enables the courts here to do justice by remanding the prisoner for a new trial, I can see no objection to holding that the Court of Queen's Bench had jurisdiction to entertain this objection to the validity of the conviction as \" a question arising on the \"trial,\" as I feel assured the English court would also have done in Mellor's case had the opinion of Lord Campbell and those who agreed with him, that there had been a mis-trial, prevalled and had the statute in terms conferred the \"power to order a venire de novo or the power which this court and the Court of Queen's Bench now possess of ordering anew trial.\nI am of opinion that the trial of the appellant should (in the words of the statute be declared to have been a \"nullity,\" that the conviction should be quashed and a new trial ordered.\nFOURNIER J.\u2015Aux assises du district de Terrebonne tenues en janvier dernier Osias Brisbois a subi son proc\u00e9s pour avoir f\u00e9lonieusement administr\u00e9 un certain poison \u00e0 F.

A chacun de ces appels, Mo\u00efse Lamoureux, qui avait re\u00e7u, par erreur, l'assignation destin\u00e9e \u00e0 Joseph, s'est pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 \u00e0 la place de celui-ci et a ill\u00e9galement pr\u00eat\u00e9 serment comme jur\u00e9, si\u00e9g\u00e9 comme tel, pris part au verdict\u2014sous le nom do son fr\u00e9re\u2014sans avoir pr\u00eat\u00e9 ser* ment sous son nom. ni r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9 son identit\u00e9 en aucune mani\u00e8re.

Elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 soulevee bien des fois en Angleterre. L'honorable juge Ramsay dans ses notes sur la cause de Feore (1), en a cit\u00e9 plusieurs cas d'o\u00f9 il a conclu:\nI take it, therefore, that before the passing of the statute 21 of Jac. I the serving as juror of any person not a juror, or one juror for another or by a name not his, or by a false addition, or of any-disqualified person, would make the trial null, and that is only modified in the Jac. I, and by. the section of our Criminal .Procedure Act, 32 and 33 Vic, oh. 29, sec. 79.\nCette derni\u00e8re section est -maintenant remplac\u00e9e par la;246me section du chapitre .174, Statuts revis\u00e9s du Canada, d\u00e9clarant que nul jugement apr\u00e8s verdict ne* sera arr\u00eat\u00e9; ni infirm\u00e9 pour diverses raisons et- entre autres la suivante:\nNi \u00e0 -raison de ce qu'une personne aura servi le jury, bien qu'e elle n'e au nombre des jur\u00e9s sur le rapport du sh\u00e9rif.\nComme on le volt, le texte qui concerne la, question soulev\u00e9e ici se le jugement ne sera pas arr\u00eat\u00e9 parce qu'una personne dont le nom n'\u00e9tait. pas sur la liste des jures aura servi comma tel Ce serait bien faire application de cette disposition, si Mo\u00efse Lamoreux, dont le nom n'\u00e9tait pas sur la liste, e\u00fbt \u00e9t\u00e9 soit par m\u00e9prise ou par une erreur quelconque, appel\u00e9 par son v\u00e9ritabee nom \u00e0 faire partie du jury. Une telle irr\u00e9gularit\u00e9 aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 sans doute couverte par. la section 246. Mais les choses sont loin de s'\u00eatre pass\u00e9es de cette mani\u00e8re. Joseph Lamoureux dont le nom se trouvait r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement sur la liste \u00e9tant appel\u00e9, c'est Mo\u00efse qui se pr\u00e9sente \u00e0 sa place et le personnifie. Il pr\u00eate serment sous Un nom, qui n'est pas le sien et, s'ouvre ainsi l'entr\u00e9e du jury par in faux serment. Il r\u00e9p\u00e8te cette imposture \u00e0 chaque fols que Joseph Lamoureux est appel\u00e9 et il a le soin de si bien cacher son identit\u00e9 qu'elle n'est d\u00e9couverte qu'apr\u00e8s le verdict. Est-ce une de ces irregularit\u00e9s couverte par la clause 246? Evidemment non; la loi presume que le jure dont le nom n'est pas sur la liste a d\u00fb \u00eatre appele son nom. Elle ne peut cert\u00e0inom\u00ebnt pas s interpr\u00e9ter de maniere \u00e0 couvrir le cas de celui quia faussement pris le nom d'un autre et jure faussement qu'il est un tel, tandis qu'il est une autre personne. \" C'est-gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 deux offenses criminelles bien graves: au faux serment et \u00e0 la personnification, que Mo\u00efse Lamoureux a r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 p\u00e9n\u00e9trer dans le jury. P\u00ebut-on dire que la loi' entendait traiter comme simple irr\u00e9gularitele fait dont Mo\u00efse Lamour\u00ebux s'est rendu coupable? Par cetee supercherie, il a emp\u00each\u00e9 l\u00eb prisonnier de se pr\u00e9valoir de son droit de r\u00e9cusation.

Qiel pouvait \u00eatre ses motifs d'en agir ainsi? Nous les ignorons; mais l\u00e9tranget\u00e9 et l'ill\u00e9galit\u00e9 de sa condutte ne font pr\u00e9sumer rien de bon en sa faveur. On no devrait pas en \u00eatre r\u00e9duit \u00e0 des suppositions pOur s'assurer si le prisonnier a eu un proc\u00e8s r\u00e9guli\u00e9r et impartial.\nOn a invoqu\u00e9 contre la position prise par le prisonnier l'autorit\u00e9 de la decision 'dans la bause' de Mellor (1), dans liquelle une question analogue s'est sonlev\u00e9e Cette decision a \u00e9t\u00e9 cit\u00e9e et discut\u00e9e dans la cour du Banc de la Reine de Qu\u00e9bec, dans la cause de Regina v Feore (1), mais la majorit\u00e9 de la courn'a pas consid\u00e9r\u00e9 qu'elle devatt avoir toute l'importance d'un pr\u00e9c\u00e9deiit, parce que sur la question \u00e0 decider par la cour du Banc de la Reine, les juges anglais s'\u00e9thient trouv\u00e9s divis\u00e9s \u00e9galement, six d'un c\u00f4t\u00e9 et six de l'autre.

Les questions en d\u00e9bat, il est vrai, ont \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9es avec beaucoup de science et de, d\u00e9veloppement, mais pour r\u00e9pondre aux arguments employ\u00e9s par les juges de la majorit\u00e9, ii n'y a qu'\u00e0 se servir des arguments encore plus solides donn\u00e9s par la minorit\u00e9.\nA l'objection faite, que la cour na pas juridiction pour adjuger sur une question r\u00e9serv\u00e9e, qui n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9e qu'apr\u00e8s le verdict, je r\u00e9pondrai par largument de l'honorable juge Ramsay sur la m\u00eame question dans la cause de Regina v.

L'honorable juge s'exprima ainsi:\nWith regard to the first of these points it does not arise in this case, for the question was raised before the end of the trial that is before sentence. But in any case it would be a very narrow mode of interpreting an enactment such as that permitting the reservation of Crown cases, to say that a question did not arise at the trial because it was not insisted upon then. The question took its rise at the trial, although only noticed after. Again, if under the statute the judge had not power to reserve the question, he certainly could not have enlered the difficulty on the record, and the accused would have been without remedy, whether he suffered injustice or not, thus effectually avoiding all the inconveniences so much dreaded by lord Ellenborough. The jurisprudence in this province is to give the fullest possible scope to the enactment permitting the reservation of questions of law, and I think our jurisprudence is more consistent than that in England on the point.\nPour tous ces motifs, je suis d'opinion que l'appel devrait \u00eatre accord\u00e9.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014The appellant having been found guilty of feloniously having administered poison with intent to murder, moved to arrest the judgment on the ground that one of the jurors who tried the case had not been returned as such. As this irregularity did not appear on the face of the record it could clearly, not constitute a ground for a motion in arrest of judgment. A case having, however, been reserved by the judge presiding at the trial, and determined, by the full court of Queen's Bench, we have, I presume to consider it as properly before us on the facts as stated in the court below, assuming, here, of course that the case could be reserved.\nThese facts are as follows. The general panel of jurors contained the two names of Joseph Lamoureux and of Moise Lamoureux. The special panel for the term of the court at which the prisoner was tried contained only the name of Joseph Lamoureux. The sheriff, however, served Joseph Lamoureux's summons on Moise Lamoureux, but returned Joseph Lamoureux as the party summoned. Moise Lamoureux appeared in court, as a juror, during the whole term answering to the name of Joseph Lamoureux and on this Brisebois', trial, went in the box without challenge having likewise answered to the name of Joseph Lamoureux.\nI am of opinion that this appeal should be dismissed on the ground, taken by the Court of Queen's Bench at Montreal viz.: \"that section 246 ch. 174 of the Rev Stat. clearly covers the irregularity complained of by the appellant here.\" This section in express terms enacts that judgment shall not be stayed or reversed because any person has served upon the jury who was not returned as a juror by the sheriff. Now here the only irregularity complained of is that Moise Lamoureux has served upon the jury, though not returned as a juror by the sheriff.\nThis is precisely what the statute says will not be a ground for staying or reversing the judgment. The reason that in Mellor's case (1), the corresponding Imperial enactment, 7 Geo. IV, c. 64, sec. 21 was not cited is that the enactment had in that case, no application. There no question arose of a patty serving as a juror who had not been returned by the sheriff as such. Reg. v. Feore (1) has also been relied upon by the appellant but that case does not bind us, did it apply to-the present one. The case of Dovey v.Hobson:(1) is in point and would conclude this case even without the above clause of our statute.\nAs to the question whether the point raised-was one which could be reserved by the judge at- the trial, I am of opinion with the Chief Justice and- Mr.J Justice Gwynne that it was not one which could be reserved. Jam of opinion that-this appeal should -be-dismissed.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014In Mellor's case (1); the Court of Criminal Appeais in crown cases res\u00ebrved, upon the opinion of eight judges against six, affirmed the Conviction. Seven of the eight were of opinion that the point submitted which was similar to that submitted in the present case did not come within the jurisdiction of the court for hearing crown cases reserved; and that it could only be raised if at all, upon a Writ of error as error in fact not \u00e9rror in law Five Of the seven held that if so raised, the irregularity which was complained of, constituted no mis-trial, in which opinion the eighth also concurred but he gave no opinion as to the jurisdiction of the court further than that he doubted its having any jurisdiction to award a venire de novo; and the other two-gave no opinion upon the question of mis-trial or no mis-trial, because the point was not properly before them, not opening up on writ of error Of the other six who were of opinion that the court had jurisdiction, and that the irrtegularity complained of did constitute-mis-trial, two namely Cockburn\".- C. J. and Watson B expressed themselves as having arrived at this opinion with great doubt and a third Martin B. Tested his judgment upon the principle which he laid down, namely, that in these cases of questions of law, reserved under the statute for the opinion of the court of crown cases reserved, the statement of the judge as to the facts upon which the question of law submitted by him depends must be received by the court as absolute verity. If the questions which can be reserved -under the statute are limited to questions upon matter appearing on the record, as in arrest of judgment, and questions of law arising during the progress of the trial which the judge presiding at the trial might have judicially determined himself if he had been so minded; the principle that the judge's statement of the facts upon which he wished to submit a question of law to the opinion of the court should be received by the court as absolute verity seems to be perfectly sound; but if the statement of facts made by the judge is in all cases submitted under the statute to be received as absolute verity, that' to my mind affords a conclusive argument against the question which was submitted in Mellor's case and that which is submitted in the present Case being* within the contemplation of the statute; for, in the absence of any provision in the statute authorizing Or enabling a judge to collect material after verdict, upon which to make a statement of facts for the purpose of submitting thereon a question of law, the decision of which, may aff\u00e8ct the' verdict, I cannot recognize the principle upon which such a statement should be received as absolute verity; or why either the prisoner or the crown should be deprived of their right to dispute the truth of the facts as settled by the judge, or if true of displacing them by other facts proposed to be put in course' of judical \u00e9nquiry as they would have the right to do in the case of a writ of error n fact; which appears to be the only proceeding by which the truth of the facts relied upon as being sufficient to vacate the verdict or of other facts pleaded or relied upon as displacing the effect of the former, assuming them to be true, can je judicially established. The decision in Mellor's case has never been question a that I have been able to find except in the case of The (Dussiz v. Feore (1) in which case with great deference I say it the learned judges who set aside the verdict do not seem to me to have correctly appreciated the grounds upon which the judgments Of the learned judges who affirmed the conviction in Mellor's case proceeded.\nThe case is cited as law in the edition of Roscoe\u2019s Criminal Evidence by Horace Smith of 1884 (1) and in a note to Chitty's Statutes, 4th edition by Lely (2). The reasoning of those learned judges upon both points is to my mind most conclusive. Pollock O.B. says.\nApart from the statute which created this tribunal 11.12. Vic. ch. 78, the objection, if any, could not have been taken except on \u00e0 writ of error, and. the error, if error it be, is error in fact and not error in law. In my judgment the statute was clearly not intended to supersede the Court of Error and to confer upon this court all its functions\nAnd again:\nThe authority and jurisdiction of the court is, in my opinion, limited to matters of law occurring upon the trial, of which the judge can take judical notice, and in providing for giving effect to the decision of this court and the certificate founded thereon there are express directions given as to what shall be done in each case. It appears to me that the statute contemplated the final determination of the matter and never contemplated any new trial or any Venire de novo\nAfter reading the terms of the statute which I may here observe are substantially identical with ours, the learned Chief Baron proceeded:\nIt appears to me that the statute never contemplated any new trial and I think that will be clear when we come to consider what are the provisions made in the act. for they are very express and direct as to what shall be done, upon the certificate going down to the court in which the point arose.\nReferring then to the words of the statute that the court is\u2014to make such, other order as justice may require, he referred to Regina v. Faderman (1); in which it was held that those words only enable the court to order a party to be let out on bail or to do any other thing of the like kind which justice may seem to demand, and he adds:\nIf this part of the act which enables us to make any other order such as justice may require,\" is to be taken to apply to a case like the present I should be glad to know why, if we can award a venire de novo, we cannot grant a new trial in any case where improper evidence has been received, but which in reality was not calculated to have any influence upon the verdict. If we are to award a venire de novo, because the prisoner may have lost some benefit, of which there is no suggestion before us, then I would ask, in a case where, in the opinion of this court, improper evidence has been received and where an entry upon the record would be that the evidence having been so received the accused party was improperly convicted, what does justice require in such a case? Why, manifestly that the prisoner, guilty of some atrocious crime, should not thereby escape justice, and yet, I apprehend it will be conceded on all sides (and I do not imagine from the communications which have taken place among us that one single member of this court is of a different opinion) that however much we might all think that justice would require a new trial we should be incompetent to grant it. The act of Parliament provides expressly what shall be done where the conviction is vitiated; We cannot order a new trial in such a case: we can not order a venire de novo to issue, we can only vacate the convection. And now I come to the second point, that of providing for giving effect to the decision of the court and the certificate founded upon it I shall read the very words of the act.\nThe learned Chief Baron read from the statute which it may be observed, is substantially identical with our own sec. 262 of ch. 174 which is as follows:\u2014\nAnd the said certificate shall be sufficient warrant to such sheriff or gaoler and all other persons for the execution of the judgment as so certified to have been affirmed or amended and execution shall thereupon be carried out on such judgment, or if the judgment has been reversed avoided or arrested the person convicted shall be discharged from further imprisonment, and the court before which he was convicted shall at its next session vacate the* recognizance of bail if any.\nThe Chief Baron then proceeds\u2014\nThis difficulty may arise; if we send back a certificate that this conviction is bad I am not lure that the ma would not be entitled to a habeas corpus to to know: why he is detained and why the sheriff does not instantly discharge him: and it might be a most serious question whether he ought not, from the plain. 'manifest and clear words of the act, instantly*to be discharged * * there is provision for everything which is really contemplated by the \u00e0ct. The sheriff is called In the event of the Midn\u00efght ''Being affirmed and amended 'then exec\u00f9tion But there is not a syllable in the 'act that points to any power in the sheriff, or anybody else to det\u00e1in 'the pr\u00eesori\u00e9r or in any court to try him in the event of a*venire de novo issuing. On these grounds in my judgment this court is not competent to award a venire de novo, and, I think, that the remark, in a case I have already cited that the prisoner ought with \u00e9q\u00f9al str\u00eangth to \"the prosecution.\nAnd he concludes his most exhaustive judgment thus:\nIn my judgment the prisoner ought to be left to his writ of error, and as that is my opinion in point of law, giving to the statute my most anxious and deliberate consideration, I abstain from giving any opinion whether a writ of error ought, or ought not, to be granted, or what ought \" to be the result of a writ of error if it were granted. assuming the facts to be-true. These matters are not in my judgment properly now before the court and I think it best to abstain from giving any opinion upon them. In my judgment this court has no authority to interfere, and I am clearly of opinion without the slightest doubt or hesitation that this court has not any power to award a venire de novo and in that way grant a new trial. I think the awarding of a venire de novo belongs exclusively to a court of error. This court by otherwise construing the words which have been referred to do make such order as justice may require \"would not be expounding the act which alone it has the province to do; but would, in fect, be legislating and taking to itself an authority which the legislature never intended to confer upon it.\nThe judgment of Erle J is pronounced with equal force, that the objection taken constituted neither ground of error \"upon a writ of error nor' Lad' the court under the statute constituting it a court for the consideration of crown cases reserved, jurisdiction to entertain it. He says:\nIt is alleged that the prisoner may have intended to challenge Thorniley and have lost the opportunity because Thorne was called, and that this possible loss of challenge is error vitiating the trial. No authority,\nHe proceeds '.\nhas been adduced to show that such a mistake has ever been held to be a ground of error.\nHe then reviews all the civil cases wherein a similar mistake had occurred and thus states the conclusion to be deduced from them.\nAccording to these authorities a misnomer appearing on-the-record is always ground of error if not amended, but it is no ground of new trial if the person who was sworn was a person that was sum moned and no injustice was done. The cases further show that if. a-person not summoned was sworn in the name of one who was sum moned, it might or might not be ground of new trial; according to the discretion of the court,\nor\nif a person not en the panel answers to the name of a person on, the panel, such personation may or may not be ground of new, trial according ,to the discretion of the -court.\nAs however all these cases were civil cases he adds:\nAs they relate to verdicts at Nisi Prius they differ materially from a verdict under a commission of Oyer and Terminer; with respect to such a verdict one case only has been found, namely, the case of a.juryman (1), where Joseph' Currie answered , to. the name. of Robert Currie on the panel and the conviction was affirmed by twelve judges unanimously, the summons having been served on Joseph Currie and the bailiff intending he should serve.: This unanimous .opinion (he says).of the whole body of judges is a decision against the principle relied on for the prisoner, viz: That the variance between the name of the person called and the name of the person sworn may have misled him in his-challenge-\nAnd again:\nThe .possible hardship of having lost a challenge from ignorance is no ground for vitiating a verdict as was said in Rex v.Sutton (1); where an alien was sworn on the jury without the knowledge of the defendant.'\nAnd again: Thus far I have considered the question as if the court was in the present state of the record legally qualified to decide whether a venire de novo should be granted, but that writ is not lawful without , an entry on the record shewing a valid ground for issuing it See Come? v. Shew (1). If in this case it issued without legal ground ' appearing on the record the new trial would be erroneous, and the verdict thereon no ground for judgment. It is therefore necessary to see what entry could be made.\nAnd upon this point he says:\nThe entry must be according to the supposed fact and ought to be traverseable so that the truth should be legally ascertained. That entry is essential for a judgment in error, and I cannot assent to the notion that every judicial officer who tries an indictment may receive a rumor and if he believes it, make an entry accordingly, to vitiate a record otherwise correct and so bind other parties and courts by an assumption which may be disputed; thus in point of substanee there is no ground of error and in point of form no ground of error appears on this record.\nThen as to the statute under which the court of criminal appeal for hearing reserved cases sat, he says:\nThe provisions of 11\u201412 Vic., oh. 78 are in terms confined to judgments after conviction there is no authority given to alter the verdict in any way\u2014noneto treat a verdict as a nullity and to grant a new trial. The anthority is express to vary the judgment in any Way, and even to enter, an adjudication that the prisoner ought not to have been convicted, but the verdict is to be left to stand notwithstanding such entry. It is true there is a general power to make such order as justice may require; but this general power follows after specific powers relating to judgments only, and the general words, are to be restricted by the proceeding words and construed to be jusdem generis*\nWiliiams J, was also of opinion that the point reserved did not come within the statute 11\u2014 12 Vic, ch 78. The questions contemplated by the statute as authorized to be reserved were in his opinion,\nquestions of law which the judge before whom the case is tried may reserve in his discretion, but he cannot reserve a point which he could not have decided finally. If, he says, the- alleged mis-trial could have been cured by a verdict, it would have been helped by the verdict which has been given; I only mention this, he says to show that the point as it stands before us .must be regarded as occurring after verdict. If that be so it seems to me to follow that it is not a question of law which has arisen at the trial within the meaning of the statute. Now, he continues, in the present case, if the point had been one which could have formed ground for arresting judgment the presiding judge might have decided it, for I do not mean to say that such a point may not be regarded as arising at the trial within the meaning of the statute; but a point like the present could not be raised in ' arrest of judgment. It could only in the ordinary course of law be made the subject of a writ of error in fact and I am of opinion that it was not intended by the statute to substitute this court for a court of error, as to errors in fact. I do not see any thing in the statute that enables the presiding judge to collect the materials for such a tribunal It is said the point was brought to the attention of the judge while he was still acting under the commission in the assize town: but I am at a loss to know what power his commission gave him to act in the matter. I think he might just as well have acted after as during the assizes. There is no doubt that if his object were only to recommend the prisoner to the crown for a pardon, on the ground that he had not been fairly tried, the judge might collect information for the purpose at any time, and from any source on which he though it right to rely. But when the object is to ascertain whether a venire de novo ought to be awarded on the ground that there was error in fact, constituting a mistrial I can see no function the presiding judge whether at or after the assize has to perform in the matter or which it was meant by the statute to transfer from him to this court in any event\nThe learned judge was further of opinion that it was unnecessary for him to consider the question whether, if the point was before the court expanded on the record on a writ of error, there ought to be a venire de novo, as to this he says\u2014\nIt would be unbecoming in me, aware, as I am, of the conflicting opinions of my brother judges, to treat this question other than as a very doubtful one. I will only observe that if the facts stated for our consideration had been assigned as error in the ordinary course the question might have assumed a very different aspect if the crown had pleaded in answer to them (as perhaps it might, ) that the juryman, William Thorniley, was personally well known to the prisoner, and was seen by him to go to the book to be sworn and that he never had any intention or wish to challenge that man\nCrompton J. was of opinion that there was no ground which in point of law, justified the court to interfere with the conviction He says: The present seems to me one of those cases where an irregularity has occurred. in the \u00e7ourse of the proceedings which does not necessarily vacate the verdict, but where the court in which therecord is, in a civil action; or the crown in the exercise of its prerogative, may interfere if any .unfairness or real prejudice has occurred but,; where such interference is only matter of discretion. And, again the argument for the prisoner.,is:that he may have, been prejudiced by supposing from the fact of the name of the other persou having been called, that the juryman he had the opportunity of challenging was the person whose was really called, and so that he may a. have, lost the opportunity of challenging the one whom he would have .wished. to(Challenge,; I think the case is the same in principle'; as that of the juryman in the note to Hill v. Yates.(1). \u201e If, .he says-further dice to the-prisoner seems to me precisely the same I am not .aware of any authority or case in which the-fact-that a prisoner has-been . ignorant of some matter which might, have caused, him.;.-to challenge a person ]who came ,the book to a verdict, in point of law, and apprehend that it would not do so even if it appeared that: the prisoner had been purposely misled, though it would be, matter ibr, the, consideration of the court in .a. civil case in,. exercising their discretion in granting a new trial, or for the advisers . the crown in the exercise of the prergative.o mercy, It would be he adds, most misehevqus if .every irregularity of this nature, however happening and even if contrived by or, assented to by the, prisonerochis friends .would, necessarily vacate a verdict if it would necessarily have that effect the same principle would apply to the case of an acquittal, even though the irregularity were caused by the prosecution I am not aware that no case has carried the doctrine so fa aswould be necessary to support the objection inquestion arid.jin no. criminal cases has any similar objection prevailed that I .am aware of.\nAs to awarding a venire de novo he says,\nThe books are full of authority to show that no de novo denovo can issue except on matter appearing on the record sufficient to justify such award, and if it be improperly awarded it is error.\nAnd, again,\nI will. not undertake to say how far any such objections the present could properly be put upon the record if. a writ of error were brought, and the judgment and proceeding had to be formally. entered on the record.\nAnd, again,\nIn Hales's Pleas of the Crown (2) it appears that if a juryman be returned as sworn it; cannot be-assigned for error that he was not sworn.\nAnd again:\nBut here we should be proceeding on the alleged fresh discovery of facts after judgment without anything on the record to justify us.\nAnd again:\nIn the case of a writ of error and error in fact being assigned, the crown in the case of a conviction, or the prisoner in the case of an acquittal would have the right of traversing the matter so alleged and so questioning its truth. I feel great difficulty in seeing how we can act without there being some such opportunity afforded to the parties or, at all events, without the matter being on the record.\nCrowder J. was of opinion that the case did not come within the statute but assuming it to do so that there had been no mis-trial and that before he could arrive at the conclusion that the verdict was a nullity for the objection taken he must be satisfied that there exists some stringent and inflexible rule of law which goes the length of avoiding every criminal trial when such a mistake (however unattended with the slightest mischief) has occurred and if there were any such rule of law which would render such a mistake per se fatal, he should contemplate with the utmost alarm the awful consequences which might ensue from it to the administration of criminal justice throughout the country. Prisoners if convicted might have another chance of escape or if acquitted might have their lives and liberty again imperilled, for that if such a mistake be fatal it is equally so whether the accused be acquitted or convicted and whatever might be the nature of the crime with which he should be charged. \" But,\" he says,\" I can find no such rule of law.\" Then, referring to the case of a juryman, he says:\nIt was contended that there was a mis-trial but held by all the judges that there was not but only a misnomer which did not invalidate the trial\nBut he adds:\nAs regards the main ground on which it was contended before us that there had been a mis-trial the case of ft juryman is directly in point It is said that Mellor's right to challenge was presumably prejudiced because he may have desired to challenge the name of William Thorniley but not that of Joseph Henry Thorne and may' have known neither of them personally, and so in the case of a jury man the prisoner might have had cause of challenge against Robert Currie and thus the prisoner might have had his right of challenge curtailed if he knew neither of the men personally\u2014the trial, however, was held valid by all the judges.\nWilles J, as to the construction of the statute con curred in the judgment of the Lord. Chief Baron Pollock, and in th.review of the cases relied upon by the prisoner he concurred with the judgment of Erie J. and he adds:\nIf a foreigner had been on the jury unknown to the prisoner the conviction would have been unobjectionable even though the prisoner were proved to have disliked foreigners, and to be sure to have challenged one if he knew to him to be so: citing Rtx v. Sutton (1). Again, if the juryman had been described on the panel by a wrong Christian name and had been called merely in court and sworn upon the jury the conviction would have been valid. Yet such a mistake might, equally with that in question, have misled the prisoner and prevented him from challenging.\nAnd again:\nIf this was a mistrial, the prisoner having been convicted, it would equally have been a mis-trial in case of acquittal; but to order a venire de novo in the latter case would be scandalous and oppressive. It is not suggested that the prisoner has not had a fair trial nor that he has sustained any prejudice. Far from its appearing that he was deprived of his challenge it is even consistent with the facts that he may have known who was about to be sworn and advisedly abstained from objecting to him.\nChannell B. was of opinion that there was no mistrial and he concurred in the opinion of Erie J. and in the reasons upon which that opinion was formed\u2014and he adds that he was unable to distinguish the case from the case of a juryman upheld and supported as he con sidered it was by Hill v. Yates (1). He says:\u2014\nThe case of a injury man was the case of a capital felony. Bill v. Yates was a civil action but it is clear from the report that the court in the last case had in its mind criminal as well as civil cases and that the objection was considered with reference to both classes of cases. I conclude that in the case of Hill v. Yates, in the year 1810, the then 12 judges fully recognized and sanctioned the opinion of the 12 judges their predecessors in the case of a juryman come to 27 years before. With great deference to the Lord Chief Justice, I cannot bring myself to doubt that the subject was in these cases fully considered, or that they are to be treated otherwise than cogent authorities upon the question now before us. Assuming that there has been an irregularity or a mistrial, it seems to me the objection would only be ground of error.\nAs to the jurisdiction of the court under the statute to entertain the question, he says:\u2014\nBy the statute referred to, the court is empowered with respect to questions of law reserved to hear and finally determine the same and therefore to reverse, affirm or amend any judgment, or to avoid such judgment and order an entry to be made that the party ought not to have been convicted, or to arrest the judgment or order judgment to be given at some other session of Oyer and Terminer if no judgment shall have been previously given, or to make such other order as justice may require; it seems to me that the statute contern.'' plates a final decision of the case without any ulterior proceedings except such as may be necessary to give effect to the judgment of this court, and that it did not contemplate or authorize any proceedings in the shape of a venire de novo or in the nature of a new trial.\nHe did not, he said, attach much weight to the objection as to the time at which the discovery of the alleged irregularity was made; and to the consequent objection that the question raised was not reserved at the trial\nByles J., while expressing no opinion upon the cou struction of the statute beyond expressing considerable doubt whether it authorized the court to grant a venire de novo, entertained a clear opinion that the irregularity complained of did not constitute a mis-trial.\nIt is, he said, an old and rational rule of law that where the parties to a transaction or the subject of a transaction are actually corporeally present, the calling of either of them by a wrong name is immaterial, presentia corporis tollit erroreut n\u00f4miinis* In this case there was, as soon as the prisoner omitted the challenge and thereby in effect said \" I do not object to the man standing there \" a compact between the crown and the prisoner that the individual juryman there standing corporeally present should try the case\nAnd again:\nA mere possibility of prejudice cannot vitiate the trial the casa in the note of Hill v. Yates (1) seems to me to confirm this view and to be a solemn decision by all the judges seventy five years ago, that notwithstanding some earlier cases a mistake of this nature is no mistrial. If another rule is once introduced, new trials in criminal eases will come in like a flood.\nIn R\u00e9g v. Feove (1) the learned judge who pronounced the judgment of the majority of the court seems to have been of opinion that the ground upon which the majority of the court in Mellor's case rested their judgment that the question there raised was not a question of law which arose at the trial was that the question was not raised until after sentence had been passed; for he says that this point did not arise in Reg v. Feore (2) for the reason that in that case the question was raised before the end of the trial, that is before sentence and here he treats the trial as not ended by the verdict But from the extracts above quoted from the judgments delivered by the learned judges in Mellor's Case (1) it is apparent that none of them rested his judgment upon any such ground. The grounds upon which they proceeded as most clearly and emphatically ex pressed by them were: That the jurisdiction of the court was limited by the statute to questions of law arising upon the trial, either out of matter appearing upon the record or in the evidence brought to the judge\u2019s notice during the trial which question of law the judge might himself have judicially determined finally, or might in his discretion reserve for the consideration of the court instead of determining it him self that the statute does not apply when the judgment of the court upon the question submitted by the judge who tried the case would not finally dispose of the case or where anything remained to be done beyond giving effect to such final decision; that after verdict the judge fore whom the case had been tried had no jurisdiction or authority whatever to collect material\u2014\u2014that is to receive information in any manner of any matters alleged to be facts, upon which as established facts to make a statement for the purpose of submitting thereon a question of law\u2014that the statute does not point to any power in any body to try the prisoner again, or empower the court to dispose of any matters not judicially ascertained to be facts, or directly or by implication deprive the crown of the right and opportunity it would have upon a writ of error to aver and prove that the allegations upon which the contention that there had been a mis-trial was rested were not founded on fact, or to displace the effect of such allegations, if true, by submitting to judicial inquiry other facts pleaded\u2014as for example that the prisoner had not been deprived of an opportunity to challenge the juryman of whose presence on the jury he complains, for that in point of fact the prisoner knew the juryman personally, and that he never intended or wished to challenge him, and that upon the juryman being presented to him personally, the prisoner well knowing him, voluntarily accepted him as ajuror upon his trial, and declined challenging him that the statute gives no jurisdiction over a case of mis-trial\u2014none to alter a verdict\u2014none to treat a verdict as a nullity or to grant a new trial\u2014either by means of a venire de novo or otherwise that the authoritv conferred by the statute is confined to judgments after conviction, which judgments may be affirmed, amended or avoided, but that the affirmance amendment or avoidance must be a final disposition of the case that the statute never contemplated substituting the Court of Criminal Appeal for a Court of Error as to errors in fact\u2014and that the irregularity complained of if objectionable at all, was so only as error in fact which could only be enquired of on a writ of error.\nThese were the grounds upon which the judgments of the majoritv of the learned judges Mellor's case proceeded, and not as suggested in Beg v. Feore (1) that the question did not arise upon the trial because of the objection not having been taken until after sentence had been passed. Now in the case as submit ted by the learned judges to the Court of Queen's Bench On its appeal side, which is the court for crown cases reserved in the Province of Quebec, the learned judge says that after verdict counsel for the prisoner moved in arrest of judgment not upon any matter appearing on the record but stated in an affidavitt or affidavits, and that the verdict rendered against the prisoner should be set aside and annulled, and that the prisoner if not liberated and discharged should be afforded a new trial upon the grounds stated in the affidavits. The learned \"judge further says that by affidavits and documents produced to the court upon be half of the prisoner on the above motion and by the deputy of the Attorney General certain facts were established which the learned judge states to be as follows (1):\nNow as to this statement it is to be observed: 1st. that the matter complained of does not constitute ground for arrest of judgment and therefore the learned judge could not upon the ground suggested have entertained the motion in arrest of judgment.\n2ndly. As a motion in arrest of judgment can be entertained only upon matter appearing upon the record affidavits stating new matter not appearing upon the record cannot be received upon such a motion; in so far, therefore, as arrest of judgment was concerned the matter stated in the affidavits was not judicially before the learned judge.\n3rdly. The learned judge had no \"jurisdiction to grant a new trial or to hear and determine the motion so far as it asked for the discharge of the prisoner or for a new trial l the matter stated in the affidavits therefore Was not judicially before the learned judge for any of the purposes for which the motion was, made or, indeed, for any purpose, and here applies one of the reasons so strongly pressed by the learned judges constituting the majority in Mellor's Case (1):\u2014 that the learned judge could not reserve a question of law which he could not himself have finally determined, or a question founded upon facts which did not appear judicially before him upon the trial nor had he any jurisdiction after verdict to collect material\u2014or to receive information in any manner of any matter alleged to be facts upon which, as if they had been judicially established, he should submit a question of law to the court.\n4thly. That the matters stated by the learned judge to have been established by the affidavits and the documents therein referred to were only cognizable in a court of error as error in fact, and that there is nothing in the statute to deprive the crown of the right to dispute the truth of such matters or to displace them, assuming them to be true, by pleading that the prisoner had lost no challenge or opportunity of challenge, for that he personally knew Moise Lamoureux and had no intention or wish to challenge him, and that he was given an opportunity of doing so which he knowingly and voluntarily declined to avail himself of; the truth of which, as appears by the learned judge's statement assuming it to be correct, could readily have been established.\nIn fact the case is almost identical with the case of The Juryman (1) for Moise Lamoureux was the person served with a summons to attend as a juryman during the court. He was duly qualified. He was served with the summons by the sheriff at his dwelling house situate in the concession from which the sheriff appears to have been summoning the jurors. \"We may assume without prejudice, although it is not expressly stated in the case that the summons with which he was served was addressed to Joseph Lamoreux, a fact which probably Moise did not know, for he may not have been able to read the summons, &c. The case then is simply this, that Moise Lamoureux,. a qualified juryman was summoned by the sheriff to attend the court as a juryman, and was placea upon the panel in, and answered to, the name of Joseph, thus shewing a plain case of misnomer precisely, as appears to me within the decision of the case of The Juryman (1). He was well known personally to the prisoner, whether the latter knew his christian name or not. It is plain therefore, from the statement of the learned judge that there was no mis-trial and that the prisoner . suffered no prejudice whatever. Indeed, it seems highly probable from the manner in which the motion was made and the form of the motion supported by affidavits that Moise's christian name was known to the prisoner or that at least he was known not to be Joseph, to which name he answered, and that he was accepted by the prisoner as a juror to sit upon his trial with the reserved intention in the mind of the prisoner or of his friends in case of conviction to have the motion made which was made; but however that may be, it appears to me to be clear upon principle and the authority of Mellor's case that the court of crown cases reserved had no jurisdiction to entertain the question, and that it only could be raised upon a writ of error m fact; and that, upon principle and the authority of The Case of a Juryman ([2]), there was no mis-trial.\nI am clearly of opinion also that the case comes precisely within sec. 246 of ch. 174 of the Revised Statutes which enacts that:\nJudgment, after a verdict upon an indictment for any felony or misdemeanor, shall not be stayed or reversed as for any misnomer of any of the jurors, nor because any person has served upon the jury who was not returned by the sheriff or other officer.\nIn Mellor's Case (2) the act 7th Geo. 4, ch. 64, sec. 21 from which the above sec. 246 of ch. 174 R. S. C. originallty was taken did not apply because both Thorne and Thorniley were duly returned by the sheriff and entered upon the panel in their own proper names respectively, and the mistake there was that one an swered when the other was called but here Moise Lamoureux who was summoned to attend was not entered on the panel and he answered to the name of Joseph Lamoureux, who had not been summoned but whose name was upon the panel and thus Moise who was not returned by the sheriff served upon the jury the identical case mentioned in the statute.\nFor the above reasons, I am of opinion that the appeal should be dismissed,\u2014the conviction affirmed and the case remitted.\nAppeal dismissed.\nAttorney for appellant: J.D.

Ritchie C.J., and Strong, Fournier, Gwynne and Patterson, J J.\nON APPEAL FROM THE JUDGMENT OF Mr. JUSTICE HENRI T. TASCHEREAU, SITTING FOR THE TRIAL OF THE JOLIETTE CONTROVERTED ELECTION CASE.\nElection petition\u2014 Commencement of trial Order of judge staying proceedings during. session of parliament\u2014\u2014Power to adjourn\u2014 Recriminatory charges\u201449 Vic. ch. 9 - Sec. 31, s.s. 4, sec. 32, 33, s.s.2; and secs, 35 & 42 \u2014Bribery by agent.\nAfter the trial of an election petition has been commenced the trial judge may adjourn the case from time to time, as to him seems convenient.\nWhere the proceedings for the commencement of the trial have been stayed during a session of parliament by an order of a judge, and a day has been fixed for the trial within the statutory period of six months as so extended, on which day the petitioners proceeded with their enqu\u00eate and examined two witnesses after which the hearing was adjourned to a day beyond the statutory period as so extended to allow the petitioners to file another bill of particulars, those already filed being declared insufficient.\nHeld, there was a sufficient commencement of the trial within the proper time and the future proceedings were valid under sec. 32 of The Controverted Elections Act R. S. C ch. 9.\nIn an election petition claiming the seat for the defeated candidate, recriminatory charges were brought against the defeated candidate and the trial judge, after having found that the election of the sitting member should be set aside for corrupt practices, fixed a day for the evidence upon the recriminatory charges. Thereupon the petitioners withdrew the claim to the seat and the judge gave judgment avoiding the election.\nHeld, That section 42 of chapter 9 R. S. C. no longer applied and the judge was right in refusing to proceed upon the recriminatory charges.\nPer Gwynee J. That it would have been competent for the trial judge to have received evidence on the recriminatory charges but his refusal to do so it was not a sufficient ground for reversing the judgment avoiding the election. APPEAL from the judgment of Mr. Justice H. T. Taschereau declaring the election of the member of the House of Commons for the electoral district of Joliette void by reason of corrupt practices by agents.\nThe appeal was from the judgment upon the merits of the petition in the case and from two decisions delivered by the judge on the 12th of December, 1887, and one on the 30th January, 1888, on the application of the appellant to have the petition declared abandoned and at an end and to have the said petition dismissed out of court with costs, and said appellant declared duly elected by reason of the trial of the said petition not having been commenced within six months from the time said petition had been presented.\nThe material dates and proceedings in the case are the following:\nOn the 15th February, 1887, the nomination of the candidates took place.\nOn the 22nd of February the election was held and appellant was returned as the member duly elected.\nOn the 9th April the petition complaining of the undue return of the appellant and claiming the seat for the defeated candidate was presented.\nParliament met on the 13th day of April, 1887, and was in session until the 23rd day of June, 1887, on which day it was prorogued. On the 12th day of April, 1887, the appellant moved the court to have all proceedings suspended as well on preliminaries as on the merits during the session of the then Parliament.\nMr. Justice Grill granted the motion.\nA plea to the merits was fyled on the 20th September, 1887, answer to said plea on the following day, and on the 22nd of September 1887 an application was made by petitioners to have a day fixed for the trial of the election petition, The trial for the election petition was fixed for the 22nd November, 1887.\nOn the 22nd November, 1887, the petitioners proceeded with their enqu\u00eate before Mr. Justice Taschereau and examined two witnesses: A. M. Rivard, the returning officer, and Urgele Faust, and the case was by the honorable judge presiding at trial continued to the 5th December following (1887), in order to allow petitioners to file another bill of particulars; the particulars then fyled being declared insufficient.\nOn the 3rd of December, the defendant presented two motions to have the petition declared abandoned, and the defendant confirmed in his seat.\nThese two motions were taken en d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9, and the court adjourned to the 12th of December and on that day rejected these two motions.\nThe defendant took exception to these two judgment, and the court further adjourned to the 5th of January, 1888.\nOn that day the defendant presented another motion contending that the petition having been presented on the 9th of April, 1888, more than six months, even excluding the session, had elapsed without any trial being fixed and held.\nOn that motion another d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9 was taken and the court was adjourned to the 30th January.\nOn that day the trial judge rejected the defendant's motion and ordered the trial to be proceeded with, and evidence was given on the following charges inter alia:\n\" Dans le cours de la dite \u00e9lection, savoir, entre le premier janvier et le vingt-deux f\u00e9vrier dernier, le d\u00e9fendeur par lui-m\u00eame directement on indirectement et par ses agents et notamment par son agent le dit Ad\u00e9lard Barrette a donn\u00e9, fourni, et a promis diverses sommes d'argent s'\u00e9levant \u00e0 somme de huit piastres \u00e0 Joseph Ratelle, fils, cultivateur de la ville de Joliette, dans le but de l'induire \u00e0 voter en sa faveur ou de s'abstenir de voter contre lui.\n\" Dans le cours de la dite \u00e9lection, savoir, entre le premier janvier et le vingt-deux f\u00e9vrier dernier, dans la dite paroise de Sainte-M\u00e9lanie, le d\u00e9fendeur par lui-m\u00eame directement ou indirectement et par ses agents et notamment par le dit Ad\u00e9lard Barrette, a donn\u00e9, fourni, pr\u00eat\u00e9 et a promis diverses sommes d'argent s'\u00e9levant \u00e0 cinq piastres \u00e0 Fran\u00e7ois Xavier St-Jean, cultivateur et \u00e9lecteur de la paroisse Sainte-M\u00e9lanie, dans le but de l'induire \u00e0 voter en sa faveur ou \u00e0 s'abstenir de voter contre lui.\n\"Dans le cours de la dite \u00e9lection, le d\u00e9fendeur par lui-m\u00eame et par son agent le dit Ad\u00e9lard Barrette \u00e0 Sainte-Melanie susdit, a donn\u00e9, fourni, pr\u00eat\u00e9 ou est convenu de donner, fournir, ou pr\u00eater, promis des r\u00e9compenses, des sommes d'argent s'\u00e9levant \u00e0 dix piastres, des mets, boissons et autres consid\u00e9rations appr\u00e9ciables \u00e0 prix d'argent \u00e0 Nazaire Lapierre, cultivateur et \u00e9lecteur de la Paroisse de Sainte-M\u00e9lanie susdit dans le but do l'induire \u00e0 voter en sa faveur, ou de s'abstenir de voter contre lui.\n\"Dans le cours de la dite \u00e9lection, savoir, entre le premier janvier et le vingt-deux f\u00e9vrier dernier \u00e0 Sainte-M\u00e9lanie susdit, le d\u00e9fendeur lui m\u00eame et par ses agents et notamment par les dits Ad\u00e9lard Barrette, et Joseph Edouard Perrault, deux do ses agents, a donn\u00e9, pr\u00eat\u00e9 ou convenu de donner, pr\u00eater, a offert ou promis la somme de cinq piastres \u00e0 Joseph. Beaudry, cultivateur et \u00e9lecteur de Sainte-M\u00e9lanie susdit dans le but de l'induire \u00e0 voter en sa faveur on de s'abstenir de voter contre lui.\"\nOn the 1st February the court having decided that corrupt practices had been practiced by A. Barrette, an assent of the appellant, upon seven voters, and that seven votes should be deducted from the appellant's votes, leaving the defeated candidate with a majority of seven votes, the sitting member he allowed to proceed with his recriminatory charges on the 16th February.\nOn the 11th February the petitioners fyled \u00e1 declaration withdrawing their claim to the seat.\nOn the 20th of February, the judge sent a written judgment to the clerk of the court at Joliette, declaring the election void by reason of corrupt practices by agents of the appellant, but without his knowledge.\nCornellier Q.C. and Ferguson for appellant contended: That the order granted by Mr. Justice Grill was not made upon an application to have the time extended for the commencement of the trial under sections 32 and 33 of ch. 9 R.S.C., but upon an application to delay proceedings under section 64, and therefore such order did not deprive the appellant of the right of claiming that in computing the lime within which the trial of the present petition should have commenced the time of the session of Parliament should be included.\nBut, even if the time of the session should be excluded, the trial did not actually commence until the 30th January, because what took place before the judge on the 22nd November, 1887, was a nullity, the court having declared that the particulars which, according to the rules of practice, had been fyled six days before the commencement of the trial, were insufficient, and that as a matter of fact the evidence in the case was given in support of particulars fyled subsequent to the 22nd November.\nOn this branch of the case the learned counsel relied upon the Glengarry case ([1]).\nAs to merits the learned counsel admitted bribery, but contended that the evidence of Barrette's agency was insufficient; and finally in any case the judgment was incomplete because without notice the judge had deprived the appellant of the right of proving his recriminatory charges, a right which he had under sec. 9 of ch 9, R.S.O., and of which he was deprived by the judgment. The case should be remitted back to the court below as was done in the Bellechasse case ([2]).\nChoquette and Dugas with him for respondent contended:\nThat the order granted by Mr. Justice Gill was one which in effect delayed all proceedings, including the fixing of the trial, and that the appellant who had applied for it could not now be allowed to ask that the time of the session should be included. As to what took place on the 22nd November, it was clear, that the trial then commenced; the trial judge was present and two witnesses were examined, and the trial was adjourned from time to time in order to complete the particulars, and if what took place on the 22nd November, the day fixed for the trial could, be said to have been illegal then the evidence of these witnesses which was to be found in the appeal book should not have been printed.\nBut as a matter of fact the judge who was present on the 22nd November was the trial judge, and when he delivered judgment he relied as much on the evidence taken on that day as on the subsequent days.\nAs to allowing evidence on the recriminatory charges there was nothing to be gained by it. These charges were put in and the judge allowed the evidence because, after the hearing of several witnesses, he came to the conclusion that bribery had been committed by an agent of the appellant on a sufficient number of votes to affect the majority and allow the defeated candidate to claim the seat, but upon the declaration being fyled that we abandoned that portion of the conclusion of our petition by which we claimed the seat for the defeated candidate, all the judge had to do was to give effect to the decision he had arrived at at the closing of the enqu\u00eate, viz: declare the election void by reason of corrupt practices.\nAs to the merits there was sufficient evidence of Barrette's agency in the appellant's own evidence to support the judge's finding. For he admits that he knew he was working for him and that all he desired was that he should not commit any illegal act. It is a finding of fact and the court does not reverse such a finding if there is any reasonable evidence to support it.\nCornellier Q.C. in reply: The petition and counter petition can only be disposed of together. If not it is in the power of any petitioner to defeat the right given to a candidate whose election is contested.\nSir W.J. Ritchie C.J.\u2014The nomination of candidates was held on the 15th February, 1887, the election on the 22nd February, 1887; the petition was presented on the 9th April, 1887; Parliament met on the 13th April, 1887, and was in session until the 23rd day of June, 1887, on which day it was prorogued. The defendant the sitting member, caused a notice to be given to petitioners' advocates of a motion to suspend proceedings during the session of Parliament, a copy of which is as follows:\u2014\nMotion de la part du D\u00e9fendeur, sans admettre qu'ilsoit r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement assign\u00e9, ou qu'il soit aucunement tenu de comparaitre et do r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 la pr\u00e9tendue p\u00e9tition en cette cause et sous la r\u00e9serve expresse du droit de produire enti\u00e8rement toute objection qu'il jugera \u00e0 propos.\nA ce que, vu la convocation du Parlement do la Puissance pour une session dont l'ouverture est fix\u00e9e au treize avril courant, tous proc\u00e9d\u00e9s ult\u00e9rieurs en cette cause soient d\u00e9clar\u00e9s suspendus \u00e0 compter du dit jour treize avril courant inclusivement, et qu'il avait en outre d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que le d\u00e9lai prescrit pour production d'objections pr\u00e9liminaires ou de r\u00e9ponse au m\u00e9rite suivant le cas est, et restera suspendu depuis et y compris le dit jour treize avril courant et n'expirera, qu'avec les deux jours qui suivront la cl\u00f4ture de la dite session, le tout avec d\u00e9pens distraits aux soussignes.

Which order unquestionably suspended all proceedings and brought the case within the operation of the 32 section of 49 Vic. ch. 9, which provides that:\nIf at any time it appears to the court or a judge that the respondent's presence at the trial is necessary, such trial shall not be commenced during any session of parliament and in the computation of any time or delay allowed for any step or proceeding in respect of any such trial, or for the commencement thereof as aforesaid, the time occupied by such session of parliament shall not be included.\nOn the 22nd September the petitioners gave notice of a motion to fix a day for hearing of the petition and on the 10th day of October, 1887, Mr. Justice Taschereau, after having heard the parties on petitioners' motion, accorded the same and ordered that the hearing should take place at the court house in the town of Joliette, in the district of Joliette, on Tuesday the 22nd day of November then next. On the 22nd day of November, 1887, the trial commenced before Mr. Justice Taschereau, and the sheriff of Joliette, the returning officer, was examined and cross-examined; after this examination, on the suggestion of the judge and the parties consenting, the following admissions were made:\nLes parties admettent los proc\u00e9d\u00e9s de l'\u00e9lection tels qu'all\u00e9gu\u00e9s dans la p\u00e9tition ainsi que la proclamation faite du candidat \u00e9lu, dans la \"Gazette officielle du Canada.\" Les parties admettent de plus que les p\u00e9titionnaires ont et avaient les qualit\u00e9s et qualifications voulues pour se porter p\u00e9titionnaires ainsi qu\u2019all\u00e9gu\u00e9 dans la dite p\u00e9tition.\nEt le d\u00e9posant ne dit rien de plus.\nOne Urgel Faust was then examined and after proceeding thus far the court adjourned till the fifth of December following.\nThe session of parliament having been excluded by the order of Mr. Justice Gill and the trial having been commenced on the 22nd of November the petitioner was within the six months.\nBut it has been contended that if the trial was commenced on the 22nd of November the judge had no right to adjourn the court until the 5th of December, but was bound to proceed with the same \"from day to day until such trial is over;\" but without stopping to enquire whether this provision, if it stood alone, is imperative or directory only, these words must be read in connection with sub-section four of section 31, which enacts that the judge at the trial may adjourn the same from time to time, and from any one place to another in the same electoral district as to him seems convenient:\" and also sub-section 2 of sec. 33 which enacts that\nNo trial of an election petition shall be commenced or proceeded with during any term of the court of which the judge who is to try the same is a member and at which such judge is by law bound to sit.\nThe court having been adjourned by the judge defendant's contention must fail.\nThe following is the judgment annulling the election, pronounced on the 20th February, 1888.\nLa cour ayant entendu les t\u00e9moins examin\u00e9s de part et d'autre et les parties elles m\u00eames, par leurs procureurs respectifs, sur le m\u00e9rite de la presente petition d'\u00e9lection, et de la contestation d'celle, ayant aussi examin\u00e9! la proc\u00e9dure et toutes les pi\u00e8ces du dossier et sur le tout d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9.\nConsid\u00e9rant qu'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 prouv\u00e9 que des man\u0153uvres frauduleuses ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pratiqu\u00e9es par des agents du d\u00e9fendeur \u00e0 l'\u00e9lection dont il s'agit, mais hors la connaissance et sans le consentement du d\u00e9fendeur, et qu'ainsi l'\u00e9lection susdite du d\u00e9fendeur est nulle.\nConsid\u00e9rant que las p\u00e9titionnaires se sont d\u00e9sist\u00e9s de cette partie des conclusions de leur p\u00e9tition par laquelle ils r\u00e9clamaient le si\u00e8ge pour le candidat Neven.\nMaintient la p\u00e9tition d'\u00e9lection en tant qu'elle demande l'annulation de l'\u00e9lection susdite, la rejette quant au surplus des conclusions et en cons\u00e9quence d\u00e9clare nulle et sans effect l'\u00e9lection du d\u00e9fendeur comma membre de la Chambre des Communes du Canada, pour repr\u00e9senter le district \u00e9lectoral de Joliette, dans la province de Quebec, laquelle \u00e9\u00e9lection a eu lieu le 15 f\u00e9vrier 1887, (pour la pr\u00e9sentation des candidats) et le 22 f\u00e9vrier 1887, (pour la votation): d\u00e9clare aussi nul et sans effet le rapport de la dite \u00e9lection, et condamne le dit d\u00e9fendeur, outre les frais d\u00e9j\u00e0 adjug\u00e9s pendant i'in stance, aux frais de la dite p\u00e9tition et des pro\u00e9dures sur icelle, et a tous les frais d'assignation, d'enqu\u00eate et de st\u00e9nographie rendus n\u00e9cessaires par l'examen des t\u00e9moins suivants des p\u00e9titionnaires: Francois-Xavier St. Jean. Ad\u00e9lard Barrette, Joseph Beaudry, Joseph Ratelle, fils, Israel B\u00e9langer, Narcisse Gendron, Hormidas Desmarais. On\u00e9sime Clermont, Auguste Guilbault et Edouard Guilbault (le d\u00e9fendeur), les autres frais d'assignation, d'enqu\u00eate et de stenographie devant \u00eatre respectivement \u00e0 la charge de chacune des parties qui les a encourus.\nEt la cour accorde distraction de d\u00e9pens \u00e0 MM. Champagne et Dugas, procureurs des p\u00e9titionnaires.\nThere can be no doubt the judge was fully justified in declaring the election void by reason of bribery by the agents of the defendant. It is only necessary to mention the case of Adelard Barrette, a nephew of the defendant, who was clearly proved to have been a most active agent of the defendant and a most unscrupulous briber.\nBut it is contended that though the defendant had closed his enqu\u00eate as to corrupt practices he should have been allowed to go into recriminatory proof against the defeated candidate H. Neveu, which it is claimed he had a right to do, the petitioners having claimed the seat for said N eveu. Had the claim not been withdrawn this he would clearly have had a right to do.\nSec. 5. A petition complaining of an undue return, or undue election of a member, or, of no return, or of a double return, or of any unlawful act by any candidate not returned, by which he is alleged to have become disqualified to sit in the House of Commons, or at any election, may be presented to the court by one or more of the following persons:\u2014\n(a.) A person who had a right to vote at the election to which the petition relates; or\n(b.) A candidate at such election;\nAnd such petition is, in this act, called an election petition. Provided always, that nothing herein contained, shall prevent the sitting member from objecting under sec. 12 of this act, to any further proceeding on the petition by reason of the ineligibility or disqualification of the petitioner, or from proving under sec. 42 hereof, that the petitioner was not duly elected. 37 Vic. ch. 10, sec. 7.\nSec. 42. On the trial of a petition under this act complaining of an undue return and claiming the seat for any person, the respondent may give evidence to show that the election of such person was undue in the same manner as if he had presented a petition complaining of such election. 37 Vic. ch. 10, sec. 66.\nSection 5 applies to any case where it is alleged any candidate has been guilty of any unlawful act, but section 42 is confined to cases where the seat is claimed but election undue.\nIf the claim of the seat is prim\u00e2 facie sustained, then the respondent may give evidence to show that the election of such person was undue in the same manner as if he the respondent had presented a petition complaining of such election.\nThis is all reasonable enough, because so long as the seat is claimed the judge is still trying out the question of the election and the party entitled to the seat, and as to the party who should be returned by him as the duly elected candidate, but where the claim of the seat for the defeated candidate is not put forward, or if put forward in the petition is abandoned, the election of such candidate ceases to be in issue, for the simple reason that when the claim of the seat is withdrawn there is no election to try and there could be no object, in fact it would be a contradiction in terms, to attempt to show that the election of a person admittedly not elected was undue.\nIt follows, therefore, if the seat is not claimed, or if claimed the claim is abandoned, and a party is desirous of proceeding against any candidate for any unlawful act by which he is alleged to have become disqualified, he must, proceed under section 5.\nSTRONG J._I am also of opinion that this appeal must be dismissed. Whatever opinion I might otherwise have entertained as to the proper construction of section 32 of the Controverted Elections Act, if the question were now open, I consider I am bound by the decision of this court, in the Glengarry Case ([3]), to hold that every election trial must be commenced within six months from the date of the presentation of the petition unless it is expressly excluded by an order or judgment of the court or judge.\nHere the petition was presented on the 9th of April, 1887. On the 14th of April an order or judgment was pronounced by the Honourable Mr. Justice Gill sitting in the Superior Court at Joliette, suspending all proceedings during the session of parliament which commenced on the 13th April and lasted until the 14th June, 1887. The trial of the petition commenced on the 22nd of November. for on that day witnesses were examined before the trial judge and other proceedings taken. This it appears to me was clearly in time. It is true that several adjournments took place which, it is argued, were not such as the 32 section of the act requires, viz., de die in diem. I think there is a two fold answer to this objection. First, I am of opinion that this provision is entirely directory, and second, there is section 35 which gives to the judge trying an election petition the same powers, jurisdiction and authority as a judge has in all other trials, and one of these powers is the power of enlarging the time for any step or proceeding in the case, and there are often circumstances which necessitate longer adjournments than de die in diem. So that there is nothing in the objection.\nAs regards the merits, I do not think it possible that a case could ever have come sub judic\u00e9, much less have reached an appellate court, in which the evidence of bribery was so plain and direct as in the present. Without going through all the cases, let me take that of Adelard Barrette a nephew of the appellant, in which a clear and undeniable act of bribery is proved. The agency is admitted but the appellant seems to think that he can shelter himself under an express prohibition to his agent against any unlawful proceedings. It is surely not necessary to add that this will not do, and that he is responsible for all the acts of his agents whether they were in breach of his instructions or in accordance with them. As to the point whether the judge had proceeded regularly in avoiding the election without proceeding with the recriminatory charges, I am of opinion that so soon as the claim of the petitioners to the seat was abandoned the judge was right in not proceeding further with the petition. If the appellant wished to take any proceedings against the defeated candidate for penal purposes he could still do so, but that should not in any way delay the rights of the electors to have the election set aside at the earliest possible moment.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs, the election declared void and the usual certificate sent to the Speaker of the House of Commons.\nFOURNIER J.\u2014L'appel est du jugement final prononc\u00e9 par l'honorable juge H. T. Taschereau sur la contestation de l'\u00e9lection d'un d\u00e9put\u00e9 aux Communes pour le comt\u00e9 de Joliette, et de deux autres d\u00e9cisions rendues par le m\u00eame juge sur des motions, l'une pour faire d\u00e9clarer la p\u00e9tition abandonn\u00e9e et p\u00e9rim\u00e9e, parce que l'enqu\u00eate n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 commenc\u00e9e et poursuivie dans les six mois, \u2014l'autre pour faire d\u00e9clarer que le juge n'avait plus de juridiction pour proc\u00e9der an proc\u00e8s de la dite p\u00e9tition, attendu que les proc\u00e9d\u00e9s ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 suspendus sur requ\u00eate de l'appelant pendant la derni\u00e8re session ii s'\u00e9tait \u00e9coul\u00e9 plus de six mois depuis la fin de la dite session\nLe jugement an m\u00e9rite, en date du 20 f\u00e9vrier, a annul\u00e9 i\u2019\u00e9lection pour cause de corruption pratiqu\u00e9e par les agents de l'appelant. Les deux autres d\u00e9cisions ont rejet\u00e9 les motions tendant \u00e0 faire d\u00e9clarer que le juge n'avait plus de juridiction pour entendre la cause. A l'\u00e9lection qui eut lieu le 22 f\u00e9vrier, l\u2019appelant fut d\u00e9clar\u00e9 \u00e9lu par le vote de l'officier rapporteur. Une p\u00e9tition se plaignant de l'ill\u00e9galit\u00e9 de son \u00e9lection et r\u00e9clamant le si\u00e8ge pour le candidat adversaire fut pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e le 9 avril. Le parlement \u00e9tant convoqu\u00e9 pour le 13 avril, le 12 l'appelant demanda par motion de cette derni\u00e8re date et obtint un jugement d\u00e9clarant:\u2014\nQue sa pr\u00e9sence \u00e9tait n\u00e9cessaire pour pr\u00e9parer ses moyens do d\u00e9fense, qu'elle le serait pour l'enqu\u00eate et notamment dans l'esp\u00e8ce o\u00f9 il a \u00e9t\u00e9 affirm\u00e9 \u00e0 l'audience sans contradiction formelle do la partie adverse, etc. etc. Ordonne en cons\u00e9quence que tous les proc\u00e9d\u00e9s seraient suspendus pendant la dite session du parlement et que les d\u00e9lais pour la production de toutes d\u00e9fenses, soit pr\u00e9liminaires, soit au m\u00e9rite ne courraient pas pendant la dite session du parlement.\nLa session commenc\u00e9e le 13 avril ne fut termin\u00e9e que le 23 juin suivant; de sorte qu'en vertu de la loi \u00e9lectorale, sec. 32, et du jugement cit\u00e9, le d\u00e9lai de six mois fix\u00e9 pour le commencement du proc\u00e8s apr\u00e8s la pr\u00e9sentation de la p\u00e9tition n'a pu commencer \u00e0 courir que deux jours apr\u00e8s le 23 juin.\nLe 20 septembre l'appelant produisit son plaidoyer \u00e0 la p\u00e9tition auquel l'intim\u00e9 r\u00e9pondit de suite, et demanda le 22 septembre 1887, qu'un jour f\u00fbt fix\u00fb pour l'instruction de la p\u00e9tition. Le 10 octobre 1887 par d\u00e9cision \u00e0 cet effet, le proc\u00e8s fat fix\u00e9 an 22 novembre suivant devant l'honorable Juge Taschereau qui a rendu le jugement an m\u00e9rite.\nEn ex\u00e9cution du jugement fixant le proc\u00e8s au 22 novembre, les p\u00e9titionnaires commenc\u00e8rent leur preuve et firent entendre deux t\u00e9moins: A.M.Rivard, officier rapporteur \u00e0 la dite \u00e9lection, qui prouva l'\u00e9lection et rapport de l'appelant, ainsi que la publication de son \u00e9lection dans la Gazette Officielle comme d\u00e9put\u00e9 de Joliette, \u2014l'autre, Urgel Faust, est entendu an sujet de l'\u00e9lection. Le m\u00eame jour, \u00e0 part l'audition de ces t\u00e9moins, il se fit encore une partie importante de la preuve, consistant dans l'admission suivante donn\u00e9e par les parties:\u2014\u2014\nLes parties admettent los proc\u00e9d\u00e9s de l'\u00e9lection tels qu\u2019all\u00e9gu\u00e9s dans la p\u00e9tition ainsi quo la proclamation faite du candidat \u00e9lu, dans la \" Gazette Officielle du Canada.\" Les parties admettent do plus quo los p\u00e9titionnaires ont et avaient los qualit\u00e9s et qualifications voulues pour se porter p\u00e9titionnaires ainsi qu'all\u00e9gu\u00e9 dans la dite p\u00e9tition.\nTous ces faits, tant ceux contenus dans les t\u00e9moignages que ceux \u00e9nonc\u00e9s dans cette admission, comme ceux de l'\u00e9lection et rapport de l'appelant, tels qu'all\u00e9gu\u00e9s dans la p\u00e9tition, la proclamation, les qualit\u00e9s et qualifications des p\u00e9titionnaires pour se porter p\u00e9titionnaires, sont tous des faits qu'il \u00e9tait essentiel de prouver. Il e\u00fbt \u00e9t\u00e9 impossible \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9 de r\u00e9ussir sans en avoir fait la preuve. Le proc\u00e8s (trial) a donc commenc\u00e9 au jour fix\u00e9, le 22 novembre, par la preuve de faits importants. La loi (sec. 32) exigeant le commencement du proc\u00e8s dans les six mois (shall be commenced) a dons \u00e9t\u00e9 respect\u00e9e. Apr\u00e8s ces proc\u00e8s du 22 novembre, le proc\u00e9s au lieu de continuer from day to day fut ajourn\u00e9 au 5 d\u00e9cembre afin de fournir aux intim\u00e9s l'occasion de produire d'autres particularit\u00e9s pour remplacer celles qui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9clar\u00e9es insuffisantes. C'est alors que l'appelant fit les deux motions dont la substance a \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9e plus haut, \u00e0 l'effet de faire d\u00e9clarer que la p\u00e9tition devait \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme abandonn\u00e9e et p\u00e9rim\u00e9e. Ces deux motions ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cid\u00e9es comme on l'a vu plus haut, il fut proc\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 l'enqu\u00eate sur les accusations de corruption contenues dans les particularit\u00e9s.\nCette preuve a constat\u00e9 de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 ne laisser aucun doute \u00e0 ce sujet qu'il y avait eu des actes de corruption commis par des agents de l'appelant. L'honorable Juge en a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 sept cas pour lesquels il a ray\u00e9 autant de votes donn\u00e9s \u00e0 lappelant.\nPuisqu'un seul de ces actes l\u00e9galement prouv\u00e9 suffit pour faire annuler une \u00e9lection, il n'est pas n\u00e9cessaire pour justifier l'annulation de celle dont il s'agit d'entrer dans le d\u00e9tail de thus ces cas. Celui rapport\u00e9 par le t\u00e9moin Beaudry est tellement flagrant qu'il suffit \u00e0 lui seul pour faire declarer 1 \u00e9lection nulle.\nAd\u00e9lard Barrette,.neveu de l'appelant et l'un de ses agents, s'\u00e9tant pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 chez Beaudry, eut avec lui l'entrevue que ce dernier rapporte ainsi qu'il' suit:\nR. Ii est venu chez nous, il m'a demand\u00e9 pour quel parti j'\u00e9tais, j'ai dit \" J'ai \u00e9t\u00e9 pour monsieur Gruilbault.\" Ii a dit \"A present vous l'\u00eates encore.\" J'ai dit, \" A present je crois bien quo je no voterai pas cette ann\u00e9e, je suis malade, jo vais rester \u00e0 la maison.\" Ii a dit \" Vous vous levez toujours, il faut quo vous alliez voter pour lui.\" J'ai dit \" \u00c7a me co\u00fbte bien. Ii a pris cinq piastres ($5) et il me les a donn\u00e9es. Ii a dit, \" vous allez voter, travaillez pour nous autres. ' \u00c7a fait que jai pris los cinq piastres ($5).\nQ. Est-co que Perrautt \u00e9tait dans la maison, alors? R. Ils \u00e9taient presents thus les deux.\nQ. Perrault et Barrette \u00e9taient pr\u00e9sents tous les deux quand Barrette vous a donn\u00e9 les cinq piastres ($5)? R. Oui.\nInd\u00e9pendamment de cet acte de corrupiion la suite du t\u00e9moignage fait preuve d'une convention entre Beaudry et les deux agents de lappelant pour corrompre plusieurs autres voteurs. Beaudry rapporte que s'\u00e9tant ensuite rendu \u00e0 la r\u00e9sidence de l'appelant, celuici lui demanda comment allait l'\u00e9lection, \u00e0 quoi il r\u00e9pondit P:\nJe crois bien qu'il faudrait un peu do graissaille pour que les nuls qu'il y avait.\nL\u00e0-dessus l'appelant dit:\nMoi, je no suis pas capable do donner d'argent, cest d\u00e9fendu: par exemple, j'ai des agents qui pourront vous rencontrer. Je puis vous nommer l\u00e0 o\u00f9 ils sont et vous aurez co qu'il vous faudra.\nQ. Les a-t-il nomm\u00e0s, ces gens-l\u00e0? R. Oui, il a nomm\u00e9 Z\u00e0phirin Tellier, Ad\u00e0lard Barrette.\nQ. Ad\u00e9lard Barrette? R. Oui, qui est pr\u00e0sent ici: Octavien Michaud.\nQ. En at-il nomm\u00e0 d'autres? R. Ouil il a nomm\u00e9 monsieur Grervais.\nQ. Qu\u00e0l est son nom do bapt\u00eame? R. Je ne peux pas dire son nom; je le connais do vue, mais je ne peux pas dire son nom.\nQ. En a-t-il nomm\u00e9 d'autres? R. Monsieur Perrault. Plus loin on lui fait les questions suivantes:\nQ. Bien, monsieur Beaudry, \u00eates-vous bien positff \u00e0 dire quo monsieur Guilbautt vous a dit do vous adresser pour de la graissailee. R. Oui, monsieur.\nQ Chez Barrette? R. Qu'on aurait ce qu'il nous faudrait et d'envoyer fort.\nCette preuve serait suffisante pour constater l'agence de Barrette; mais \u00e0 ce t\u00e9moignage on peut ajouter celui de l'appelant qui prouve bien des faits suffisants pour \u00eatablir l'agence et qui finit par cette d\u00eaclaration qui ne peut laisser de douee \u00e0 cet \u00eagard:\nQ Est-ce la seule fois que vous lui avez parl\u00e9 sur ce ton-l\u00e0. \u00e0 Barrette? R. Chaque fois que je l'ai roncontr\u00e0 je lui ai toujours dit de prondee garde de se compromettre et do me compromettre. C'est cola que ie lui ai d\u00e9fendu do faire, et d'autres lo lui ont d\u00e9fendu aussi\nLa d\u00e9fense se bornait \u00e9videmment \u00e0 ne pas agir ouvertement mais tout ce qui pouvait \u00eatre fait secr\u00e9tetement \u00e9tait accept\u00e9 d'apres l'appelant lui-m\u00eame.\nIl en est de m\u00eame des autres cas cit\u00e9s par l'honorable juge, ainsi qu'il appert par son jugement du ler f\u00e9vrier 1888.\nLa cour rend l'adjudication suivante:\nEn cons\u00e9quence des actes do corrupiion prouv\u00e9s contro l'agent du d\u00e9fendeur Ad\u00e9lard Barrette aux moyess desquess les nomm\u00e9s Fran\u00e7ois X. St. Jean, Joseph Beaudry, Jos. Ratelle fils, Ephrem Laforest, Edmond Michaud, Israel B\u00e9langer et Narcssoe Gendron paraissent avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 influenc\u00e9s la cour retranche sept votes du nombre total des votes enregist\u00e9\u00e9s en faveur du d\u00e9fendeur et rotranche de plus du nombre des dits votes un autre vote \u00e0 raison du fait que lo nomm\u00e9 Horn. Desmarais, agent du d\u00e9fendeur,aurait vote bien quo mineur.\nLa cour ajoute au nombre des votes du candidat Neveu un voto repr\u00e9sentant le vote d'On\u00e9sime Clermont qui \u00e9t\u00e9 ill\u00e9galement \u00e9cart\u00e9 par le D\u00e9put\u00e9 Officier rapporteur au poll No. 9, paroisso Ste. Elizabeth. Sur application do la part du d\u00e9fendeur et attenuu quo lo dit d\u00e9fendeur so trouve actuellement en minorit\u00e9 d'apr\u00e8s la decision ci-dessus la cour fixe lo 16me jour do f\u00e9vrier pour proc\u00e9der \u00e0 l'enqu\u00eate r\u00e9criminatoiro et sur le scrutin deman\u00e9\u00e9 par le d\u00e9fendeur et permot \u00e0 co dornier do produire un bill do particularit\u00e9s le 10 f\u00e9vrier et la cour ajourne au 16e jour do f\u00e9vnier courant.\nLors de l'argument, l'appelant sest plaint que le dernier jugement, en date du 20 f\u00e9vrier, manquait de precision et ne mentionnait aucun des cas de corruption \u00e0 raison desquels l'\u00e9lection \u00e9tait annul\u00e9e; ces d\u00e9tails \u00e9taient d\u00e9j\u00e0 donn\u00e9s dans le jugement du ler f\u00e9vrier:; ii \u00e9tait inutile d'en faire la r\u00e9p\u00e9tition dans le jugement suivant.\nSi ce n'e\u00fbt \u00e9t\u00e9 de la question des six mois fix\u00e9s pour le commencement du proc\u00e8s, ii n'aurait pas porte le present appel. Mais cette cause n'a aucune analogie avec celle de Glengarry ([4]). Dans cette derni\u00e9re, la petition avait \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e le 25 avril 1887, et ce n'est que le 17 d\u00e9cembre qu'un ordre fut rendu par la cour des Common Pleas fixant le proc\u00e9s de la petition au 12 janveir 1888. Aucune proc\u00e9dure n'ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 adoptee pour faire d\u00e9clarer que le proc\u00e9s serait suspendu pendant la session, les six mois fix\u00e9s par la sec. 32 pour le commencement du proc\u00e9s \u00e9taient d\u00e9j\u00e0 expires depuis longtemps lorsque la demande de fixation fut faite. La cour interpr\u00e9tant les diverses sections de l'acte des elections au sujet des d\u00e9lais et des adjounements ments du proc\u00e9s comme suffisantes pour l'autoriser \u00e0 fixer le proc\u00e9s apr\u00e9s l'expiration des six mois, rendit le jugement fixant le proc\u00e9s au 12 janvier. Ce jour-l\u00e0 au moment o\u00f9 allait commencer le proc\u0141s l'avocat de Purcell renouvela devant le trial judge, l'objection qu'il avait faite devant la cour pour emp\u00eacher la fixation du proc\u00e8s, parce que les six mois dans lesquels il aurait d\u00fb \u00eatre commenc\u00e9 \u00e9taient depuis longtemps expires. Cette objection fut rejet\u00e9e par le trial judge comme elle l'avait \u00e9t\u00e9 par la cour. En appel devant cette cour la majorit\u00e9 des juges a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que les six mois fixes pour le commencement du proc\u00e9s \u00e9taient de rigueur, qu'une fois expires, la cour, ni le trial judge n'avait plus de juridiction pour proc\u00e9der an proc\u00e8s. Tant que cette d\u00e9cision ne sera pas modifi\u00e9e, elle doit \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme ayant finalement r\u00e8fgl\u00e9 cette question. Aussi je n'entrerai dans aucun argument \u00e0 ce sujet me bornant \u00e0 mentionner la tentative infructueuse faite devant le Conseil Priv\u00e9 pour la faire r\u00e9former et \u00e0 r\u00e9f\u00e9rer pour mes motifs de confirmation du present jugement aux raisons que j'ai donn\u00e9es dans cette cause de Glengarry et celle du comt\u00e9 de Qu\u00e9bec ([5]).\nLes six mois \u00e9taient incontestablement expires dans la cause de lengarry. Il est aussi incontestable qu'ils ne l'\u00e9taient pas dans la pr\u00e9sente cause, parcequ'\u00e0 la demande de l'appelant, la procedure avait \u00e9t\u00e9 suspendue pendant la session, et que ce d\u00e9lai n'a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 courir que le 25 janvier, deux jours apr\u00e9s la fin de la session, en vertu du jugement rendu le 12 avril. Le proc\u00e9s ayant effectivement commenc\u00e9 le 22 novembre comme on l'a vu par les proc\u00e9d\u00e9s rapport\u00e9s ci-haut, ii se trouve done avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 commenc\u00e9 dans les six mois\nOn a fait l'obecction que la loi obligeait le juge \u00e0 proc\u00e9der de die in diem, mais cetee objection eat sans valeur, parce qu'ayant acquss pleine et enti\u0141re juridiction sur la cause, par le commencement du proc\u00e9s il \u00e9tait au pouvoir du (trial Judg\u00e8) juge pr\u00e9sidant au proc\u00e8s, en vertu de la sec. 31 s.s. 4, d'ajourner de temps \u00e0 autre.\nThe judee at the trial may adjourn from time to time, and from any one place to another, in the same electoral district, as to him seems convenient.\nCette section fait voir que l'objection en question est tout \u00e0 fait frivole\nL'appelant s'est aussi plaint de ce que le juge a refus\u00e9 de proc\u00e9der \u00e0 la preuve sur les accusations r\u00e9criminatoires port\u00e9es contre l'autre candidat pour lequel les p\u00e9titionnaires avaient demand\u00e9 le siege. L'\u00e9lection ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cla\u00e9e nulle et la demande du si\u00e8ire faite par les p\u00e9titionnaires retir\u00e9e, ii n'y avait plus lieu de pro c\u00e9der sur ces charges. Je concours compl\u00e8tement dans les raisons donn\u00e9es par Sir William Ritchie, justifiant le refus du juge de faire une enqu\u00eate devenue tout \u00e0 fait inutile. L'appel dolt \u00eatre renvoy\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens.\nGWYNNE J. The learned counsel for the appellant contended that the order of the 10th of October was made upon an application under the 64th section of the Controverted Elections Act, and therefore, although general in its terms, ordering a stay of all proceedings, it must be construed as extending only the time for the respondent in the petition filing preliminary objections thereto or answering it un the merits without at all extending the time for going to trial: but I am of opinion, that assuming the order to have been made in view of and under the 64th section, it is nevertheless a good order for extending the time for the taking of all proceedings including the going to trial, and that, therefore, the petitionesr had six months from the presentation of the petition given to them to go to trial exclusive of the session of Parliament. I am of opinion also that what took place on the 30th November was a commencement of the trial which, therefore, did commence within the extended time,and that the trial was duly continued by adjournment until judgment was pronounced. I am of opinion also that when sufficient evidence to avoid the election had been produced, it was competent for the learned judge to close the taking further evidence upon the petition, and to pronounce his judgment avoiding the election.It is contended however, upon this appeal by the respondent in the election petition, the now appellant, against the judgment avoiding his election, that inasmuch as the petitioners had claimed the seat for the other candidate and notwithstanding that the claim had been withdrawn in the progress of the case for the petitioners, and before the learned judge had expressed himself satisiied with the evidence that had been given as sufficient to avoid the election, he, the respondent, had a right before judgment avoiding the election should be pronounced, to go into evidence upon recriminatory charges which he desired to be allowed to prove, and he contends that by reason of the learned judge having declined to receive such evidence because of the claim for the seat for the other candidate having been so as aforesaid withdrawn, it is competent for him to maintain the appeal against the judgment avoiding the election.\nAlthough it appeass to me that it would have been competent for the learned judge to have received evidence on the recriminatory charges notwithstanding the withdrawal of the claim for the seat for the candidate in whose interest the petition was filed, as was done in the Harwich Case ([6]), still I do not clearly see how we can, on this appeal, make his declining to do so sufficient ground for reversing his judgment avoiding the election, which judgment, having regard to the evidence upon which it rests, is unexceptionable. The objection in fact is not one affecting the soundnsss of the learned judge's judgment avoiding the election. It calls in question the correctness of the judgment of the learned judge upon a matter of procedure in relation to a totally different matter, namely, a counter charge which the claim to the seat made on behalf of the opposing candidate, by the petitioners, enabled to be enquired into on the trial of the election petition, and the withdrawal of which claim the learned judge deemed sufficient to warrant his refusal to receive evidence of charges which could only be entered into then in respect of the claim to the seat which had been withdrawn. The determination of those counter charges, in whatever way they might have been determined, if the evidence upon them had been received, could have had no effect upon the question of the avoiding of the election. The learned judge's judgment upon that question would have remained, even if the recriminatory charges had been proved. The act does not appear to me to make provision for such a case, as the present. To reverse the learned judge's judgmeat avoiding the election, not for any reason affecting the soundnsss of that judgment upon the merits, but because the learned judge did not enter Upon the counter charges for the reason above stated would not, as it seems to me, be a step in the furtherance of justice and I do not see how we could upon this objection, reverse a judgment which upon the merits of what is concluded by it is unexceptionable.\nI think, therefore, that the only course open to us is to dismiss the appeal, and report accordingly to the Speaker of the House of Commons.\nPATTERSON J.\u2014This election was avoided by a judgment pronounced on the 20th of February, 1888, by Mr. Justice Henri T. Taschearau, for corrupt practices commiteed by agents of the successful candidate Edouard Guilbault without his knowledge or consent.\nThe petition was filed on the 9th of April, 1887. Four days afterwards, viz., on the 13th of April the session of parliament began and it continued until the 23rd of the following June.\nThe 22nd of November was named as the day for the trial by an order made on the 10th of October.\nGuilbault who was respondent to the petition is the present appellant. His contention is thus stated in his factum:\u2014\u2014 1st. There was no jurisdiction to try this matter. The petition was out of court at the time of trial and. the judge should so have determined, and .dismsseed the petition.\n2nd. The learned judge should have found in favor of the appellant on his motions of the 12th December, 1887, and the 80th of January, 1888.\n3rd. The learned judge should not, on the evidenoe, and on the record, have found in favor of the petitioners on charges of bribery by agents, and should not have voided the election\nThe point made under the first of these grounds of complaint is that the trial was not commenced within six months from the filing of the petition.\nIf the session of parliament is included in the computation of the six months, that period expiedd on the 8th of October, while, if excluded the time would extend to the 18th of December.\nIt is urged that whichever computation is adopted the six months period was exceeded.\nBut it happens that the appellant himself procured an order the effect of which was to exclude the session .\nHe gave notice on the 12th of April the day before the meeting of parliament, that he would move on the 14th to stay all proceedings from the 13th of April till two days after the close of the session, and on the 14th the order he asked for was made.\nThe notice was of a motion in these terms:\nA ce que, vu la convocation du Parlement do la Puissance pour une session dont l'ouverture est fix\u00e9e au treize avril courant, tous proc\u00e9d\u00e9s ult\u00e9rieurs en cette cauee soient d\u00e9clar\u00e9s suspendus \u00e0 compter du dit jour treize avril courant inclusivement, et qu'il avait en outre d\u00e9clar\u00e9 quo le d\u00e9lai prescrit pour produciion d'objections pr\u00e9liminaires ou de r\u00e9ponse au m\u00e9rite suivant le cas est, et restera suspendu depuis et y compsis le dit jour treize avril courant et n'expirera qu'avec les deux jours qui suivront la cl\u00f4ture do la dite session le\u00b0tout avec d\u00f4\u00f4pess distraits aux soussign\u00e9s. It was urged before us that the object of the motion was not to extend the time for the beginning of the trial, but to get further time to answer or object to the petition, by means of an order which the court or a judge is authorized by section 64 of R. S. C. ch. 9 to make. The motion asked, it is true, for an order of that kind, but asked it in addition to the stay of proceedings. The main application was for the stay during the session andthe other matter seems to have been introduced to make it clear that while the petitionerss hands were tobe tied as to proceedings on his part towards the trial the time was not to count against the respondent in respect to his proceedings.\nThe learned judge who made the order evidently understooe the matter in this wav. He refers in the order to the 32nd section of the act, but the direct authority for the order is section 33, and he pursues that section in giving reasons to show that the interests of justice rendered the enlargement necessary.\nThe document is in these words ([7]):\u2014\nThere can be no question of the effect of that order in extending the time for the trial. In the face of it the petitioner could take no step during the specified time, whil,e but for it, he could have applied under section 13 at any time after the 15th of April, which was five days from the filing of the petition, to have a time fixed for the trial, provided no preliminary objections had been taken.\nIt may be worth noting that if the motion of the 14th of April had in its terms asked only for an extension of time till the end of the session for taking preliminary objections, it is not likely that a judge would have made the order without also extending the time for the trial, because, by section 13, the right to apply to have the time for the trial fixed is made to some extent dependent on the disposal of the preliminary objctions.\nUpon these grounds we were all of opinion, and so held during the argument, that the effect of the order was that the six months limit reached to the 18th of December.\nIn the meantime, viz., on the 22nd of November, the election court sat for the trial of the petition, and two witnesses were examined to prove formal matters not affecting any of the charges. Evidence being then offered in support of one of the charges, it was objected that the article in the particulars was not sufficienyly specific, and thereupon the petitioner was ordered to give better particuaars and the court adjourned to the 5th of December. When it met on that day two motions against the jurisdiction based on the contention which has been held to be unfounded, that the 22nd of November was beyond the six months' limit, were discussed and taken en delib\u00e9r\u00e9, the court again adjourning till the 12th of December. On the 12th the applications were dismissed, and the judge having to preside, as we are told, at another court on the 13th, \u00e0 further adjournment till the 5th of January took place. On that day the attack on the jurisdiction was renewed, the ground this time being that the extended time, which expired on the 18th of December, had been exceeded without the trial having been begun.\nThis contention, in the form in which it was advanced, wanted a foundation of fact. The trial had been begun on the 22nd of November. What was done on that day in proving certain essential facts was not repeated when the taking of evidence was resumed on the 30th of January after the various adjournments. If, after proving those facts on the 22nd of November, it had happened that no proof was given of any charge containedin the petition, either because the petitioner was unable or unwilling to adduce evidence or because of the absence or insufficiency of particulars, or for any other valid reason, there would nevertheless have been a trial, and the petitionmight well have been dismissed.\nThe question of the trial having been begun on the 22nd November is, therefore, a simple one and must be decided against the appellant.\nBut there is another question upon the construction of section 32 that requires notice. By that section the trial is to,be commenced within six months, \" and shall be proceeded with from day to day until such trial is over.\"\nHere there were several adjournments during the interval between the 22nd of November when the trial was begun and the 30th of Jauuary when the bulk of the evidence was taken. They were not different in character or duration from those frequently found necessary, and made without question, by all our ordinary courts. Can it be intended by this direction to procedd from day to day, that any adjournment which interrupts the continuous sittings of a court for the trial of a controverted election shall ipso facto oust the jurisdiciion and render the petition coram non judice? If this is the effect it will be so in all cases, no matter what may be the cauee of the adjournment, the illness or unavoidable absenee of a witness, or of the judge himself, or any other accident beyond the control of the parties or the court.\nThere is nothing in the terms of the enactment, which are in form directory and not prohibitive, to make it necessary to adopt a construction involving consequences so anomalous and so calculated to do injustice, and that construction would, moreover, be at variance with the liberal spirit in which powers of amendment and of extending time are conferred by other sections of the act. I think this is the first time the reading in question has been suggested. Adjournments such as those in this case have always hitherto been made when occasion for them arose and a construction has thus, in practice, been put upon the provision, although no court may have formally pronounced upon it. That construction treats the provision as directory only, and I have no doubt of its being the proper construction.\nIt may be that this discussion of the provision is not necessary, for I am not sure that the appellant intended to raise the question. The objections taken by him from time to time in the court below were based on the contention, which we have held to be unfounded, that the trial was not begun on the 22nd of November, and not on any assumed obligation to proceed literally day after day.That is true of the motion of the fifth of January, as well as of the earlier ones. They all relied on the six months limit and on the denial that the trial had begun. But the petitioner in his formal answerto the last motion, which answer was filed on the 12th of January, asserted a full compliance with the statute.\nSection 33, sub-section 2, declares that no trial of any election petition shall be commenced or proceeded with during any term of the court of which the judge who is to try the same is a member, and at which such judge is by law bound to sit.\nThe de die in diem rule is therefore not universal:and setting aside for the moment the directory character of the mandate,I apprehend that before a party can impeach a proceeding or maintain it to be void for non-compliance with the rule he must show that the case is not within the exception.\nIt is asserted by the petitioner in his answer to the motion of the fifth of January to be within the exception, or fact sare stated touching the engagements of the judge, tending in that direction, and some evidence in support of that statement has been read to us from the record, yet the petitioner has not, by any evidence, nor as I understand, by any statement, negatived the exception, and we could not assume in his favour that the exception does not apply.\nThere is no reason from any point of view for holding the proceedings null by reason of the adjournments in question.\nWhat I have said disposes of the second ground of complaint as well as of the first.\nThe third ground as formulated impeaches the judgment on matters of fact. From the discussion of the evidence which took place on the argument it is clear that the finding of the learned judge on both questions, the agency of Barrette, and the act of bribery committed by him, are amply sustained by testimony on which it was the province of the learned judge to pronounce.\nBut under this head another objection has been urged, namely, that the learned judge refused to receive evidence of recriminatory charges which the appellant was prepared to give.\nIn the petition the seat was claimed for the defeated candidate In those circumstances the appellant was entitled, by sec. 42, to give evidence to show that the election of the defeated candidate was undue, in the same manner as if he had preseneed a petition complaining of such election.\nBut the claim for the seat was withdrawn, for the reason that a scrutiny showed him to\" have a minority of votes but at all events it was withdrawn. The learned judge thereupon considered that section 42 no longer applied. I think he was clearly right.\nIt has been argued that on this trial and on this question the status of the appellant was the same as if he had under section 5, presented a petition charging the candidate with corrupt practices. It is not necessary to decide whether such a petition could or could not have been presented under section 5. Assuming, however, that a substantive proceeding under that section or section 9 subs, b could have been taken, it must have been within thirty days after the return, or fifteen days after the service of the papers and upon giving security for costs. The proceeding under section 42 is authorized in order to avoid the awarding of the seat to a person who is disqualified or has not been duly elected, and can only apply so long as the seat is claimed. The language of the section creates no difficulty in this respect. It enacts that the recriminatory evidence may be given on the trial of a petition claiming the seat for any person. But the trial ceased to answer that description as soon as the petition ceased to claim the seat.\nThe whole proceeding under the section has reference to the seat, and the seat is no longer in question.\nI am clearly of opinion that the appeal should be dismissed, and of course with, costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellants: McConville & Renaud.\nSolicitors for respondents: champagne & Dugas.\n[1] 14Can, C.

C.\u2014 Waiver.\nA condition in a marine policy that all claims under the policy shall be void unless prosecuted within one year from date of loss is a valid condition not contrary to art. 2184 C. C., and all claims under such a policy will be barred if not sued on within one year from the date of the loss.\nThe plaintiff cannot rely in appeal on a waiver of the condition, unless such waiver has been properly pleaded.\nPer Taschereau J.\u2014The debtor cannot stipulate to enlarge the delay to prescribe, but the creditor may stipulate to shorten that delay.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada (appeal side) ([1]) rendered on the 22nd day of November, 1887, which confirmed, unanimously, a judgment of the Superior Court rendered on the 31st day of October, 1885, dismissing the action of the appellant, plaintiff in the Superior Court.\nThe action was instituted on the 8th April, 1880, upon a policy of insurance to recover from the said respondents the sum of $5,000.\nThe declaration alleged that on the 29th October, 1877, the plaintiff effected an insurance with the defendants for the sum of $5,000 on the barque \"Waterloo,\" her tackle, etc. to take effect from the 25th day of said month of October said vessel having sailed from Quebec on the 26th day of the same month, for a premium of $500. That in the said policy the said vessel, tackle, etc., were valued at $35,000; that the said vessel sailed from Quebec to Liverpool on the 26th October, 1877, and was lost on or about 28th February, 1878; that the plaintiff was interested in the said vessel to the extent of $5000; that on the 6th June, 1878, the plaintiff abandoned the said vessel and all his rights therein to the defendants and complied with all the conditions of the policy.\nThe declaration concluded for a condemnation against the defendants for $5,000 with interest from 28th February, 1878, and costs.\nThe defendants pleaded two special pleas and a general denial to the action.\nThe first plea upon which this appeal was determined set up one of the conditions of the policy which is in words following :\u2014\n\"It is also agreed that all claims under this policy \" shall be void unless prosecuted within one year from \"the date of loss; and in case the note or obligation \" given for the premium herefor be not paid at maturity the full amount of the premium shall be considered as earned and this policy become void while \" the said note or obligation remains over due and \" unpaid.''\nThe plaintiff filed general answers to the pleas of the defendants.\nUpon these pleadings and the evidence being taken the case was argued and judgment was rendered by the Honorable Mr. Justice Jette in the Superior Court dismissing the plaintiff's action with costs.\nRitchie for appellant contended :\n1. That the clause of the policy stating that \"all claims should be void unless prosecuted within one year from the date of loss\" was not binding on the appellant.\n2. Supposing the clause to be binding, the respondents had waived the rights thereunder by their actions herein. 3. That the condition, binding him to institute proceedings within a year is not valid, not being mentioned in the binding application for insurance, which was the contract between the parties and being contrary to the terms of art. 2184 of the Civil Code.\nThe learned council cited and relied on Grant v. Lexington Ins. Co. ([2]); Jones v. Sun Mutual Ins. Co. ([3]); Eagle Ins. Co. v. The Lafayette Ins. Co. ([4]); Dolbier v. The Agricultural Ins. Co. ([5]); French v. The Lafayette Ins. Co. ([6]); The Anchor Marine ins. Co. v. Allen ([7]); Chandler & Co. v. St. Paul F. & M. Inst. Co. ([8]); also Parsons, Maritime Law ([9]); Little v. Ph\u00e6nix Ins. Co. ([10]); Sansum's Digest of Insurance vo. Limitation ([11]).\nHatton Q.C. for respondent contended the clause was valid and not contrary to the code and that no waiver had been pleaded, citing and relying on the following in addition to the cases cited in the judgment given :\u2014\nBrowning v. The Provincial Ins. Co. ([12]); Rousseau v. Royal Ins. Co. ([13]); Porter's Laws of Insurance ([14]); Bunyon Fire Insurance ([15]), and cases there cited.\nAs to the French law the learned counsel referred to Laurent ([16]); Pouget, dict. des assurances; Pothier, Droit civil ([17]); Merlin, Rep. E\u00e9n. Vo. Prescrip. ([18]); Dalloz Rep. Ass. Terrestres ([19]); Marcad\u00e9 ([20]); Aubry & Rau ([21]); Troplong, Pres. ([22]); Pothier Vente ([23]). Sir W. J. RITCHIE C.J.\u2015The appeal in this case should be dismissed upon the ground that the action was instituted too late under a valid provision of the policy. It is claimed that there was a waiver. It was not pleaded and, therefore, there is no issue upon which we could give judgment.\nSTRONG J.\u2014I am of opinion that there is no foundation for this appeal. The action is on a policy of marine insurance whereby the respondents insured the barque \" Waterloo \" for the sum of $5,000 for one year from the 25th of October, 1877, sailing from Quebec \" on present voyage \" on 26th October, 1877. The policy was effected by E. H. Duval on account of himself, loss (if any) payable to the appellant, (who was described in the policy as of the firm of Moses & Mitchell, 4 Grace Church street, London). The \" Waterloo \" sailed on the voyage from Quebec on the 26th October, 1877, did not arrive at her port of destination and was never afterwards heard of.\nIt is not disputed that the vessel was lost sometime before the 28th February 1878, on which day she was posted at Lloyd's list.\nThe policy contained a provision in the words following:\u2014\nIt is also agreed that all claims under the policy shall be void unless prosecuted within one year from the date of loss.\nThis action was instituted on the 8th April, 1880.\nBy their first peremptory exception the respondents set up the bar of the prescriptive clause already referred to. The plaintiff fyled general answers only to all the defendant's exceptions. The cause being at issue, the parties went to enqu\u00eate, and the action was afterwards heard before Mr. Justice Jett\u00e9 in the Superior Court.\nThe Superior Court dismissed the action with costs and an appeal from that judgment having been taken to the Court of Queen's Bench by the present appellant, that court affirmed the judgment of the Superior Court. A further appeal has now been taken to this court.\nOnly two points requiring notice were argued here. First, it was said that the conventional prescription provided by the clause already quoted had been waived. It is sufficient to refer to one conclusive answer to this contention. The appellant cannot be admitted to insist on waiver in the state of the record before us. If it had been intended to rely on this reply it should have been set up by a special answer to the exception pleading the prescription, but this was not done. It is, therefore, out of the question now, in this second stage of appeal to consider this answer to the defence, even if it were sustained by the clearest and strongest evidence. It is sufficient then to say that it is not now competent to the appellant to raise this objection, and to this it may be added that there is not a title of evidence in support of the pretended waiver.\nThe only other point seriously urged in argument was the legal one that this prescriptive clause was void as against public policy. It has over and over again been adjudged that a provision of this kind is valid and unimpeachable in English law\u2014and no authority has been quoted to show that the French law differs in this respect from the English law; on the contrary numerous French authorities show that the law of France as settled by a general consensus of legal authors as well as by the jurisprudence of the Court of Cassation, agrees with the law of England.\nThe appeal is one of the most frivolous and ill founded which has ever come before this court and should be dismissed with costs\nFOUR\u00d1IER J. Concurred with Taschereau J.\nTASCHEREAU J. This was an action on a policy of Marine Insurance. One of the conditions of the policy was that \" all claims under this policy shall be void unless presented within one year from the date of loss.\" The action was instituted more than two years after the loss. The company pleaded this condition and the Superior Court, thereupon, dismissed the action. The Court of Appeal unanimously confirmed that judgment, and the plaintiff now appeals to this court. His appeal must be dismissed. I would call it \u00e1 frivolous appeal. His first contention was that p prosecuted \"in the said policy does not mean \u201c prosecution by a suit or action.\" The appellant has not been able to cite a single authority in support of this contention. In the case of Carraway v. The Merchant's Mutual Ins, Co. ([24]) this very same point was raised and determined against the plaintiff.\nThe appellant, secondly, argued that this condition is void under article 2184 of the Civil Code which enacts that prescription cannot be renounced by anticipation, the only prescription against him recognized by law, as he contends, being the prescription of five years under art. 2260 C.C. The question is now well settled, and the validity of such a condition perfectly well established. I need only refer to Cornell v. The Liverpool Ins. Co. ([25]); Armstrong v. Northern Ins. Co, ([26]); Bell v. Hartford ([27]); Rousseau v. The Royal ([28]); Whyte v. Western in the Privy Council ([29]); and to Laurent ([30]) and Pouget, Dictionnaire des Assurances ([31]) where all the French authorities are collected. The enactment that prescription cannot be renounced by anticipation is an enactment in favor of the debtor and means simply, that (to apply it to the present case, for instance) if the company had stipulated that an action on this policy should lie in case of loss at any time even after five years, the company upon being sued after five years could plead this prescription, notwithstanding the stipulation to the contrary. But that the plaintiff should himself invoke the article to support the contention that he could not legally stipulate that the delay to prosecute should be shorter than five years seems to be a misconception of the article. The debtor cannot stipulate to enlarge the delay to prescribe, but the creditor may stipulate to shorten that delay.\nAs to the waiver which the appellant attempted to rely upon, it is sufficient to say that there is no such issue raised on the record. The appellants only answer to the company's plea was a general replication.\nGWYNNE J. concurred.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellant: Davidson & Ritchie.\nSolicitor for respondents: J.

C.\nOn this appeal certain ballot papers being objected to\nHeld, that it will require a clear case to reverse the decision of the trial judge who has found as a question of fact whether there was or was not evidence that the slight pencil marks or dots objected to had been made designedly by the voter. Also, that where the X is not unmistakably above or below the line separating the names of the candidates the ballot is bad.\nAppeal from the judgment of the Honorable Mr. Justice Street delivered at Cayuga upon the trial of the controverted election of Haldimand for the House of Commons whereby the election petition was dismissed with costs.\nThe election in question was held on the 5th and 12th days of November, 1887, when the respondent, Walter Humphreys Montague and Charles Wesley Coulter were candidates, and the said Walter Humphreys Montague was declared by the returning officer to have a majority of the votes cast at the said election.\nThe petition contained, in addition to the usual charges of bribery and corruption, many specific charges with reference to the reception, counting and rejection of ballots, and other charges of irregularity and unlawful practices in connection with the election which by the said petition it was sought to have declared void.\nThe trial began on Tuesday the 24th January, 1888, and by the direction of the presiding judge the charges of corrupt practices against the respondent and his agents were first disposed of, and afterwards certain evidence was taken as to charges in the petition of irregularities in the conduct of the said election.\nOn the fourth day of the trial, Friday the 27th of January, the learned judge proceeded to examine the ballots cast at the said election, and as the result of such counting of the ballots he declared a majority of ten votes to have been cast in favor of the respondent.\nOn the present appeal a number of ballots which on the scrutiny had been counted either for the respondent or the defeated candidate were objected to. These ballots were examined by the court and two ballots which had been allowed for the respondent by the trial judge after examination with a microscope were disallowed, the court holding that unless the X is unmistakably above or below the line separating the names of two candidates so marked the ballot is bad.\nThe findings of the trial judge on the other objected ballots were upheld, the court holding that it would require a clear case to reverse the decision of the trial judge who had found as a question of fact as to whether there was or was not evidence that the slight pencil marks or dots objected to had been made designedly by the voter. No decision was arrived at on ballots No. 103 and No. 46.\nBallot No. 103 was cast at polling sub-division No. 4, in the township of Oneida, by one Philip S. Wintermute, and the words \"Philip S. Wintermute,\" were written upon the ballot itself, before it was deposited in the ballot box. Charles Young, the deputy returning officer at the polling sub-division in question, was called by the respondent at the trial as a witness to support the claim to have this ballot counted. He stated that Wintermute voted as a farmer's son, that his right to vote was challenged, and that when he came back from the voting compartment and handed his ballot to the deputy returning officer to be deposited in the box one of the scrutineers for Mr. Colter suggested or urged, that a note of the objection to the vote should be made on the ballot-paper itself, and that accordingly he (the deputy returning officer) then wrote on the ballot-paper the words \"Philip S. Wintermute,\" before depositing it in the box. This ballot was allowed for the respondent in the court below.\nBallot 46 was a ballot not initialed by the returning officer and was counted for the defeated candidate by the trial judge after evidence of its identity was given.\nThe appellant by his notice of appeal limited the subject of this appeal to the following special and defined questions and the rulings and decisions thereon of the learned judge at the trial, viz.:\n\"2. The refusal of the learned judge at the trial to count as votes for Mr. Colter 7 of the ballots cast at the said election at polling sub-division No. 2 in the township of Oneida and which, as the petitioner contends, were marked with a second cross by the deputy returning officer at the said polling station after the voter had returned the same to the officer to be deposited in the ballot box. The said 7 ballots were numbered by the county judge upon the recounting of votes after the said election as Nos. 85, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91 and 92.\n\"3. The charge (No. 8 in the particulars) that Frederick Harrison as agent of the respondent did induce Thomas Nixon to take a false oath at the poll and to vote at the said election though not qualified to do so.\n\"4. The charge (No. 20 in the particulars) that Stephen Allen, an agent of the respondent, did induce Robert Dougherty to take a false oath at polling station No. 3, in the township of Walpole, though the said Robert Dougherty was not qualified to vote at the said election.\n\"5. The charge that the deputy returning officer at polling sub-division No. 4, in the township of Oneida, put into the ballot box and counted ballots not duly received from the electors in the lawful performance of his duties as deputy returning officer at the said election.\n\"6. The charge that the deputy returning officer at polling sub-division No. 2, in the township of Oneida, improperly marked ballots received by him at the said election from electors before depositing the said ballots in the ballot box, and thereby prevented the said ballots from being counted at the said election, and the ruling of the learned judge at the trial, rejecting the evidence on behalf of the petitioner, which was tendered by him at the trial in support of the said charge.\n\"7. The charge that many persons voted at the said election who for different reasons were not qualified to vote thereat, and the refusal of the learned judge at the trial to inquire into the right at the time of the election of any person to vote thereat, if the name of such person appeared on the list of voters as finally revised, and certified by the revising barrister, and the rejection by the learned judge at the trial of the evidence tendered on behalf of the petitioner to establish that many persons who voted at the said election had, between the time of the final revision of the voters' lists by the revising barrister at the date of the said election, forfeited the right to vote thereat.\"\nThe evidence relating to charges 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7, upon which this appeal was decided, is reviewed in the judgments hereinafter given.\nAylesworth (Colter with him) for appellant.\nOn the Harrison\u2013Nixon charge (Par. 3 in the notice of appeal) the learned counsel cited and relied on The Dominion Elections Act, secs. 90, 91 93 and also sec. 45, sub sec. 2, ch. 8 R. S. C.; Cooper v. Slade[1]; North Norfolk Case[2]; Wallingford Case[3]; The Hereford Case[4]; The Launceston Case[5]; The Carrickfergus Case[6]; The Louth Case[7]; The Selkirk Case[8]; The Soulanges Case[9]; and Taylor on Evidence[10].\nOn the Allen-Dougherty charge (Par. 4 in the notice) upon the question of agency The Stroud Case[11] was referred to. On this charge they referred also to the judgment of Chief Justice Moss in a case referred from the County of Elgin to the Ontario Court of Appeal under the Ontario Voters Lists Acts\u2014printed in the appendix to Hodgins' Manual on the Law affecting Voters' Lists in Ontario, 2nd Ed., as case No. 8 in re Norman.\nThe learned counsel then argued that the trial judge had erred in refusing to allow witnesses to disclose for whom they had voted in order to prove the truth of charge 6 in the notice of appeal, and contended that the statute was framed solely to leave to the voter the privilege of secrecy if he wished to assert and maintain it. Citing sec. 71 of the Dominion Elections Act and Taylor on Evidence[12]: McCreary on Elections[13]; People v. Pease[14]; Res. v. Kinglake[15]; Thomas v. Newton[16]; King v Adey[17]: Cooley on Limitations[18].\nThen as to right to enquire on a scrutiny into the qualification of the farmer's sons at the time of voting the learned counsel contended that sec. 41 ch. 8 R. S. C. must be read as conferring on farmers' sons the right to vote subject to the provisions contained in sec. 45, sub-sec. 2 and in support of his interpretation of the statute in this respect relied upon the judgment in The South Wentworth Case[19]; The Stormont Case[20]; North Victoria Case[21]; Cooley on Limitations p. 762.\nMcCarthy Q.C. for respondent.\nAs to the Harrison--Nixon charge he contended there was no agency. Matthison and Macaskie on Corrupt Practices[22] and cases there cited. Harrison's authority was limited as provided in sec. 36 ch. 8 R. S. C. But, admitting agency, he argued that it was impossible under the circumstances to hold: First, that Nixon took a false oath. There was no ground on which the learned judge could have held that any oath which Nixon was required to take was false in fact, or if false in fact that it was false in the sense in which it would be unlawful for him to take it, namely, knowingly false. Secondly, there was not a tittle of evidence on which the learned judge could have found that Harrison either \"compelled or induced\" Nixon to take the oath, or that he did so with the belief that Nixon was not in a position to take the oath, or that he did so corruptly within the meaning of the act, and he submitted that the holding and finding of the learned judge was the only possible one under the circumstances\u2014citing the Kingston Case[23].\nAs to the Allen-Dougherty charge no agency was proved. The scrutineer had not been appointed, and moreover, the facts clearly shew that Dougherty was still a resident on his father's property and could take the oath.\nThe learned counsel then referred to the irregularities relied on and contended the defeated candidate had suffered no injustice.\nAs to charge 31. Unless a prim\u00e2 facie case of fraud is alleged and proved there is no right to enquire how a voter voted. On the grounds of public policy the legislature determined that a ballot could not under any circumstances, for the purpose of ascertaining by whom that ballot was marked, be enquired into in a court of justice. In this respect the ballot act under the law of Canada differs from the law established in England, where under certain circumstances the court is at liberty to investigate how the ballot has been marked. Clauses 70, 71 and 72, as indeed the whole election act itself, clearly indicate that the great object which the legislature had in view was the secrecy of the ballot, and that under no possible circumstances could it ever be made known by any course of procedure how a man had voted; in other words that the ballot was to be absolutely and for all time secret. In Leigh & Le Marchant on Elections[24] is a statement showing how the peculiar inconsistency to be found in the English ballot is accounted for. In the Canadian law the policy as to the secrecy of the ballot was maintained and the act is consistent in itself. So that in a scrutiny, if it be determined that an elector was bribed by a candidate or his agent, it is provided that one vote should be deducted from that candidate's poll, without any enquiry or means of enquiry as to how in fact the bribed elector voted, and it may not be at all impossible that the elector may have voted under the secrecy of the ballot different from the way in which he was bribed or corrupted to vote, Nevertheless as there can be no such enquiry the law has provided as the only means of redress that one vote shall be deducted from the candidate's poll. Besides strictly speaking there can be no evidence as to how a man voted other than the production of the paper itself, nor would there be any safety if courts were to deal not upon the ballot which is the vote, but upon the statement of witnesses as to how they voted. A witness might falsely say he had voted differently from the way in which he had voted, without the slightest fear of detection, and without it being possible to establish that his evidence was wrong. The courts ought not to make any exception. Now with regard to the English mode or method of procedure, to show very clearly that the principle contended for is the right one, there, no examination can be had of the ballot until it be established to the satisfaction of the court that the person who cast that ballot was guilty of an offence which ipso facto destroyed his vote. Then by reference to the numbers the ballot can be produced, every care being taken to prevent any other ballot being seen, and upon its being ascertained how he voted, the poll is altered accordingly, whereas the Canadian Parliament deliberately adopted the other rule as above referred to. At the trial the respondent's counsel offered in express terms to waive his objections if any evidence was given to the trial judge upon which he would say that a prim\u00e2 facie case of fraud had been made out. And if this was such a fraud there must surely be evidence of it. It was difficult to conceive how such a fraud could have been practiced. For it must be remembered that the voter getting his ballot has an opportunity to see that at that time it is not marked. He folds it up leaving the counterfoil and number exposed, which he exhibits on his return to the polling room to the deputy returning officer. The deputy returning officer then removes the counterfoil and in the presence of the voter deposits the ballot which he has brought back to him in the box. The witness that was examined in this case said that was all done and done in the presence of two scrutineers on each side and the poll clerk, so that the offer was made by the respondent's counsel, if a prim\u00e2 facie case of fraud was made out, to withdraw the objection and allow the petitioner full and ample enquiry. The petitioner's counsel would not avail himself of that offer, and therefore his lordship properly determined not to allow the examination to proceed.\nThe following authorities were cited:\nThe North Durham Case[25]; The Harwich Case[26]; The Litchfield Case[27]; The Wigtown Case[28]; Rogers on Election[29]; Macartney v. Corry[30].\nThen the learned counsel discussed the scrutiny charges under the eighth class of scrutiny particulars that farmers' sons voted who were not entitled to vote and contended:\nFirst, that no scrutiny is at all allowed under the act; secondly, that no scrutiny could be held because the ballot is conclusive and is the only evidence as to how a man did vote; thirdly, a man cannot be allowed to say how he voted, and could not be compelled to say how he voted; fourthly, every person whose name is on the list is entitled to vote.\nWith regard to the apparent conflict which is introduced by the Franchise Act\u2014by one section of the Franchise Act and by clause 70 of ch. 8 R. S. C.\u2014they have to be reconciled. By the Franchise Act farmers' sons are required to have what is called a continuing qualification, differing from everybody else, and Parliament has evidently for the purpose adopted the oath as the protection. The same thing is done in the Local Legislature, they have farmers' sons and owners' sons and all that class who require to have, just as in this case, a continuing qualification, but under the local act it has been held in the Wentworth Case, and was intimated in the recent case in Kent with the same effect by the learned judges who were there, that there could be no scrutiny upon any ground whatsoever. The oath was the protection that the law intended. For those reasons no enquiry can be made under this head of objection taken in these particulars. Stowe v. Joliffe[31].\nSir. W. J. RITCHIE C.J.\u2014Among the particulars of corrupt practices alleged are the following:\u2014\n8. Frederick Harrison, a resident of the township of Walpole, an agent of the respondent, did at polling station No. 6, in the township of Walpole, induce Thomas Nixon, a resident of the township of Walpole, to take a false oath at the poll and to vote at said election though not qualified to do so.\n20. Stephen Allen a resident of the township of Walpole, an agent of the respondent, did on the 12th day of November, 1887, induce Robert Dougherty to take a false oath at polling station No. 3, in the township of Walpole, though said Robert Dougherty was not qualified to vote at said election.\nIt is provided by 49 Vic. ch. 8 sec. 90 that\nEvery candidate who corruptly, by himself or by or with any other person on his behalf, compels or induces or endeavors to induce any person to personate any voter, or to take any false oath in any matter wherein an oath is required under this act, is guilty of a misdemeanor, and shall, in addition to any other punishment to which he is liable for such offence, forfeit the sum of $200 to any person who sues for the same.\nAnd by sec. 91:\nThe offences of bribery, treating, or undue influence, or any of such offences, as defined by this or any other act of the Parliament of Canada, personation or the inducing any person to commit personation, or any wilful offence against any one of the seven sections of this act next preceding, are corrupt practices within the meaning of this act.\nWe have then in this case to look to the seven preceding sections, of which 90 is one, simply to discover what wilful offences are corrupt practices within the meaning of this act, and under sec. 90 the wilful offence is the compelling or inducing or endeavoring to induce any person to take any false oath in any matter wherein an oath is required under this act, and the inquiry is not whether the candidate is guilty of a misdemeanor or not.\nThen by section 93 it is provided that:\nIf it is found by the report of any court, judge or other tribunal for the trial of election petitions, that any corrupt practices had been committed by any candidate at an election, or by his agent, whether with or without the actual knowledge and consent of such candidate the election of such candidate if he has been elected shall be void.\nThe inquiry then in this case is confined to the question: Whether there has been a wilful offence under section 90, and if so, whether it was committed by an agent of the candidate? Mr. Frederick Harrison represented Dr. Montague under a written authority whereby he appointed Harrison to act in the capacity of scrutineer for him (me) at polling sub-division No. 6, in the municipality of Walpole in the said electoral district of Haldimand.\nA voter named Nixon who was on the list qualified as a farmer's son, and qualified only in that capacity, offered himself to vote at this polling place as a farmer's son. William Parker, the scrutineer of the opposing candidate insisted that this voter should be sworn and this is the account be gives of what took place:\u2014\nWilliam Parker, sworn\u2014Examined by Mr. Aylesworth\u2014Q. Where were you engaged on polling day? A. Sub-division 6 of Walpole. Q. What capacity? A. As agent at the polls. Q. For whom? A. For Mr. Colter. Q. Were you there when Mr. Nixon came to vote\u2014the last witness? A. Yes. Q. What took place? A. When he came in I said to the returning officer I want this man sworn: Nixon said what is that for; he said I have voted here three or four times and you have never said anything; I said well I want you sworn; so he turned to go out and the poll clerk, and I am not sure whether others said to him\u2014Q. The poll clerk\u2014who do you mean? A. Andrew Falls: that is the name he didn't remember; the poll clerk said don't go out; if you do you cannot come back again; so he turned and came back, and he said to me what is your objection to my vote, Mr. Parker, you have never objected to it before; and I replied I don't discuss voters' qualifications here, and I turned to the returning officer and says I require him sworn; so the returning officer took the book to swear him, and I said oath \"T,\" and I looked over and saw the returning officer was reading oath \"T\" to him, but still he hesitated. Q. Who did? A. Nixon the voter; so Harrison, the other scrutineer, said your vote is perfectly good, Tom; he said take the oath, Tom, take the oath; I will be responsible; so then he took the oath and voted. Q. What oath was read to him? A. Oath \"T,\" the farmer's sons' oath.\" Q. Did you have a copy of the oath? A. Yes, I had a copy of the act. Q. How did you know it was oath \"T?\" A. I just looked over it and could see it. Q. You followed the reading? A. I could see when he began to read what he was reading and I said oath \"T\" to the returning officer before he began. Q. And was this part of it, \"That I am resident with my father within this electoral district?\" A. Yes, sir, that is the last.\nAnd Nixon the voter on his examination says in reply to the question: What was the form of oath administered to you? was it as owner or owner's son or farmer's son or which? Answers, farmer's son.\nThis oath \"T\" is the form of oath of qualification of a person whose name is registered as a voter on the list of voters as being a farmer's son, not claiming the benefit of the provision as to occasional absence as a mariner, fisherman or student.\nI, (B), solemnly swear (or if he is one of the persons permitted by law to affirm in civil cases, solemnly affirm):\n1. That I am the person named or purporting to be named, by the name of , (and if there are more persons than one of the same name on the said list, inserting also his addition or occupation) on the list of voters for polling district No. , in the electoral district (or municipality) of .\n2. That I am a British subject by birth (or naturalization, as the case may be), and that I am of the fall age of 21 years.\n3. That I have not voted before at this election, either at this or at any other polling place.\n4. That I have not received anything, nor has anything been promised me, directly or indirectly, either to induce me to vote at this election, or for loss of time, travelling expenses, hire of team, or for any other service connected therewith;\n5. That I have not, directly or indirectly, paid or promised anything to any person, either to induce him to vote or to refrain from voting at this election;\n6. That I am resident with my father, (or it his father is dead, with my mother) within this electoral district, and that I have not been absent from such residence more than six months since I was placed on the list of voters. So help me Grod.\nAnd this last clause is that which it is claimed the witness could not truthfully take and it cannot be denied that if he did take this oath he did take a false oath in a matter wherein an oath is required under the act.\nThis statement of Mr. Parker I must accept as strictly true, because neither the returning officer nor Harrison, the scrutineer of Mr. Montague, were called to show that oath \"T\" was not regularly and properly administered, or that any portion of the oath was omitted, and independent of any evidence of Parker in the absence of any evidence to the contrary it must be presumed the returning officer did his duty. If he did not do so the sitting member should have shewn it.\nIt is not necessary for me to discuss or decide a question raised on the argument, viz: whether a voter registered as a farmer's son has a right to choose what oath he will take, because in this case he actually took the farmer's son's oath, and did not choose or offer to take any other. I may say, however, that if I were called on to express an opinion I should require much more than I have heard in this case to convince me that a voter so registered has any such right.\nThe questions then resolve themselves to these: Was Harrison the agent of Mr. Montague at this polling place, and if so, did he compel or induce, or endeavor to induce, the voter Nixon to take the false oath? There cannot be a doubt that, having been authorized to act as scrutineer at the polling place in question, he was there as the agent of the candidate appointing him. The sections of the act 36, 37 and 38 make this, in my opinion, too plain for argument, they are as follows:\n36. In addition to the deputy returning officer and the poll clerk, the candidates and their agents (not exceeding two in number for each candidate in each polling station), and, in the absence of agents, two electors to represent each candidate on the request of such electors, and no others, shall be permitted to remain in the room where the votes are given, during the whole time the poll remains open;\nProvided always, that any agent bearing a written authorization from the candidate, shall always be entitled to represent such candidate in preference to, and to the exclusion of any two electors, who might otherwise claim the right of representing such candidate under this section. 41 Vic. ch. 6 s. 4.\n87. Any person producing to the returning officer or deputy returning officer, at any time, a written authority from the candidate to represent him at the election or at any proceeding of the election, shall be deemed an agent of such candidate within the meaning of this act. 37 Vic. ch. 9., s. 36.\n38. One of the agents of each candidate, and, in the absence of such agent, one of the electors representing each candidate, if there is such elector, on being admitted to the polling station shall take the oath to keep secret the names of the candidates for whom any of the voters has marked his ballot paper in his presence, as hereinafter required, which oath shall be in the form Q in the first schedule to this act. 37 Vic. ch. 9 s. 36, part.\nIf an agent, then was Harrison guilty of the corrupt practice attributed to him? The voter, it appears, having turned to go out, the poll clerk said to him \"don't go out, if you do you cannot come back again,\" so he turned and came back and after asking Parker \"what is your objection to my vote\" and receiving the reply, \"I don't discuss voters' qualifications here,\" and requiring him to be sworn; and while, Parker says, \"the officer was reading oath T to him, but he still hesitated,\"\u2014(Q. Who did? A. Nixon the voter.)\u2014Harrison the other scrutineer said: \"your vote is perfectly good Tom, take the oath Tom\u2014I will be responsible.\" \"So he took the oath and voted.\" And Nixon himself says in answer to the question;\nDid Harrison take any part when your vote was challenged? A. He insisted that I should take the oath. Q. What did he say? A. He said my vote was perfectly good. Q. Anything else? A. That was all; I took his word and went and voted.\nIf the scrutineer or agent representing the candidate chose to interfere with the voter and urge him to take an oath he could not truthfully take and, in the language of the voter himself, \"he insisted that I should take the oath, he said my vote was perfectly good, I took his word and went and voted:\" and, further, professed to assume the responsibility of the voter's doing so, this, in my opinion, was such a wilful inducing or endeavoring to induce the voter to take a false oath as to amount to a corrupt practice.\nMay it not, indeed, be fairly said that this was something more than mere inducing or endeavoring to induce this voter to take this oath which, but for the agent's interference, the hesitating voter might not, and from his own evidence, most probably never would, have taken, for he says, \"I took his word and went and voted?\" Did not this insistance that he should take the oath, and this assumption of responsibility for his so doing, if not amounting to a legal compelling very nearly approach moral compulsion or coercion? This having been done in a place and at a time when the scrutineer or agent ought not to have interfered with the voter, who should have been left to act as his own judgment and knowledge of his position prompted, and on his own responsibility, constrains me to the conclusion that what Harrison did was done corruptly and wilfully with the intention of securing the vote, at all hazards, for the party whom he was representing; for I cannot think he would have been so urgent that the oath should be taken if he had not been well assured for whom the voter intended to vote: and I am the more impressed with this conviction inasmuch as the evidence stands uncontradicted, and I cannot doubt but that Harrison would have been examined at the trial could he have contradicted the evidence of Parker, or have shewn that what he did was done under a misapprehension or mistake either of fact or law, that he honestly believed the voter was entitled to vote and could truthfully take the oath, and that what he did was not done wilfully or corruptly. As no excuse or justification has been put forward for his conduct the sitting member must take the consequence of his improper act and the election must be declared void.\nSTRONG J.\u2014I have the misfortune to differ from the majority of the court in the Harrison-Nixon case.\nThe particulars of this charge are, as they have just been stated by the learned Chief Justice, that Frederick Harrison, who was the scrutineer for the respondent at polling place No. 6, in the township of Walpole, induced Thomas Nixon, whose name appeared on the registry as a voter, to take a false oath and to vote, though not qualified, and thereby committed a corrupt act, as an agent, sufficient to avoid the election. It appeared that Nixon was registered as a farmer's son and that his father had died, on the 4th of April, 1886, before the final revision of the lists but that his name was left on the lists as a farmer's son; that the oath administered to him, and which he certainly could not properly take, was oath \"T\" which reads as follows:\nI am resident with my father within this electoral district, and that I have not been absent from such residence more than six months since I was placed on the list of voters,\nand that he nevertheless took this oath.\nTwo witnesses were examined on this charge, the voter Nixon and Parker the scrutineer for the petitioner at the poll in question.\nWhat is said by Nixon is as follows:\u2014\nQ. Did Harrison take any part when your vote was challenged? A. He insisted that I should take the oath. Q. What did he say? A. He said my vote; was perfectly good. Q. Anything else? A, That was all; I took his word and went and voted. * * Q. The deputy returning officer I suppose, read the oath over to you before you took it? A. Yes sir. Q. That is the way it was administered? A. Yes sir. Q. Was this part of it: \"That I am a resident with my father within this electoral district and have not been absent from such residence more than six months since I was placed on the list of voters? A. I do not remember that part \"with my father, &c.\"\n* * * * * * *\nQ And when you went in the polling booth, as I understand, the gentleman who was there was Mr. Parker? A. Yes, sir. Q. Who was there representing Mr. Colter, required you to be sworn? A. Yes, sir.\nThen Parker is called and he is examined by the counsel for the petitioner:\nQ. Were you there when Mr. Nixon, the last witness came to vote? A. Yes. Q. What took place? A. When he came in I said to the returning officer, I want this man sworn; Nixon said what is that for; he said I have voted here three or four times and you have never said anything; I said, well, I want you sworn; so he turned to go out\u2014the poll clerk and I am not sure whether others said to him. Q. The poll clerk\u2014who do you mean? A. Andrew Falls; that is the name he didn't remember; the poll clerk said don't go out; if you do you cannot come back again: so he turned and came back, and he said to me what is your objection to my vote, Mr. Parker; you have never objected to it before; and I replied I don't discuss voters' qualifications here, and I turned to the returning officer and says I require him sworn; so the returning officer took the book to swear him, and I said oath \"T,\" and I looked over and saw the returning officer was reading oath \"T\" to him, but still he hesitated. Q. Who did? A. Nixon the voter; so Harrison, the other scrutineer, said your vote is perfectly good, Tom; he said take the oath, Tom, take the oath; I will be responsible; so then he took the oath and voted. Q. What oath was read to him? A. Oath \"T,\" the farmers' sons' oath. Q. Did you have a copy of the oath? A. Yes, I had a copy of the act. Q. How did you know it was oath \"T\"? A. I just looked over it and could see it. Q. You followed the reading? A. I could see when he began to read what he was reading and I said oath \"T\" to the returning officer before he began. Q. And was this part of it, \"That I am resident with my father within this electoral district\"? A. Yes, sir, that is the last.\nOn cross-examination he says:\u2014\nQ. You turned to the returning officer and said what? A. I want him sworn. Q. Now what further? A. He hesitated again and Harrison said your vote is perfectly good. Tom, and he rose partly off his feet, he says take the oath, Tom, take the oath Tom, I will be responsible. Q. What did you say to that? A. Nothing. Q. Then what did you do? A. Went to the returning officer, took the book, I said oath \"T.\" Q. Thereby meaning? A. The farmer's sons' oath. Q. Then what did the returning officer do? A. He read the oath, read the farmer's sons' oath. Q. Did you hear him reading it? A. Yes.\nNow upon this evidence the learned judge found that Nixon had a good vote and concluded his adjudication on the charge as follows:\u2014\nNow, under those circumstances, can it be found that Mr. Harrison wilfully and corruptly induced Thomas Nixon to take a false oath in order that his vote, which was perfectly good without any false oath, might be put in? I think that such a finding would not be justified by the facts, and I find therefore that Mr. Harrison did not wilfully and corruptly induce this Thomas Nixon to take the oath which he did, and I dismiss that charge also.\nAs regards agency I am not clear that Harrison who was a mere scrutineer, and therefore an agent with a limited authority, was an agent for whose corrupt acts the respondent was according to the general law of elections answerable. But I will assume rather than admit that he was such an agent. We have then to consider the provisions of the law applicable to the case, and these are contained in secs. 90, 91 and 93 of the Dominion Elections Act.\nSec 90 enacts that:\nEvery candidate who corruptly, by himself, or by or with any other person on his behalf, compels or induces or endeavors to induce any person to personate any voter, or to take a false oath in any matter wherein an oath is required under this act, is guilty of a misdemeanor, &c.\nAnd sec. 91 declares that:\nThe offences of bribery, treating, or undue influence, or any of such offences, as defined by this or any other act of the Parliament of Canada, personation or the inducing any person to commit personation, or any wilful offence against any one of the seven sections of this act next preceding, are corrupt practices within the meaning of this act.\nAnd sec. 93:\nIf it is found by the report of any court, judge or other tribunal for the trial of election petitions, that any corrupt practice has been committed by any candidate at an election, or by his agent, whether with or without the actual knowledge and consent of such candidate, the election of such candidate if he has been elected shall be void.\nNow it is apparent that these provisions do apply to make the inducing a voter to take a false oath by an agent a corrupt practice avoiding the election, provided it is done (as required by section 90) \"corruptly,\" and (as required by sec. 91) \"wilfully.\"\nThen can it be said on the evidence that Harrison acted \"corruptly\" and \"wilfully?\"\u2014I am of opinion that it cannot. Supposing that Harrison was aware of the father's death, it appears to me that he acted in perfect good faith when, assuming very naturally, though in point of law I admit erroneously, that Nixon, registered as a farmer's son, did not lose his vote because he had become the actual owner of the property on which he had resided with his father, he encouraged him to take the oath appropriate to his actual status as a voter. That Harrison did or said, anything to induce Nixon to take oath \"T\" or any other particular form of oath is not proved. He is therefore to be regarded as having instigated Nixon only to take such an oath as was appropriate to his case. This I cannot hold to have been a wilful and corrupt inducement to take a false oath.\n2nd. Further Nixon was originally registered as a farmer's son and at the time he was registered it was true; his father died in April, 1886, and this election took place in 1887. There is no proof that Harrison knew that Nixon's father was dead, in which case oath \"T\" would have been the proper oath.\nI must hold, therefore, that the act was not a wilful one, was free from any corrupt intent, and I consequently agree in the conclusion of the learned judge at the trial that the charge was not proved.\nThere is another charge, that Allen, a scrutineer far the respondent, induced Dougherty, a voter to take a false oath. It occurred at polling place No. 3, in the township of Walpole.\nThis charge, in my opinion, wholly fails. The facte are that Dougherty removed from the house his father resided in into another house on the same farm, but that he occupied this last house as a caretaker or servant of his father, the possession being clearly in the father. Assuming that agency was proved, and that is a very considerable assumption for there is much doubt about it, I hold with the learned judge that the voter had a perfectly good vote and was able consistently with the truth to take the oath which was administered to him.\n3rd. As to the charge that the deputy returning officer at polling place No. 4, Oneida, put into the ballot box and counted ballots not duly received from electors and which is thus referred to in the notice of appeal:\n5. The charge that the deputy returning officer at polling subdivision No. 4 in the township of Oneida, put into the ballot box and counted ballots not duly received from the electors in the lawful performance of his duties as deputy returning officer at the said election.\nI am clear there is nothing in this case. It relates only to one ballot which could not affect the result of the election. Moreover the county judge on the recount made such an allowance in favor of the defeated candidate as afforded a sufficient remedy for any irregularity which the evidence establishes.\nAnother case is charge No. 6 in the notice of appeal, viz.:\nThe charge that the deputy returning officer at polling sub-division No. 2 in the township of Oneida, improperly marked ballots received by him at the said election, from electors before depositing the said ballots in the ballot box, and thereby prevented the said ballots from being counted at the said election, and the ruling of the learned judge, rejecting the evidence on behalf of the petitioner which was tendered by him at the trial in support of the said charge.\nNothing could be made of this charge without admitting the evidence of voters to show how they voted. This I hold cannot be done. To do so would, in my opinion, be a direct violation of the act which requires secrecy. Sec. of the Dominion Elections Act, enacts:\nNo person who has voted at an election shall, in any legal proceeding questioning the election or return, be required to state for whom he voted.\nIt is no answer to this to say that secrecy is imposed for the benefit of the voter and that he can waive it, for I hold secrecy to be imposed as an absolute rule of public policy, and that it cannot be waived. The whole purview of the law is different from the English act and from the Ontario act. I am of opinion, therefore, that the learned judge rightly rejected the evidence though I may not be able to agree with the grounds he put it upon. The next charge that is important is stated as follows in the notice of appeal:\u2014\n7. The charge that many persons voted at the said election who, for different reasons were not qualified to vote thereat, and the refusal of the learned judge at the trial to enquire into the right at the time of the election of any person to vote thereat, if the name of such person appeared on the list of voters as finally revised, and certified by the revising barrister and the rejection by the learned judge at the trial of the evidence tendered on behalf of the petitioner to establish that many persons who voted at the said election had, between the time of the final revision of the voters' lists by the revising barrister and the date of the said election, forfeited the right to vote thereat.\nThis principally relates to the case of farmers' sons whose votes were impeached. It appears to me that the evidence was, if admissible in other respects, material, inasmuch as if it were shewn that bad votes were received more in number than respondent's majority that would be sufficient to avoid the election. Then, as regards the qualification of farmer's sons, I think it clear that the registry was not conclusive, though as regards qualification founded on ownership it appears to be conclusive.\nI found this opinion on section 41, which is as follows:\n41. Subject to the provisions hereinafter contained all persons whose names are registered on the lists of voters for polling districts in any electoral district, in force under the provisions of \"The Electoral Franchise Act\" or of the act passed in the session held in 48th and 49th years of Her Majesty's reign and intituled \"An act respecting the Electoral Franchise\" on the day of the polling at any election for such electoral district, shall be entitled to vote at any such election for such electoral district and no other persons shall be entitled to vote thereat.\nread in conjunction with section 45 sub.-sec. 2 enacting that\nSuch elector, if required by the deputy returning officer, the poll clerk, one of the candidates or one of their agents, or by any elector present, shall, before receiving his ballot paper, take the oath of qualification in the form S, or in one of the forms T, U, V, or W, in the first schedule to this act, as the circumstance of the case require \u2014which oath the deputy returning officer and poll clerk are each hereby authorized to administer.\"\nAnd the last paragraph of oath \"T\"\nThat I am resident with my father within this electoral district, and that I have not been absent from such residence for more than six months since I was placed on the said list of voters.\nNow I contend that the proper construction of these provisions is that no one is to vote who has not the qualification arising out of a continuous residence subsequent to registration, for I say that sec. 41 is subject to the exception afterwards contained in sec 45, sec. 2, which, by requiring the oath of qualification, makes, in my opinion, the fact of the continuance of the qualification, stated in the last paragraph of oath \"T,\" of residence with the father essential as a preliminary to the right to vote. It is true that it makes the oath sufficient evidence for the purpose of authorizing the reception of the vote, but it does not, in my opinion, make it conclusive evidence, and therefore on a scrutiny further enquiry is admissible, and if it is shewn that a larger number of bad votes than the majority were admitted the election ought to be set aside, though the seat could not, of course, be awarded, inasmuch as no voter can be asked how he voted. Stowe v. Jolliffe[32] does not apply. The registry there was conclusive, here it is not.\nTherefore it appearing that evidence duly tendered at the trial was improperly rejected, there should be further enquiry and the witnesses whose evidence was so rejected should be examined pursuant to sec. 51 ss. 3 of the Controverted Elections Act[33], and the appeal should be ordered to stand over for that purpose.\nFOURNIER J.\u2014La p\u00e9tition se plaignant de l'\u00e9lection de l'intim\u00e9 contient les all\u00e9gations ordinaires de corruption et all\u00e8gue en outre que des bulletins ont \u00e9t\u00e9 admis et rejet\u00e9s ill\u00e9galement ainsi que beaucoup d'autres irr\u00e9gularit\u00e9s, et conclut \u00e0 l'annulation de l'\u00e9lection.\nSur les trente-neuf accusations de men\u00e9es corruptrices contenues dans les particularit\u00e9s, l'enqu\u00eate a eu lieu dans un grand nombre de cas, et a \u00e9t\u00e9 abandonn\u00e9e dans plusieurs autres. L'intim\u00e9 avait donn\u00e9 avis qu'il proc\u00e9derait \u00e0 la preuve sur des accusations r\u00e9criminatoires. Mais la p\u00e9tition ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9e en entier, il ne s'est pas trouv\u00e9 dans l'obligation de proc\u00e9der sur ces charges.\nParmi les accusations rejet\u00e9es par l'honorable juge Street qui a pr\u00e9sid\u00e9 au proc\u00e8s et au sujet desquelles il y a appel, se trouve la huiti\u00e8me qui est \u00e9nonc\u00e9e dans les termes suivants:\n80. Frederick Harrison, a resident of the township of Walpole, an agent of the respondent did, at polling station number six, in the township of Walpole, induce Thomas Nixon, a resident of the township of Walpole, to take a false oath at the poll and to vote at the said election, although not qualified to do so.\nLa preuve de cette accusation faite par Thomas Nixon le voteur lui-m\u00eame et par William Parker, l'agent de l'autre candidat, W. Colter, est si compl\u00e8te, qu'elle ne laisse aucun doute sur l'existence du fait imput\u00e9.\nNixon s'\u00e9tant pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 pour voter, Parker, l'agent de Colter, le requit de pr\u00eater serment; il s'en plaignit, mais la demande ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9it\u00e9r\u00e9e, il fit quelques pas pour sortir du poll. Changeant subitement d'id\u00e9e, il revint sur ses pas et se plaignit de nouveau de ce que l'agent exigeait de lui le serment de qualification. L'agent Parker ayant encore insist\u00e9, le d\u00e9put\u00e9-officier rapporteur commen\u00e7a \u00e0 lire la formule du serment de qualification pour les voteurs enregistr\u00e9s sur la liste des fils de fermiers. Nixon h\u00e9sitait encore, lorsque Harrison, l'agent du membre si\u00e9geant se levant \u00e0 demi, interrompit l'officier rapporteur en disant au voteur:\nYour vote is perfectly good, Tom, take the oath, Tom, take the oath; I will be responsible.\nImm\u00e9diatement apr\u00e8s ces paroles, Nixon fit le serment requis et vota. Les m\u00eames faits sont aussi prouv\u00e9s par Wm. Parker, de la mani\u00e8re la plus positive. Dans son t\u00e9moignage, Nixon dit \u00e0 propos de l'intervention de Harrison, que ce dernier voyant l'objection \u00e0 son vote insista \u00e0 ce qu'il fit serment.\nHarrison insisted that I should take the oath. He said my vote was perfectly good. That was all, I took his word and went and voted.\nLe serment pr\u00eat\u00e9 par Nixon est celui de la formule T. concernant les fils de fermiers, se terminant par la d\u00e9claration:\nThat I am resident with my father within this electoral District, and that I have not been absent from such residence more than six months since I was placed on the list of voters, &c., &c.\nL'agence de Harrison est prouv\u00e9e. Il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 sp\u00e9cialement nomm\u00e9 par \u00e9crit pour repr\u00e9senter l'intim\u00e9 \u00e0 ce poll. Il \u00e9tait de son devoir de prot\u00e9ger les int\u00e9r\u00eats de l'intim\u00e9 en r\u00e9sistant \u00e0 des objections non fond\u00e9es qui auraient pu emp\u00eacher des voteurs de donner leurs votes en faveur de son candidat. Mais celle qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 prise contre Nixon \u00e9tait bien fond\u00e9e. Port\u00e9 sur la liste des voteurs comme fils de fermier, demeurant avec son p\u00e8re, il avait, lors de son vote perdu depuis longtemps sa qualification de voteur, par le d\u00e9c\u00e8s de son p\u00e8re. Il avait aussi laiss\u00e9 la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 sur laquelle il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 qualifi\u00e9 lorsqu'il demeurait avec son p\u00e8re, pour aller demeurer avec une de ces s\u0153urs sur une autre propri\u00e9t\u00e9. Il n'\u00e9tait enregistr\u00e9 comme voteur qu'en qualit\u00e9 de fils de fermier et en aucune autre qualit\u00e9, sur aucune autre liste. C'est ainsi qu'il a vot\u00e9. Le serment qu'il a pr\u00eat\u00e9 qu'il \u00e9tait r\u00e9sident dans le district \u00e9lectoral avec son p\u00e8re \u00e9tait \u00e9videmment faux et tout-\u00e0-fait contraire \u00e0 la v\u00e9rit\u00e9. Il donne lui-m\u00eame la date du d\u00e9c\u00e8s de son p\u00e8re dans son t\u00e9moignage comme ayant eu lieu le 4 avril 1886. Sa m\u00e8re \u00e9tait morte depuis environ dix ans. Il n'a pas pr\u00eat\u00e9 le serment sans beaucoup d'h\u00e9sitation, comme on l'a vu par son propre r\u00e9cit. Sans l'insistance de Harrison, il est clair qu'il serait retourn\u00e9 sans voter. Ses h\u00e9sitations sont faciles \u00e0 comprendre, il lui r\u00e9pugnait sans doute beaucoup de faire le serment qu'il r\u00e9sidait avec son p\u00e8re mort depuis 19 mois. Mais press\u00e9 par Harrison, son voisin qui savait aussi bien que lui la mort de son p\u00e8re, et qui, d'apr\u00e8s sa mani\u00e8re de lui adresser la parole, semble \u00eatre avec lui sur un pied de familiarit\u00e9 intime, il a fini par se laisser persuader qu'il n'y avait pas de mal \u00e0 faire ce serment; il a pu tout probablement se croire d\u00e9gag\u00e9 en conscience de toute responsabilit\u00e9 par le ton persuasif et la persistance de Harrison \u00e0 lui r\u00e9p\u00e9ter que son vote \u00e9tait bon et \u00e0 lui dire de voter, qu'il prenait tout sur sa responsabilit\u00e9. Sans l'intervention de Harrison, il e\u00fbt sans doute suivi sa premi\u00e8re pens\u00e9e de s'en aller sans voter; \u00e9videmment ce vote n'est d\u00fb qu'\u00e0 la pression exerc\u00e9e sur Nixon par Harrison. Ce dernier ne pouvait certainement pas \u00eatre de bonne foi lorsqu'il agissait ainsi, il ne pouvait ignorer la mort du p\u00e8re de Nixon dont une des propri\u00e9t\u00e9s adjoignait la sienne. Dans tous les cas puisqu'il prenait sur lui d'affirmer la validit\u00e9 du vote, tandis qu'il \u00e9tait clairement ill\u00e9gal, sa conduite a eu l'effet de rendre l'intim\u00e9 responsable des cons\u00e9quences de son action. S'il ignorait la v\u00e9ritable position de Nixon fils, il aurait d\u00fb s'en informer avant d'en parler avec autant d'assurance qu'il l'a fait. Comme tant d'autres, il a mis plus de z\u00e8le que de discr\u00e9tion dans l'exercice de ses fonctions comme agent et son principal doit malheureusement en supporter les cons\u00e9quences.\nHarrison s'est donc en connaissance de cause rendu coupable du fait d'induire Nixon \u00e0 faire un faux serment. L'offense qu'il a ainsi commise est d\u00e9finie comme suit par la section 90 de l'acte des \u00e9lections, d\u00e9clarant: That every candidate who corruptly by himself, or by any other person on his behalf, induces or endeavors to induce any person to take any false oath in any matter wherein an oath is required under the Act, is guilty of a misdemeanor.\nPar la section suivante, 91me, il est d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que\nAny wilful offence against any one of the seven sections of this Act next preceding, are corrupt practices within the meaning of this Act.\nLe fait d'avoir induit Nixon \u00e0 faire un faux serment est clairement, d'apr\u00e8s ces sections, une men\u00e9e corruptrice commise par un agent de l'intim\u00e9, et a eu en cons\u00e9quence l'effet d'affecter la l\u00e9galit\u00e9 de l'\u00e9lection.\nDans la section 90, le mot corruptly ne signifie pas d'une mani\u00e8re absolue que l'acte, qualifi\u00e9 ainsi, a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait dans un but immoral, malhonn\u00eate ou avec malice. Ce mot y est plut\u00f4t employ\u00e9 pour signifier que l'acte vis\u00e9 par cette expression est une violation de la prohibition du statut \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard[34]. Il n'\u00e9tait pas n\u00e9cessaire de faire la preuve que Harrison, en agissant comme il l'a fait, avait une intention malhonn\u00eate et immorale. Toutefois il n'a pas offert son serment pour expliquer ses recommandations. Cependant l'opinion de l'honorable juge a \u00e9t\u00e9 que la preuve de l'intention de Harrison aurait d\u00fb \u00eatre faite, mais elle est contraire \u00e0 l'interpr\u00e9tation adopt\u00e9e par les autorit\u00e9s suivantes:\nAll the judges have considered that the word 'corruptly'..... means, with the object and intention of doing that thing which the statute intended to forbid. It does not mean corrupt in the sense in which you may look upon a man as being a knave or a villain.\nPer Mr. Justice Blackburn in The North Norfolk Case[35].\nAnd in discussing the meaning of the word in considering whether treating had or had not been done corruptly, Mr. Justice Blackburn says, \"the point to be considered is, Was it given with an intent to influence the election?\"\nThe Wallingford Case[36].\nThe word 'corruptly' means contrary to the intention of this Act, with a motive or intention by means of it to produce an effect upon the election. Per Mr. Justice Blackburn in The Hereford Case[37].\nThis language is quoted with approval by Mr. Justice Mellor in The Launceston Case[38].\nAnd by Mr. Baron Dowse in The Carrickfergus Case[39].\nSee also, on the same subject, The Louth Case[40].\nHarrison connaissait parfaitement l'objection faite \u00e0 Nixon, il avait entendu Parker demander l'administration du serment suivant la formule T. au sujet du fils de fermier; il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 t\u00e9moin des h\u00e9sitations de Nixon, mais sa crainte de perdre un vote pour l'intim\u00e9 le dominait tellement, qu'il a exerc\u00e9 toute la pression dont il \u00e9tait capable sur ce jeune homme pour l'engager \u00e0 pr\u00eater un serment faux. Non seulement Harrison avait l'intention d'assurer un vote \u00e0 son candidat, mais il y a mis de la persistance et l'a obtenu au moyen d'un serment faux. Il est inutile d'en dire davantage pour prouver que l'acte de Harrison a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait volontairement et non par inadvertance. Il a manifest\u00e9 sa volont\u00e9 assez souvent et n'a d\u00fb son succ\u00e8s qu'\u00e0 ses efforts r\u00e9it\u00e9r\u00e9s. Quels que soient les motifs qu'on lui suppose son acte a \u00e9t\u00e9 au moins wilful dans le sens d'intentionnel, tel qu'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 par cette cour dans la cause de l'\u00e9lection de Selkirk, Young v. Smith[41].\nJe suis en cons\u00e9quence d'avis que pour ce seul fait de Harrison l'\u00e9lection doit \u00eatre annul\u00e9e et l'appel maintenu avec d\u00e9pens.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014I am of opinion that this election should be annulled on the Harrison-Nixon charge, at No.\u00fb 6 Walpole polling division.\nThe facts relating to this charge are as follows:\nThomas Nixon voted at the election. His name was on the voters' list as a farmer's son and not in any other capacity. He is an unmarried man, living with. his sister, on the property in respect of which he voted; his mother died some years ago, his father also at the time of the election, had been dead a little more than 19 months.\nNixon's post-office is Hagersville, and he has lived on the place ever since he was born.\nThe respondent's agent at this polling place was Frederick Harrison, whose post-office is also Hagersville, and who appears assessed as owner of the next farm to Nixon, in the adjoining concession.\nWhen Nixon came to vote, one of the scrutineers at the poll required that he should be sworn; Nixon expostulated, but the demand was repeated, and Nixon thereupon turned to go out, but came back and again remonstrated with the scrutineer, and was again met with the demand that he be sworn.\nThe deputy returning officer began to read to him the form of oath for persons registered on the list as farmers' sons, but Nixon still hesitated, when Harrison, partly rising off his feet and interrupting, said: \"Your vote is perfectly good, Tom; take the oath, Tom, take the oath; I will be responsible,\" and thereupon Nixon took the farmers' sons' oath and voted.\nNixon states in his account of what took place, that on his vote being challenged Harrison \"insisted that I should take the oath He said my vote was perfectly good. That was all; I took his word and went and voted.\"\nOn these facts the petitioner alleges that the said Harrison, an agent of the respondent, induced or endeavored to induce the said Thomas Nixon to take a false oath when tendering his vote at the polls and was thereby guilty of a corrupt practice under the Dominion Elections Act, sec. 90 which provides that every candidate who corruptly by himself, or by any other person on his behalf, induces or endeavors to induce any person to take any false oath in any matter wherein an oath is required under the act, is guilty of a misdemeanor, and sec. 91 by which any wilful offence against the preceding section is made a corrupt practice within the meaning of the act. As to the facts there can hardly be any dispute.\nFirst, as to Harrison's agency, there is no room for doubt. He was specially appointed by the respondent in writing to represent him at this poll, and it was in the course of his duty as such representative of the respondent that he interfered to have Harrison's vote taken.\n2nd. The oath which Nixon took was unquestionably taken in a matter wherein the statute required an oath to be taken. One of Colter's scrutineers requiring it, Nixon could not get a ballot paper without taking the oath, and the farmers' sons' oath, he being on the list as such, was the only one that could be administered to him as was shown.\n3rd. It is as conclusively established that the oath he took was a false one. He swears that he was then resident with his father within this electoral district; yet his father had been dead nearly two years.\n4th. Harrison induced Nixon to take the oath. In fact, he would not have taken it, it is plain from the evidence, if Harrison had not interfered to induce him to do so. He says that Harrison insisted he should take the oath, and he said \"my vote was perfectly good. I took his word and went and voted.\"\nNow, was this act of Harrison a wilful act and one corruptly done within the meaning of the Elections Act? It is settled law that the word \"corruptly\" as used in sec. 90 of the Elections Act does not mean \"wickedly, immorally or dishonestly,\" neither can it mean \"consciously\" or with intent to commit an offence. The word means, as per Lord Cranworth, in Cooper v. Slade[42], \"in violation of that which this statute was passed to prohibit.\"\nHere Harrison's object and intention is manifest. He heard the objection raised to Nixon's vote; he knew the point of the objection, as the scrutineer who objected had also stated the particular form of oath which he demanded to be administered, viz:\u2014that for a farmer's son not claiming the benefit of the provisions as to occasional absence; he had seen Nixon in the first place turn away unwilling to take the oath; he saw him then hesitating; the voter was a young man; Harrison was manifestly alarmed lest a vote should be lost to the respondent if something was not promptly done to reassure the voter and encourage him into taking the oath; he hastened to assume the responsibility of what he was urging Nixon to do; he heard the oath read containing the averment of residence with the father, but said not a word to retract or modify the urgency of his previous language; he manifestly acted with the object and intention of securing the vote at all hazards, even though it was necessary that the untrue oath should first be taken.\nHe could not have believed that Nixon's father was living; and the respondent did not attempt to bring him in the witness box to swear to that belief. He lives in the same place as Nixon, and is the owner of a farm next to Nixon, in the adjoining concession. He knows him intimately as is evidenced by the familiar way in which he addresses him \"take the oath, Tom, take the oath?\"\nThis with the fact of his not coming forward to swear the contrary cannot but create a strong presumption that he knew of Nixon's father's death. But even without this knowledge, the corrupt act is proved. He induced Nixon to knowingly, wilfully and corruptly take a false oath required by the act, for he must have known that the farmer's son's oath was the only one that Nixon could give so as to vote. This is what the act in plain terms declares to be a corrupt practice. And the scienter of Harrison is immaterial. If an agent assumes recklessly to induce a voter to take an oath without previously ascertaining or taking any steps to ascertain whether that oath will be true or not, and the oath turns out to be a false one, I think it clear that this agent has committed the offence created by section 90 of the statute. He has procured a vote, which, without that false oath, could not have been recorded. He has consequently acted \"in violation of that which the statute was passed to prohibit.\" To say that Harrison's scienter was necessary to complete the offence, is to say that he must have been guilty of subornation of perjury. Now it is, as I read the section, something more than subornation of perjury that Parliament has legislated against, another and different offence that it has created. And I cannot see that the fact that the statute has declared this to be a misdemeanor makes any difference. No mens rea, no scienter, is necessary where a statute prohibits the very act that has been done, neither is ignorantia juris or ignorantia facti an excuse. In R. v. Prince[43] for instance, the defendant having been found guilty of abducting a girl under 16 the court held the conviction right, although the jury had found that the prisoner reasonably believed the girl to have been 18. In R. v. Bishop[44], also it was held that under a statute which prohibits the receiving of lunatics in a house not licensed, the owner of a house who had received lunatics was guilty of the offence enacted by the statute, though the jury found that he believed honestly and on reasonable grounds that the persons received were not lunatics.\nThese cases show that ignorance of fact is no excuse where the act is prohibited by the statute, and go further even than it is necessary to do in to the the present case. So under a statute imposing a penalty for having adulterated tobacco the defendant was held liable to the penalty, although he did not know that he had such tobacco in his possession. R. v. Woodrow[45]. I also refer to Atty. Gen. v. Lockwood[46], R. V. Marsh[47].\nIn Cundy v. Lecocq[48] Stephen J. said:\u2014\nI do not think that the maxim as to the mens rea has so wide an application as it is sometimes considered to have; in old times and as applicable to the common law or to earlier statutes, the maxim may have been of general application, but a difference has arisen owing to the greater precision of modern statutes. It is impossible now to apply the maxim generally to all statutes, and it is necessary to look at the object of each act to see whether and how far knowledge is of the essence of the offence created.\nI refer also to the case of Young v. Smith[49], in this court, and to The State v. Perkins[50].\nIn Mierelles v. Banning[51], the word \"knowingly\" was in the statute as an ingredient of the offence there charged, and consequently the case has no application here. This word \"knowingly\" has no doubt purposely been left out of the clauses of the Elections act which declare what will be corrupt practices.\nAs to the offence being wilful, I need only refer to the case of Young v. Smith (5), in this court, hereinbefore cited. Harrison wilfully induced Nixon to take the oath, that oath was false; this constitutes a wilful offence in the sense of the election act. If a man wilfully does an act which the statute declares to be an offence, he is guilty of an offence against the statute. See R v. Holroyd[52], and Hudson v. McCrae[53].\nI may notice that what the act declares illegal is the inducing to take a false oath. It does not say, \"inducing to commit perjury.\" So that if the oath is a false one, whether the party taking it knew it to be so or not, the inciting to take it would appear to fall under this act. Nothing in this case, however, turns upon this.\nAs to the petitioner's claim for the seat, it must be dismissed.\nThe evidence of thirty-six voters to show that they had voted for Colter at polling division, No. 2, Oneida, was properly held not admissible by the learned judge at the trial.\nHad the learned judge permitted the enquiry to have been prosecuted as the petitioner desired, it would have in effect disclosed not merely how those willing to tell had voted, but practically how every man at the poll had voted, because if out of one hundred votes fifty are found to have voted for A. and fifty for B and the fifty who voted for A. are called and expressing their willingness to tell, do tell that they voted for him, it at once becomes known who the fifty were who voted for B., although they may be most unwilling that that fact should be disclosed. It would be interfering, therefore, with the overriding principle prevailing throughout the Ballot Act, and which embodies a great public policy, had the learned judge permitted the evidence to be given.\nThe evidence tendered by the petitioner to prove that a certain number of farmers' sons who had voted had no right to vote was also properly declared inadmissible. The list coupled with the oath, when the oath is required, is conclusive as to their right to vote.\nThe other irregularities complained of on this appeal could not affect the result of the case, in the view I take of it.\nThe appeal should, in my opinion, be allowed with costs and the election set aside. GWYNNE J.\u2014The scrutiny of ballots having resulted in leaving unaffected the right of the respondent in the election petition to retain the seat the only material points upon which, in view of the judgment arrived at by the majority of the court, it is necessary for me to express any opinion, are the two charges of corrupt practices made in connection with the cases of Thomas Nixon and Robert Dougherty.\nThese charges were as follows:\n1. Frederick Harrison, a resident of the township of Walpole, an agent of the respondent did, at polling station number six in the township of Walpole, induce Thomas Nixon, a resident of the township of Walpole, to take a false oath at the poll, and to vote at said election though not qualified to do so.\n2nd. Stephen Allen, a resident of the township of Walpole. an agent of the respondent, did on the 12th day of November, A.D., 1887, induce Robert Dougherty to take a false oath at polling station number three in the township of Walpole, though said Robert Dougherty was not qualified to vote at said election.\nThese charges are based wholly upon sections 90 and 91 of the Dominion Elections Act, 49 Vic., ch. 8. These sections are as follows[54]:\u2014\nBefore enquiring into the evidence adduced in support of these charges, it will be well to determine first what is the true construction of this section 90 and what is the nature of the offence therein pointed at under the words \"induce any person to take a false \"oath in any matter wherein an oath is required \"under this act\" and how it can be committed and proved.\nBy the Dominion Act, 49 Vic. ch. 154 of the Revised Statutes of Canada which is a consolidation of, and substitution for, the 1st, 2nd, 6th and 7th sections of the Dominion Statute 32\u201333 Vic. ch. 23, and the 1st sec. of 33 Vic. ch. 26 it is, among other things, enacted that\nEvery person who (having taken an oath, affirmation, declaration or affidavit in any case in which by any act or law in force in Canada or in any Province of Canada it is required, or authorised, that facts, matters or things be verified or otherwise assured or ascertained, by or upon the oath, affirmation, declaration or affidavit of any person) wilfully and corruptly upon such oath, affirmation, declaration or affidavit swears or makes any false statement as to any such fact, matter or thing, is guilty of wilful and corrupt perjury and liable to be punished accordingly.\nA false oath to constitute perjury at common law must be taken in a judicial proceeding before a competent jurisdiction, but the taking a false oath before a person competent and authorized to administer it, although the oath be not in a judicial proceeding, is a misdemeanor at common law, though perjury cannot be assigned upon such an oath unless it be under the provision of some statute[55], but the above statute, ch. 154 of the Revised Statutes, does make the taking a false oath in any case which, by any act or law in force in Canada, it is required or authorized that any fact, matter or thing be verified upon oath to be perjury; so that it is clear that perjury can be assigned upon and for the taking of a false oath in any matter wherein an oath is required under the Dominion Elections Act, and the procuring or suborning any person to take any such false oath is a misdemeanor and punishable as such wholly independently of the 90th section of the said Dominion Elections Act. The punishment for such offences is provided by the above ch. 154 of the revised statutes which enacts as follows:\u2014\nEvery one who commits perjury or subornation of perjury is guilty of a misdemeanor and liable to a fine in the discretion of the court and to 14 years imprisonment.\nNow the 90th sec. of the Elections Act does not create any new offence or constitute that to be a misdemeanor which was not already a misdemeanor independently of the section; what it points at is, as appears plainly by the language of the section, an act which is already recognized by law to be a misdemeanor, to which offence punishment is by law already annexed, and the object of the section is to add to such punishment, a further punishment namely\u2014that the person who is guilty of the misdemeanor of corruptly inducing or endeavoring to induce any person to take any false oath in any matter wherein an oath is required under the act, in addition to any other punishment to which he is liable for such offence, shall forfeit the sum of $200 to any person who sues for the same; and the 91st sec. makes the wilful committal of the offence specified in the 90th sec. a corrupt practice under the provisions of the Election Act, so as not only to avoid the election of the candidate who may be guilty of the offence, but to disqualify such candidate for the period of seven years from being capable of being elected to the House of Commons and of sitting therein, or of voting at any election of a member of that House, or of holding any office in the nomination of the crown, or of the Governor General of Canada.\nBefore a judge sitting without a jury, as he does upon an election petition, finds any one guilty of an offence to which such extremely penal consequences are annexed, he should be, and on an appeal from his decision this court should be, well assured of the true construction of the sections of the acts under consideration, and that the offence to which such penal consequences are annexed has been clearly established by evidence no less sufficient than would be required to justify a conviction by a jury upon an indictment for the offence.\nNow, as to the construction of the secs. 90 and 91, it is expressly provided by them taken together that the offence of inducing a person to take the false oath referred to therein consists in wilfully and corruptly, (in the sense that those words are used in an indictment for subornation for perjury) inducing a person to take an oath in a matter wherein an oath is required to be taken by any act of the Dominion of Canada, false swearing in which oath is by the before herein mentioned ch. 154 of the revised statutes of Canada made a misdemeanor for which the person taking the oath might be indicted for and convicted of perjury.\nNow the offence of wilfully and corruptly inducing or procuring any person to take such an oath is the misdemeanor known in law as subornation of perjury, to the complete perpetration of which offence knowledge of the falsity by the person accused is essential; and this is the law also in the case of an indictment for the misdemeanor of procuring or inducing another to take a false oath, upon which perjury could not be assigned, both misdemeanors as to the elements constituting the offence standing precisely on the same footing. Formerly it was necessary to be expressly averred in the indictment, but now if the party who is charged with having corruptly induced Nixon to take the oath which he did take was indicted for that offence, it would be sufficient to set out the substance of the offence in the manner prescribed by the 108th sec. of ch. 154 of the revised statutes, which is, verbatim, identical with the 21st sec. of the Imperial Statute 14\u201315 Vic. ch. 100 and enacts that:\nIn every indictment for subornation of perjury or contracting with any person to commit wilful and corrupt perjury or for inciting causing or procuring any person unlawfully, wilfully, falsely, fraudulently, deceitfully, maliciously or corruptly to take, make, sign or subscribe any oath, affirmation, declaration, affidavit, deposition, bill, answer, notice, certificate or other writing, it shall be sufficient whenever such perjury or other offence aforesaid has been actually committed to allege the offence of the person who actually committed such perjury or other offence in the manner hereinbefore mentioned, and then to allege that the defendant unlawfully, wilfully and corruptly did cause and procure the said person to do and commit the said offence in manner and form aforesaid; and whenever such perjury or other offence aforesaid has not actually been committed, it shall be sufficient to set forth the substance of the offence charged upon the defendant without setting forth or averring any of the matters or things hereinbefore rendered unnecessary to be set forth or averred in the case of wilful and corrupt perjury.\nThat is to say without setting forth the bill, answer, information, indictment, declaration or any part of any proceeding either in law or equity, and without setting forth the commission or authority of the court or person before whom such offence was committed.\nUpon an indictment for subornation, since the passing of 14\u201315 Vic. ch. 100, it is as necessary as it was before that it should be proved\u20141st. that perjury had been committed by the person who took the oath and unless that be proved the defendant cannot be convicted of the subornation. Secondly, the subornation or previous inducement or procurement to commit that offence\u2014that is to say, it must be proved that the defendant solicited or procured the person who took the oath to take it, knowing the same to be false, or that by taking it the party so doing would be committing perjury[56].\nNow, that any person can be pronounced by a judge sitting upon the trial of an election petition to have been guilty of an offence of this nature upon less evidence than would be required upon the trial of an indictment for the same offence before a jury, is a proposition which neither in law or justice or common sense can, in my opinion, be entertained.\nThat a judge without a jury should be authorized to try a charge of an offence of this nature is a sufficiently grave departure from the ordinary rule that no one can be convicted of a criminal offence, especially one so seriously affecting his civil rights and liberty, except by a jury; we cannot, however, extend by construction the penal character of the act so as to hold that it justifies an adjudication of guilt unless it be established by as complete and sufficient evidence as would be required on a trial before a jury.\nNow as to the evidence adduced in support of the charge. Nixon himself was called upon behalf of the petitioner and also a Mr. Parker, who acted as scrutineer for the candidate in whose interest the petition was filed, at the polling place where Nixon voted. The material evidence given by him and by Parker on his cross-examination which, where it differs from that as taken down upon his examination in chief, appears to me to be more reliable, in short substance is, that when Nixon came forward to get his ballot paper Mr. Parker said to him that he required him to be sworn, upon which Nixon turned towards Parker and said to him, \"what is your objection to my voting, Mr. Parker, I have been here several times and you never questioned it before?\" To which Parker replied that he did not discuss voters' qualifications there, and turning to the returning officer said, \"I want him sworn;\" at this point Harrison intervened and said, \"your vote is perfectly good, Tom.\" Nixon swears that all that Harrison said to him was,\u2014your vote is a good one or perfectly good, he repeated several times that this was all the insisting he did\u2014all that he said or at least that he Nixon heard\u2014that otherwise Harrison never spoke to him upon the subject of his vote either then or previously\u2014that he, Nixon, had never heard that his right to vote was doubted, and that he had not any expectation that his vote would be objected to or that he would be required to be sworn.\nParker admits that he did not state what was his objection to Nixon's Voting although asked by Nixon what it was, and that he knew that since the death of Nixon's father (which occurred in April, 1886, while the election took place in Nov., 1887), he Nixon was the owner of the property in respect of which he was upon the voters' list with the description added of farmer's son, and upon which he had resided all his life; he says, however, that when Harrison said to Nixon that the vote of the latter was perfectly good, he added, \"take the oath, Tom, I will be responsible.\" Nixon swears that if Harrison said this he did not hear it, and he denies that to his knowledge Harrison did make use of this expression. Upon this contradiction, if it be material whether in point of fact Harrison did or not make use of these words, they cannot, upon a charge of this nature, be regarded as proved to have been used by him. If the words were used, as Nixon swears that he never heard them, they could not have operated upon his mind to induce him to take the oath he might be required to take or did take; and so, unless the substance of the offence charged is to be wholly disregarded, because it is alleged to have been committed at an election, and the accused is to be convicted on a mere technicality, it becomes immaterial whether the words were used or not, if the person to whom they are alleg-to have been addressed by way of inducement to get him to take a false oath never heard them. Hereupon Parker called upon the deputy returning officer to administer the oath \"T\"; whether Nixon heard Parker say to the returning officer that the oath \"T\" was the one he should administer, or that Nixon had any knowledge of the matters contained in such oath there is no evidence. No reference had been made to the contents of the oath or as to what Nixon would have to swear\u2014an oath was administered which Parker says was the oath \"T,\" and now we see exposed the gist of the charge and the point of objection to Nixon's vote becomes developed; an objection which does not appear to have been in the mind of any one but Mr. Parker, at the election, and which he studiously suppressed.\nNixon in his father's lifetime was registered on the voters' list as a voter in the character of farmer's son. His father died in April, 1886, his mother had died 8 or 9 years previously. Upon his father's death Nixon became owner of the property upon which his father in his lifetime resided and upon which Nixon himself had resided all his life, and was still residing at the time of the election in November 1887. Nixon swears that at the time of the election, in November 1887, he did not know in what character he was entered upon the voters' list then in use, namely, whether as farmer's son or as owner. We have seen that the point was not alluded to at the election. Now the oath, T., assuming it to have been, as Mr. Parker swears it was, the oath administered, in its last paragraph contains these words\u2014\"with my father\" which if they had been omitted when the oath was being administered, every syllable in the oath could have been sworn by Nixon with the most perfect truth, and laying out of consideration all question as to whether the deputy returning officer would have been justified or authorized in omitting them if he had known all the facts of the case, the oath with these words left out would have been in conformity with the circumstances and facts of the case as they in truth existed, and if they had not been omitted but Nixon had never heard them he never could be convicted of having taken a false oath, such offence involving, as of necessity it must, knowledge of the falsity and a deliberate intention to take the oath with such knowledge; so that upon this ground alone the charge against Harrison must fail. Upon this point Nixon in substance swears that to his knowledge and belief these words \"with my father\" or the words\u2014\"I am residing with my father\" were not in the oath that he took\u2014that he has no remembrance of hearing anything of the kind.\nWith the greatest deference I must express my dissent from the doctrine that upon a charge of the grave nature of the misdemeanor charged here there is to be any presumption that the officer who presided at the election did or did not administer the right oath or did or did not omit any part of it. The charge is one of a grave misdemeanor charged against the agent and upon such a charge nothing is, in my opinion, to be presumed. The maxim omnia pr\u00e6sumuntur rite esse acta does not, in my opinion, apply to supply any defect in evidence adduced for the purpose of establishing the commission of the misdemeanor. Everything must be clearly proved which constitutes the perfection of the offence, and neither the agent nor the candidate is called upon to prove anything. I can see no reason whatever in principle why this offence should be established on less conclusive evidence than on an indictment, and any imperfection or insufficiency in the evidence enures to the benefit of the person accused who must be acquitted of the charge if not conclusively proved. But independently of this and confining myself to the charge of corrupt inducement made by Harrison to procure Nixon to take the oath, I confess that I am unable to perceive upon what possible foundation that charge could in reason and common sense be maintained. There was no evidence offered that Harrison had any knowledge of the true facts of the case. And assuming him to have known them as they now appear to have been, but which do not seem to have been alluded to by any one at the election, it seems to me a perversion of language to attribute the epithet \"corruptly\" to the opinion given by Harrison that Nixon's vote was perfectly good, even if that opinion had been supplemented by the expression, \"take the oath Tom, &c., &c.,\" as testified by Mr. Parker. This gentleman appears to have been of opinion, that although Nixon had a good vote while his father lived he ceased to have a vote when, by his father's death, he became absolute owner of the property upon which, in his father's life time, they had both resided. Harrison may, I think, be excused if he entertained, although it might be erroneously, a different opinion.\nThe point, indeed, is one upon which lawyers, much less laymen, might differ without justly subjecting those who might be of opinion that Nixon had a good vote, under the circumstances, to the imputation of corruption in expressing that opinion. In his father's life time he was upon the voters' list as a voter in the character of a farmer's son. By the Dominion Franchise Act he could have been upon the list as a farmer's son only in the event of his not being otherwise qualified to vote in the electoral district in which his father's farm is situate. 49 Vic. ch. 5 sec. 3 ss. 7. The father died on the 4th April, 1886, and although upon his death the son became absolute owner and sole occupant of the property upon which he had, in his father's lifetime, resided with his father, as the assessment takes place between the 15th February and the 30th April, the father may have been assessed for the property in that year before his death, so that the revising officer may have had no opportunity of correcting the voters' list in that year; but in 1887 the son was the sole occupant of the property and the only person who was assessable for it, and as owner and occupant. He had a right therefore to remain on the voters' list in 1887, though not as a farmer's son. His name could not have been removed from the list. He was qualified to be upon it as owner of the property, he was in point of fact on it, though not described as owner, but he could not have been removed from the list, although the character in which he was entitled that his name should remain there was changed. Provision is made for such a case by section 16 of the Electoral Franchise Act, which enacts:\u2014\nThe revising officer shall not remove the name of any person on the list of voters, from such list, on the ground that the qualification of such person is incorrectly entered thereon, if it appears that such person is entitled to be registered on the list of voters as possessed of any of the qualifications set forth in the act, but the revising officer shall retain the name of such person on the list and correct the same accordingly.\nAt the time of the election in Nov., 1887, Nixon's right then was to be on the voters' list in the character of owner, and if not on the list in that character that was the fault of the officials upon whom were imposed by the law the duties necessary to be discharged in order to ensure that the voters' list should be correct. Now by the act 49 Vic. ch. 8, sec. 41\u2014all persons whose names are registered on the list of voters in force on the day of the polling at any election shall be entitled to vote at such election. The act does not say that he shall be entitled to vote only in the character in which he is described, and it may be erroneously described, on the list. By sec. 45 of this same act if his name is on the list he is entitled to demand and receive a ballot paper, and the only restraint upon the right which is imposed by the statute is that if required he shall take a vote of qualification in the form S. or in the forms T. U. V. or W. in the first schedule of the act mentioned, as the circumstances of the case may require.\nNow, under the circumstances of Nixon's case, without expressing any opinion as to whether or not Nixon's vote was in strict law a perfectly good one, or whether or not the peculiar circumstances of the case were such as to entitle him to demand and receive his ballot paper upon taking the oath appropriate to be administered to an owner of property all that it is necessary to say, and upon this I express a very decided opinion, is that laymen certainly, and I think lawyers also, might without any corrupt intent whatever and indeed very conscientously entertain and express the opinion that the fault of the officials to discharge their duty had not disfranchised Nixon, and that as he was qualified to be on the list, and was in fact upon it, although erroneously described, his vote was a good vote, and as owner, that being the character which should have beeu annexed to his name upon the list, and under the peculiar circumstances of the case the appropriate oath to have been administered to him would have been the oath which should have been administered to an owner of property; and, assuming \"Harrison to have known all the circumstances of the case, the evidence as to what he said at the polling booth is perfectly consistent with his having entertained and conscientiously entertained this opinion, and with this being all he intended to convey. Hereafter lawyers who may be interested in an election, and who I presume cannot claim any exemption from liability upon a charge of this nature which a layman cannot have, will need to be very careful indeed that in giving advice in an election as to the right of any person to vote and as to the form of oath he may be required in law to take, he gives no opinion, however conscientious, which a court can pronounce to be erroneous, for if the court should differ from him (which unfortunately sometimes happens) he would become guilty of the misdemeanor of which Harrison has been pronounced to have been guilty and for which the respondent is made to suffer.\nThe case of Dougherty differs from that of Nixon in this, that in Dougherty's case the objection to his vote was stated and fully discussed at the polls. The questions raised were:\u20141st. One of law, namely, whether the nature of his residence upon his father's property which he described was such a residence as came within the meaning of the act? And 2nd. Whether Doherty could conscientiously take the oath that he was residing with his father?\nNow, the only evidence of the charge of corrupt inducement to Dougherty to take a false oath made against Allen is that given by Dougherty himself, who said that he had several times voted upon the same qualification without objection; that previously to the election in November he had heard his right to vote questioned upon the point raised; that he had given the subject the fullest consideration and had come to the conclusion that his vote was a good one and that he could conscientiously take the prescribed oath. He also said that at the poll the returning officer had expressed the same opinion, and had added that at a recent trial of an election petition which had taken place in relation to an election in the same electoral district before the Chancellor, that learned judge had expressed the opinion that precisely such residence as that of Dougherty was sufficient, and that a person upon such evidence could well take the oath. Allen, who is now accused of having corruptly induced Dougherty to take a false oath, also expressed his opinion to be that Dougherty could conscientiously take the oath, and this expression of opinion is the sole foundation for the charge made against Allen.\nAll that appears to me to be necessary to say upon this charge in addition to what I have said in Nixon's case, as to the nature of the offence pointed at in section 90 of the act 49 Vic. ch. 8 is that the expression of such opinion by Allen does not appear to me to constitute any inducement made by Allen much less \"corruptly\" made, in order to get Dougherty to take a false oath. And as to both, of these charges, I am of opinion that if the learned judge who tried that election petition had upon the evidence adduced adjudged either Harrison or Allen to have been guilty of the offence charged against them respectively he would have greatly erred.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for appellants: A.

Ritchie C.J. and Strong, Fournier, Taschereau and Gwynne JJ.\n(Mr. Justice Henry was present at the argument but died before the delivery of the judgment.)\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF QUEEN'S BENCH FOR LOWER CANADA (APPEAL SIDE).\nJudgment in licitation\u2014Binding on parties to it\u2014Constitutionality of an act of incorporation\u2014When its validity can be questioned and by whom.\nThe Island of Anticosti, held in joint ownership by a number of people, was sold by licitation for $101,000. The report of distribution allotted to G. B. (plaintiff) $16,578.66, for his share, as owner of one sixth of the island acquired from the Island of Anticosti Company, who had previously acquired one-sixth from Dame C. Langan, widow of H. G. Forsyth.\nThe respondent's claim was disputed by the appellant, the daughter and legal representative of Dame C. Langan, alleging that the sale by her through her attorney, W. L. F., of the one-sixth to the Anticosti Company was a nullity, because the act incorporating the company was ultra vires of the Dominion Government, and that the sale by W. L. F., as attorney for his mother, to himself as representing the Anticosti Company, was not valid\nThe Anticosti Company was one of the defendants in the action for licitation, and the appellant an intervening party; no proceedings were taken by the appellant prior to judgment, attacking either the constitutionality of the Island of Anticosti Company's charter or the status of the plaintiff, now respondent.\nHeld, affirming the judgment of the court below, Ritchie C. J. and Gwynne J. dissenting, that as Dame C. Langan had herself recognized the existence of the company, and as the appellant, her legal representative, was a party to the suit ordering the licitation of the property, she, the appellant, could not now on a report of distribution, raise the constitutional question as to the validity of the act of the Dominion Parliament constituting the company, and was now estopped from claiming the right of setting aside the deed of sale for which her mother had received good and valuable consideration. APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench, for Lower Canada (appeal side) reversing a judgment of the Superior Court in favor of the appellant.\nThe proceedings in this case arose out of the sale by licitation of the Island of Anticosti. The respondent claiming to be entitled to one-sixth part of the Island of Anticosti, in common with others, instituted proceedings against P. Leslie et al., in order to have the whole island sold by licitation. The appellant intervened in the proceedings and subsequently by order of the court the property was ordered to be sold, and there was a judgment homologating the report of distribution of moneys levied viz. $101,000, with the exception of the $13,136.45 awarded to the respondent as being the purchaser from the Island of Anticosti Company of two-twelfths undivided shares of the island which the said Anticosti company had previously bought from Dame Charlotte Langan, widow of the late Henry Greorge Forsyth.\nThe appellant is the daughter and the testamentary executrix of the saidDame Charlotte Langan the vendor and was collocated on her intervention for the sum of $24,902.00, as being the owner of \u00bc undivided share, but contested the collocation in favor of Bury for different reasons, the principal being that the act incorporating the said Anticosti Company was null, void and ultra vires, and that consequently the said company could neither buy nor sell said property and that the deeds of sale of her mother, Charlotte Langan, to the Anticosti Company and of the Anticosti Company to the respondent Bury were also null and void.\nThe act incorporating the company is 35 Vic. ch. 115 (D.) and the principal clauses relied on as being ultra vires of the Dominion Parliament are stated at length in the judgment of the Chief Justice hereinafter given ([1]). The following are the material facts relating to the sale of the two-twelfths claimed by the respondent:\u2014\nOn the 11th September 1874 the late Dame Charlotte Langan, widow of Henry G. Forsyth by William Langan Forsyth, acting as the attorney of his mother, under deed passed before Andrews, notary, became party to a deed by which she declared that she sold to the Anticosti Company, represented by William Langan Forsyth one-sixth of the Island of Anticosti, and the price of such sale was stated to be $250,000 of the company's stock, fully paid up, and to be transferred to the vendor.\nOn the 9th December, 1875, Mrs. Forsyth signed a declaration, stating that she had received from her son, W. L. Forsyth, payment and compensation in full for her right to one-sixth of the island mentioned in the deed of the 11th September, and, on the 4th of January following another deed of sale was passed, by which W. L. Forsyth, who stated that he was his mother's attorney, sold to the company one-sixth of the island for the sum of $250,000 with a declaration that this new deed should be considered as being only a ratification of that of the 11th September 1874. The said W. L. Forsyth further declared, on his mother's behalf that the latter had received from him due compensation for the consideration of the sale of the 11th September, as appeared by the receipt above mentioned, and that the company was to allot to W. L. Forsyth $250,000 of paid up stock and be thus freed from the payment of the price of sale.\nOn the 1st February, 1831, \"a special general meeting of the shareholders of the Anticosti Company \" was held and a proposal was made by Mr. Bury the respondent to purchase one-sixth of the island for $1,000. This offer was, on the motion of the secretary, Mr. Forsyth, accepted, and Mr. Forsyth was authorized to sign, as secretary, a deed of sale. Subsequently, on the 23rd of the same month, another \"special general meeting,\" consisting of four persons was held. This meeting elected five directors, to whom Bury's offer was again submitted, and who accepted the offer and authorized \"the proper officers to sign the deed of sale.\" On the 16th March following Peter S. Murphy, as president of the Anticosti Company, and W. L. Forsyth, as its secretary, signed a deed of sale, transferring the one-sixth of the island to Mr. Bury for $1,000.\nKerr Q.C. for appellant contended: 1st. that in so far as the act of incorporation by the Dominion Parliament granted them, the Island Anticosti Company, the power of acquiring and utilizing a property wholly situated within the province of Quebec, for the purpose of clearing and cultivating the same, the said act was ultra vires of the Parliament of Canada such matters being of a purely local interest, affecting property and civil rights in the province of Quebec, and consequently if the company had not the power to purchase, its pretended deeds of purchase were null and void and the same argument applied to the sale made by the company to the respondent.\nSee L' Union St. Jacques de Montreal v. Belisle ([2]); Dow v Black ([3]); Smith v. Merchants' Bank ([4]).\nIf an absolute nullity the objection could be alleged by the appellant, as it might have been by her auteur. 2nd, that even if the company was legally incorporated the facts proved in evidence show that the whole transaction was a fraud, and the title being simulated and fraudulent the respondent never became the owner of the sixth, for which he was collocated and the appellant was entitled to be collocated therefore as testamentary executrix of Mrs. Forsyth. Laflamme Q.C. and David for respondent contended that the proceedings having taken place under arts. 919, 933-999 of the code of procedure, to which proceedings the appellant was a party, she could not at this late stage raise any question as to the status of the respondent or as to the constitutionality of the act of incorporation. As regards the appellant and respondent, the judgment in licitation had acquired the force of res judicata. On the question of constitutionality of the act of incorporation, the learned counsel referred to Abbott v. Fraser ([5]); Colonial Building Association v. Loranger ([6]); Grant on Corporations ([7]); Lemoine v. Lionais ([8]); Fisher & Harrison's Digest ([9]); Morawetz on Corporations ([10]); L'Union Navigation Company v. Rascony ([11]).\nSIR W. J. RITCHIE C.J.\u2014The Island of Anticosti having been sold by licitation for the sum of $101,000.00, this amount was deposited and the distribution thereof proceeded with amongst the owners according to their respective shares.\nThe report of distribution allotted to George Bury $16,578.66 for his share as owner of one-sixth of the island which he appeared to have acquired from the Island of Anticosti Company.\nSusan Forsyth contested this collocation, and the Superior Court, sitting at Murray Bay, maintained the contestation, declaring that Bury had never been owner of the one-sixth which he claimed and that consequently, he was not entitled to any portion of the price of sale.\nAn appeal having been taken from this judgment to the Court or Queen's Bench, it was reversed, and it was decided, Mr. Justice Tessier dissenting, that Bury had really been owner of one-sixth and was entitled to be collocated for that portion of the proceeds.\nIt is from this judgment that the appeal to this court is taken.\nBy 35 Vic. cap. 115 the Island of Anticosti Company was incorporated by the Dominion Parliament so far as it was within the province of parliament to grant the powers conferred.\nThe 1st section names the persons incorporated.\n2nd. The said company shall have power to purchase from the proprietors thereof the whole of the Island of Anticosti, with all the rights, title, privileges and interest of the said proprietors in and to the same; and upon the completion of such purchase and the transfer of the same, the property therein shall be vested in the said company; It shall be lawful for the said company to colonise the said island, and to sell or lease the whole or any part of the said island from time to time, upon such terms as to them may seem proper,\u2014and this in so far as it is within the province of the Parliament of Canada to grant such powers.\n3rd. The company may also acquire by purchase, lease or otherwise, and may hold absolutely or conditionally any other lands, tenements, real or immoveable estate, not exceeding in yearly value ten thousand dollars, for the convenient conducting and management of their business, and may sell, alienate, let, lease and dispose of the same from time to time, and may acquire others in their stead, not exceeding at any time the value aforesaid,\u2014in so far as it is within the province of the Parliament of Canada to grant such powers.\n4th. The company may carry on all such operations as may be found necessary to develop the resources of the Island in respect of agriculture, forests, fisheries, mineral deposits of gold, silver, copper, iron and other metals or ores, and of coal, peat, plumbago, and salt springs, and shell marl, the opening up and working of quarries of slate, limestone, sandstone, grindstone, marble or other economic minerals or mineral substances, and to wash, dress, smelt and otherwise prepare and manufacture such articles for sale in so far as it is within the province of the Parliament of Canada to grant such powers.\nAnd by the 10th. When and as soon as one-tenth of the said capital stock shall been been subscribed as aforesaid, and ten per centum of the amount so subscribed paid in, the provisional directors or a majority of them may call a meeting of the shareholders at such time and place as they shall think proper, giving at least two weeks notice in the Canada Gazette, and in one or more newspapers published in the city of Montreal; at which general meeting and at the annual general meetings of the company thereafter, a board of directors shall be elected, consisting of not less than five nor more than thirteen, as may be prescribed by the by-laws (of the provisional or other directors) in force at the time of such election; but they shall not be authorised to commence operations under this act until at least fifty thousand dollars shall have been paid in.\nThis Dominion act so far as it professes to confer the right to purchase the Island of Anticosti, in the Province of Quebec, and to sell or lease the same, is, in my opinion, clearly ultra vires of the Dominion parliament. It is for a provincial object, and affecting property and civil rights in the Province of Quebec alone; the legislative right to incorporate such a company belongs to the Provincial Legislature, under the British North America Act.\nThe company, then, having no legal existence to enable them to purchase, hold or sell the land, the answer to the plaintiff's contention simply is: If the Dominion act is ultra vires the alleged company never was incorporated in reference to provincial objects, or in connection with property and civil rights in the province; therefore, there was no charter to be violated, nor any charter into the validity of which it is necessary to inquire. The existence of this company is not questioned collaterally, but directly, in this case, the plaintiff claiming by, through and under the alleged corporation which, as shown, should have no existence as such. I think that Judge Routhier was right in holding that the company, assuming it had a legal existence for some purposes, could take nothing under the alleged deeds from Mrs. Forsyth, by her attorney, of the 14th of September, 1875 and the 4th of January 1876, to the Island of Anticosti Company and the company could convey nothing to the plaintiffs under the deed of the 16th of June, 1881, between the company and George Bury; or, in other words, the company never bought because it had no right to buy, and never sold because it had no right to sell, and, therefore, the company acquired no title and could convey none, and, consequently, Bury had no locus standi to be collocated as claimed.\nIf the act of incorporation is not ultra vires, I am of opinion there never was any valid organization of the company to enable it to transact business, it not having complied with the provisions of the 10th section of the act of incorporation and if this had been shown I am inclined to agree with Mr. Justice Tessier that the sale of the 11th of September by W. L Forsyth, as attorney for his mother, to himself as representing the Anticosti company, was not a valid execution of the power and was bad on its face.\nI am, therefore, of opinion that George Bury has no right to the collocation No. 11 of $6,578, but that this collocation should be made in favor of the appellant Maria Susan Forsyth. The judgment of the Superior Court reserved to the interested parties whatever recourse they might have for the recovery of all sums paid in virtue of the deed of the 4th of January 1876. This judgment, I think, should be affirmed. The appeal must be allowed and this judgment affirmed.\nSTRONG J.\u2014this action was instituted by the respondent as one of several co-owners of the island of Anticosti for the licitation of the property, and the appellant being, also, the owner of a share in the island was a defendant in the action. The appellant pleaded no plea or defence raising any question as to the validity of the plaintiffs title, either by challenging the constitutional validity of the charter granted to the Anticosti company (the plaintiff's immediate quteurs), or by impeaching the legality of the organization of the company under the provisions of the charter, but allowed a judgment ordering the licitation of the property to be rendered sub silentio. Pursuant to judgment thus rendered, the property was sold and the purchase money lodged in court. Thereupon the prothonotary made his report of distribution of the monies thus arising from the sale by which he collocated the parties to the action for their respective shares.\nThe appellant Mrs. Forsyth has contested this collocation so far as relates to the monies allowed to the respondent by an opposition, in which she attacks the respondent's title to the share of the property which he claimed in the action, and has thus for the first time raised the questions which have been argued on this appeal.\nWhilst I entirely concur that if we can now enter into the merits our judgment ought to be in favor of the appellant I am nevertheless of the opinion that by her own omission to raise the objections she now insists upon in the proper manner and at the proper time, that is by plea ordefence before judgment, the appellant has precluded herself from insisting on the matters she has raised by her opposition.\nBy allowing a judgment for licitation to pass without objection the appellant must be considered as having admitted that the respondent's title, derived from the common auteur of herself and the respondent, was valid, and that the respondent's conclusions taken in the action and granted by the judgment were well founded.\nI was convinced by the argument of the learned counsel for the appellant that the charter of the Anticosti company was ultra vires of the Dominion, and, also that the company had no authority to acquire the property which the respondent claims to have derived from them, or to take any proceedings in prosecution of the enterprise for which they were incorporated until the amount of share capital, prescribed by the 10th section of the act of incorporation, ($250,000) should have been in good faith subscribed for and ten per cent, thereon actually and bon\u00e2 fide paid up, neither of which pre-requisities was, it is clear upon the evidence, ever complied with. It is, therefore, with very great regret that I am compelled to give effect to the objection that it is now too late for the appellant to raise the contentions she has insisted on by her opposition.\nBetween these parties, however, the matter is concluded and the appellant is bound by the principle of res judicata from raising the questions which are put forward by this appeal, and which have been already referred to.\nIt was argued that res judicata should have been pleaded in answer to the appellant's opposition and that the respondent having failed so to plead is not now entitled to avail himself of it. I cannot agree to this. By the record in the principal action now before us, and forming part of the record in appeal, the appellant's recognition of the plaintiff's title which was the foundation of all the proceedings in licitation is manifest. Under these circumstances it is impossible to go behind the judgment ordering the sale without doing great injustice, not only to the respondent, but also to the other parties to the cause interested in maintaining the judgment and the proceedings had pursuant to its terms.\nThe objection to which I feel bound to give effect is, therefore, not a matter of narrow technical procedure, but one founded on substantial justice and universally recognized in practice. In courts proceeding according to English law, land may be ordered to be sold at the instance of one of several Co-owners, instead of being partitioned, provided the necessity for a sale is established. In such a case if the land were sold and the purchase money paid into court an objection then raised for the first time that the plaintiff in the action at whose instance the sale had been ordered had no title would be considered altogether too late and would not be listened to for a moment. If we were now to allow this appeal we should, therefore, not merely be relaxing salutary rules of procedure, but actually impugning principles upon which the validity of titles may depend. My conclusion is that the appeal must be dismissed with costs.\nFOURNIER. J.\u2014La contestation en cette cause s'\u00e9l\u00e8ve sur la distribution des argents provenant de la vente de l'Ile d'Anticosti, dont l'intim\u00e9 \u00e9tait propri\u00e9taire pour deux douzi\u00e8mes, qu'il avait acquis par acte notari\u00e9, le 16 mars 1881, de la Compagnie d'Anticosti incorpor\u00e9e par acte du parlement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral. Cette derni\u00e8re avait acquis ces deux douzi\u00e8mes de Dame Charlotte Langan, veuve de feu H. G. Forsyth, maintenant repr\u00e9sent\u00e9e en cette cause par l'appelante. La dite Dame Langan, agissait \u00e0 l'acte de vente du 4 janvier 1876 par le minist\u00e8re de son procureur, William Langan Forsyth. Ces divers actes comportent tous qu'ils \u00e9taient faits pour bonne et valable consid\u00e9ration.\nLa Principale raison de la contestation de cette collocation est que l'acte d'incorporation de la Compagnie d'Anticosti est inconstitutionnel et nul comme ultra vires du parlement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral et qu'en cons\u00e9quence la dite compagnie ne pouvait acheter ni vendre des immeubles dans la province de Qu\u00e9bec, et que la vente faite \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9 \u00e9tait nulle. La contestation contient aussi des all\u00e9gations de fraude et d'irr\u00e9gularit\u00e9 dans les proc\u00e9d\u00e9s de la dite compagnie, qui paraissent n'avoir gu\u00e8re occup\u00e9 l'attention des deux cours appel\u00e9es \u00e0 juger ce litige.\nLa pr\u00e9tention d'ill\u00e9galit\u00e9 de la constitution de la compagnie a \u00e9t\u00e9 admise par la cour Sup\u00e9rieure et rejet\u00e9e par la cour du Banc de la Reine, dont l'un des consid\u00e9rants est:\nThat the Anticosti Company has been incorporated by an Act of the parliament of Canada, passed in the thirty-fifth year of Her Majesty's reign, ch. 115, and considering that the said Act in so far as it created the said company a body corporate, and attributed to it certain of the powers thereby conferred, was not ultra vires.\nA l'appui de ce consid\u00e9rant de la cour du Banc de la Reine on pent citer les d\u00e9cisions du Consell Priv\u00e9 dans la cause du Colonial Buildings and Investment Co v. Loranger ([12]), et celle dans la cause de Ross v. Canada Agricultural Ins. Co. ([13]).\nLa premi\u00e8re question que soul\u00e8ve cetee contestation n'est pas celle de la constitutionalit\u00e9 de l'incorporation de la Compagnie d'Anticosti, mais bien plut\u00f4t celle de savoir si apr\u00e8s en avoir plusieurs fois reconnu l'existance de la fa\u00e7on la plus formelle, l'appelante pent encore \u00e8tre re\u00e7ue \u00e0 la mettre en doute.\nLe but de la demande en licitation intent\u00e9e par Bury \u00e8tait d'amener \u00e0 vente par licitation la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de l'Ile d'Anticosti appartenant aux divers propri\u00e9taires mentionn\u00e9s dans la proc\u00e9dure, et d'en partagrrle prix de vente conform\u00e9ment aux droits de chacun des divers propri\u00e9taires. Ii est incontestable qu'\u00e0 une telle action on ne peut mettre en cause que ceux qui out des droits certains \u00e0 une part quelconque dans l\u2019immeuble \u00e0 liciter. Lorsque le demandeur Bury a pris son action contre madame Forsyth, co-propri\u00e9taire de l\u2019Ile d'Anticosti pour l'amener \u00e0 liciter et partager avec lui et les autres propri\u00e8taires, l'\u00eele en question, le premier devorr de madame Forsyth, \u00e8tait d'entamer imm\u00e9diatement (in limine) la contestation avec Bury sur ses droits de propri\u00e9t\u00e9. Elle \u00e8tait oblig\u00e9e de refuser de laisser poursuivre cetee licitation Si elle ne lui reconnaissait pas sa qualit\u00e9 de co-propri\u00e9taire. Au lieu de cela, elle laisse la proc\u00e9dure poursuivre son cours et prend part \u00e0 un grand nombre d'actes de proc\u00e9dure, bas\u00e9s sur Ta qualit\u00e9 de co-propri\u00e8taire prise par Bury. Chacun de ses actes est une reconnaissance de sa part des droits de Bury. Enfin, le 22 septembre 1882, jugement est rendu sur la demande de Bury, \u00e0 laquelle madame Forsyth est partie en cause, ordonnant la licitation de I\u2019 Ile d'Anticosti reconnaissant ainsi les droits de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de Bury, qui sont consacr\u00e9s par le jugement.\nCe jugement ordonnant la licitation est un de ces interlocutoires qui ont un caract\u00e8re de finalit\u00e9 'Qui oblige la partie qui peut avoir \u00e0 s'en plaindre, \u00e0 en appeler, afin de l'emp\u00e8cher d'obtenir la force de chose jug\u00e8e. Elle n'a fait aucun proc\u00e9d\u00e9 pour attaqurr ce jugement pass\u00e8 depuis longtemps en force de chose jug\u00e8e et devenu partant inattaquable.\nCe n'est que Te 5 janveir 1885, plus de deux ans et trois mois aprss le jugement du 22 septembre 1882, ordonnant la vente de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 one Dame Susan Forsyth, fille et repr\u00e9sentante l\u00e8gale de Dame Charlotte langan, \u00e9pouse de H. G. Forsyth, pr\u00e9sente pour la premi\u00e8re fois une contestation des droits de Bury, sous la forme d'une contestation \u00e0 la collocation n 11 du rapport de distribution. C'est dans cetee contestation faith longtemps apr\u00e8s la vente de Ta propri\u00e9t\u00e9 et lorsque le prix de venee est devant la cour, pour distribuions, qu'elle attaque Ta validit\u00e8 de l'acte du 16 mai 1881, vente par la Compagnie d'Anticosti \u00e0 Bury et celui de juin 1876, par lequel Ta dite Dame H. G. Forsyth, repr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par l'appelante, vendait \u00e0 Bury par le minist\u00e8re de son procureur W. L. Forsyth, partie (deux douzi\u00e8mes) de l'Ile d'Anticosti. Elle soul\u00e8ve aussi la question de la l\u00e9galit\u00e9 on la constitutionalit\u00e9 de l'acte d'incorporation de la dite compagnie. Elle plaide simulation des actes en question, non consid\u00e9ration, fraude, etc., etc.\nTous ces faits qui sont ant\u00e9rieurs \u00e0 l'action en licitation s'ils \u00e9taient fond\u00e9s auraient d\u00fb faire le sujet d'une contestation \u00e0 l'action en licitation et faire rejeter les pr\u00e9tentions de Bury \u00e0 une partie de cette propri\u00e9t\u00e9. Ils ne peuvent plus \u00eatre plaid\u00e9s contre un jugement pass\u00e9 en force de chose jug\u00e9e. Le rapport de distribution n'est que l'ex\u00e9cution de ce jugement qui ne pouvait \u00eatre attaqu\u00e9 que par l'appelante on par un tiers qui ny\u00fb aurait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 partie. L'appelante ne le pent pas parce qu'elle repr\u00e9sente \u00e0 titre universel Charlotte Langan, sa m\u00e8re, partie \u00e0 l'action et aux actes attaqu\u00e9s.\nIi est de plus \u00e8vident que si Dame Charlotte Langran n'a pas oppos\u00e9 ces d\u00e9fenses dans le temps voulu, c'est qu'elle les a tacitement abandonn\u00e9es. Elle n'a pas voulu, sans doute par un sentiment de dignit\u00e9 personnelle et par esprit de justice envers celui qui a le plus contribu\u00e9 \u00e0 donner une valeur consid\u00e9rable \u00e0 une propri\u00e9t\u00e9 qui n'avait \u00e9t\u00e9 jusque-l\u00e0 pour elle et sa famille qu'une source de d\u00e9penses inutiles,\u2014elle n'a pas voulu dis-je lui contester des droits qu'il avait acquis de la Compagnie d'Anticosti \u00e0 laquelle elle les avait vendus. Mais un motif l\u00e9gal encore plus puissant a d\u00fb aussi l'emp\u00eacher d'attaquer les droits de Bury, c'est que par rapport \u00e0 elle il n'\u00e9tait qu'un tiers acqu\u00e9reur de bonne foi, et comme tel il n'\u00e9tait nullement responsable en loi des torts qu'elle avait pu subir dans ses transactions avec la dite Compagnie d'Anticosti. Ce n'est qu'\u00e0 cette derni\u00e8re qu'elle pouvait s'adresser pour les faire r\u00e9parer. L'appelante n'a pas plus de droit que sa m\u00e8re d'opposer ces moyens de nullit\u00e9, paree qu'elle est sa repr\u00e9sentante \u00e0 titre uni versel et qu'en loi elle est consid\u00e9r\u00e9e Comme la m\u00e8me personne. De plus, en supposant qu'elle e\u00fbt fait une preuve suffisante pour invalider les actes qu'elle impugne, elle ne pourrait en obtenir la nullit\u00e9 parce qu'elle ne l'a pas demand\u00e9e \"par les conclusions de sa contestation. La cour ne pouvant pas dans tous les cas, adjuger au-del\u00e0 de sa demande. Ind\u00e9pendamment de ce d\u00e9faut de conclusion insurmontable, elle n'offre pas de rendre les diverses consid\u00e9rations re\u00e7ues, et ne peut en cons\u00e9quence \u00eatre re\u00e7ue \u00e0 demander la nullit\u00e9 de ces actes sans se d\u00e9clarer elle-m\u00eame pr\u00eate \u00e0 faire raison \u00e0 Bury de ses avances.\nCes arguments, fond\u00e9s en droit et appuy\u00e9s sur les faits de la cause, me semblent suffisants pour faire rejeter cette contestation.\nJe ne crois pas qu'il soit utile pour la d\u00e9cision de cette cause d'entrer dans plus de consid\u00e9rations que ne l'a fait la cour du Banc de la Reine au sujet de la constitutionalit\u00e9 de l'acte d'incorporation de la compagnie, mais je crois qu'il est important de ne pas perdre de vue le fait que cetee question n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 aussi soulev\u00e9e qu'apr\u00e8s le jugement de licitation, c'est-a-dire plus de deux ans et trois mois apr\u00e8s la mise en cause de la dite compagnie conjointement avec la m\u00e8re del'appelante. C'est apr\u00e8s avoir plaid\u00e8 c\u00f4te \u00e0 c\u00f4te pendant plus de deux ans comme parties au m\u00eame proc\u00e8s que l'appelante s'imagine de soulever cette question lorsqu'il ne s'agit plus que d'ex\u00e9cuter le jugement. En effet la compagnie a \u00e9t\u00e9 mise en cause des le d\u00e9but de l'action, comme on peut le voir \u00e0 la premi\u00e8re page du dossier, dans l'\u00e9nonciation des qualit\u00e9s des parties. Apr\u00e8s l'avoir consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme corps l\u00e9gal pendant deux ans, il est trop tard maintenant pour lui nier son existence. Cette pr\u00e9tention est contraire \u00e0 la doctrine bien \u00e8\u00e9tablie par les autorit\u00e9s dans le factum de l'intim\u00e9: The contracts made with third parties by corporations existing invirtue of a statute apparently good, and even by corporations existing defacto, must be held good and valid ([14]).\nEn outr\u00e9, les nombreux acquiescements qui ont eu lieu par les divers actes de proc\u00e9dure dans le cours de l'action emp\u00eachent l'appelante de revenir sur cette question. Pour ces motifs, je suis d'avis que l'appel dolt \u00eatre renvoy\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014I am of opinion that this appeal should be dismissed with costs for the reasons given in the formal judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench in the 5th and 6th consid\u00e9rants thereof. The maxim quem de cvictione tenet actio, eumdem agentem repellit exceptio determines this case.\nAs to the constitutional question raised by the appellant we cannot determine it. We simply say she cannot raise it.\nGWYNNE J.-\u2014With the greatest deference for the opinion of my learned brothers who have pronounced-judgment dismissing the present appeal, I cannot see that the grounds upon which they proceed, as I understand them, are open upon the record before us on this appeal.\nIn an action instituted by the respondent claiming to be entitled to one-sixth part of the Island of Anticosti against Patrick Leslie and others, defendants, and the present appellant as intervenante, the respondent obtained decree in licitation for sale of the island under article 1562 C.C. Accordingly the sale by licitation took place and the sum of $101,000 was deposited in court to abide the result of the report of distribution. By that report the sum of $16,578, as representing the proportionate value of the said one-sixth part of the island was allotted to Greorge Bury, the above respondent. The appellant contested this collocation, claiming herself to be entitled to the one-sixth part of the island which was claimed by the respondent. The contestant in her opposition pleaded that the said George Bury was in no way entitled to be collocated, as aforesaid, because that he never was at any time the owner or proprietor of the said one-sixth part of the island, and she alleged divers matters which she relied upon as rendering utterly null and void the deeds under which he claimed and she averred title to the said one-sixth part in herself by a title derived from the late Dame Charlotte Forsyth in her life time the owner of the said one-sixth part.\nThe respondent contested this opposition by pleading the title under which he claimed as derived from the same Dame Charlotte Forsyth through the Anticosti Company, a company incorporated by an act of the Dominion Parliament, and which company, as the respondent contended, were vendees of the said Dame Charlotte Forsyth and vendors to the respondent for value.\nUpon the pleadings issues were joined and the only question thereby raised was as to the validity of the title of the respondent to the said one-sixth part in view of the objections pleaded by the opposant to the validity of the title.\nAssuming the deeds, under which he claimed to have been invalid for the reasons alleged by the opposant or any of them, there was no dispute as to the title of the opposant the now appellant.\nThe Superior Court in the District of Saguenay maintained that the respondent, George Bury, never had acquired any title in or to the said one-sixth part of the island in question, supporting one of the grounds of objection taken by the opposant, namely, that the Dominion Act incorporating the Anticosti Company was ultra vitrs and for that reason null and void. The Court of Queen's Bench of the district of Quebec, the appeal side reversed this judgment, and rendered judgment in favor of the respondent upon the ground that he was, as the court adjudged him to be, a bon\u00fb fide purchaser for value from the Anticosti Company, and that as against him the appellant having, as the court adjudged her to have, recognized the existence of the company and its right to acquire and sell the said property, cannot now contend that the company had no right to purchase or to sell the said one-sixth part, and for the reason, further, that whether or not the said Anticosti Company had a right to acquire and possess the said property the sale which the said late Dame Forsyth made to the said company of one-sixth part of the said island was a sufficient authority to the said company to convey to a bon\u00e2 fide purchaser the right and interest which she had in the said one-sixth part and by the sale which the company made to the respondent of the said one-sixth part he has acquired a good and valid title to the same, and is entitled to be collocated out of the proceeds of the sale of the island for the value of the said one-sixth part less his proportion of the cost of the sale of the island.\nUpon an appeal from this judgment the questions presented for our consideration, as it appears to me, are:\u2014\n1st. Can this judgment of the Court of Appeal of the district of Quebec be maintained in view of the only issues which are joined by the respondent's contestation of the appellant's opposition to the collocation in favor of the respondent appearing in the report of distribution and upon which issues the litigants themselves have been content to rest the case which they have submitted to the court for its adjudication? In other words, was the court justified in adjudging the appellant to be estopped from insisting upon the de facts in the respondent's title which she had pleaded in her opposition, in the absenee of any pleading upon the record alleging the existence of any facts upon which such estoppel could be and was rested?\n2nd. If the opposant was not estopped from insisting upon the defects in the respondent's title which she had pleaded in her opposition, then we have to determine and adjudicate upon the issues joined as to those defects.\nThe record, as it stands, contains no pleading setting up the existence of any facts which raise any question of the estoppels adjudged by the court. In the absence of such a pleading the judgment of the Court of Appeal of the Province of Quebec cannot in my opinion be maintained, and I must say, moreover, that I fail to see any facts in the case which, if pleaded, would have been, in my opinion, sufficient to support that estoppels.\nBut it is objected, although no such objection appears upon the record, that the only proper time to take the objections which have been taken by the appellant to the respondent\u2019s title was in the action in licitation. Why they must have been taken there in order to be effectually taken, I fail to see, and I have not heard any reason suggested, which is, to my mind, satisfactory why they might not be taken equally well and effectually, as they have been taken, upon the record before us.\nThe appellant herself was interested in the island and in the proceeds to arise from any sale which might be made thereof quite independently of her claim to the one-sixth part, which the respondent also claimed, and she appeals to have been quite content that the sale should take place under the direction of the court on the proceeds being deposited in court, to abide the determination of the court upon the question being raised upon the report of distribution as to the parties entitled to the proceeds, and. in what proportions they should-be found to be entitled.\nI confess that the mode in which the question of title has been raised, upon the present record, appears to me to be the most convenient and most natural mode for raising the questions under the circumstances of the case. However the suggestion of this objection is but another form of raising a question of estoppels against the right of the opposant to have the issues joined between her and the respondent adjudicated upon by the court, for which I can see no justification either upon principle or authority in the absence of any pleading suggesting facts upon which the estoppels could be rested and submitting the question of estoppels to the court. If this mode of proceeding can be sanctioned, then, as it appears to me, the issues joined Upon the record as it stands are a mere delusion. For these reasons I cannot see that we have anything to do upon this appeal but to adjudicate upon the Validity of the respondent's title as pleaded by himself, in view of the objections taken to it by the opposant, and of the facts offered in evidence by the respective parties in relation to such objections, in fact to adjudicate upon the issues as raised by the parties themselves and upon which they have been respectively content to rest the case which they have submitted to the court for its adjudication.\nAnd now as to those issues: If it were necessary to the determination of the present case to decide whether the Dominion Act 35 Vic. ch. 115, intituled an act to incorporate the Anticosti Company was or not infra vires of the Dominion Parliament I should be, as at present advised, of opinion that it is intra vires, but as in the view which I take a decision upon that point is not necessary to the determination of the case now before us, I need not state my reasons for the opinion I entertain upon that point.\nIf the plaintiff Bury had, never acquired the interest which he claims to have acquired in the undivided one-sixth part of the Island of Anticosti of which the late Dame Charlotte Forsyth in her life time was seized, and if the question now before us had arisen between Dame Charlotte in her life time or since her death between the present opposant and the Anticosti Company, I can see nothing in the case which could estop the late Dame Charlotte in the one case or the present opposant in the other, from asserting their right to recover, and from recovering, the $16,578.06 in contestation.\nIt is clear from the evidence that the late Dame Charlotte never received anything from the company for the alleged transfer to the company of her one-sixth share in the island, sand that the company not only never in point of fact paid anything for the one-sixth interest in question, but that they never were in a position to pay anything for it, or to acquire it under the provisions of their act of incorporation for the company never had succeeded in procuring stock to be in good faith taken to the amount of ten per cent. on the sum of $2,500,000 named in the act as the capital stock of the company, and of having $12,500.00 of such stock actually paid in, both of which things, namely, the subscription of ten per cent, upon the capital stock of the company and the actual payment of $12,500 thereof were by the act made conditions precedent to the company's commencing any operations, even that of the election of directors by the shareholders\nUntil such ten per cent. should he subscribed and such sum of $12,500 should be actually paid in, the powers of the provisional directors named in the act were limited to opening stock books and procuring stock to be subscribed, and such provisional directors were, by the act, made the only persons having control of the affairs of the company. It appears, however, that certain persons, some of whom had subscribed for shares in good faith, but not to the amount of ten percent, required by the act, and at a time when not more than about 80 shares, more or less, of $100 each, had been bon\u00e2 fide subscribed, and before $12,500, or indeed it would seem before one hundredth part of that amount had actually been paid upon stock subscribed, went through the form in 1875 of electing a board of directors. Yet, it plainly appears, that in 1876, by reason of the company having wholly failed to procure the requisite amount of ten per centum of the capital stock, or anything more than the above number of eighty shares or thereabouts, to be subscribed in good faith, it became, to all intents and purposes, and was deemed by the persons who had subscribed in good faith to be defunct and abandoned, and they never took any further interest therein.\nTinder these circumstances it appears to be tree from doubt that if the question was now before us between the late Dame Charlotte, if she were living, or, since her death between the present opposant and the company the latter would have no claim whatever to the amount in question, or any part thereof, but that Dame Charlotte in the one case, and the present opposant in the other would be entitled to the money. The only question therefore which, it appeass to me, remains is: Can the plaintiff Bury, under the circumstances as appearing in evidence attending his procuring the execution of the instrument under which he claims, be in any better position? The answer to which must be, in my opinion, decidedly in the negative; for the contrivance to which he was party by which a fictitious board of directors was pretended to be elected by per sons who never were bon\u00e2 tide shareholders in the company, but had become nominally shareholders, and for the sole purpose of assisting Bury in procuring the execution of the instrument under which he claims in consideration of $1,000 paid by him to Wm. D. Forsyth was a transaction, so fraudulent in its nature that Bury, a party to that transaction, never could be regarded in a court of justice as a purchaser for value and in good faith, even if the company had legally acquired the beneficial interest of the late Dame Charlotte Forsyth in the land which, for the reasons already stated, they had not.\nIn my opinion the appeal should be allowed with costs and the appellant should be collocated in the place of the respondent for the said sum of $16,578.66.\nAppeal dismissed with costs ([15]).\nSolicitors for appellants: Pemberton & Languedoc.\nSolicitors for respondent: Longpr\u00e8 & David.\n[1] See p. 547\n[2] L.

J. and Strong, Fournier, Taschereau and Gwynne JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF QUEEN'S BENCH FOR LOWER CANADA (APPEAL SIDE).\n39 Vic. ch. 52 (P.Q.)\u2014Constitutionality of\u2014By-law\u2014 Ultra vires Taxation of ferry boats Jurisdiction of Harbor Commissioners \u2014Injunction.\nBy 39 Vic. ch. 52 sec. 1 sub-sec, 3 the city of Montreal is authorized to impose an annual tax on \" ferrymen or steamboat ferries \" under the authority of the said statute the corporation of the city of Montreal passed a by-law imposing an annual tax of $200 on the proprietor or proprietors of each and every steamboat ferry con\u00adveying to Montreal for hire travelers from any place not more than nine miles distance from the same and obtained from the Recorder's Court for the city of Montreal a warrant of distress to levy upon the appellant company the said tax of $200 for each steamboat employed by them during the year as ferry-boats between Longueil and Montreal. In an action brought by the appellant company, claiming that the Provincial statute was ultra vires of the Provincial Legislature and that the by-law was ultra vires of the corporation, and asking for an injunction, it was\nHeld, affirming the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench, Montreal, that the Provincial Legislation was intra vires.\n2. Reversing the judgment of the court below, that the by-law was ultra vires, as the words used in the statute only authorize a singee tax on the owner of each ferry, irrespective of the number of boats or vessels by means of which the ferry should be worked.\n3. Affirming the judgment of the court below, that the jurisdiction of the harbor commissioners of Montreal within certain limits doss not exclude the right of the city to tax and control ferries within such limits. APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada (appeal side) ([1]) confirming a judgment of the Superior Court.\nThe appellant company employed several of their boats to perform the ferry service between Montreal and Longueuil; and the Recorder's Court of the City of Montreal having issued, at the instance of the City of Montreal, against the appellants, a warrant of distress to levy the tax of $200 which had been imposed 'upon each of their boats, the respondents presented before one of the judges of the Superior Court a petition to suspend the proceedings on such warrant of distress and brought the present suit.\nThe action was in order to have the by-law of the city of Montreal, imposing a tax of $200 on each ferry boat employed by the appellant company between Montreal and Longueil, set aside and the Provincial act 39 Vic. ch. 52 under the authority of which the by-law was passed, declared unconstitutional and ultra vires.\nBecause:\n1. By the common law of the British Empire no citizen or British subject, nor any property of such citizen or subject can be taxed twice for the same thing, the same object or the same purpose; the appellant company, besides the special tax of two hundred dollars ($200), pay a business tax of seven and a half per cent and stand ipso facto on an unequal footing with the other navigation companies.\n2. Commerce and navigation are exclusively within the jurisdiction of the Parliament of Canada and in the present case the Provincial Parliament acted ultra vires in granting to the city of Montreal power and authority to pass the by-law imposing a tax on the ferry-boats of the said company. 3. The tax of two hundred dollars ($200) is an indirect tax which impedes trade, and under the British North America Act the Provincial Legislature is not empowered to impose such tax.\n4. The harbor of Montreal, where appellants' boats are moored, is situated beyond the limits of the city and within the jurisdiction of the Harbor Commissioners, who alone are empowered to collect the wharf age dues on account of said mooring.\n5. The corporation has no power to impose a tax on\u2219 any business, industry, labor, trade or occupation what-ever, carried on outside of its limits, nor can it be vested by any Legislature with the power of imposing such.\n6. The preamble of by-law No. 94 only refers to the statute 37 Vic. ch. 51, sec. 78, which was repealed, and wherein no mention is made of the act 39 Vic. ch. 52, which has been substituted for the latter, and it is fatal to the validity of the provisions therein contained.\nThe Attorney-General for the Province of Quebec intervened under 45 Vic. ch. 4 to sustain the validity of the Provincial Act.\nThe City of Montreal pleaded to the action and affirmed the principle that the laws upon which was based the by-law were constitutional.\nArchambault Q.C. for appellant.\nEthier for respondents the City of Montreal.\nRoy for the Attorney General.\nIn addition to the points relied on by counsel in the courts below and which are sufficiently stated in the report of the case in M. L. R. 3 Q. B. p. 173 and seq. the learned counsel for the appellants contended that the by-law was beyond the provincial act.\nSIR W. J. RITCHIE C.J.\u2014I think the provincial act is constitutional but I think the by-law is bad because it does not follow the provincial act. The appeal should be allowed with costs. STRONG J.\u2014The constitutional question raised by the action need not be considered save for the purposes of costs as hereafter mentioned, inasmuch as it is quite clear that the 23rd. section of the by-law of the 21st April 1876 was ultra vires of the City Council. The only statutory authority to which this provision of the by-law can be ascribed is the Provincial Statute of Quebec, 39 Vic. cap. 52 sec. 1 sub-sec. 3, which authorises the City to impose an annual tax on \"ferrymen.\" and \"steamboat ferrymen.\" These words could only authorise a single tax on the owner of each ferry irrespective of the number of boats or vessels by which the ferry should be worked. The plainest principles of construction require this even without the aid of this rule which makes it imperative on us in case of doubt to adopt that interpretation which is most favorable to the party who is claiming exemption from a tax.\nThen this 23rd section of the by-law in question provides that an annual tax of $200 shall be imposed on ferry owness for every ferry boat which transports to the city, passengers from any place no more than nine miles distant. This taxis manifestly in excess of the powers conferred by the legislature since it is not confined to the imposition of a single tax on each ferry owner, but exacts the tax in respect of each steamboat used for the ferry an imposition which can be referred to no statutory authority whatever. If we are to read the 3rd sub-section of section 1, of 39 Vic. ch. 52, as in pari material with the enactment on the same subject contained in the earlier act of 37 Vic. ch. 51 section 78, this becomes if possible still plainer, for the last mentioned act is also in words confined to authorising a tax on ferrymen irrespective of the number of vessels they may happen to\u00b7make use of in operating their ferries. The portion of the by-law impeached is therefore ultra vires of the City and void, and the respondents should be prohibited from collecting the tax.\nI have had some doubt whether the conclusions taken by the plaintiffs in the action were such as to entitle them to the judgment indicated, but having regard to the last clause of the conclusions it does not appear to me that such judgment would be ultra the plaintiffs' demand so as to offend against article 17 of the Code of Civil Procedure.\nThe appeal should be allowed with costs as against The City of Montreal and a judgment entered in the court below for the plaintiffs with costs. The appeal lands should however pay the costs of the Attorney General who has been put en cause for the purpose of sustaining the constitutional validity of the statute which was not seriously impugned and indeed could not be in the face of the later decisions in the Privy Council, the tax authorized being clearly a direct tax such as a Provincial Legislature has authority to impose.\nFOURNIER J.\u2014Le jugement de la Cour du Banc de la Reine Province de Qu\u00e9bec, dont il est interjet\u00e9 appel en cette cause, a confirm\u00e9 la l\u00e9galit\u00e9 d'un r\u00e8glement de la Corporation de la cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al, adopt\u00e9 le 21 avril 1876, dans le but de d\u00e9terminer le montant des taxes et droits de licence qui seraient pr\u00e9lev\u00e9s sur les diff\u00e9rents genres d'industries et de commerce exerc\u00e9s et pratiqu\u00e9s dans la dite cit\u00e9.\nL'appelante se plaint principalement de l'article 23 de ce r\u00e8glement, con\u00e7u en ces termes:\nSec. 13. Une taxe annuelle de deux cents piastres est par le pr\u00e9sent impos\u00e9e et sera pr\u00e9lev\u00e9e sur le propri\u00e9taire ou les propri\u00e9t\u00e9 tout et chaque bateau-\u00e0-vapeur traversier qui transporte \u00e0 la cit\u00e9, moyennant r\u00e9tribution, les voyageurs de tout endroit n'\u00e9tant pas \u00e0 une distance de plus de neuf milles de la cit\u00e9, Un des principaux moyens de nullit\u00e9 que l'appelante fait valoir contre ce r\u00e8glement, est que, d'apr\u00e8s son pr\u00e9ambule, il parait avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 bas\u00e9 sur l'acte 37 Vic., ch. 51, tandis qu'\u00e0 cette \u00e9poque, le 21 avril 1876, ce statut avait \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9voqu\u00e9 par l'acte 39 Vic., ch. 52.\nEn effet, la Ire section de ce dernier acte r\u00e9voque la 78e section de la 37 Vic., ch. 51, donnant l'autorit\u00e9 d'\u00e9tablir sur les propri\u00e9taires de bateau-\u00e0-vapeur trac versiez la taxe de $200 impos\u00e9e par l'article 23. A la section ainsi abrog\u00e9e, ii en est substitu\u00e9 une autre sous le m\u00eame num\u00e9ro et au m\u00eame effet o\u00f9 sont con tenus avec des pouvoirs additionnels tous ceux qui \u00e9taient d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9s dans la section 78 de\u00b7la 37 Vic., oh. 51. C'est ainsi qu'on y retrouve dans l'\u00e9num\u00e9ration des pouvoirs conf\u00e9r\u00e9s par la ss. 3 de la Ire section, le pouvoir de taxer exerc\u00e9 par l'article 23, exprim\u00e9 dans les termes suivants:\nEt sur les traversiers ou bateaux-\u00e0-vapeur traversiers, qui trans portent \u00e0 la cit\u00e9, moyennant r\u00e9tribution, les voyageurs de tout endroit n'\u00e9tant pas \u00e0 une distance de plus de neuf milles da la cit\u00e9.\nDans la ss. 13 de la section 78 de 37 Vic., ch. 51, le pouvoir de taxer est ainsi exprim\u00e9:\nSur les traversiers qui transportent dans la cit\u00e9, moyennant r\u00e9tri bution, les voyageurs de tout endroit situ\u00e9 \u00e0 une distance de pas plus de neuf milles de la cit\u00e9, et g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement sur tous commerces, manufactures, occupations, affaires, arts, professions, ou moyens de profit ou de subsistance, qu'ils soient \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9s ci-dessus ou non, qui sont maintenant ou qui seront par la suite faits, exerc\u00e9s ou en op\u00e9ration dans la dite cit\u00e9.\nOn voit en comparant ces deux textes qu'apr\u00e8s le mot \" traversier r on trouve dans la ss. 3 de la \u00e8te section de l'acte de 39 Vic., ch. 52, les mots suivants: o\u00f9 bateaux-\u00e0-vapeur traversiers qui ne se rencontrent pas dans la ss. 13 de la section 78 de la 37 Vict., oh. 51.\nC'est sur cette diff\u00e9rence que l'appelante se fonde pour pr\u00e9tendre que la Corporation n'avait pas le 21 avril 1876, pouvoir d'adopter l'article 23 et de taxer les bateaux-\u00e0-vapeur traversiers. Ii est vrai comme on vient de le voir que l'acte mentionn\u00e9 dans le \"pr\u00e9ambule du r\u00e8glement, ne fait pas mention de bateaux-\u00e0-vapeur. Ii n'est nullement question dans cet acte du genre de pouvoir moteur employee pour transporter les voyageurs. Les termes de cette section sont si g\u00e9n\u00e9raux qu'ils comprennent tous les modes de locomotion alors en usage, et donnent le pouvoir de taxer les traversiers (ferrymen) sans \u00e9gard au mode du pouvoir moteur qui d'apr\u00e8s cet acte peut \u00e9tre aussi bien la vapeur que la voile, la rame ou les chevaux.\nLa citation dans le pr\u00e9ambule du r\u00e8glement en question, est \u00e9videmment une simple erreur cl\u00e9ricale; c'est sans doute l'acte 39 Vic., ch. 52, que l'on a voulu citer; sanctionn\u00e9 le 24 d\u00e9cembre 1875 il \u00e9tait en force longtemps avant l'adoption du r\u00e8glement du 21 avril 1876, et la Corporation se trouvait par cet acte \u00e0 poss\u00e9der un pouvoir de pr\u00e9lever des taxes sur les traverses et les traversiers, mais non pas le pouvoir de taxer chaque bateau-\u00e0-vapeur traversier. S'il n'y avait que la version fran\u00e7aise du statut \u00e0 consulter il serait plus facile de justifier l'article 23 du r\u00e8glement en question; mais lorsqu'on r\u00e9f\u00e8re au texte anglais, on voit qu'il y a entre les deux versions une diff\u00e9rence assez consid\u00e9rable. La version anglaise donne pouvoir de taxer lesferrymen ou steamboat ferries, c'-est-\u00e0-dire les traversiers ou bateaux-\u00e0-vapeur traversiers. Cela ne signifie pas autre chose que toute traverse de quelque mani\u00e8re qu'elle soit faite pourra \u00eatre tax\u00e9e. Le r\u00e8glement au contraire, impose une taxe non sur la traverse ou le bateau-\u00e0-vapeur employ\u00e9 \u00e0 cet effet, mais il taxe le propri\u00e9taire ou les propri\u00e9taires de tout et chaque bateau-\u00e0-vapeur traversier. C'est certainement aller au del\u00e0 du pouvoir conf\u00e9r\u00e9. Ce n'est Pius la traverse ou le traversier qui est tax\u00e9. Ce r\u00e8glement pourrait atteindre un propri\u00e9taire de bateaux-\u00e0-vapeur qui ne serait pas traversier, mais qui aurait lou\u00e9 son bateau-\u00e2-vapeur \u00e0 quelqu'un qui l'emploierait \u00e0 une traverse. La taxe reposerait sur le bateau et non pas sur la traverse ou sur celui qui l'exploite. Les deux versions du statut n'\u00e9tant pas d'accord je crois que dans ce cas on devrait prendre la version anglaise, sur le principe qu'elle est plus claire et impose une taxe moins rigoureuse et moins \u00e9tendue que celle de la version fran\u00e7aise. La compagnie appelante poss\u00e8de un grand nombre de bateaux-\u00e0-vapeur, mais n'en emploie qu'un seul r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement. Pour une raison ou pour une autre ce bateau est souvent remplac\u00e9 par un autre qui fait le m\u00eame service de la traverse; est-ce \u00e0 dire que ce bateau qui n'est employ\u00e9 que temporairement doit \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme tenant une traverse diff\u00e9rente et soumis \u00e0 une autre taxe de $200.00 ? Telle n'est certainement pas l'intention du statut, et le r\u00e8glement exc\u00e8de en cela les pouvoirs conf\u00e9r\u00e9s \u00e0 la corporation et se trou\u00e9e en cons\u00e9quence ill\u00e9gal.\nL'appelante pr\u00e9tend en outre que l'acte de la l\u00e9gislature de Qu\u00e9bec sur lequel est fond\u00e9 ce r\u00e8glement est ensach\u00e9 d'inconstitutionnalit\u00e9, comme ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9 en violation des dispositions de l'Acte. de l'Am\u00e9rique Britannique du Nord, attribuant au gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral par la section 91, ss. 10, le pouvoir l\u00e9gislatif sur la navigation et les vaisseaux, (navigation and shipping). Les dispositions adopt\u00e9es par la l\u00e9gislature de Qu\u00e9bec ne concernent pas la navigation mais seulement la r\u00e9glementation des traverses qui, d\u00e8s avant l'acte de conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration \u00e9tait sous le contr\u00f4le de la province du Canada, qui avait d\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9 aux corporations \u2022 de Montr\u00e9al et de Qu\u00e9bec le pouvoir de taxer et r\u00e9glementer les traverses. Ce pouvoir n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 retir\u00e9 aux provinces, car il est clair que la ss. 13 de la section 91 ne donnant au gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral que les traverses (ferries) entre deux provinces, ou entre une province et les pays \u00e9trangers, a laiss\u00e9 aux provinces le pouvoir de r\u00e9gler les traverses en dedans de leurs limites Cette interpr\u00e9tation est positivement confirm\u00e9e par la ss. 16 de la section 92 attribuant le pouvoir l\u00e9gislatif aux provinces \"en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral sur toutes affaires d'une nature purement priv\u00e9e on locale dans la province.\" Une traverse du genre de celle dont il s'agit est certainement un sujet d'une nature locale ou Driv\u00e9e tombant sous le pouvoir de la l\u00e9gislature provinciale. Les pouvoirs conf\u00e9r\u00e9s \u00e0 ce sujet par diff\u00e9rents actes du parlement du Canada. avant la Conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration sont encore en pleine force. La consolidation faite de temps \u00e0 autres des statuts concernant les Corporations des cit\u00e9s de Montr\u00e9al et de Qu\u00e9bec, n'a pas en d'autre effet que de continuer ces pouvoirs. Je concours dans les observations sui~ vantes de l'honorable juge Baby sur cette question:\nAvant cette \u00e9poque (la Conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration), il est certain que la Corporation de Montr\u00e9al avait ce pouvoir et l'a exerc\u00e9. Or d'apr\u00e8s la section 129 du dernier acte pr\u00e9cit\u00e9 (Acte de l'Am\u00e9rique Britannique du Nord) toutes los lois en force au Canada lors de l'Union ont continu\u00e9 d'exister comme si la Conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration n'avait pas eu lieu et cela, m\u00eame dans le cas, d'apr\u00e8s les nombreuses d\u00e9cisions d\u00e9j\u00e0 rendues, o\u00f9 ces lois auront \u00e9t\u00e9 renouvel\u00e9es (re-enacted) on refondues, ainsi que nous l'avions jug\u00e9 tout particuli\u00e8rement dans les causes Major v. la Corporation de la cite de Trois-Rivi\u00e8res, et Barras et la Corporation de Qu\u00e9bec.\nJe concours \u00e9galement dans les observations de l'honorable juge tendant \u00e0 \u00e9tablir que la juridiction de la Commission du Havre de Montr\u00e9al n'exclut pas celle de la cit\u00e9\u00b7sur le sujet des traverses. Comme elles sont un peu longues, je ne citerai que celles de Sir A. A. Dorion, J. C. sur le mme sujet:\nAs to the jurisdiction of the Harbour Commissioners that does not interfere with the contract of the city The Harbour Commissioners by their charter are excluded from levying a tax upon ferry-boats plying within nine miles from the city. What was the object of that exception? It was because these boats were already subject to the taxation by the city of Montreal. The corporation of the city have a right to tax the owners of properties extending to the river.\nConcluant \u00e0 l'ill\u00e9galit\u00e9 de l'art. 23 ' du r\u00e8glement attaqu\u00e9, ii est inutile de s'occuper du moyen fond\u00e9 sur l'in\u00e9galit\u00e9 dans l'imposition de cette taxe.

It is evident that the statute does not support this tax. Each steamboat ferry, says the act, not each ferry steamboat, one tax for each ferry never mind how many steamboats are engaged not a tax on each steamboat of a ferry.\nThe appellants, who are proprietors of a ferry on which they work many steamboats, every one of which is taxed at $200 under the said by-law ask that it be quashed. I think their contention well founded. The French version of the statute would rather support the by-law, but as the English version is clearly against it, we must on general principles, determine adversely to the tax.\nI think the appeal should be allowed with costs in all the courts against respondents, distraits, and by-law quashed.\nOn the issue with the Attorney General costs in all the courts against appellants.

Ritchie C.J. and Strong, Fournier, Taschereau and Gwynne JJ.(Mr. Justice Henry heard the argument in this case but died before judgment was delivered).\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.\nPartnership\u2014Liability of one partner for prior debt of co-partner\u2014Promissory note\u2014Collateral for partnership debt\u2014Release of maker.\nP. lent N. an accommodation note which N. deposited with R. as collateral security for a mortgage debt. N. and B, afterwards went into partnership and a new mortgage on partnership property was given to R. for N.\u2019s debt, the note being still left with R. The partnership being dissolved, B. agreed to pay all debts of the firm, including the mortgage, and in settling the accounts between himself and the mortgagees B. was given credit for the amount of the note which P. had paid to the mortgagees. P. sought to recover from B. the amount so paid.\nHeld, reversing the judgment of the court below, Ritchie C.J. and Fournier J. dissenting, that N. having authority to deal with the note as he pleased, and having given it as collateral security for the joint debt of himself and B., on such security being realized by the mortgagees and the amount credited on the joint debt P., the surety, could recover it from either of the debtors.\nSemble,\u2014Assuming P. not to have been liable to pay the note to the mortgagees and that it was a voluntary payment, it having been credited on the mortgage debt, and B. having adopted the payment in the settlement of the accounts between him and the mortgagee, he was liable to repay it.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] reversing the judgment of the Queen\u2019s Bench Division and restoring that of the trial judge who dismissed the plaintiff\u2019s action. The facts of the case may be stated as follows: The plaintiff lent to the defendant Nichol an accommodation note which the latter gave to certain creditors as collateral security for his indebtedness. Nichol and the defendant Baechler afterwards entered into partnership and a mortgage on partnership property was given to secure the above debt of Nichol the creditors still holding the plaintiff\u2019s note. The partnership only existed a few months and on its dissolution Baechler assumed the payment of all liabilities of the firm including said mortgage. An account was settled between Baechler and the mortgagees and the plaintiff having paid the note the amount was credited to Baechler on such settlement, and on the foot of the accounts he covenanted with the mortgagee to pay the balance due after crediting plaintiff\u2019s payment.\nThe plaintiff having brought an action to recover the amount of the note from Baechler, the latter pleaded ignorance of the dealings between the plaintiff and Nichol and claimed that Nichol had received, out of partnership funds, an amount larger than plaintiff\u2019s claim, and that plaintiff could have no higher right than Nichol.\nThe Chief Justice of the Queen\u2019s Bench Division, before whom the case was tried, dismissed the plaintiff\u2019s action, holding that the evidence did not establish the allegations in the statement of claim that the note was deposited as collateral security for the debt of Nichol. The Divisional Court reversed this judgment and ordered Baechler to pay the amount of the note to the plaintiff. The Court of Appeal restored the judgment of the Chief Justice. The plaintiff then appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nMills for the appellant cited Coke on Littleton[2]; Belshaw v. Bush[3]; Moule v. Garrett[4]; Sanderson v. Aston[5]; Henderson v. Killey[6]. Idington Q.C. for the respondent referred to Lindley on Partnership[7]; DeColyar on Guarantees[8]. Mills in reply cited Jones v. Broadhurst[9].\nSir W.J. RITCHIE CJ.\u2014I think the evidence shows that the note was not held as collateral security for the new mortgage debt, nor was the plaintiff, that I can discover from the evidence, ever in the position of a surety for the payment of the joint mortgage. That there is nothing whatever to show the plaintiff\u2019s liability on the note was to continue as security for the new debt the evidence of McPherson would seem to be conclusive. It is as follows:\u2014.\nGeorge McPherson sworn. Examined by Mr. Purdom.\nQ. You are a solicitor practicing at Stratford? A. Yes sir.\nQ. For whom did you act in the matter of this bill? A. I acted for both Mr. Bedford and Mr. Barton.\nQ. I believe the note sued on in this action is in your handwriting, the body of it was filled up by you? A. That is my handwriting except the \u201cThomas Purdom,\u201d except the name of the endorser.\nQ. And you witnessed the execution of that by Baechler? A. Yes sir.\nQ. And some of the others? A. By all except Caroline Baechler.\nQ. Can you explain to us how the amount of that mortgage was made up, what the consideration for the giving of the mortgage was? A. Yes, I gave you some statements to show how I made it up and what it was for.\nHis Lordship.\u2014What mortgage are you speaking of now? A. The mortgage of the 4th April, 76. Mr. Baechler and Nichol to Bedford and Barton. I have a statement which I prepared of the 4th April, \u201876, showing a total of $7,323.00 made up of a\nClaim of Barton\u2019s amounting to.\n$3,803 00\nA claim of Bedford amounting to.\n3,377 00\nAnd paid insurance and advertising.\n142 60\nMaking a total of.\n$7,322 60\nWhen that mortgage was made, before that mortgage was made, on this day this was the indebtedness of Nichol alone, not the indebtedness of Baechler and Nichol, and to induce Baechler to purchase the property along with Nichol, my recollection is that a thousand dollars was thrown off the indebtedness by Bedford and Barton, and a mortgage taken for $6,323.00, being this amount less the $1,000.00.\nMr. Purdom resuming:\nQ. What mortgage was signed by Nichol\u2014by both defendants? A. That is the mortgage that was signed by both defendants.\nQ. Did that mortgage include the whole indebtedness of Nichol and Baechler to Bedford? A. It included all the indebtedness of Nichol up to that time, less the thousand dollars that was thrown off.\nMr. Purdom.\u2014We will examine Mr. McPherson further.\nQ. Did the mortgage that was taken for $6,323.00 include the total indebtedness of Baechler and Nichol to Barton and Redford? A. No, it became an indebtedness of Baechler and Nichol the moment Baechler signed the agreement, previous to this it was the indebtedness of Nichol alone.\nHis Lordship,\u2014Then there is a mortgage? A. On the 4th April, 76, Nichol owed Bedford and Barton $7,323.00. On this day a sale of the property was made to Baechler and Nichol, who formed the partnership.\nQ. You say Nichol owed Redford and Barton? A. Yes, on the 4th April, 76, $7,323.00. Redford and Barton held a deed of this property as a security for their debt.\nQ. It was an absolute deed in form? A. Absolute in form but in reality a mortgage.\nMr. Idington.\u2014Q. The one that is put in? A. Yes.\nHis Lordship resuming:\nQ. That was signed by? A. By Nichol alone, that deed.\nQ. To secure this amount? A. To secure this total amount. Then on the 4th April, 76, Baechler having formed a partnership with Nichol, purchased the property jointly with Nichol from Redford and Barton.\nQ. After they formed their partnership, they did what? A. They purchased from Redford and Barton this mill property at the total indebtedness less $1,000.00 that was forgiven, and on the 4th April, 76, the conveyance was made by Bedford and Barton to Baechler and Nichol, and on the same day a mortgage was given back for the full consideration mentioned in the deed.\nBy Mr. Purdom.\u2014Q. Barton had held the note of the plaintiff prior to the time that mortgage was taken? A. Yes, or I had held it for Barton and Redford, this note of the plaintiff that is sued on now.\nQ. Did you continue to hold it after that mortgage was taken. A. Yes.\nQ. After the mortgage was given did you hold it as collateral security to that mortgage? A. Well, I don\u2019t know whether there was never anything said at all about how it should be held. There never at any time was anything said that I can recollect of of the note being held as collateral security, though that might be the effect of it.\nQ. At all events did you have any claim against Nichol and Baechler outside of the amount stated in the mortgage? A. No claim outside of the amount that was stated.\nHis Lordship.\u2014Q. But the mortgage might be collateral to the note, rather than the note collateral to the mortgage? A. It might be.\nMr. Purdorm resuming:\nQ. Any more than the mortgage was for a larger sum. Do you know as a matter of fact whether the mortgage was collateral to the note or the note to the mortgage? A. I cannot recollect of anything being said about it at all, of there being any arrangement at all. I don\u2019t think that when the mortgage was made that Baechler knew anything whatever about the notes.\nHis Lordship\u2014Well, is that all you know about the note? Do you know when it first came into Mr. Bedford\u2019s hands, or Barton\u2019s hands?\nWitness. My recollection is a couple of weeks after it was drawn in came into my hands and remained with me over a year.\nMr. Idington. Q. That is as attorney for Mr. Barton? A. As attorney for Mr. Barton and Mr. Bedford.\nHis Lordship. It is dated the 14th April, 1875? A. Yes.\nQ. Then it would be somewhere about the 1st May 75 it came into your hands? A. About that time.\nQ. Do you know from whom you received it? A. I received it from Nichol.\nQ. Why did you get it? A. Mr. Bedford and Mr. Barton had arranged; I think the arrangement was that each of them should\u2014that they should carry Nichol in equal amount, that their indebtedness should be made equal by the payment from one to the other of what the excess might be, and then they both instructed me to try and collect a couple of thousand dollars from Nichol if possible without suit. I saw him and thought his friends ought to assist him to that extent, and he said he would try, and he went away and in a week or two he came back and said he had not been able to raise any money. Then I made the other suggestion that instead of paying the cash that possibly if he could get his friends to endorse notes, and I prepared four notes for him of $500 each leaving the name blank as you see in that note, not writing in the name of the endorser, and gave him these four notes to get signed. He was away sometime, perhaps a couple of weeks and brought me back three of them. They were received in that way; whether as collateral I cannot recollect at all, or whether as payment, I cannot recollect. They remained in my safe until after this mortgage was taken.\nBy Mr. Idington. Q. Nichol was the only party to whom the note was given at first? A. Yes. Q. Baechler had nothing to do with the transaction at all? A. Not for a year afterwards.\nQ. And yet you say Baechler never heard of the note? A. Not that I ever heard of, not that I ever knew of]\nQ. Even down to the time you were crediting him on the mortgage? A. I think he had ceased at that time to have much interest in it.\nQ. At the time he signed this agreement he was insolvent? A. Oh, yes, insolvent.\nQ. It was practically a matter of no consequence what he signed? A. He never examined the agreement. He took my figures for it in signing that agreement of the 15th January \u201881.\nQ. It was a desirable thing to get the property sold without costs? A. Yes.\nQ. And he was quite willing you should sell the property and to facilitate your selling it held himself liable for anything you choose to say he was liable for? A. That was the position.\nQ. At the time you got his covenant he was supposed to be quite good? A. Yes.\nQ. That is the covenant in the mortgage? A. Yes.\nI am of opinion that the effect of the transaction of the 4th April, 1876, without the consent or knowledge of Purdom and without any knowledge of Baechler of the existence of the note, was to discharge the plaintiff as surety for Nichol; that when Baechler discharged the mortgage of the 19th of January, 1872, for securing of which the note was held by Baechler, he thereby likewise discharged the note; and when Purdom was sued by Baechler he should have resisted payment: the mortgage having been discharged the note was thereby also discharged; the dealings between the parties changed the whole claim and all right to assert any claim on the note against the indorser ceased to exist, and therefore the payment by the plaintiff was a purely voluntary one as regards the defendant Baechler; therefore I think the Court of Appeal was right in restoring the judgment at the trial.\nThere is no evidence to show that Nichol ever authorised Redford and Barton to retain the note as collateral security for the debt in its altered form. I think the true inference to be drawn from the evidence is. that having obtained the additional security of Baechler\u2019s covenant payable at a shorter time than the note, he being proved to be at the time \u2018in quite good circumstances, might well account for the note not having been considered at all in the transaction or being entirely overlooked, and consequently did not enter into the calculation of any of the parties and formed no portion of the new arrangement but was treated as having served its purpose and as of no account in the new arrangement; it would be somewhat singular that a note not payable until the 17th of April, 1879, should be held as collateral security for a mortgage payable on the 7th of April, 1878, and as Mr. Macpherson shows nothing was said by either of the parties in reference thereto. Unless this is so I must confess it strikes me as somewhat extraordinary that a professional gentlemen who appears to have negotiated the whole transaction with reference to the note should receive and hold such a note and not be able to state whether he held it as a payment or as security, and should have allowed the new transaction to be entered into without consulting the indorser or in any way indicating to the parties that the note was to be held as a continuing security for the indebtedness secured by the new joint mortgage, but on the assumption that the note was not, or was not intended to be taken into account in the new arrangement the matter of the note might very well have escaped his memory.\nAt the time this note was given there was no partnership; it was to be used in payment of, or security for, Nichol\u2019s individual indebtedness to Barton and Redford secured by his mortgage to them; when the firm was formed an entirely new arrangement was entered into and the individual debt of Nichol became a partnership debt in the new firm and the original mortgage was discharged and a new joint liability in. curred, and for which a new mortgage security was taken creating an entirely different transaction. How is it possible to say that under such circumstances the liability of an accommodation indorser can be continued and he be made security without his consent for a joint indebtedness to which he never assented?\nIn the absence, then, of any evidence to show any request on the part of Baechler to become security or to pay this amount for him, or any facts from which such request can be inferred, or any evidence to show that the new arrangement was entered into with the consent of Purdom or that it was ever in the contemplation of the parties to the new arrangement that the liability of the accommodation indorser was to continue and become security for the new joint mortgage, and without any evidence, even, that McPherson held, or professed to hold, the note as collateral security for the debt secured by the new mortgage from Nichol and Baechler to Barton and Redford, I fail to see how the payment to the plaintiff can be looked on in any other light than as a voluntary payment.\nUnder these circumstances I think the appeal should be dismissed.\nSTRONG J.\u2014I am of opinion that this appeal should be allowed. It appears to me that the plaintiff, the present appellant, was entitled to recover on several distinct and independent grounds Putting it merely as a voluntary payment, by Purdom, the appellant\u2019s testator, and assuming him to have been, as the appellant contends, no longer liable on the note, but considering it as a voluntary payment afterwards adopted by Baechler, as in fact it was, it seems clear, on plain principles of law, that the defendant is liable. An adoption of the payment by Baechler is clearly established by what took place on the 15th of January. 1881, when the three accounts i.e. (1) the account between Baechler and the mortgagees jointly and (2 & 3) the separate accounts between Baechler and each of the mortgagees (Barton and Hossie) showing the apportionment of the debt between the two latter, were stated and settled. In all three of these accounts Baechler was given credit for Purdom\u2019s payment. Moreover, on the foot of these accounts Baechler entered into the several covenants with Barton and Hossie which bear even date with the settlement of the accounts, in which covenants he agreed to pay the balance arrived at after crediting Purdom\u2019s payment. Baechler thus, clearly, got the benefit of the payment, and as he executed the covenants on the basis of the accounts stated between himself and the parties entitled to the mortgage in the three different forms before mentioned he thereby, beyond all question, adopted these accounts and assented to the credits therein given to him. This, by itself, is sufficient ground for reversing the judgment of the Court of Appeal, it being a well settled principle of law that a party who adopts a voluntary payment made by a third person on his behalf is liable in an action by the latter for money paid at the request of the debtor, the subsequent adoption warranting an implication of the request.\nSecondly.\u2014Mr. Justice Armour in the Divisional Court puts the Appellant\u2019s right to recover on a distinct ground, in which I also concur. This view of the case may be presented as follows:\u2014\nNichol having sought Purdom\u2019s assistance in the way of a loan of money, Purdom, not finding it convenient to accomodate him with a loan, lent him, instead of cash, his credit in the shape of an accommo- dation indorsement of the promissory note of the 14th April, 1875, for $500, payable four years after date. Purdom did not limit Nichol as to the use he was to make of this promissory note but left him free to use it in any way he thought fit, just as he might \u2018have used the cash if Purdom had been able to accomodate him with the loan first requested Having, thus, authority to deal with the note as he pleased Nichol, first of all, deposited it with Barton as a collateral security and afterwards, when the transaction of the 14th of April, 1876, took place, and Baechler as well as Nichol came under liability for the aggregate amounts of the debts of the latter to both Barton and Redford, Nichol allowed this note to remain as a collateral security in the hands of Barton and Bedford for their consolidated debt, a disposition of it which was entirely within the authority as to its use which had been conferred on Nichol by Purdom.\nThus, it is simply the case of one of two joint debtors giving the creditors the note of a surety as a collateral security for the joint debt and the creditors afterwards realizing the security by enforcing payment from the collateral surety and giving credit on account of the joint debt for the payment so made. Surely in such a case there can scarcely be a doubt that the surety can recover, in the equitable action for money paid, against both of the joint debtors. So that, even if the transaction of the 24th February, 1877, when the deed of dissolution was executed and Baechler undertook to pay the mortgage debt, had never taken place Baechler would still, on the ground last indicated, have been liable to indemnify Purdom, whose money had gone to discharge Baechler\u2019s liability pro tanto, and who would, therefore, to the extent of his payment, have a good equitable claim to stand in the shoes of the creditors who had thus been partially satisfied by him. It is said, however, in answer to this, that Purdom was discharged on the 14th of April, 1876, by the novation resulting from the transaction which then took place. Granting, for the present purpose, that the legal effect of the transaction of that date was to operate as a novation still, as Purdom had no notice of the facts which are said to have constituted his discharge, it is plain, I think, just as Mr. Justice Armour puts it, that his payment under these circumstances is not to be considered a voluntary payment, but Purdom having paid in the bon\u00e2 fide belief of facts warranting the conclusion that he was still liable on the note it stood on precisely the same footing as if he had, in law, remained liable, in which case, the payment having enured to the benefit of Baechler, he would, even without any assent or adoption of it, and that for the reasons before stated, have been liable to reimburse Purdom for the amount he had paid. The authorities referred to in the judgment of Mr. Justice Armour seem to me conclusive on this point.\nThirdly.\u2014At all events, on equitable grounds Baechler must be held liable. Nichol, as before shown, had authority, as between Purdom and himself, to deal with the note, as he in fact did deal with it, by leaving it as collateral security for the consolidated debt of the two creditors, Barton and Bedford, for which, as before stated, he and Baechler became jointly liable. Then, even though Baechler knew nothing about the disposition of the note, Purdom, on paying it, had a perfect right to be subrogated pro tanto to the securities held by the creditors paid by him, viz.: (1) to their rights and actions under and upon the covenant contained in the mortgage deed, and (2) to their rights as against the real security, the land. As to the latter\u2014the land\u2014the plaintiff cannot, in this action, to which the purchaser, Young, and his mortgagee (both of them, probably, purchasers for value without notice) are not parties, have any relief; but under the first head the plaintiff is clearly entitled to relief, as a party entitled to be subrogated to the mortgagees\u2019 rights under the covenant in the mortgage, to the extent of the payment made by him. The only answer which, as far as I can see, can possibly be suggested to this is the state of the pleadings, but no difficulty need be felt on that score, as the Divisional Court expressly gave leave to amend the record in such a way as to adapt it to the facts in evidence.\nThe judgment of the Court of Appeal should be reversed and the judgment of the Divisional Court restored, with costs to the appellant in all the courts.\nFOURNIER J.\u2014I am in favor of dismissing the appeal and restoring the judgment of the late Chief Justice Cameron.

Muir & Co. were agents for two firms, Doty & Co. manufacturers of engines and engine machinery, and the defendants Paxton, Tate & Co. manufacturers of saw mills and saw mill machinery, under separate and distinct authorities, and a contract was made between the plaintiffs and Muir & Co. to supply, for a lump sum of $6,000 to be paid partly in cash and partly in notes, the power and the saw mill and machinery. The agreement was signed by Muir & Co. agents for Doty & Co. and Paxton, Tate & Co. Subsequently Muir & Co. by letters arranged, separately with the firm of Doty & Co. for the saw mill and the respondents for the machinery.\nThe power and machinery were supplied and Muir & Co. haying received the stipulated price paid part of it to Doty & Co. for the power and arranged with the defendants as to amount to be paid them, Muir & Co. retaining for themselves the cash payment. The machinery supplied by the defendants was, however, found to be defective, and the defendants endeavored to remedy the defects, but failed to do so to the satisfaction of the plaintiffs, who brought an action for damages sustained by breach of the contract to supply machinery of a stated capacity. A verdict for $2,000 damages was rendered for the plaintiffs which was set aside by the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench and a non-suit ordered on the ground that Muir & Co. had exceeded their authority by making the contract on behalf of two principals for a lump sum. The plaintiffs then appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nRobinson Q.C. for the appellants.\nAn agent can act for more than one principal, and as to the law of this case there is no difference between a factor and an agent to procure sales. Story on Agency ([1]); Wharton on Agency ([2]); Corlies v. Cumming ([3]).\nIf the defendants had objected to the act of their agent when it first came to their knowledge the plaintiffs would have had difficulty in enforcing their contract, but the defendants ratified the contract by accepting the notes and putting in the machinery and cannot now set up want of authority in the agent. Moss Q.C. for the respondents. It cannot be said that there was any ratification for the defendants knew nothing of Doty & Co.\u2019s connection with the contract.\nIf the defendants are liable on this contract they would be answerable for a breach by Doty & Co. This shows that Muir & Co. could not bind the defendants by such a contract.\nThis is an action for breach of warranty which will not lie because the property had not passed to the plaintiffs when the action was begun, the contract providing that it should not pass until paid for. Frye v. Milligan (1); Friendly v. Canada Transit Co. (2); Tomlinson v. Morris (3).\nSir W. J. RITCHIE C.J.\u2014I think the evidence clearly discloses a contract between the plaintiffs and the defendants through their agent, and adopted by the defendants and acted upon by both parties, and for which the defendants received from the plaintiffs large payments. A clear breach by the defendants of such contract was shown, in fact admitted throughout by the defendants without any question being raised as to their obligation to the plaintiffs for its fulfilment, all of which the correspondence between Cameron & Co., and Paxton, Tate & Co, abundantly demonstrates.\nI cannot discover that Muir & Co., in acting for the two firms of Doty & Co. and Tate & Co., bound either firm beyond the goods and machinery each was to deliver; in other words the contract with Muir was not intended to make Tate & Co. liable for the performance of Doty & Co.\u2019s undertaking or vice vers\u00e2; the price each was to receive was entirely independent of the other, and separate payments appear to have been made to each party irrespective of the other and separate notes appear to have been made out and delivered to the two firms respectively. The correspondence shows that Tate & Co. were informed that Doty & Co. were to supply the motive power while they were to supply the mill, & c. I think the correspondence cannot be read without being forced to the conclusion that the intention is most clearly shown that there should be, and was, throughout the whole, a direct privity of contract between the plaintiffs and the defendants, and I can find nothing to justify the conclusion that Muir & Co. bought the goods from the plaintiffs and resold them to the defendants; on the contrary, I think the jury were fully justified on the evidence in coming to the conclusion that the contract was made and entered into between the plaintiffs and the defendants through Muir & Co. their duly authorized agents in that behalf.\nThe defendants fixed the price of the machinery and the evidence very clearly shows that they looked to the plaintiffs for its payment, and not to Muir & Co. their agent. Doty & Co. appear to have performed their contract and were paid, and I can see no good reason why Tate & Co. should not perform theirs.\nThe only difficulty in my mind has been as to the amount of damages the plaintiffs are entitled to recover for such non-fulfilment on their part of the contract, but the case seems to me to have been very fairly left to the jury, and I can find no sufficient grounds for disturbing their finding.\nUnder these circumstances I think the appeal should be allowed,\nSTRONQ J.\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench of Manitoba, making absolute a rule for a non-suit in an action brought by the appellants against the respondents in respect of an alleged breach of warranty said to be contained in a contract for the sale of a set of machinery for a saw 40 mill. The facts, so far as they are material to the present appeal, may be stated as follows: In February, 1884, the appellants, who, together with a Mr. Caldwell. (since dead), were in partnership as lumber manufacturers, had had a quantity of saw logs on the shores of the Lake of the Woods and in the neighborhood of Rat Portage, which they intended to cut up at Rat Portage, for which purpose they proposed to erect a saw mill there. In order to procure the necessary machinery for this mill the appellants applied to Mr. Robert Muir, who carried on business as a machinery agent or broker at Winnipeg, and who was the agent, under separate and independent authorities, of the respondents, who were manufacturers of mill machinery at Port Perry, in Ontario, and also of the John Doty Engine Company, a company engaged in the manufacture of steam engines and steam machinery at Toronto. The authority under which Muir acted for the respondents was in writing and was as follows:\nPORT PERRY, ONTARIO, 5th July, 1883.\nTo ROBERT MUIR, ESQ., Machinery Broker,\nP. O. Box 584, Winnipeg, Man.\nDear Sir,\u2014We hereby agree to give you the sole agency for our circular saw mills, shingle machines, turbine water wheels and mill machinery, in Keewatin, Manitoba, and N. W. Territory. You are to sell by price lists used by us upon which we will give you 12 per cent, commission on all the above excepting mill machinery, upon which we pay 5 per cent, commission.

You are to use your best endeavors to sell\u2019 on short time, all notes to draw seven per cent, interest per annum. While selling for us you are not to sell for any other firm. Goods as above mentioned, excepting when we cannot fill your orders, in such cases you are at liberty to get from others. You are to use a reasonable diligence in pushing the business and advancing our interest by advertising, & c, & c. We will in all practicable cases direct parties to you to close contracts.

You to agree to accept drafts for any goods remaining in stock, with the privilege of making return drafts for what goods remain in stock when said drafts mature. Where an order is lost through our not shipping in time agreed upon we will pay you a half commission on said sale.\nPAXTON, TATE & CO.\nThe negotiations with Muir resulted in a contract, entered into on the 8th of February, 1884, for the sale by Muir to the appellants of the machinery for the saw mill and also of the engine and machinery for motive power for working it. This contract is contained in two letters (exhibits 7 and 8) which were taken as proved at the trial and which are in the following words:\u2014\nWINNIPEG, 8th Feb., 1884.\nROBERT MUIR & Co.,\nAgents for John Doty Engine Co. and Paxton, Tate & Co. Sir,\u2014Furnish us circular saw mill, saw not included, 240 h. p. boilers, 175 h. p. engine, 1 Steam\u2019s double edger, 1 slab saw, 1 cut off saw, 10 live rolls, 1 bull wheel rig without chain, 1 steam pump, 3 by 5 cylinder, necessary shafting, hangers, boxing and as per your letter of 8th February, or to day such as made by and deliver the same for us at Winnipeg about the 1st day of April, 1884, for which we agree to pay the sum of six thousand dollars on delivery in payment as follows:\u2014Cash, a satisfactory note for $\u2014, due 188\u2014, with interest at\u2014per cent.

This order and your acceptance thereof constitute the whole contract between us, and there is no other agreement between us respecting these articles but what is herein expressed.\nCALDWELL & MOFFAT.\nEXHIBIT 8.\nWINNIPEG, MAN., 8th February, 1884.\nMessrs. MOFFATT & CALDWELL, Winnipeg:\nGentlemen,\u2014For the sum of six thousand dollars we will deliver to you f.o.b. in Winnipeg the following machinery, viz.:\u2014One circular Saw mill to cut logs 30 feet long, saw not included, with all necessary shafting, pulleys and boxing, 1 Steam\u2019s double edger, 1 slab cut off saw with four saws, 10 live rolls 9 by 20 friction bull wheel rig without chain, steam pump, Northey\u2019s, with water cylinder 3 by 5, shafting, hanger, boxing and pulleys to drive (two) boilers of 40 h.p. capacity each, one engine of 70 h.p. capacity, 60 feet of suitable smoke stack. This mill to be capable of cutting about 30,000 feet of lumber per day of 12 hours; the whole to be built in a first class workmanlike manner of good material. The chain for jacker is worth $1 to $1.50 per foot, according to weight.\nYours truly,\nROBERT MUIR & CO.,\nAgents for John Doty Eng. Co. and Paxton, Tate & Co.\nP.S.\u2014The above does not include saw, belting or chain.\nImmediately upon the contract being completed, Muir ordered the, mill machinery from the respondents and the steam engine and the machinery connected with it from the John Doty Engine Company for separate prices, the orders so given being entirely independent of and unconnected with each other. The respondents\u2019 firm, as well as the John Doty Engine Company, accepted the orders respectively addressed to them, and in fulfilment of them manufactured and forwarded the machinery and engine to Muir & Co. at Winnipeg, who sent the same to the appellants\u2019 firm at Rat Portage. The price agreed to be paid by Muir & Co. to the Doty Engine Company and to the respondents respectively did not amount in the aggregate to the $6,000, which, as stipulated in the letter of the 8th of February, was the price to be paid by the appellants to Muir & Co. The price of $6,000 which was the amount agreed to be paid by the appellants to Muir & Co. for all the machinery, as well for the engine and machinery for motive power obtained from the John Doty & Co. as for the mill machinery furnished by the respondents, was settled by the appellants by a payment to Muir & Co. of $2,000 in cash and the delivery to them of promissory notes for the residue of $4,000. Some of these notes were handed by Muir & Co. to the respondents, to whom they were made payable, and the others were delivered to the John Doty Company, but the whole of the $2,000 paid in cash was retained by Muir & Co., and no portion of it was paid over by them either to the respondents or to the Doty Company, nor, so far as the evidence shows, was any distribution of it between the respondents and the John Doty Company made by Muir & Co., even in the way of apportioning it as credits in account. The machinery was erected and the mill got into working order some time in July, 1884, but the appellants very soon after they had begun to saw complained that the mill was of inadequate capacity to cut the quantity of lumber stipulated for, and that it was in other respects not according to the contract. Direct negotiations for remedying the defects in the machinery of the mill were then entered upon between the appellants and the respondents, and the respondents then proposed to furnish new machinery and to enter into a new and supplementary contract for that purpose, but these negotiations never reached the stage of actual contract, and they were wholly broken off after the respondents had sent up to Rat Portage some new and additional machinery with instructions that it was not to be delivered to the appellants until certain payments were made, which payments the appellants refused to make, whereupon this proposed new arrangement came entirely to an end, and the machinery which had been forwarded was retained by the respondents. The appellants soon afterwards, and in August, 1885, commenced this action for a breach of the contract of February, 1884. The declaration as originally framed contained three counts, besides the common counts, to which an additional count was afterward added under a judge\u2019s order, but all these counts were for various breaches of the original contract of February, 1884, which the declaration averred to have been made with the respondents. The defendants pleaded a variety of pleas, but it is sufficient for the present purpose to say that the first plea was an express traverse of the allegations in the declaration that the contract set out in the different counts was one which had been entered into with the respondents. At the trial, which took place before the present Chief Justice of Manitoba, a number of witnesses were examined, the evidence being principally directed to the question of the sufficiency of the mill and to the damages. There were, however, four witnesses examined who were able to speak as to the contract and as to the subsequent proposals to furnish new machinery, viz., the appellants Messrs. Cameron and Moffat, Mr. Dryden, one of the respondents, and Mr. Muir, with whom the contract of February, 1884, was actually made, as already mentioned. None of this evidence established the existence, de facto, of any contract other than that entered into with Muir at Winnipeg, and which is contained in the two letters bearing the date of the 8th of February, 1884, already set forth. At the trial the defendants\u2019 counsel, at the close of the plaintiffs\u2019 case, moved for a non-suit upon several grounds, one of them being that there was never any privity of contract between the appellants and the respondents. At page 121 of the printed case we find this objection thus distinctly stated by the counsel for the defendants in these words:\nThe contract at most is only a contract of these plaintiffs with Muir & Co., and not a contract with these defendants. If we have made any contract whatever it is a contract with Muir to deliver f.o.b., at Port Perry at certain prices, and Muir\u2019s contract was not the same with these plaintiffs, but was a contract to deliver free at Winnipeg, showing that they are not the same contract. We never agreed to deliver at Winnipeg; we agreed to deliver at Port Perry, and therefore there are two contracts, and if we are answerable to any one it is only to Muir. That would be, in effect, that Muir in this transaction was not acting as our agent, but was acting as a seller himself, to these plaintiffs.\nThe learned judge refused to non-suit, but reserved leave to the defendants to move in term, and the case proceeded with the result that there was a verdict for the plaintiffs for $2,500. Subsequently the respondents moved the court in banc for a non-suit on the leave reserved, or for a new trial, and the court after argument ordered a non-suit to be entered. The learned judge who delivered the judgment of the court, Mr. Justice Killam, expressly rests the decision upon the ground already mentioned as having been taken on the motion for a non-suit at the trial, viz., that there never was any contract such as that sued upon in existence as between the appellants and the respondents. It lies therefore upon the appellants, who now impugn the correctness of this judgment of the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench, to show that the specific ground thus taken is erroneous before they can entitle themselves to a reversal, and we must therefore proceed to inquire whether they have succeeded in doing this.\nThe materials upon which we must determine whether there ever was, either originally or by ratification, a contract between the parties, consist of the evidence of the depositions of the four witnesses already named, and some documentary evidence, comprising the letters of the 8th February, 1884, which contain the original contract with Muir and certain letters referred, to in the appellants\u2019 factum which passed between the appellants and the respondents when they came into direct communication after the mill had been tried and found defective. There cannot be any doubt or question that the written contract contained in the letters signed by the appellants and Muir respectively and dated the 8th of February, 1884, (exhibits 7 and 8) was on its face a contract exclusively between Muir as vendor and the appellants as purchasers. Then this contract was one for the sale of the engine and the machinery required for the power and the mill machinery in one lot for one single lump price. But although this written contract on its face purports to be, and according to the only admissible construction of it is, one between the appellants and Muir exclusively, yet according to the principles laid down in the well known case of Higgins v. Senior ([4]) it was competent for the appellants to establish by parol evidence that, beyond and in addition to the liability of Muir, the respondents were liable as principals on whose behalf the contract had been entered into. But in order to do this it was, of course, requisite that the appellants should show, not only that Muir intended to bind the respondents, but also that he either had authority to enter into a contract on their behalf, identical in terms with that of the 8th of February, 1884, or that, if such a contract had been originally entered into without authority, it had been subsequently ratified by those whom Muir had assumed to represent and to bind by it. Then neither of these conditions has been fulfilled by the appellants. The terms of the authority which had been conferred on Muir by the respondents are to be found clearly stated and denned in the letter of the 5th July, 1883, (exhibit 9) already set forth, but they contain nothing which empowered him to enter into such a contract as that contained in the letters to the 8th February, 1884, whereby the goods to be furnished by the respondents and those of the John Doty Engine Co., are combined in one lot and agreed to be sold for one single, indivisible price. As regards the John Doty Engine Co., no written authority from them to Muir has been put in evidence, and as regards both the last mentioned company and the respondents the oral testimony is destitute of anything to show that such authority as Muir must have had, in order that he should have been authorized to bind his principals by the terms of the agreement actually made, was ever conferred upon him by either of his constituents.\nNext, as to ratification. In order to bind the parties, in whose name and behalf an unauthorized person has assumed to enter into a contract, by subsequent recognition and adoption it must be shown that either expressly, or impliedly by conduct, the parties whom it is sought to bind have, with a full knowledge of all the terms of the agreement come to by the person who assumed to bind them, assented to the same terms and agreed to abide by and be bound by the contract undertaken on their behalf. But can it be said that the evidence in the present case, either oral or documentary, shows such a ratification? The answer must be that beyond all question it does not. In order to make out a ratification here it would be essential to show that both the respondents and the John Doty Company had assented to the terms of agreement and adopted the contract contained in the letters which had been interchanged by Muir and the appellants, by which as already shown all the machinery described in the letters, as well that to be supplied by the one firm for the motive power, as that to be furnished by the other for the saw mill, were included in one joint sale for one single price and by which each firm further agreed to warrant all the machinery (not only that supplied by itself, but also that to be supplied by the other firm) and its fitness and sufficiency for the purposes specified in the contract. The evidence entirely fails to establish any such joint adoption and it is impossible to point to anything in it indicating that the respondents ever assented to any such terms or ratified any such contract. Indeed there is nothing to show that the terms of the contract between Muir and the appellants were ever communicated to or brought to the notice of the respondents, or the John Doty Company, so that each firm so far from intending to become joint vendors with the other was, as we must assume, entirely ignorant of the essential fact that Muir had included the goods of both in one contract of sale, and had agreed to such provisions that the effect of a ratification would have involved the unreasonable consequence that each manufacturer would have become a warrantor of the goods of the other.\nThe case which we have before us for decision may be made even more plain by a simple illustration. The owner of a carriage sends it to a repository for sale and the owner of a horse sends it to the same repository for the same purpose, the two owners having no connection but each acting independently of the other. Further, each owner gives authority to warrant his own property. The commission agent to whom the property is thus entrusted for sale thinks fit, it may be with a view of making a more advantageous sale, to include the horse and carriage in one lot and to sell them together for one price and with a general warranty of both. Could it be said in such a case that, apart from any evidence of custom or usage, the agent had properly executed the authority conferred upon him, and that the owner of the carriage was bound by the warranty of the horse and the owner of the horse by the warranty of the carriage? And would each owner be bound to accept such proportion of the price as (he agent might think fit to assign to him? And further, if the owner of the horse were to accept such portion of the price as the agent might choose to pay over to him without informing him how the sale had really been effected, Could it be said that he thereby ratified the unauthorized mode of selling and bound himself not only to make good the warranty of his own horse but that of the other man\u2019s carriage as well? In this plain case every one would say at once that such conclusions would be manifestly unjust and entirely inadmissible. Then in all essential features the case supposed is indistinguishable from that now before us.\nThe authorities referred to in the appellants\u2019 factum do not support the proposition for which they were cited, viz., that such a sale as that made in the present case was within the implied powers of the agent, although no express authority to that effect had been conferred. The case of a sale by a factor referred to in the passages quoted from Story on Agency and Wharton on Agency, and which was the subject of decision in the case of Corlies v. Cummings ([5]), where it was held that a factor could, where such a mode of dealing was sanctioned by the usage and custom of the market in which he dealt, bind two independent and unconnected principals by the sale of the goods of both in one lot, can manifestly only apply where the goods of both principals are commodities of the same kind, and are sold either at a ratable price, or at a price susceptible of a ratable apportionment, as a quantity of wheat at so much a bushel, or of flour at so much a barrel, or (as was the actual case in Corlies v. Cummings) of cheese at so much a hundred weight\u2014all cases in which, such staple merchandise having been sold in a lot for one fixed price, the factor or agent can easily apportion the price between his principals according to the quantity of goods each may have contributed to the common lot. In such cases the principals are not entirely dependent on the mere arbitrary discretion of the agent for the portion of the price which each is to receive, although they do certainly even in that case trust to the fairness and good faith of their agent not to prejudice them by allotting their goods with others of inferior quality; and this last consideration shows that, even as applied to goods such as have been just referred to, this mode of selling can only be admissible, in the absence of express authority, where it is warranted by a recognized and well established mercantile usage. But where the articles included in the sale by the agent are different in kind, as in this case, and as in the case put of the horse and carriage, such a mode of executing the agent\u2019s authority cannot possibly be otherwise than ultra vires, for the simple reason that there is no principle or rule upon which he can apportion the price between his constituents, so that, if it is distributed, the division must be according to the mere arbitrary will of the agent to which it is not to be inferred that the principals ever intended to submit themselves for such a purpose. Applying these considerations to the facts of the case now in appeal, the inevitable conclusion is that Muir had no authority, either express or implied, to bind the respondents by such a contract as that he entered into with the appellants, and further that nothing was ever done by the respondents which could amount to a ratification of such a contract, even assuming that the evidence shows that it was Muir\u2019s intention, so far as he had it in his power to do so, to bind his principals in the terms of his own agreement of the 8th February, 1884, a question, which m the view taken of the other points, it is not worth while to consider. Therefore, save in so far as any new rights and obligations may appear to have been created in the course of the direct negotiations which sprung, up between the appellants and the respondents subsequent to the delivery and erection of the machinery, there never was any contract between them such as the appellants have set forth in their declaration, but the agreement of the 8th February, 1884, was an executory contract of sale by which Muir exclusively agreed to sell to the appellants all the machinery mentioned for $6,000; and it was in order to carry out this agreement with the appellants that Muir subsequently became himself, in his own name and in his own behalf, in separate lots and for separate prices, the purchaser from the respondents and the Doty Company of the two sets of machinery which he had thus agreed to sell to the appellants. Further, this view is confirmed by what was pointed out by the defendants\u2019 counsel at the trial, that whilst in the agreement between Muir and the appellants the former is bound to deliver f. o. b. at Winnipeg, the respondents, in their contract with Muir, only undertook to deliver at Port Perry, thus showing, as strongly as anything could, that the two contracts, containing different terms on such an. important point as delivery, could not be parts of the same whole, but were, according to the foregoing conclusion, separate and distinct agreements between different parties.\nIt follows that for any breach of the agreement with the appellants they should have sued Muir, and not the respondents between whom and themselves there was no privity of contract.\nOf course if there really had been separate prices for the two sets of machinery, that required for the saw mill and that for the steam power, it might have made no difference that in the written contract with Muir a single lump price was alone named, for in such a case it might have been said that, whilst the written contract with Muir, the agent, comprised all the machinery and bound him accordingly, there was behind this written contract two other distinct and several contracts made by parol through the agency of Muir, but with his two principals, which latter contracts having been executed by the receipt and acceptance of the goods, thus taking them out of the statutes extending the provisions of the statute of frauds to contracts for the sale of goods not in esse, were binding though not in writing. But there is no express evidence of any such distinct parol contract with the respondents, nor are there any facts in evidence which could properly have been left to the consideration of the jury as warranting the implication of a contract of this kind. From first to last there never was any division of the single price of $6,000 in such a way that separate prices could be assigned to the two different sets of machinery to be furnished by the respondents and the Doty Company respectively; and no principle can be suggested on which, as between the appellants and respondents, it can be said that there was a sale or an agreement for a sale of the saw mill machinery by itself for a price which the appellants were to pay. Of the whole price of $6,000 for both sets of machinery $2,000 was paid in cash by the appellants to Muir, and for the difference notes were given. As to the latter portion of the price there certainly was a division and an appropriation of it between the two vendors but as to the sum paid in cash to Muir no division of it was ever made and no principle has been indicated or even suggested on. which it could be divided. I have carefully examined the depositions of the two appellants, of the respondent Dryden, and of Mr. Muir, the only witnesses who were conversant with the facts bearing on this point, and they all fail to give any clue to a solution of the difficulty. The documentary evidence is equally deficient in this respect. Any division of the cash part of the price would, therefore, have been purely arbitrary. Therefore, even if we assume that it was open to the appellants to have established by parol evidence that there was originally a separate contract for the mill machinery between themselves and the respondents, we must hold that they have failed to do so, for the reason that it is essential to a contract of sale, executed or executory, that there should be a price either ascertained or ascertainable to be paid by the vendees and received by the vendors, and in the present case it is apparent that there never was any such price as between the respondents and the appellants, the price paid to the former by Muir for the goods supplied by them having been the amount of the notes which he procured the appellants to make and handed over to the respondents and which did not represent the whole price which the appellants were to pay and did pay to him. Further, it may well be doubted, even if such a parol contract distinct from the written contract with Muir could have been implied from the surrounding circumstances, whether it would have been taken out of the provisions of the act already mentioned, inasmuch as the acceptance and receipt of the goods would have been referable, not to any separate contract with the respondents, but exclusively to the written agreement with Muir, as would have been apparent from the price actually paid. Next, it cannot be said that there was any new contract arising out of the subsequent direct negotiations between the appellants and respondents as to making good the alleged defects in the machinery. The offers and counter offers as to supplying new machinery never ripened into a contract, and there is nothing which I can find, either in the oral evidence or the correspondence, which shows that there was between the parties any binding contract or agreement operating retroactively to convert the original contract of the appellants with Muir into a several contract for an ascertained price or consideration with the respondents. To establish this, everything which is required to make out what is termed \u201cnovation\u201d would have been essential, and therefore some new consideration would have been indispensable; no such new consideration can, however, be pointed out.\nAs regards the passages in the correspondence between the parties, in which the respondents refer to a contract between the appellants and themselves and the appellants similarly to a contract with the respondents, it is to be observed that their admissions could not by themselves have been properly left to the jury, for they show nothing more than that the parties had adopted erroneous opinions of their legal obligations and rights, and consequently the letters referred to could not possibly have had the effect of creating liabilities not otherwise existing.\nLastly, I am of opinion that there was no evidence to show that in the course of the negotiations for a settlement the respondents did or said anything to estop themselves from insisting on the defence which they distinctly put forward at the trial and afterwards successfully urged in term, viz., that there never was any privity of contract between them and the appellants; indeed it is hard to see in the present state of the pleadings how such an answer to this defence could possibly have been admissible.\nMy conclusion is that the non-suit was in all respects right and that this appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nFOURNIER J.\u2014I concur in the reasons given by the Chief Justice for allowing the appeal.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014I am of opinion that this appeal should be dismissed for the reasons given by my brother Strong.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014The respondents who are founders and machinists trading under the name of Paxton, Tate & Co., in manufacturing saw mill machinery at Port Perry in the Province of Ontario, in reply to an application made to them by Robert Muir, of the firm of, or trading as the firm of Robert Muir & Co., at Winnipeg in the Province of Manitoba, as jobbers and machinery brokers, appointed the said Robert Muir as their agent\u2019 by a letter dated the 5th July, 1833, which is as follows ([6]):\u2014\nOn the 21st November, 1883, Mr. Muir addressed and mailed to the defendants a letter of that date, which counsel for the defendants admitted to have been received by them, and which as read from Mr. Muir\u2019s letter book is as follows:\nWINNIPEG, 21st November, 1883.\nMessrs. PAXTON, TATE & Co., Port Perry:\u2014\nGents,\u2014I have written you a note in pencil re saw mill, I now give you a description of mill so that no mistake will arise. The parties to purchase are connected with the Imperial Bank here, they want a mill that will cut 30,000 feet per day of eleven hours to cut timber 30 feet long. The mill to include one double edger, one slab saw, one butting saw, the necessary shafting, pulleys, hangers, & c, required to drive them, also live rolls to carry the timber from saw as per Steam\u2019s circular, also bull wheel for endless chain. The mill to be complete, excepting the saw, endless chain and belting, a price per foot to be given for chain. The mill would be driven by 80 h. p. boiler, with 65 h. p. engine. In my former letter I asked you to wire me a price for the mill, giving the net price to me f.o.b. I can then add my commission j if any mistake has arisen you can correct by wire. The mill would require to be first-class. The building is up and the plan could be furnished.\nYours truly,\nROBERT MUIR & CO.\nThe reply to this letter was not produced, but that there was one appears from a letter of 12th December, 1883, from Paxton, Tate & Co. to Muir & Co., relating to other matters, in which the following passage occurs:\nIn regard to the saw mill outfit you were writing us about we found on examining Steam\u2019s catalogue you sent us that their live rolls were made of iron and much more expensive than we first included in our tender, hence our second telegram set you right. What is being done about the order?\nThe contract sued upon was contained in two letters dated the 8th February, 1884, one from Robert Muir& Co., written by Mr. Muir to Messrs. Moffatt & Caldwell and the other from the latter to the former. The original letters were not forthcoming, but secondary evidence was given of them. That written by Mr. Muir taken from his letter-book was as follows ([7]):\u2014\nThe answer to this letter was written upon a printed form of orders, of Muir & Go\u2019s., one of which Mr. Muir produced and filled in, with exception of blanks as to payment, as to which he stated that the agreement was that $2000 should be paid in cash and the balance on time in three payments at four, five and six months, but in what sums respectively did not appear. Nothing, however, turns upon this.\nThe reply as filled in by Mr. Muir was as follows ([8]):\u2014\nNeither this contract or a copy of it was ever sent to the defendants, but on the 11th and 13th February, 1884, Mr. Muir wrote to them the following letters:\u2014\nWINNIPEG, 11th February, 1884.\nMessrs. PAXTON, TATE & Co., Port Perry:\u2014\nGents,\u2014Have taken an order for saw mill from Messrs. Caldwell & Moffatt. It is the machinery we wrote you about on November 21. The mill is to be capable of cutting 30,000 feet of lumber per day of eleven hours. The machinery is to include circular mill with carriage to cut logs 40 feet long, without saw, one Steam\u2019s double edger, one slab cut off saw (4 saws), one butting saw, 10 live rolls 9 by 20, and driving gear friction bull wheel, viz., without chain, all necessary shafting, pulleys and boxing. The whole to be built in a first-class workmanlike manner of good material. Will send the length of jack chain in a few days, also size of saws required. This mill is to be an A 1 mill. It will be placed at Rat Portage among mills cutting 100,000 per day, manufactured by Sterns, E. Allis & Co., and we want it to give a good account of itself. Make it heavy. See that the bull wheel is heavy enough j the butting saw, not an emery and garland trimmer, but a common butting saw. Let us know the price of butter and we will try and get the difference between it and the trimmer. This would make a much better rig. The edger now here will do for this mill. Arrange every thing in good shape for work. Will send plan of building now up, so that you can work from it. I have contracted for the complete mill delivered at Winnipeg. We have not been able to get a cash payment much larger than to cover freight. We have cash to pay for a steam pump. They will pay cash for saws and chains. The payments are four, five and six months from delivery at Winnipeg. The customers are good. They have a timber limit from the Imperial Bank at a low rate. Doty promised them six months on the power when we first made the offer. Have had to cut down, or lose this contract, to get it. The opposition was strong. We have agreed to deliver here by April 1. You will need to ship by March 1, and on no account later than 15th. The carriage should be made with% platform for men to ride on. Let us know the weight of what you will ship and if it will go on one car. Doty furnish the power\u201480 h. p. boiler, 70 h.p. engine. They will add more machinery. Let us have a description of lath machine on list $100 and weight.\nYours truly,\nR. MUIR & CO.\nWINNIPEG, 13th February, 1884.\nPaxton, TATE & Co., Port Perry:\u2014\nGents,\u2014The dogs for mill ordered were to be lever dogs. Moffatt insisted upon them. Kindly send me a price list of the different items composing this mill\u2014that is net to us, also an estimate of probable weight of shafting, pulleys, boxing, & c, so that we may see how we stand. If we can afford it we will reduce the price of lumber trimmer so that we may get it in and make a complete outfit.\nYours truly,\nMUIR & CO.\nOn the 25th February, 1884, Paxton, Tate & Co. Wrote a letter of that date, in reply to the above, addressed to Messrs. Robert Muir & Co., as follows:\u2014\nGents,\u2014Your letters duly came to hand, and we would have replied promptly, but for delay in getting the plan, which only reached us Saturday afternoon. Now are we to follow Mr. Hackett\u2019s plans? If he is to do the work we presume we must work the machinery as he has drawn it out. Better telegraph at our expense who the millwright is to be, and his post office address, as we wish to get a few more particulars. We are not quite sure whether we can get all on one car, we are afraid we cannot. We will make the Lane mill, left hand, and be working at bull wheel rig in the meantime. But be sure and let us know the millwright\u2019s name and address as soon as it is possible to do so Mr. Doty, jun., has gone up to see about changing the pulleys, & c, so keep us posted about the change if any. We will write you again as soon as we understand the plan better. Herewith find picture of lath mill, weight about 1200 lbs. It is liked much better than a Waterous machine. We can make a lumber trimmer, say with two saws, thus allowing room to shift the board before it reaches the second saw, so that you can adapt it to any length of boards, price, say $1.50. How would that do in place of an Emery and Garland trimmer? The plan shows 19 or 20 live rolls, but you only call for 10. Train just in, must close.\nYours, & c.,\nPAXTON, TATE & CO.\nNo answer to this letter is produced unless a letter of March 18, 1884, is an answer to it. Muir having upon the 17th March arranged with the plaintiffs to make certain alterations in the contract of the 8th February, namely, to substitute a trimmer for the cut off saw and the slab saw, wrote to Paxton, Tate & Co. the 18th March as follows:\u2014\nGentlemen,\u2014Messrs. Caldwell & Moffatt have decided to leave out both slab and cut off saws, and in place put in an Emery & Garland trimmer to cut 12, 14,16 feet. They are going to use the trimmer to cut what slabs they need to cut. The saws are to be solid tooth medium in guage, to be 52\u00b0 and 54\u00b0, one of each. The timber is small have teeth say 3 inches from point to point. They also want us to order the belting. Will you please take the sizes from plan giving us a list of belts and lengths? We can purchase cheaply here, but there may be some sizes that will not be in stock. We have another car leaving Doty\u2019s about April 1, and can order any belting we cannot get here. Caldwell & Moffatt have decided not to put in the shingle and lath mill at present. Ship the car vi\u00e2 Grand Trunk R.R. to Chicago, then by Albert Lea route. Bill to us at Rat Portage as we pass customs here and forward. We presume you can put all on one car.\nYours truly,\nROBERT MUIR.\nNow Mr. Muir, in his evidence, stated that what he had asked the defendants to forward to him as to quotations was\u2014that they should quote prices of the several articles they should supply free on board at Port Perry and that the order would be filled when put on board there free; he said further that the defendants did supply him with their prices for the articles supplied by them as asked for, which, as appears by the letter of the 13th February, 1884, was \u201cnet\u201d to them, Muir & Co. Mr. Moffatt, one of the plaintiffs, in his evidence stated that the plaintiffs knew nothing about the detailed prices of any of the articles supplied, whether those which were supplied through Doty or through the defendants, that they knew nothing about what portion of the articles to fulfil the contract they made, as contained m the letters of 8th February, 1884, would be supplied by Doty or what by defendants\u2014that they had nothing to say to apportioning the $6,000 they agreed to pay for the whole work between Doty & Co. and the defendants. In short his evidence amounted to this, that they paid Muir & Co. in cash, as they had agreed, $2,000 of the disposition of which the plaintiffs knew nothing and that they signed six notes which Muir had drawn in favor of Paxton, Tate & Co.\nThe plaintiffs having declared upon a contract alleged to have been made between them and the defendants for the specific articles mentioned in the declaration, which articles as delivered to the plaintiffs they contend are not conformable to the contract, and the contract relied upon being that contained in the letters of the 8th February, 1884, the case seems to be resolved into a simple question of construction of those letters. If they do not contain in them the contract declared upon, that is to say, a contract between the defendants and the plaintiffs for the sale and delivery to the plaintiffs, by the defendants, of the specific articles mentioned in the declaration, the nonsuit ordered by the Supreme Court of Manitoba is correct, and no question of ratification can arise, for if the true construction of the contract as contained in the letters be that it is a single contract between the plaintiffs and Muir & Co. for all the work therein r specified, and not two separate distinct contracts, the one with Doty & Co. for part, and the other with the defendants for other part, in such case there was nothing for the defendants to ratify; and, moreover, there is no evidence or suggestion that the defendants had any knowledge as to the terms of the actual contract entered into by Muir & Co. with the plaintiffs, until those terms appeared in evidence upon the trial of this cause; so that in either case ratification by the defendants of the contract, as appearing in the letter of the 8th February, appears to be out of the question. What then is the true construction of the contract as appearing in the letters of the 8th February, 1884? That seems to me to be the simple question to be determined. And, in my opinion, the true construction is that the contract entered into by the plaintiffs was one indivisible contract entered into by them with Muir & Co. as principals for goods, which, it is true, the latter contemplated procuring, partly from Doty & Co. and partly from the defendants, but with which the plaintiffs had nothing to do. The plaintiffs knew nothing as to what parts were to be procured from Doty & Co., and what from the defendants, or what should be the prices to be paid to Doty & Co. and to the defendants respectively, for such parts as they should respectively supply. These were matters in which the plaintiffs were in no way concerned nor, in fact, were they concerned whether Muir & Co. should get any part of the articles contracted for, either from Doty & Co. or from the defendants. Then, again, the contract is for a sawmill complete, with all the articles specified, including steam power and steam engine and everything else; now if the steam engine and power should not have been supplied at all there is no obligation upon the plaintiffs to take the remaining articles or vice vers\u00e2. The plaintiffs were by their contract entitled to have the whole of the things contracted for by them before they could be obliged to pay anything under the contract. Mutuality of obligation under the contract can alone exist by treating the plaintiffs and Muir & Co. as the sole parties to it and as principals. It is incapable of being construed to be a separate contract made by the plaintiffs with the defendants for the sale and delivery, by the latter to the former, of the specific articles mentioned in the declaration, in respect of which the contract provides for no price or terms of payment, and a separate contract entered into by the plaintiffs with Doty & Co. for the sale and delivery, by the latter to the former, of the steam power and engine, & c, & c, as to which neither does the contract specify any price or terms of payment. The last clauses of the document of the 8th February signed by the plaintiffs shews, conclusively I think, that the plaintiffs were entering into and perfectly understood that they were entering into one indivisible contract with Muir & Co. as principals, namely, \u201c this order and your acceptance thereof constitute the whole contract between us and there is no other agreement between us, respecting those articles but what is herein expressed.\u201d\nMuir & Co. were, as it appears to me, dealing with the defendants in the matter from November, 1883, in such a manner as to enable them to determine whether they should enter into a separate contract for the defendants with the plaintiffs, as to the articles manufactured by the defendants on the agreed terms of agency and commission; and another contract between Doty & Co. and the plaintiffs as to the articles manufactured by Doty & Co., or whether they could purchase from the defendants and Doty & Co. the articles manufactured by them respectively upon such terms as would enable them to enter into an independent contract themselves with the plaintiffs which would probably give to them, Muir & Co., a greater profit than their commission upon separate contracts, entered into by them as agents of Doty & Co. and the defendants respectively would give them, and that they finally concluded to enter into such an independent contract themselves as principals. Their letters of the 21st November, 1883, and the 11th and 13th February, 1884, in my opinion support this view. In that of the 11th February, it appears that they and not the defendants determined that the edger of the defendants, then in Winnipeg in the hands of Muir & Co., would fill the contract they had entered into, and it is in the alleged utter insufficiency of this edger to meet their contract that the plaintiffs\u2019 chief complaint consists. Then the letter of the 13th February seems to me to be conclusive as to Muir & Co\u2019s. intention being that the contract was their own as principals with the plaintiffs. No stress or argument whatever can be laid or founded upon the acts of the defendants done by them to remove the plaintiffs\u2019 complaints whether these were well or ill founded, for the defendants had no knowledge then of the precise terms of the contract entered into by Muir & Co., and their reputation as manufacturers was equally at stake, whether they should be liable to the plaintiffs or to Muir & Co. for any defect there might be in goods manufactured by them, and they would naturally desire to remove any just grounds of complaint, to whomsoever they might have been liable. They knew that Muir & Co. had authority to have entered into a contract on their behalf and binding upon them with the plaintiffs, and that they might have entered into a contract upon their, Muir & Co\u2019s., own account, supplying themselves from the defendants with articles manufactured by the latter, but the defendants do not then appear to have known which course Muir & Co. had adopted. The defendants\u2019 acts, therefore, after the plaintiffs complained of the insufficiency of the articles which Muir & Co. had procured from the defendants, cannot be regarded as in ratification of a contract made by Muir & Co. upon behalf of the defendants and as their agents with the plaintiffs, no such contract having ever been entered into as by the written contract which was entered into by Muir & Co. with the plaintiffs, I think, appears.\nThe appeal therefore, in my opinion, should be dismissed and the non-suit affirmed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellants: Aikins, Culver & Hamilton\nSolicitor for respondents: J.

The habendum of the lease and covenants affecting this case are as follows:\u2014\n\u201cTo have and to hold the said close piece or parcel of land and also the said mines unto the said lessees, their executors, administrators and assigns, from the first day of December instant, for and during and unto the full end and term of 10 years thence next ensuing and fully to be complete and ended, yielding and paying therefor unto the party of the first part $1 per gross ton of 2,240 pounds of the said iron stone or ore for every ton mined and raised from the said land and mine, payable quarterly on the first day of March, June, September and December in each year.\n\u201cThe parties of the second part, for themselves, their heirs, executors, administrators, or assigns, covenant and agree to and with the party of the first part, her heirs, executors, administrators and assigns, that they will dig up and mine and carry away in each and every year during the said term a quantity not less than 2,000 tons of such stone or iron ore for the first year, and a quantity not less than 5,000 tons a year in every subsequent year of the said term, and that they will pay quarterly the sum of $1 per ton as aforesaid for the quantity agreed to be taken during each year for the term aforesaid.\n\u201cAnd the said parties of the second part covenant and agree to and with the party of the first part that they will pay the said quarter\u2019s rent or royalty upon the said quantity quarterly in each year, and if the same shall then exceed the quantity actually taken, such excess shall be applied towards payment of the first quarter thereafter in which more than the said quantity shall be taken.\u201d\nThe lease also contained the following provisoes:\u2014\n\u201cProvided, that if the rent or royalty hereby reserved shall be behind in arrear or unpaid for two quarters, then the lessor may at her election then or at any time before actual payment declare the lease void and the term hereby created at an end, and the term shall cease and be determined.\n\u201cProvided also, that if the iron ore or ironstone shall be exhausted and not to be found or obtained there by proper and reasonable effort in paying quantities, then the parties of the second part shall be at liberty to determine this lease in the manner provided therefor.\u201d\nOn the trial before Mr. Justice Ferguson there was conflicting evidence as to the quantity and character of the ore mined from the land, and the learned judge found, as a fact, that it was not found, by reasonable and proper effort, in paying quantities; he therefore held that the defendant was relieved from his liability to pay rent under the lease and gave judgment in his favor. The Court of Appeal reversed this judgment, holding that there was a liability on the lessee to pay rent in any event. From the latter decision the defendant appealed to this court. S.H. Blake Q.C. and W. Cassels Q.C. for the appellants, argued that as the subject matter never existed the contract never took effect and cited Bainbridge on Mines[2]; Rogers on Mines and Minerals[3]; Griffiths v. Rigby[4]; Clifford v. Watts[5]); Earl of Beauchamp v. Winn[6]; Daniell v. Sinclair[7].\nRobinson Q.C. and Dickson Q.C. for the respondents. The lessees had a right to terminate the lease if ore was not found. They could only do so by notice in writing to the lessor which was not given until after this rent accrued.\nThe lessor was kept out of possession of the land and is entitled to the rent.\nSIR W.J. RITCHIE C.J.\u2014By the terms of the lease the lessee is to yield and pay $1 per gross ton of iron stone or ore for every ton mined and raised.\nThe covenant is that the lessee shall dig up and mine in each and every year a quantity not less than 2000 tons for the first year and not less than 5000 tons in every subsequent year, and will pay quarterly $1 per ton for the quantity agreed to be taken during each year.\nAnd further, that they will pay said quarter\u2019s rent or royalty upon said quantity quarterly in each year, and if the same shall exceed the quantity actually taken such excess shall be applied towards the payment of the first quarter thereafter in which more than the said quantity shall be taken.\nWith this proviso, that if the rent or royalty shall be unpaid for two years the lessor may at her election then, or before actual payment, declare the lease void and the same shall cease and be determined.\nAnd also provided, that if the iron ore, or iron stone, shall be exhausted, and not to be found or obtained by proper and reasonable efforts in paying quantities, then the lessee shall be at liberty to determine this lease.\nI think that the right to recover the rent was dependent on the existence of ore on the premises which could be mined or raised by the defendant, and that the defendants did not agree to pay a dead or sleeping rent. The learned judge who tried this case says that \u201cthere is no doubt that at the time of the execution of the lease all parties to it believed that there was a valuable mine on the premises in question\u201d This was not denied by any one. At page 351 the learned judge says:\u2014\nAll I desire to say is, that after having examined and considered it as well as all the evidence respecting the assays of the ore made by professional men, and as to the bearing of such assays as evidence of the practical fact from a mining point of view, I am as I was at the close of the evidence clearly of the opinion that the defendants (even assuming that the burden of proof was upon them throughout in respect of this subject) have succeeded in establishing as a fact that the iron or iron stone became exhausted and was not to be found or obtained by proper and reasonable efforts in paying quanties. The pocket south of the shaft was exhausted and I think that ore in paying quantities was not found in the shaft, that is, although there were pieces of fairly good ore in the shaft and drifts these were so intermixed with rock and lean and poor ore that the real fact for all practical or mining purposes is reasonably and accurately stated by saying that iron ore or iron stone was not to be found or obtained there by proper and reasonable efforts in paying quantities; and upon the evidence 1 have no hesitation in finding and I do find that the iron ore and iron became exhausted and not to be found or obtained by proper and reasonable efforts in paying quantities.\nHere, then, both parties assumed, in good faith, the existence of a valuable mine on the premises and must, I think, be assumed to have contracted, in good faith, on the assumption of its existence; and it seems to me that when the act or thing contracted to be done by either party cannot be performed by reason of the non-existence of the subject matter assumed to be in question the contract in respect to it must be considered to be at an end and not enforceable. A dead rent may be reserved in respect of a license to enter and search, and in such case is payable whether there is ore or not, because there is nothing to exempt the defendant from paying the dead rent; but in this case the parties have not chosen to agree on a dead rent payable at all events, but have made the rent dependent on the ore raised; they only undertook to pay so much on every ton raised; if no ore they could have nothing to pay, because there was no ore to raise. Therefore, in this case the defendants have not got what they contracted for, and for which they agreed to pay rent or royalty. It is the iron ore which is the subject of the grant, on the raising of which the rent was reserved. How, then, can there be any rent payable when it is ascertained there was no such ore there? The covenant to pay rent is, in my opinion, only applicable if the ore is there, and does not amount to a warranty on the part of the lessee that the ore was there, or to an engagement to pay the royalty if there was none, in which event there was nothing on which the rent could attach. The intention and meaning of the covenant, in my opinion, was that the plaintiff should receive the royalty on the ore if it was found on the premises, the covenant being then based on the assumption of both parties that the ore was there; if no ore then the covenant became inapplicable. There is, it is true, a provision that either party could put an end to the lease, the one if the rent reserved should be in arrear, the other, if the ore should be exhausted and not to be found or obtained, by proper and reasonable efforts, in paying quantities, but I cannot see that this interfered with the right of the lessees to resist payment on the ground that the rent agreed to be paid never accrued due, by reason of the rent being payable only for every ton mined and raised, and no tons could be raised because none existed to be mined and raised. It seems to me that the quarterly payments, at the rate of $1 per ton for every ton mined and raised for the minimum quantity agreed to be raised each year, and the provision that if the fixed quarterly payments should exceed the quantity actually taken out from the mine, the excess should be applied in payment of the next quarter in which more than the quantity is taken, is based on the assumption that the mine will, at any rate, produce the minimum quantity, that the ore is there and can be mined and raised but for the default of the lessees, and does not, in my opinion, justify the conclusion that it was thereby intended that there should be a fixed payment of the stipulated sum per quarter whether there was ore on the premises or not.\nI think the payment made before it was established that the ore did not exist, must be held to have been made conditionally on the contingency that ore would be found, and no ore having been found they amounted to payments made under a mistake of fact, with the exception of the payment of $937.32, paid voluntarily after knowledge of the non-existence of the ore, and of the sum of $306, the amount of royalty on the ore actually taken by the defendant.\nI may say that I find it difficult, and even impossible, to distinguish this case from the case of Clifford v. Watts[8], in which Willes J. says:\u2014\nThe indenture also contains a covenant that Watts shall dig and raise from the land an aggregate amount of not less than 1000 tons, or more than 2000 tons, of pipe or potter\u2019s clay, the defendant was to pay a royalty of 2s. 6d per ton. The breach assigned on that covenant is that with which we have to deal on this occasion; it is that the defendant has not dug an aggregate amount of not less than 1000 tons of pipe and potter\u2019s clay in each year of the demise. The plea, the validity of which is now in question is, that the defendant could not dig 1000 tons of clay each year according to his covenant, because there was not at the time of the demise nor since existing under the lands 1000 tons of such clay, that the performance of the covenant had always been impossible, and that such impossibility was unknown to the defendant at the time, and he had no reasonable means of knowing or ascertaining the same.\n* * *\nThe second, and with reference to this case the most important consideration, appears to me to arise from the question whether the defendant has by this covenant contracted to perform an impossibility, or whether the true meaning of the covenant construing it by the rest of the deed, is, not that the defendant undertakes to get the stipulated quantity of clay whether it be there or not, or to pay the stipulated tonnage as if the clay had been raised, but rather dealing with it as subsidiary to the main object of the demise, that he will raise such pipe or potter\u2019s clay as may be found under the land, at the rate and price specified. If the latter be the true construction of the covenant, it is not an independent covenant to do the thing contracted for, whether possible or not, but only a stipulation as to the rate at which that is to be done which both parties at the time contemplated. According to that construction of the covenant, the plea is a good defence to the second breach. And this is the view to which, after the best consideration I am able to bring to the case and after having heard the very learned arguments on both sides, my opinion inclines.\nI think the appeal should be allowed and the judgment of Ferguson J. in the Chancery Division restored.\nSTRONG J.\u2014For a statement of the facts of this case I refer to the very full and carefully prepared judgment of Mr. Justice Ferguson, before whom the action was tried in the Chancery Division. The learned judge found in the appellant\u2019s favor as to the principal questions of facts involved in the issues raised by the pleadings, that as to whether or not the premises comprised in the lease contained ore in paying quantities, the finding in question being thus distinctly stated in the judge\u2019s own words:\u2014\nI am, as I was at the close of the evidence, clearly of the opinion that the defendants (even assuming that the burden of proof was upon them throughout in respect of this subject) have succeeded in establishing as a fact that the iron or iron-stone became exhausted and was not to be found or obtained, by proper and reasonable efforts, in paying quantities. This question, therefore, being purely one of fact, and the learned judge having rightly held that the onus was on the appellant to establish the affirmative of it, we must, of course, regard this finding as conclusive, and confine ourselves to the question what effect the fact thus established ought to have on the rights of the parties, having regard to the proper legal construction of the lease. This question of the construction of the lease is, indeed, the principal difficulty in the case, and when that is solved a conclusion as to the proper determination of the appeal is easily reached.\nThen, to consider the several clauses and provisions material to be considered, as bearing on the liability of the lessees to perform the covenants to pay the rent or royalty reserved in the event which has been established, that with the exception of some 306 tons of ore extracted the land demised was wholly barren and unproductive of ore in paying quantities, we find first in order the reddendum which is in the following words:\u2014\nYielding and paying therefor unto the party of the first part, one dollar per gross ton of twenty-two hundred and forty pounds of the said iron stone or ore for every ton mined and raised from the said land and mine, payable quarterly on the first days of March, June, September and December in each year.\nIt is to be remarked of this reddendum that it is, by itself, only a reservation of a royalty and not of a dead or sleeping rent, i.e., a rent payable absolutely. It is, however, followed by a covenant thus expressed:\u2014\nThe parties of the second part * * * covenant and agree to and with the party of the first part, * * * that they will dig up and mine and carry away in each and every year during the said term a quantity not less than two thousand tons of such stone or iron ore for the first year and a quantity not less than five thousand tons a year in every subsequent year of the said term and that they will pay quarterly the sum of one dollar per ton as aforesaid for the quantity agreed to be taken during each year for the term aforesaid.\nIt appears to me that it is upon the construction of this covenant, read in the light of that which immediately follows it, that; the whole question depends. If the lessees had merely covenanted to dig up 2000 tons of ore during the first year, and 5000 in every subsequent year of the term, this case would have been undistinguishable from Clifford v. Watts[9]; but it will be observed that the covenant is not so restricted, for after the agreement to dig the stipulated quantity we find, expressed in absolute terms, the following additional agreement:\u2014\nAnd that they will pay quarterly the sum of one dollar per ton as aforesaid for the quantity agreed to be taken during each year for the term aforesaid,\nthus making the lessees liable to pay a sum equivalent to the amount of the tonnage on the prescribed quantity of ore, at the stipulated rate, whether it should be taken or not. And then, as though it had been intended to remove any possible ambiguity which might be supposed to arise upon the words \u201cagreed to be taken,\u201d we find the following covenant coming immediately after that just stated:\u2014\nAnd the said parties of the second party covenant and agree to and with the party of the first part that they will pay the said quarterly rent or royalty in each year, and if the same shall then exceed the quantity actually taken, such excess shall be applied towards payment of the first quarter thereafter in which more than the said quantity shall be taken,\na covenant which, beyond all doubt or question, contains an absolute undertaking to pay the rent or royalty in each year without reference to the quantity of ore actually extracted. This provision conspicuously and decisively distinguishes this case from Lord Clifford v. Watts9, where Willes J.[10] expressly remarks on there being no covenant \u201cto pay the stipulated tonnage as if the clay had been raised,\u201d in such a way as clearly to imply that if there had been such a covenant similar to that now before us, it would have amounted to a covenant to pay a dead rent.\nI construe these covenants which have just been set forth as if they had been expressed in the form of absolute covenants to pay a dead rent, or in other words, to pay a gross rental of $2000 for the first year and $5000 for each subsequent year of the term.\nSuch then being the prim\u00e2 facie construction of the covenants for the payment of rent standing alone, the next question which, arises is what effect, on that construction, is to be attributed to the clause that if the rent shall exceed the quantity actually taken the excess in payment shall be applied to any excess in quantity the first quarter thereafter in which more than the stipulated quantity should be taken. This provision merely enables the lessees to recoup themselves by setting off the excess of their payments over the tonnage of the ore excavated in any year against their liability for ore excavated in excess (if any) of the prescribed quantity in succeeding quarters. Why should such a provision have the effect of cutting down an absolute covenant to pay rent to one dependent on a condition that the land should contain ore in paying quantities, words of qualification not to be found in the covenant itself? Surely the clause in question should not be held to have such a violent operation unless it can be shown that it is so entirely inconsistent with the preceding covenants to pay a fixed dead rent that the two cannot subsist together; then, so far from this being the case, the two are quite consistent if we consider the proviso as having been intended for the very reasonable and just purpose of enabling the lessees, in the case of there being a sufficiency of ore, to take a ton of ore to recoup themselves for every dollar of royalty which they should happen to pay in advance; in other words, that although the lessees should be bound to pay absolutely, and whether they took out ore or not, they should not be compelled to pay twice over, but should be entitled to a quantity of ore in the aggregate equal in value to their aggregate payments, at the stipulated rate of $1 per ton, provided ore was to be found to enable them to do so. I can see no repugnancy nor inconsistency between such a provision and the absolute covenant to pay, nor anything but the most natural consistency and concordance. Then this still leaves the covenant to pay for the stipulated quantities an absolute covenant equivalent to one for the payment of a dead rent.\nThe only other provision of the lease which can have any bearing on this question is that which enables the lessees to avoid the lease if the iron ore should be exhausted, or it should prove that there was none to be found in paying quantities on the demised premises. It is as follows:\u2014\nProvided also, that if the iron ore or iron stone shall be exhausted and not to be found or obtained by proper and reasonable effort in paying quantities, then the party of the second part shall be at liberty to determine this lease.\nTaking the covenants already considered to be, as I hold they are, absolute covenants for the payment of a dead rent during each and every year of the term of ten years this power given to the lessees to determine the lease at their option in the event of the failure of the iron ore, or in the case of the unproductiveness of the demised land being ascertained, so far from influencing the construction in such a way as to reduce the clear, absolute terms of the preceding covenants, has precisely the opposite tendency since it shows that the case which has actually happened was in the contemplation of the parties and was provided for by the introduction into the lease of this important proviso enabling the lessees to relieve themselves from liability by putting an end to the term. The inference from this is so strong as almost to be irresistible that if, for any cause, they did not think fit to avail themselves of the remedy thus afforded them their liability to pay the rent was intended to continue.\nSupposing the lease had contained a covenant, in terms, to pay a rental of $2000 for the first year and $5000 for the subsequent years of the term without any reference to the quantity of ore taken out, it would have been impossible in that case to say that this proviso could, though no minerals were found, have constituted any answer to a claim for rent actually accrued due prior to a determination of the lease by the lessees for the cause mentioned. Then, as I interpret it, the covenant is, in legal effect, the exact equivalent of such an absolute covenant to pay the rental as an ordinary dead rent. The clause enabling the lessees to determine the lease is then, in truth, their only protection from liability to pay in case of failure of the ore, and until they exercised their election, and gave notice of it to the lessor, they are bound by the plain and unequivocal words of the covenants they have entered into.\nAs to the sufficiency of the notice given by the lessees of their intention to avoid the lease, I agree with the Court of Appeal that we must accept the conclusion of Mr. Justice Ferguson that the evidence establishes a determination of it sufficiently early to afford a defence to the claim for the quarter\u2019s rent which accrued due on the 1st of December, 1884, though not for that which was payable on the 1st of September preceding.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nFOURNIER J.\u2014I am of opinion that the appeal should be allowed and the judgment of Mr. Justice Ferguson restored. TASCHEREAU J.\u2014I am of opinion that this appeal should be dismissed for the reasons given by my brother Gwynne.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014By an indenture made on the 30th December, 1882, in pursuance of the act respecting short forms of leases, between the plaintiff, therein called the lessor, of the first part, and the defendant and others therein named and called the lessees of the second part, the said party of the first part in consideration of the royalty, rents, and covenants thereinafter mentioned did grant, demise and lease unto the lessees, &c.\n(His lordship here read the provisions of the lease.)\nAt the time of the execution of the lease all parties thereto believed, as the learned judge who tried the case has found, that there was abundance of ore in the demised piece; there was then an iron mine being profitably worked upon a piece of land which was separated by the distance of four perches only from the demised piece, and upon the demised piece there was already a shaft dug which gave indications of the presence of iron ore.\nUpon the execution of the lease the lessees proceeded to sink shafts for the purpose of working the mine, and, in the year 1883, they took out about 300 tons of ore which, however, they allege turned out not to be good. They paid the quarterly rents which accrued due under their covenant in the lease up to and including that which fell due on the 1st June, 1884, but they refused to pay any more rent for the reason that, as they allege, and as is now admitted to be the fact, there never was any iron ore on the demised piece in excess of the 300 tons which they had taken out; and in the month of September, 1884, availing themselves of the clause in the lease enabling the lessees to deter- mine the lease, they abandoned the premises and gave notice to the lessor that they determined the lease. The plaintiff brought her action in the month of December, 1884, to recover the two quarters rent which she claimed to have accrued due on the first of September and December, 1884, contending that the lease could not be determined by the lessees otherwise than by a deed, and that it was not determined until some time in 1885, when the lessees executed (ex majori cautel\u00e2, as they contend) a deed of surrender of the lease to the lessor, which deed the lessor did not produce, a circumstance which drew from the learned judge who tried the case the observation that he could not say what it may have contained; it may possibly have recited the fact that the lessees had determined the lease in September for the reason that the iron ore had been exhausted. The defendant Palmer, in whom the interest of his co-lessees had become vested, defended the plaintiff\u2019s action upon the ground and contention that there never was on the demised premises any iron ore whatever other than the 300 tons taken out, and that as the rent is reserved only in respect of iron ore mined and raised, and that as under the circumstances no more could by possibility be raised, the consideration of the lease had wholly failed, and there never accrued due to the plaintiff anything in excess of $1 per ton on the 300 tons, and the defendant therefore counterclaimed for the monies paid in excess of such sum as for monies paid without consideration and under a mistake of fact, namely, as to there being iron ore on the demised premises capable of being taken out. The learned judge who tried the case acceded to this contention, and he dismissed the plaintiff\u2019s claim and gave judgment in favor of the defendant on his counterclaim for the amount claimed by him, less the sum of $937.50 which was, as he found, voluntarily paid by him on the 3rd of July, 1884, at a time when, as he also found, the defendant was as much aware that the mine had been exhausted as he was when the notice of determination of the lease for that cause was given, which he found to have been some time, but when in particular is not stated, in September, 1884.\nOn appeal from this judgment the Court of Appeal for Ontario has allowed the rent which accrued due on the 1st September, 1884, viz., $1250 dollars, but has not allowed that claimed to have become due on 1st December for the reason that (in this respect affirming the view taken by the learned judge who tried the case) the lease was effectually determined by the notice to that effect given in September 1884, and that to determine it a deed of surrender was not necessary, but they wholly disallowed the defendant\u2019s counterclaim, holding that no part of the monies paid could be recovered back.\nThe question wholly turns upon the construction of the lease, and it is to be observed, first, that the moving consideration for the execution of the lease by the lessor consists of the royalty and rent thereby reserved and the covenants of the lessees therein contained; secondly, that the habendum is \u201cto have and to hold the said close or parcel of land\u201d (in the lease described) \u201cand also the said mines\u201d and the reddendum therefor is of a money rent issuing not out of the iron ore but out of the said piece of land and also the mines of iron ore therein, payable quarterly on the 1st days of March, June, September and December in each year, the maximum amount of which rent is determinable by the quantity of iron ore mined and raised, but the minimum amount payable in each quarter is expressed to be the fourth part of $2000.00 or $500.00 per quarter in the first year, and the fourth part of $5000.00 or $1250,00 per quarter in each succeeding year. Upon the execution of the lease the lessees were entitled to enter upon and enjoy the exclusive possession of the piece of land demised, and to retain such possession during the whole period of ten years or until the lease should be determined by the lessor or by the lessees under the clause in the lease which authorises them respectively to determine the lease; they acquired the right of digging and prospecting for iron ore by sinking shafts to any depth they pleased (provided only it should be done in a proper and skilful manner) in as many parts of the demised piece of land as they pleased, and in such kind of work they might, if they pleased, have been engaged for nine, twelve or any other number of months without raising any pre. Having this privilege it was natural and reasonable that the quarterly rent of not less than $500 in each quarter of the first year and $1250 in each quarter of each subsequent year should be, as in point of fact it was, made payable by the lease. Accordingly the lessees for themselves and each for himself his heirs, &c., covenanted with the lessor to pay such minimum quarterly rents notwithstanding that in any such quarter in which such rent should become payable no ore should be raised, and the only indemnity which the lessees contracted for, and which is provided by the lease for such payments of rent in advance of any ore being raised, is that the amount so paid in excess of any ore raised within the quarter shall be allowed in any quarter in which ore should be raised in excess of the quantity represented by the minimum amount made payable in such quarter, and only as against such excess in quantity so raised. The rent was made payable quarterly, and the intention of the parties is, I think, plainly expressed upon the lease to be, that the quarterly rents of $500 in the first year and of $1250 in each quarter of each succeeding year, should be and are made payable whether or not there should be any iron ore raised in any of the quarters upon the determination of which such rents respectively were made payable. Those specific quarterly rents so made payable have all the character of minimum rents covenanted to be paid whether any iron ore should or not be raised in any such quarter. The case of Bridges v. Potts[11] is the nearest case to the present, and in my opinion the present comes within it. There the royalty agreed upon was a stated sum per ton and it was provided and agreed that:\u2014\nIf in the 1st and 2nd years the royalties above provided for should not amount to the sum of \u00a3500 each year then the lessees shall advance and pay to the lessor for each of the years such sum of money as with the amount of the royalties for that particular year will make up the full sum of \u00a3500, if in the third and any subsequent year of the said term the said royalties do not amount to the sum of \u00a31500 each year the lessees shall pay to the lessor such sum as with the royalties will make up the full sum of \u00a31500, and if any sum of money be so advanced to make up the said respective minimum rents in any one year the amount of such advance may be deducted out of the excess of royalties above such minimum rent accruing during any succeeding year.\nNow a minimum fixed rent payable either by the year or the quarter may be reserved and made payable absolutely without the use of the words \u201cminimum rent\u201d which were the words used in Bridges v. Potts11. In the present case the language is that the lessees covenant\nThat they will in each and every year during the said term dig up and mine and carry away not less then 2000 tons of such iron ore for the first year and not less than 5000 tons in every subsequent year, and that they will pay quarterly the sum of $1.00 per ton for such quantities and will pay the said quarter\u2019s rent or royalty upon the said quantity so agreed to be taken out, quarterly in each year, and if the same shall then exceed the quantity actually taken, such excess shall be applied towards payment of the first quarter thereafter in which more than the said quantity shall be taken.\nNow these provisions in the present lease, applying the judgment in Bridges v. Potts[12] to them, are in effect that rent is to be paid quarterly to the amounts mentioned but that the lessees were to have the benefit of\nrent paid in one quarter in excess of ore raised as or towards payment of any excess in a subsequent quarter of ore raised exceeding the quantity represented by the rent made payable in such quarter. Rent so reserved is clearly, in my opinion, a minimum fixed rent payable quarterly whether any ore may have been raised or not. The covenant to pay it is as much an absolute unqualified covenant as was the covenant in Jervis v. Tomkinson[13], and the quarterly payments are as much a determined rent absolutely payable so long as the term shall endure, which the lessees can themselves determine, as was the rent in the Marquis of Bute v. Thompson[14], or that reserved in Bishop v. Goodwin[15]. The lease does not operate by way of warranty by the lessor that there is to be found iron ore in the demised premises which can be worked profitably or at all[16]; and in Gowan v. Christie[17] Lord Cairns says that the instruments which are called mineral leases\nwhen properly considered are sales out and out of a portion of the land. He says it is liberty given to a particular individual for a specific length of time to go into and under the land and to get certain things there if they can find them and to take them away just as if he had bought so much of the soil.\nLord Clifford v. Watts[18] was a case very distinguishable from the present. There the rent reserved was a royalty of 2s 6d per ton of clay which might be found upon or under the lands described; habendum for 12 years reddendum the 2s 6d per ton; there was a covenant that the defendant would dig and remove from the land an aggregate amount of not less than 1000 tons nor more than 2000 tons of pipe or potter\u2019s clay in each year of the term; but there was no covenant for the payment of any fixed sum either by the year or by the quarter as there is in the present case; the action therefore had to be brought upon the covenant to dig and take out not less than 1000 tons in each year and the breach laid was that the defendant had not dug an aggregate amount of not less than 1000 tons of pipe and potter\u2019s clay in each year of the demise that had elapsed; to this breach the defendant pleaded upon equitable grounds in substance that there was no pipe or potter\u2019s clay in the demised premises, and that it was impossible for the defendant to have dug and gotten out any. Under these circumstances judgment was rendered for the defendant. The covenant was held to be a bar a stipulation for payment for the clay which should be raised, which the fact that there was no stipulation, as there in the present case, for payment of a fixed rent quarterly during the term, or a stipulation, as there is also in the present case, that the lessees might upon finding the ore to be exhausted instantly determine the lease and all liability thereunder, showed to be the intention of the parties. That case therefore seems to be an authority in support of the judgment of Court of Appeal for Ontario, rather than against it. The contention that the defendants are entitled to be relieved from their covenant to pay the quarterly rents as upon a total failure of consideration for their entering into the covenant, and that they are entitled to recover back the rent paid as paid without consideration and under a mistake of fact, is quite untenable. There is no room here for the application of the doctrine of total failure of consideration; it was in fact upon the faith of and in consideration of the lessees\u2019 covenant to pay the rent at the times and in the amounts in the covenants stated that the lessor granted to them the exclusive possession of the demised premises for the term of ten years, to prospect for and get out and take out all the iron ore which might be found thereon as to the existence of which in sufficient quantities to justify the lessees in entering into the covenant, it was their business to satisfy, and they appear to have satisfied themselves; moreover, they did in fact take out 300 tons of such iron ore and what has occurred is what the lessees took care to provide for as being possible to occur, namely, that the iron ore has become exhausted, in which case the lessees were given power to relieve themselves from all future liability under their covenant by determining the lease, a privilege of which they did not avail themselves until the month of September, 1884, until which time they retained to themselves that exclusive possession which in consideration of their covenants the lease granted to them. Then as to the rent which was paid having been paid under a mistake of fact, what is here called a mistake of fact was, in truth, an error of judgment, not a mistake of fact in the recognized sense of that term, but an erroneous conclusion drawn by the lessees from such facts as were known and apparent, but which experience has shown to have been insufficient to justify the conclusion which the lessees formed upon them as to the value of the speculation they were entering into. The Court of Appeal for Ontario was clearly right in not allowing any thing to the defendant on his counter claim for the rents which he had paid, which rents were paid in compliance with, and discharge of, the covenant he had entered into, and in consideration of which he and his co-lessees acquired for a term of ten years exclusive possession of the ten acres mentioned in the lease, for the purpose therein stated, and with the powers therein mentioned to be exercised thereon; there is no principle of law upon which money so paid can be recovered back. For the same reason, I am of opinion that the $1250 allowed by the Court of Appeal for Ontario, as for rent covenanted to be paid on the 1st September, 1884, was properly allowed to the plaintiff. The covenant sued upon is express that such sum should be paid in each and every quarter in the second and each succeeding year of the term until the expiration thereof by lapse of time or sooner determination thereof by the lessees themselves, who, in the event which has happened, were empowered to determine it. The covenant is absolute in its terms not qualified by any condition that iron ore should have been raised at the respective times when the sums which were covenanted to be paid quarterly became payable.\nThe appeal therefore, in my opinion, must be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellants: Bell & Biggar.\nSolicitor for respondent: Francis S.

That the bank having given up the said promissory notes, etc., and accepted, as renewals thereof, forged and worthless paper, McK. was, to the extent of such worthless paper, relieved from liability as such surety.\nHeld, per Strong J.\u2014That the bank having accepted the renewals in\nthe ordinary course of banking business, and it not being shown that they were guilty of negligence, the surety was not relieved.\nHeld, per Gwynne J.\u2014That as there was a reference ordered to take an account of the notes alleged to be forged, the consideration of the surety\u2019s liability should be postponed until the account was taken.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, affirming the judgment of the Chancery Division[1] in favor of the defendants.\nThe action in this case was brought for foreclosure of a mortgage given by the defendants as security to the plaintiffs for the indebtedness of the firm of Wm. Kyle & Co., and to enable said firm to increase their credit with the plaintiffs\u2019 bank. The obligation of the defendants under the mortgage is thus provided for:\u2014\n\u201cProvided, this mortgage to be void on payment of twenty-six thousand five hundred and thirteen 04\/100 dollars of lawful money of Canada, as follows: in two years from the date hereof, and all bills of exchange, promissory notes and other paper upon which the said firm of William Kyle & Co. were liable to the said mortgagees on the 24th day of November, A.D. 1883, together with all renewals, substitutions and alterations thereof, and all indebtedness of the said firm to the said mortgagees in respect to the said sum. This indenture being intended to be a continuing security to the said mortgagees for the above amount, notwithstanding any change in the membership of the said firm, either by death, retirement therefrom or addition thereto, and also to secure and cover any sum due or to become due in respect of the interest, commission upon the said notes or renewals, or other commercial paper, and taxes and performance of statute labor.\u201d\nAt the time this mortgage was given the greater part of the business of Kyle & Co. with the bank consisted of the discount of their customers\u2019 bills, a small portion being the discount of their own bills with the customers\u2019 paper given as collateral. When the suit was brought the greater part of the indebtedness consisted of discounts of the latter character.\nThe defendants raise two objections to the proceedings against them on the mortgage, namely, that the bank had given up the good paper, which they formerly held, of the customers of Kyle & Co., and had taken in renewal or substitution thereof forged and worthless paper, and that by increasing the discounts with collaterals they had facilitated the giving of such forged paper, inasmuch as the customers would not be notified, as they would in the case of straight discounts. The action was tried before Mr. Justice Ferguson, and referred, by consent of counsel, to the Divisional Court. The judgment of the Divisional Court exonerated the defendants from liability on the mortgage, in so far as the bank had parted with the valid securities aforesaid and accepted forged and worthless securities therefor, and an account was ordered. This decision was affirmed by the Court of Appeal. The plaintiffs then appealed to this court.\nRobinson Q.C. for the appellants cited Loomis v. Fay[2]\nMcIntyre for the respondents, referred to Sutton v. Wilders[3]; Re Speight[4].\nSir W.J. RITCHIE C.J.\u2014The mortgage recites that the firm of Kyle & Co. were indebted to the Merchants\u2019 Bank, in the course of banking, for debts contracted by the said firm to the bank and for which the bank then held the commercial paper of the customers of the firm upon which the said advances were made, and that the said firm had applied to the bank for additional advances for a limited period, to which the bank had agreed upon receiving security for the present indebtedness, and that the mortgage was intended to carry out that agreement.\nThe consideration of the mortgage was stated to be $26,513.04, the amount due the bank from the said firm on November 24,1883, and then unpaid; and the mortgagors conveyed their respective interests in the lands mortgaged to the bank as additional security for such indebtedness.\nThere was a proviso that the mortgage should be void on payment, in two years from the date of the mortgage, of the above amount and all bills of exchange, promissory notes and other paper upon which the said firm were liable to the bank on November 24, 1883, and all renewals, substitutions and alterations thereof, and all indebtedness of the said firm to the bank in respect of the said sum; and also a proviso that the bills, notes and other commercial paper should not be deemed to be merged in the mortgage.\nIn my opinion the bank was not justified in parting with any of the securities held by them at the time of the making of the mortgage unless the same were paid or renewed with valid paper of the same character; that if the bank gave up the paper so held by them, and took in lieu of it forged paper, they must be answerable for the loss sustained thereby; that the securities held by the bank at the date of the mortgage were held as well for their own benefit as for the benefit of the sureties, the mortgagors; and that if they gave up such paper, and did not obtain renewals or other commercial paper therefor, but gave up said notes and accepted in lieu thereof forged and invalid instruments, they discharged the defendants from the payment of the said mortgage to the extent of the paper so given up, without any evidence of negligence pro or con.; I think the bank was bound to see before giving up the notes they held at the date of the mortgage that the notes they took in renewal or substitution therefor were genuine, valid notes. I think the distinction is most manifest between the bon\u00e2 fide taking a valid note, though the party might not be solvent and the note consequently, for the time being, apparently worthless, and the bank taking a forged note. In the first case the surety, on payment, would be entitled to the note and to hold it for what it might be, or at any time afterwards become, worth; in the latter the forged note, by no possibility, could ever be of any value. To my mind the clear intention of all parties, to be gathered from the deed, is that the renewals, substitutions and alterations were to be by valid, binding commercial paper of the customers of the firm, and not by taking, in lieu of such paper, not commercial paper of such customers but utterly worthless and forged paper. I think that in accepting this security from these sureties the bank, by clear implication of law, undertook that they would do nothing in reference to the paper held by them in derogation of the rights of the sureties; that they would take in renewal or substitution thereof paper of the same character as that then held by them, namely, commercial paper of the customers of the firm; and I think, in favor of the sureties, the giving up of valid commercial paper, which, when paid, the sureties had a right to have the benefit of, and taking forged and invalid paper in lieu thereof, was necessarily, as against the sureties, a negligent and improper act. I think the bank was bound to be in a position to hand over, on payment, to the sureties good and valid commercial paper of the customers of Kyle & Co., such as they held at the date of the mortgage, and if they had given up such paper, and not taken, in lieu thereof, good, valid, commercial paper, and cannot give them securities of such a character but have only forged and invalid paper to offer them, the sureties, in my opinion, are thereby relieved to the extent of such invalid paper.\nIt must be borne in mind that between the surety and the principal debtor there is no privity of contract. The surety contracts with the creditor; therefore, it is What the creditor does that alone has to affect the surety. The creditor has no right to deal with the principal debtor in derogation of the rights of the surety, behind the backs of the sureties and without their consent, whether such dealings were induced by negligence, carelessness, or over\u2011confidence in the debtor. The right of subrogation attaches as soon as the liability of the surety attaches. If this is so, and the surety is entitled to be subrogated to the position of the creditor in respect to any valid securities of the principal debtor held by him, how can it be in the mouth of the creditor to allege that he, without the assent of the sureties, gave up such valid securities, and, in lieu thereof, took valueless, invalid and forged securities, which the surety must accept as and for the valid securities he gave up?\nThere can be no doubt, in this case, that the dealings of the bank with the principal debtor were, in the highest degree, prejudicial to the surety. There was, in my opinion, a clear duty on the bank to ascertain, before they gave up any of the securities they held alike for their own benefit as for the benefit of the sureties, that they were justified in doing so; and if they gave them up without receiving the money therefor, or valid commercial paper of the customers of Kyle & Co. in renewal or substitution therefor, they did so at their own risk and peril, whether the same was caused by negligence, carelessness, over-confidence in Kyle & Co., or any other cause, so long as the sureties were no parties, directly or indirectly, to the action of the bank. To hold that they could do so, and force the loss on the sureties, would be, in my opinion, at variance with the well-established rights of sureties.\nIf the bank held collateral security to the benefit of which the sureties were entitled, upon what principle, by any act of the bank, could the sureties be deprived of such, their unquestionable right?\nWhy, then, should the sureties and not the bank bear any loss arising from the loss of these collaterals? As between the bank and the sureties the loss was, no doubt, occasioned by the misconduct of a third party and by the action or misapprehension of the bank in reference thereto, but in no way by or through the action, interference or consent of the sureties. Upon whom, then, should the loss fall but upon the bank through whose instrumentality the collaterals were lost? To adjudge otherwise, and make the loss fall on the innocent sureties, would be a strange way indeed of treating them as \u201cfavored debtors.\u201d\nI cannot discover a particle of evidence to justify the suggestion of the learned Chief Justice of the Court of Appeal \u201cthat from all that appears on the evidence a portion of this paper might have been forged at the time of the execution of the mortgage.\u201d I am at a loss, in the absence of any evidence to that effect, to understand how such a contention can now be urged or such a conclusion implied. On the contrary, the mortgage distinctly recognizes that the collaterals then held were valid securities, and I fail to see a suspicion cast on them, or even a contention that such might have been the case.\nThe cases, both in England and the United States, leave no doubt on my mind as to the law governing this case. I will refer to the following. In Pearl v. Deacon [5] the Master of the Rolls says:\u2014\nIn the judgment of Vice-Chancellor Wood in Newton v. Chorlton [6] there is a statement, in every word of which I concur. He says, as regards the creditor, \u201cHe is bound to give to the surety the benefit of every security which he holds at the time of the contract\u2014every security which he then holds; and he is not allowed in any way to vary the position of the surety with reference to those securities. That has been decided most distinctly in Mayhew v. Crickett [7] by Lord Eldon, where there was a warrant of attorney in the hands of a creditor put into operation by the creditor, and a judgment obtained, from which he afterwards discharged the principal debtor. Lord Eldon held it utterly immaterial whether the warrant of attorney was known to the surety at the time he entered into the contract or not. The surety had a complete right to the benefit of it, and if the benefits were lost to him he was at once discharged.\u201d In Wheatly v. Bastow [8], per the Lord Justice Turner:\nThe creditor is, no doubt, under the obligation of preserving the securities which he takes from the principal debtor, for (as observed by the Vice-Chancellor) the surety may entitle himself to the benefit of the securities, and if any of them be lost by the act or default of the creditor the surety may be wholly or partially discharged[9], but the creditor enters into no contract with the surety not to assign the debt or the securities.\nIn Wolff v. Day [10], per Hannen J:\nWe are not bound by the exact terms of it; but I take it to be established that the defendant became surety upon the faith of there being some real and substantial security pledged, as well as his own credit, to the plaintiffs; and he was entitled, therefore, to the benefit of that real and substantial security in the event of his being called on to fulfil his duty as a surety, and to pay the debt for which he had so become surety. He will, however, be discharged from his liability as surety if the creditors have put it out of their power to hand over the surety the means of recouping himself by the security given by the principal. That doctrine is very clearly expressed in the notes in Rees v. Barrington [11]. As a surety on payment of the debt is entitled to all the securities of the creditor, whether he is aware of their existence or not, even though they were given after the contract of suretyship, if the creditor, who has had or ought to have had, them in his full possession or power, loses them, or permits them to get into the possession of the debtor, or does not make them effectual by giving proper notice, the surety to the extent of such security will be discharged. A surety, moreover, will be released if the creditor, by reason of what he has done, cannot, on payment by the surety, give him the securities in exactly the same condition as they formerly stood in his hands.\u201d And numerous cases are cited in support of those statements.\nIn De Colyar\u2019s Law of Guarantees[12], the law is thus\nlaid down:\u2014\nBetween the surety and the principal debtor there is no privity of contract for the surety contracts with the creditor.\n183.\u2014* * In all these cases there is a privity between the parties which constitutes an identity of person; but there is no privity between the surety and principal, for the surety contracts with the creditor. They do not constitute one person in law, and are not jointly liable to the plaintiff.\n290.\u2014Another right is, that he is entitled to the benefit of all the securities, whether known to him (the surety) or not, which the creditor has against the principal. And it is the duty of the creditor, as soon as the surety has paid the debt, to make over to him all the securities which he, the creditor, holds, in order that the surety-may recoup himself. In the case of a person who becomes surety for a limited amount of a debt he has, on payment of the amount for which he is liable, all the rights of a creditor in respect of that amount and is entitled to a share in the security held by the creditor for the whole debt.\n391.\u2014We have already seen that a surety is entitled to the benefit of all securities which the creditor has against the principal. It follows, therefore, that if the surety be deprived of this benefit by the act of the creditor he will be discharged to the full extent of the security to which he was entitled; and, consequently, a creditor is bound to use diligence and care with regard to securities held by him. Thus, for instance, a creditor holding a mortgage for a guarantee debt is bound to hold it for the benefit of the surety so as to enable him, on paying the debt, to take the security in its original condition, unimpaired. The right of the surety is to have the same security in exactly the same plight and condition in which it stood in the creditors hands.\nIn Watts v. Shuttleworth [13] Pollock C.B. says:\u2014\nThe rule upon the subject seems to be that if the person guaranteed does any act injurious to the surety, or inconsistent with his rights, or if he omits to do any act which his duty enjoins him to do, and the omission proves injurious to the surety, the latter will be discharged. Story\u2019s Equity Jurisprudence[14]. The same principle is enunciated and exemplified by the Master of the Rolls in Pearl v. Deacon[15], where he cited with approbation the opinion of Lord Eldon in Craythorne v. Swinburne[16], that the rights of a surety depend rather on principles of equity than upon the actual contract; that there may be a quasi contract; but that the right of the surety arises out of the equitable relation of the parties. The Master of the Rolls also referred to the judgment of Vice-Chancellor Wood in Newton v. Chorlton[17], where he laid down that a creditor is bound to give the surety the benefit of every security he holds at the time of the contract; that the surety has a complete right to the benefit of it, and if the benefit be lost he would be discharged.\nIn Newton v. Chorlton[18] the marginal note thus\nstates the law:\u2014\nThe contract of suretyship entitles the surety to require that his position shall not be altered by any arrangement between the creditor and the principal debtor, from that in which he stood at the time of the contract; and it, therefore, entitles him absolutely to the benefit of all the securities for the debt which the creditor held at the time of the contract.\nIn Springer v. Toothaker[19] per Hathaway J.:\u2014\nIn equity, a creditor who has the personal contract of his debtor with a surety, and has also or takes afterwards, property from the principal as security for his debt, is to hold the property fairly and impartially for the benefit of the surety as well as for himself, and if he parts with it without the knowledge or against the will of the surety he shall lose his claim against the surety, to the amount of the property so surrendered.\nThe People v, Janson[20], Rees v. Berring ton[21], Law v. E. I. Co.[22], Baker v. Briggs; 2 ed. of 1 Story\u2019s Eq.[23].\nIn Green v. Millbank[24], N. Y. Sup. Court, per Van Vorst J.:\u2014\nIn Hinckley v. Kreitz[25] Church C.J. adopts the comprehensive statement of Story, that if a creditor does any act injurious to the surety, or inconsistent with his rights, or if he omits to do any act, when required by the surety, which his duty enjoins him to do and the omission proves injurious to the surety, in all such cases the latter will be discharged. 1 Story\u2019s Eq. Juris.[26]\nIn N.H. Savings Bank v. Colcord[27] Parker C.J. speaking of the principles of equity which regulate the relation of principal and surety, says:\u2014 Among these, as we have had occasion to notice in other cases, is one which requires a creditor, who has an obligation, executed by principal and surety, and who has also collateral security from the principal, to appropriate the avails of the security to the payment of the debt, or to hold it for the benefit of the surety, who, if he pay the debt, will be subrogated to the rights of the creditor * * * * If he surrenders such collateral security without the knowledge of the surety the latter will be discharged entirely, or pro tanto, according to the value of the security thus surrendered. Law v. East India Co.[28]; Baker v. Briggs[29]; 1 Story\u2019s Eq. Jur.[30]; McCollum v. Hinckley[31]; Bank of Manchester v. Bartlett[32]; Commonwealth v. Vanderslice[33]; Lichtenthaler v. Thompson[34]. But if the surety assent to the surrender it will not affect his liability.\nI think the judgment of the Divisional Court should be restored and the matter referred to the master, to take the accounts directed in that judgment.\nSTRONG J.\u2014The mortgage for the foreclosure of which this action was brought was executed by the respondents as sureties to secure a large debt due to the appellants by Kyle & Co., a firm of wine and spirit merchants carrying on business in Toronto. The appellants also held as collateral security for the same debt negotiable paper, consisting of bills of exchange and promissory notes, made and accepted by the customers of Kyle & Co. and endorsed by the latter. The proviso for the defeasance of the mortgage was as follows:\u2014\nProvided, this mortgage to be void on payment of twenty-six thousand five hundred and thirteen 04\/100 dollars of lawful money of Canada, as follows: in two years from the date hereof; and all bills of exchange, promissory notes and other paper upon which the said firm of Wm. Kyle & Co. were liable to the said mortgagees on the 24th day of November, A.D., 1883, together with all renewals, substitutions and alterations thereof, and all indebtedness of the said firm to the said mortgagees in respect of the said sum. This indenture being intended to be a continuing security to the said mort- gagees for the above amount, notwithstanding any change in the membership of the said firm, either by death, retirement therefrom or addition thereto, and also to secure and cover any sum due or to become due in respect of the interest, commission upon the said notes or renewals or other commercial paper, and taxes and performance of statute labor.\nThe respondents in their defence insist that the security has been discharged by reason of the appellants having renewed the original notes, bills and negotiable paper held by them as collateral securities at the date of the mortgage, and taken in substitution therefor renewals which turned out to be forged, as regards the names of the parties to such paper other than that of Kyle & Co., by whose fraud the appellants were induced to take these forged renewals, and the respondents further insist that the acceptance of such forged paper in lieu of the original genuine paper was such negligence on the part of the appellants that they are thereby exonerated from liability, either wholly or pro tanto to the extent of the value of the notes and bills which were exchanged for forged renewals.\nThe action came on for trial before Mr. Justice Ferguson who, at the conclusion of the evidence and with the consent of the parties, adjourned the cause for its further disposal into the Divisional Court, where it came on for argument before the Chancellor and Mr. Justice Proudfoot who gave judgment for the defendants (the present respondents). The appellants then appealed to the Court of Appeal, with the result that the judges being equally divided the appeal was dismissed.\nUpon the general question of law involved there can be little doubt. The duty of a creditor as regards collateral securities in his hands to which a surety on payment of the debt would be entitled to be subrogated has long been well settled by courts of equity. The creditor is bound to conserve the securities for the benefit of the surety, and if he parts with them in such a way as to put them beyond the reach of the surety on payment, or does anything which a prudent owner of such securities, acting in his own interest and in the regular course of business, would not do, or if he omits to do anything which such a prudent owner would do for the preservation of the securities, and they are thereby lost or deteriorated in value, or the surety is prejudiced, the latter is wholly or pro tanto (as the case may be) discharged from liability. That this is the rule to be applied in the present case does not indeed seem to have been questioned by any of the learned judges whose opinions have been adverse to the appellants. The Chancellor, in delivering the judgment of the Divisional Court, places the decision upon the ground of default on the part of the appellants, and in the Court of Appeal both the learned judges who agreed with the Chancery Division most distinctly place their judgments on the ground that the bank, in giving up the original genuine paper in exchange for forged renewals, was guilty of neglect and breach of duty as regards the respondents. The defendants themselves have, indeed, placed their defence on this same ground, for in the eighth paragraph of their statement of claim, where they put forward the principle of law on which they rely, they propound their defence as follows:\n8. The defendants further says that at the time of the execution of the said mortgage the plaintiffs held commercial paper of the said Kyle & Co. to an amount exceeding in value the amount secured by the said mortgage, and it was the duty of the plaintiffs to keep the same, or if they give up the same, or any part thereof, to obtain renewals thereof, or other commercial paper of the customers of said Kyle & Co., in substitution thereof, and to have said commercial paper ready to transfer and hand over to the defendants upon payment by them of the amount secured by the said commercial paper or procure other such paper in its stead, but negligently and improperly gave up the valid commercial paper held by them, and took instead thereof forged and invalid instruments, and they have not now commercial paper of the customers of the said Kyle & Co., to which the defendants would be entitled upon payment of the amount secured by the said mortgage, and the defendants say that they are discharged and released from the payment of the said mortgage, or any part thereof.\nBoth the Chief Justice and Mr. Justice Osler, who gave judgment in the Court of Appeal in favor of the appellants, adopt the same view of the case, conceding that if the bank was \u201cguilty of negligence\u201d the consequence would have been that the respondents, as sureties, would have been discharged, and they base their judgments on the inference of fact that there was no such negligence. There is, therefore, so far as both the courts below are concerned, a general consent of judicial opinion as to the abstract rule of law, by the application of which to the facts the case must be decided; and the difference of opinion which has arisen must be referred entirely to the different views taken by the several judges of what constitutes negligence in the circumstances of this particular case. In other words, the difficulty which has led to the conflict of opinion has arisen, not in laying down the legal principle applicable, but in applying it to the facts in evidence.\nIn order to ascertain whether the appellants have failed in their duty so as to render themselves liable to the imputation of negligence we must in the present, as in all cases where negligence is charged, and whether the question is to be determined by a jury under the direction of a judge, or by a court having in its own hands the decision of both law and fact, first of all enquire and endeavor to define, with as much exactitude as the nature of the case admits of, what is the standard of duty to which the appellants were bound to conform. In doing this the respondents will certainly have no right to complain if it is held that the creditor, in a case like the present, is bound to the same degree of diligence as a trustee in dealing with securities belonging to the trust, and to no greater, for it might easily be shown, as Mr. Justice Osler has said, that the analogy is not perfect and that the creditor in his dealings with collateral securities is not so strictly dealt with as is an express trustee in his management of the trust fund. But in doing this I am certainly not prepared to consider the instance of strictness in adjudicating on the liability of a trustee afforded by Lord Romilly\u2019s decision in Bostock v. Floyer[35] as conclusive, but I prefer to adopt the rule propounded by the higher authority of the House of Lords in the well-known case of Speight v. Gaunt[36], and apply it to the facts of the case before us.\nThen, in Speight v. Gaunt36 the House of Lords plainly and authoritatively state the law to be that a trustee ought to conduct the business of the trust in the manner an ordinarily prudent man of business would conduct his own affairs and that beyond that there is no obligation binding him. Applying that rule here, and always bearing in mind the facts that the creditors holding the collateral notes here were a banking corporation, that the notes had come into their hands, and the debt of the principal debtors had been contracted, and the whole transaction had occurred, in the ordinary course of the business of banking, and in the usual way of managing the bank account of a mercantile customer, our actual enquiry here is still further narrowed to this: Did the appellants, in accepting the fabricated renewals, do any act or fail to take any precaution which a prudent bank manager would not have done or would have taken under the circumstances?\nIn order to ascertain what is to be considered the duty of a banker in taking renewals of a large line of commercial paper, such as the appellants were the holders of in the present instance, we must, of course, have regard to the evidence so far as it is that of persons who may be regarded as experts, as to the course of business as carried on by bankers in such cases. But the court is not to confine itself to the evidence. It is also bound to bring its own common experience to bear and to take into consideration the practicability or impracticability of adopting the precautions which it is suggested ought to have been taken, and which might have prevented the loss. Then, considering the facts and the evidence in this way it certainly appears to me that it would be utterly impracticable to carry on the business of banking if every transaction, like the renewal of a note, was required to be attended with a degree of suspicious vigilance against forgery which no ordinarily prudent bank manager would ever think of exhibiting or could exhibit, without insult and injury to his customers, unless his suspicions had previously been aroused by circumstances warranting an exception to the usual course of dealing. Here there were no such circumstances; Kyle & Co. were traders in fair credit, and doing a large business in the same place as the bank itself, and immediately under the eyes of the bank officers, and no taint of suspicion had ever been attached to them. Under such circumstances an enquiry directly by the bank of each one of the customers of the firm, whose names appeared on notes presented for discount or as renewals, would not only have been out of the regular course, in the absence of cause for suspicion, but would have been an unwarranted injury to their commercial credit, and if they had turned out to be honest dealers, as the bank had every right to suppose them to be, would have been considered as an insult to be resented by the withdrawal of their account.\nIt seems to me, therefore, that it is most unjust and unreasonable now, because it has turned out that Kyle & Co. were a dishonest and bankrupt firm, engaged in practising a series of frauds upon the bank, to say that the appellants ought, at their peril, and by going out of the usual course of their business and of the business of all bankers, to have discovered that the notes which were put off upon them as genuine were, in truth, forgeries. Such a proposition is, I think, well answered by reference to the judgment of Bramwell, L.J., in Baxendale v. Bennett[37] when the learned judge says, in the passage which has been quoted by Mr. Justice Osler, \u201cEvery one has a right to suppose that a crime will not be committed, and to act on that belief.\u201d If the appellants had omitted any usual precaution, or had blindly persisted in dealing with the firm after circumstances had occurred calculated to rouse the suspicions of not merely a prudent man but of a prudent banker, who, I concede, ought to be more on his guard against such frauds than one not engaged in banking business, then the case would have admitted of very different considerations; but nothing of the kind is established by the evidence.\nAs to the omission to give notice of notes about to fall due it has, in my opinion, no bearing on the case, the practice not having been universal or even general and having for its object not the detection of frauds or forgeries but the insuring of punctuality by the parties primarily Kable on the paper, a precaution sometimes adopted but not in the interest of the parties to the paper but purely for the convenience of the bank itself, and therefore one which it was not bound to take and was at liberty to omit or discontinue as suited its own convenience without being subjected to any imputation of negligence for so doing. On the whole I am unable to see that any act or default can be imputed to the appellants, which amounted to misfeasance or negligence in taking the forged renewals in substitution for the genuine notes originally held by the bank.\nHad the mortgage not contained a clear recognition by the sureties of the creditors\u2019 right to renew the case S would have been susceptible of very different considerations. In that case the appellants would have parted with the genuine notes at their peril; and besides, as Mr. Justice Burton says in his judgment, there would then have been another independent ground of discharge, arising from the giving of time implied in taking the renewals.\nThere is, however, an express assent, as I construe the mortgage deed, to the course of renewal and substitution adopted, and, indeed, having regard to the way in which a bank account of this kind with a wholesale firm, having a large number of small customers, retail sellers and hotel keepers, scattered over the Province, is carried on it is scarcely to be conceived as possible that the bank would have taken a security which so restricted and fettered them as to have disabled them from renewing the notes which might be in their hands. There need, however, be no difficulty about this for it is not possible, upon any ordinary principles of construction, to do otherwise than hold that the sureties have, in the language used in the proviso in the mortgage deed (before extracted), stated their acquiescence in the mode of dealing which was subsequently adopted. The sole question is that already considered, whether the appellants, in renewing the notes as they were entitled to do by the terms of the mortgage, were guilty of negligence in allowing forged paper to be imposed upon them, and this to the best of my ability and to my own satisfaction I have already answered in the negative.\nTherefore, I have come to the same conclusions as were arrived at by the Chief Justice in appeal and by Mr. Justice Osler, and in the main for the same reasons. The judgments of both the courts below should be reversed and discharged, and the usual foreclosure decree should be entered in the Chancery Division, with costs to the appellants in the Court of Appeal and in this court.\nFOURNIER J.\u2014I concur in the judgment delivered by His Lordship the Chief Justice.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014I would dismiss this appeal with costs for the reasons given by Patterson J. in the court below.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014The sole question appears to be as to the proper form of the decree to be made in this suit, which was instituted by the plaintiffs, as0 mortgagees of certain real estate against the defendants, the mortgagors thereof, who, by the mortgage, became sureties only for the payment of a debt therein mentioned as being then due by a firm named Kyle & Co. to the plaintiffs. The suit was brought for the purpose of realising out of the mortgaged premises the amount remaining due in respect of the debt so guaranteed.\nThe question arises out of the ordinary course before the taking of the accounts of the debt secured by the mortgage, under the following circumstances. A firm carrying on in the city of Toronto a large wholesale business, as dealers in liquors and tea, under the name of Kyle & Co., were, upon the 24th November, 1883, indebted to the plaintiffs in the sum of $26,513 for monies advanced to them upon the discount of commercial paper of the said firm, and the plaintiffs refused to give the firm any further accommodation unless they. should furnish them with additional security for the said debt; the defendants having agreed to become such security by giving a mortgage upon real estate, the plaintiffs procured the mortgage which is sued upon to be prepared by their solicitor for execution by the defendants, and it was executed by them accordingly.\n(After reading the recitals and covenant for payment in the mortgage His Lordship proceeded):\nNow, it being by the Banking Act illegal for the plaintiffs to take security by mortgage upon real estate for future advances to be made thereon to any one, this mortgage, to be valid, must be construed, as indeed is also provided by the express terms of the instrument, as a security only for the debt of Kyle & Co. as it existed on the 24th day of November, 1883, and as represented by the commercial paper recited in the mortgage as having been before then discounted by the plaintiffs for Kyle & Co. The plain intent of the mortgage appears to me to be that the defendants should become, and they did thereby become, sureties for the due payment of such commercial paper, or of such other commercial paper as the plaintiffs in the ordinary and proper course of their business should take, by way of renewals thereof or in substitution therefor, during the period of two years. Any payments made to the plaintiffs by any of the parties primarily liable, or by Kyle & Co. themselves, upon any of the commercial paper then in existence, or upon any renewals thereof, would be a satisfaction pro tanto of the defendant\u2019s liability. Provision is made in the mortgage for the plaintiffs taking renewals of the then existing paper, and so on of such renewals during the two years, and the plain intent of this provision appears to me to be, that the defendants should exercise equally as sound a discretion as to the commercial paper which should be taken by them by way of renewals of, or in substitution for, the paper represent- ing the debt, as it stood on the 24th of November, A.D. 1883, as they would and should have taken in case they had renewed such paper from time to time without having had the additional security of the mortgage. They were not, by getting the additional security from sureties, to be less careful in the conduct of that part of their business with Kyle & Co., in which the sureties were concerned, than they would have been if they had given time to Kyle & Co. for the payment of their then existing debt without having the additional security given by the sureties. They were not to be at liberty to be indifferent to the interest of the sureties. Their plain duty, as it appears to me, was to keep the account of the debt of Kyle & Co., for which the defendants were sureties, and of the plaintiffs\u2019 dealings with the commercial paper in existence, recited in the mortgage, as representing such debt when the mortgage was executed, and of their dealings, also, with all the commercial paper which they should take from time to time by way of renewal of such paper, or by way of renewal of such renewals, during the whole period of the two years mentioned in the mortgage, wholly separate and distinct from the account the plaintiffs should keep with Kyle & Co. of all subsequent advances the plaintiffs should make to them upon other paper with which the defendants had nothing to do.\nWhat the plaintiffs now appear to have in fact done was to mix the two accounts together and to keep them as one account, just as if the defendants were sureties for the future advances as well as for the existing debt, thus mixing the account of the transactions with which the defendants as such sureties were concerned, with transactions with which they had no concern whatever; and the plaintiffs continued this mode of keeping their accounts until the month of September, 1885, when Kyle & Co. became insolvent and all further dealing with them ceased. At the time of their becoming insolvent Kyle & Co. are said to have been indebted to the plaintiffs on the footing of the single account so kept by them in a sum exceeding $57,000, for which the plaintiffs held paper of the customers of Kyle & Co., endorsed by them to, and discounted by, the plaintiffs to the amount only of about 25 per cent. of the whole amount, and for the balance or 75 per cent. all they held was Kyle & Co.\u2019s own promissory notes to the plaintiffs, together with which certain paper purporting to be the paper of customers of theirs, and payable to them, was deposited with the plaintiffs as collateral on collection for Kyle & Co., but this paper was not indorsed to, or discounted by, the plaintiffs, and nearly all of this latter paper the plaintiffs allege that they now believe to have been forged by Kyle & Co. At the time the defendants became sureties by the mortgage which they executed, it now appears that the debt for which they became sureties, that is to say, the $26,513 due on Nov. 24th, 1883, was, when the defendants executed the mortgage, represented by what are called straight discounts, that is to say, the paper of customers of Kyle & Co. payable to and endorsed by them to the plaintiffs and discounted by the latter for Kyle & Co., to the amount of $21,745 and the balance of $4,768 by Kyle & Co.\u2019s own notes to the plaintiffs, accompanied with collaterals deposited on collection. The plaintiffs\u2019 manager, in his evidence, admits that by reason of the difference in the manner in which the plaintiffs were accustomed to deal with what he calls the straight discounts, and the paper deposited by way of collateral to Kyle & Co.\u2019s own notes on collection, the result of the change made by the plaintiffs to take such a large amount of Kyle & Co.\u2019s own notes with collaterals, instead of the customers\u2019 paper on discount, was that thereby Kyle & Co. were the better enabled to commit the forgeries which it is alleged, they have committed, and that if the plaintiffs had only discounted customers\u2019 paper, indorsed by Kyle & Co. to the plaintiffs, the forgeries could hardly have been successfully committed at all. The plaintiffs are now claiming, under these circumstances, the right to recover from the defendants, under their mortgage, the whole $26,513, with interest, as still due and payable by them. The Chancery Division of the High Court of Justice for Ontario made a decree, whereby it was declared:\n1. That the defendants are exonerated from liability upon the mortgage in question in this action, in so far as they have been prejudiced by the conduct of the plaintiffs in surrendering the securities held by them on the 20th December, 1883, on the indebtedness of Kyle & Co., secured by the said mortgage, or any securities, received by the plaintiffs in renewal or substitution of such securities or in renewal or substitution of any such renewals \u00abor substitutions, and receiving in renewal or substitution therefor forged instruments from the firm of Kyle & Co., and doth order and adjudge the same accordingly.\nAnd the court did further declare:\n2. That prim\u00e2 facie the plaintiffs are bound for the face value of all securities held by them on the 20th December, 1883, or at any subsequent time, on the indebtedness of Kyle & Co., secured by the said mortgage which they the said plaintiffs may at any time have surrendered on receiving forged securities in lieu thereof, but the plaintiffs are to be at liberty to adduce evidence to reduce such liability to the amount which the said defendants have been actually damnified by the plaintiffs\u2019 acceptance of such forged securities, and subject to these declarations the court referred it to the master to take the account for redemption of sale of the mortgaged premises.\nUpon an appeal taken from this decree to the Court of Appeal for Ontario that court was divided in opinion, and thereupon the case has been appealed to this court.\nIn my judgment, the case is not yet ripe for a decision upon the question whether the defendants are relieved from liability in respect of such forged paper, if any, as the plaintiffs may have taken from Kyle & Co., which can be held to be referable to the particular tran- saction for which the defendants are guarantees. Nor can the question properly arise until the court shall be furnished with evidence (to be produced on the taking of the account, which the defendants are entitled to have taken showing the circumstances under which such forged paper was received by the plaintiff, and what was the particular paper given up by the plaintiffs upon every occasion upon which such forged paper came into their hands.\nAs at present advised, it appears to me (assuming any of the paper which the plaintiffs now hold to have been forged by Kyle & Co., and which in the present state of the case can be assumed only) that before any question can be effectually raised between the plaintiffs and the defendants as to any such paper it must be made to appear that such paper, is legitimately referable to and connected with the original debt which was secured by the mortgage\u2014that is to say, that such forged paper is paper which the plaintiffs actually received in renewal of or in actual substitution for paper which they held at the time of the execution of the mortgage, or by way of renewal of or in actual substitution for any renewals of such paper; and for this purpose it is necessary that an account should be taken of the particular dealings of the plaintiffs with the several bills of exchange and promissory notes which, at the time of the execution of the mortgage, represented the debt guaranteed by it, apart from and unaffected by any dealings between the plaintiffs and Kyle & Co. subsequently to the mortgage, and not guaranteed thereby, and of all renewals from time to time of all such original paper so guaranteed by the mortgage, and of all renewals of such renewals, respectively, and of all paper received by the plaintiffs in actual substitution for such original paper, or for any renewals thereof, and of all payments from time to time made to or received by the plaintiffs on account of or properly referable to such paper or any part thereof. Until such an account shall be taken it cannot be determined whether any paper in particular now held by the plaintiffs does or does not represent any part of the original debt guaranteed by the mortgage. In the case, as it at present stands, no question arises as to appropriations of payments under the rule in Clayton\u2019s case[38]. The City Discount Co. v. McLean[39] and Fenton v. Blackwood[40], and cases of that description, have no application to the present case. But the defendants being guarantees for particular distinct transactions which constitute part only of the plaintiffs\u2019 dealings with Kyle & Co., and having no connection with large advances made by the plaintiffs to Kyle & Co., subsequently to the transactions guaranteed by the defendants\u2019 mortgage, are entitled, whatever may have been the mode in which the plaintiffs kept their accounts with Kyle & Co., to have an account taken of the transactions in respect of which the defendants are guarantees, wholly unprejudiced by and separated from the dealings of the plaintiffs with Kyle & Co., with which the defendants have no concern. They have as much right to call upon the plaintiffs to account for all paper from time to time accepted by them by way of renewal of the original commercial paper mentioned in the mortgage as then existing as they have for an account of all monies paid by any of the parties primarily liable upon any such paper, or by Kyle & Co. themselves, upon the occasion of the plaintiffs giving up, if they did give up, any of such paper to them, and of the circumstances under which the plaintiffs parted with any such original commercial paper or any renewals thereof. This case differs from Moffatt v. Merchants Bank[41] in this, that the guarantee there was by bond a mode of security which it was competent for the plaintiffs to take by way of security for future advances as well as for a debt already incurred, and which the majority of the court held was in its\u2019 terms a security for such future advances. While referring to this case, I wish to observe that the head note of the case, as reported in 11 Can. S.C.R. 46, is very inaccurate and misleading. It is there in substance said that the judgment of the majority of the court was that the obligor in the bond was liable upon it according to its tenor and effect, a point as to which there could not well be any difference of opinion; but I am represented as having dissented from this proposition, whereas the only difference of opinion which existed between me and the majority of the court was as to what was the tenor and effect of the bond, they being of opinion that it covered the future advances, I that it was limited to the then existing debt alone.\nThe decree should, in my opinion, be varied and should be to the effect following: declare that the defendants are sureties only for the debt of $26,513 in the mortgage in the pleadings mentioned as represented by the commercial paper in the said mortgage also mentioned as constituting such debt, and that as such sureties they are entitled to have an account taken of all the plaintiffs\u2019 dealings with such commercial paper, and of all payments, if any made in respect thereof, or properly referable to, and which should have been credited by the plaintiffs to any of such paper, and in the taking of such account the defendants are to be kept free from all prejudice, if any there be, arising from the fact of the plaintiffs having in the account kept by them with Kyle & Co. mixed up their, the said plaintiffs\u2019, dealings in respect of the paper held by them representing the said $26,513 from subsequent advances made by the plaintiffs to Kyle & Co., with which the defendants had no concern. Refer it to the master to take an account of all such securities as aforesaid so recited in the said indenture of mortgage, and of all the dealings of the plaintiffs in respect of each and every such securities, and of all payments, if any, made thereon or on account thereof, and also of all securities from time to time taken and received by the said plaintiffs by way of renewal of or in substitution for any such original securities, or by way of renewal of or in substitution for any of such renewals, and of all sums of money paid directly to the plaintiffs by any of the parties to any of such securities other than Kyle & Co., or by the said Kyle & Co., either directly in respect of any of such securities or properly referable thereto, and which should have been credited by the plaintiffs to any of such securities, or to the original debt of $26,513 represented thereby; and the said master is to report what amount, if any, appears to remain due upon or in respect of said original securities, or of any other and what securities in particular from time to time received by the plaintiffs in renewal of or in substitution for any of them; and what are the particular securities, if any there be, now held by the plaintiffs which have at any time or times been received by them in renewal of or in substitution for any of such original securities, or by way of renewal of or in substitution for any of such renewals; and under what circumstances each of such securities was taken and received by the plaintiffs, and whether any of the paper now held by the plaintiffs representing any part of the said original securities is for any and, if any, what reason valueless. And whether, in the opinion of the said master, any diminution in value from the face amount of such securities, or any of them, if any there be, has arisen from any and, if any, what neglect or disregard by the plaintiffs of any duty due by them to the defendants as such sureties as aforesaid. The master to report such further special cir- cumstances, if any there be, appearing in evidence before him.\nReserve further consideration and costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSilicitors for appellants: Smith, Rae & Green.\nSolicitors for respondents: McKays, McIntyre & Stewart.\nSolicitors for respondent Clarkson: MacLaren, MacDonald, Meredith & Shepley.\n[1] 12 O.R. 498.\n[2] 24 Ver. 241.\n[3] L.R. 12 Eq. 377.\n[4] 22 Ch.

A creditor who has his debt secured by a surety, and has also property pledged to him by the principal debtor as security, is bound to keep the property for the benefit of the surety as well as of himself, and if he surrender the property without the knowledge and consent of the surety he loses his claim against the surety to the extent of the property given up.

Ritchie C.J. and Strong, Fournier, Henry and Gwynne JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.\nFire Insurance\u2014Description of property\u2014Error in policy\u2014Statutory condition\u2014Just or reasonable variation\u2014Waiver.\nThe agent of an insurance company filled in an application for insurance on a building built of boards and fixed the premium at the rate demanded on brick buildings, there being no tariff value for board buildings. The words \u201cboards\u201d was so badly written that it was difficult to decipher it, but the character of the building was designated on a diagram on the back of the application which the agents wore instructed to mark with red in case of a brick, and black in case of a frame building. It this case it was in black. At the head office the word intended for boards was read \u201cbrick\u201d and the policy issued as on a brick building. A loss having occurred the company, under a clause in the policy, caused an arbitration to be had, but afterwards refused to pay the amount awarded to the insured, claiming that by reason of the error in the policy there was no existing contract of insurance.\nHeld, affirming the judgment of the court below, that as there had been no misrepresentation by the assured, and no mutual mistake, the parties were ad idem and the contract was complete, and even if it were otherwise the company could not set up this defence after treating the contract as existing by the reference to arbitration under the policy.\nBy the 17th condition in ch. 102 R.S.O. a loss is not payable until thirty days after the proofs of loss are put in unless otherwise provided by statute or agreement of the parties.\nHeld, per Ritchie C.J. and Fournier, Henry and Gwynne JJ. that this is a privilege accorded to the company and while the time maybe further limited by agreement it cannot be extended.\nPer Strong J\u2014That a variation of the condition by inserting a clause in the policy extending the time to 60 days is not a variation by agreement of the parties, nor is such varied condition a just or reasonable one. APPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] affirming the judgment of the Divisional Court[2] which sustained the plaintiff\u2019s verdict and refused a new trial.\nThis is an action by the plaintiff against the defendants, under the following circumstances:\u2014\nOn the third day of July, 1883, the plaintiff made an application to the defendants through one Stafford, their local agent at Renfrew, to insure a building at Renfrew for $2,500. A policy subsequently issued upon this application, and on the 15th day of April, 1884, a fire occurred. Proofs of loss were sent by the company to Stafford, the local agent, on the 16th April. Stafford was away from home at the time, but returned on the 24th April. He handed the papers to Smith, the plaintiff, instructing him to fill them up and to leave them with Mr Eady, a local magistrate, for him, Stafford, to get and send to the office, which Stafford says he did on the 26th April, 1884. An action was brought on the 4th June, 1884. On the 24th June, the magistrate\u2019s certificate was demanded. On the 19th July, 1884, an arbitration having been had between the parties, an award was made fixing the loss at $1,700, and the value of the property at $2,500. The action came on for trial at the Pembroke fall assizes for 1884, and was tried before Mr. Justice Rose and a jury, when judgment was given for the plaintiff. The defendants thereupon moved before the Queen\u2019s Bench Divisional Court to set aside the judgment, which court unanimously dismissed the motion with costs. The defendants thereupon appealed to the Court of Appeal for Ontario, which court unanimously dismissed the appeal with costs, and the defendants thereupon appealed to this court.\nThe following facts will show the nature of the defence to this action: \u201cWhen the insurance was effected the company\u2019s usual printed form of application was filled up by the agent from the answers of the plaintiff and from his knowledge of the premises derived from personal inspection and examination; the property was described as a building two stories high, &c., built of \u201cbirds\u201d covered with shingles, situate and being No. on the west side of Raglan St., Block 2, No. 79, Goad\u2019s plan. It was a wooden building made of boards six inches wide laid flat one on top of another, and the word \u201cburds\u201d which is very distinctly thus written in the application, was written and intended by the agent for the word boards and seems to be a mere misspelling of that word.\nOn the back of the application is a diagram of the building, and the printed direction to the agent at the top of the blank space left for the diagram requires that brick or stone buildings shall be shown in red and frame buildings in black. The diagram shows the buildings in black.\nThe local agent fixed the rate for the premium at 1\u00bd p.c. His authority to fix a rate was not denied. This was the company\u2019s rate for a brick building. He said on the trial that he considered a solid board building a safer risk than a brick building, and would not rate it any higher. The tariff provided no special rate for a board building.\nThe policy issued by the company insures \u201cthe property hereinafter described, and more fully described in the requisition for insurance, that is to say,\u201d on the building only of a two story brick building, situate, &c., the word written \u201cburds\u201d in the application being read at the head office as \u201cbrick.\u201d\nIt was contended by the defendants on the motion to set aside the verdict that the parties were never ad idem, and consequently no valid contract existed be- tween them. The courts below held that, assuming this was a valid defence, the company could not claim the benefit of it as, under a clause in the policy, they caused the plaintiff\u2019s claim to be submitted to arbitration, and by so doing recognized the existence of a contract between them.\nAnother objection to the verdict was that the evidence showed the insured premises to have been occupied, at the time of effecting the insurance, by objectionable characters who had been threatened with violence by the villagers and were finally driven out of the place, the company contending that the insurance was effected under an apprehension of an incendiary fire on the premises. As to this it was shown that the premises were vacant for some time before the fire, and the jury found that the risk was less when vacant than when occupied by the above mentioned tenants.\nA further objection was that the action was brought too soon. A statutory condition in the policy was that the insurance should not be payable until thirty days after due proofs unless otherwise provided by statute or the agreement of the parties. In this case the policy provided that the loss should not be payable until sixty days after completion of claim which the court below held was an unreasonable condition.\nRobinson Q.C. for the appellants.\nAs to weight of evidence see Campbell v. Hill[3]; Sutherland v. Black[4].\nThe weight of evidence may make the judgment perverse. Greet v. Citizens Ins. Co.[5]\nThe company had a right to notice when the premises became vacant which was a change material to the risk. (Ritchie C.J. refers to Foy v. Etna Ins. Co.[6] where the contrary was held.)\nThen as to the condition that the insurance shall not be payable for thirty days after proof of loss. The judge at the trial held this condition to be unreasonable, but it is submitted that the company can make what conditions they choose. The statutory condition is that it shall not be payable for thirty days unless otherwise provided by statute or agreement. That clearly authorizes an extension of the time to sixty days.\nThis special condition has never been the subject of judicial decision, but there are a number of cases in which the reasonable nature of conditions has been discussed. Ballagh v The Royal Mutual Ins. Co.[7]; and the judgment of Moss C.J., in the same case on appeal[8]; May v. The Standard Ins. Co.[9]; Butler v. The Standard[10]; Parsons v. Queen\u2019s Ins. Co.[11]; Ulrich v. National IKS. Co.[12]; Morrow v.Waterloo County Mut. Ins. Co.[13]\nMcCarthy Q.C. for the respondents.\nThere is no misdirection complained of and no error in law in the judgment on the trial. All that is complained of is in the discretion of the judge and jury with which discretion an appellate court, and especially a second appellate court, will not interfere. Metropolitan Ry. Co. v. Wright[14]; Allen v. Quebec Warehouse Co.[15]; Eureka Woollen Mills Co. v. Moss[16]; and Bickford v. Howard[17]; Black v Walker[18].\nAs to the condition extending the time of payment to sixty days that can be placed on no higher ground than that of its reasonable or unreasonable character. That is dealt with in the case of Queen\u2019s Ins. Co. v. Parsons[19]. In the same case in the Privy Council[20] it was held that this was a question to be decided at the trial.\nThe latest case on the question is The Great Western Ry. Co v. McCarthy[21] decided on a statutory condition similar to that in question here. I would also refer to Sands v. Standard Ins. Co.[22]; May v. The Standard Ins. Co.[23]\nAs to the authority of the agent to bind the company see Insurance Co. v. Wilkinson[24].\nSir W.J. RITCHIE C.J.\u2014The first and really the substantial objection proceeds entirely upon this, that the company took the word spelt \u201cburds\u201d in the application to mean bricks and issued the policy describing the subject matter of insurance as a brick building. In the language of the statement of defence they say that if the plaintiff intended to insure the building as a wooden one, no contract was made by reason of a want of mutual understanding between the parties as to the subject matter of the agreement.\nStafford, the agent who filled in the application says:\nI say that that is meant for boards, it is not very plain; it is my own handwriting.\nThe plaintiff swears it was\u2014\nNever meant for a brick building in the application. The agent filled in the diagram on the back of the application.\nI have examined the original application and am unable to make \u201cbrick\u201d out of the word in dispute, and am of opinion it must have been intended for boards, spelt \u201cburds\u201d But if there is any difficulty in deciphering the word I think the intention of the parties and the identification and character of the pro- perty to be insured is clearly established beyond all reasonable question by the diagram in black on the application, which clearly indicated to the company that the house was not a brick building. That such were the view and intention of both the agent of the insurers and the insured is conclusively shown by the certificate of the agent indorsed on the application and his evidence that he had inspected the property personally and therefore knew that the building to be insured was constructed of boards and not of brick, and therefore, acting honestly (and neither his bona fides nor that of the assured has been assailed) he could not have transmitted the premium on a brick building when he knew from personal examination it was a board one. He also certifies that the property was steadily profitable and fully recommended the risk; that the premium was paid and the company was now in the risk. \u201cWhat risk but the one he had personally inspected, which, unquestionably, was a house built with boards?\nUnder these circumstances had the company honestly considered that the word written was intended for brick and not for boards, in view of the discrepancy between the word and the diagram surely they should have placed the matter beyond all doubt and not have retained the premium of the assured and allowed him to remain under the impression that his property was covered by the policy transmitted to him. In addition to which the defendants clearly recognized the policy as an existing contract of insurance by calling for further proofs of loss and the magistrates certificate mentioned in condition 13, after they had notice of the error in the description; a thing, as Mr. Justice Osler justly remarks, they clearly had no right to do except upon the assumption that there was an existing contract. I think the jury were right in finding that the vacating of the premises by the Bromleys was not material to the risk in the view of increasing it and that, on the contrary, that the risk was less after the Bromleys had left and that there was no incendiary danger threatened at the time of the application, and such finding should not be disturbed\nThe 17th statutory condition is:\u2014\nThe loss shall not be payable until thirty days after completion of the proofs of loss unless otherwise provided by statute or the agreement of the parties.\nWith reference to this condition I am inclined to adopt the construction put upon it by Mr. Justice Burton, namely,\nThat it is a privilge given by law to the companies and the statute does not seem to contemplate any further extension but simply that the company shall have that delay, unless, under a statute or by their own agreement, that period is shortened.\nSTRONG J.\u2014I concur generally in the conclusion of the judgment of Mr. Justice Gwynne, and also in the reasons given therefor with the exception of those relating to the defence based on the variation of the 17th condition. That variation I hold not to have been warranted by the agreement of the parties and not to be just and reasonable, agreeing in this respect with the judgments of Mr. Justice Osler and Mr. Justice Rose.\nFOURNIER J.\u2014I entirely agree with the learned Chief Justice in both questions raised in this appeal, on the one as to the description of the property insured as well as that relating to the interpretation of the 17th statutory condition. I think the proper construction of that condition is, that the parties can agree to a shorter period than thirty days but not to a longer. The variation here is, that the loss shall not be payable until sixty days after completion of the claim which, I think, is not allowable under the statute. HENRY J.\u2014I am in favor of dismissing this appeal. I think it is clear what the respondent intended to insure, and the mistake in the policy was due to the company, who cannot be allowed to retain the premiums and, at the same time, claim the benefit of the mistake.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014Upon the question as to the property insured being described in the policy as a \u201cbrick\u201d building when in fact it was built of boards laid across each other and plastered at both ends, I do not think we can now interfere. The policy may I think be read as\ninsuring against loss and damage by fire the property more fully described in the requisition for this insurance No. 7270, which forms part and parcel of this policy and hereafter described, that is to say, as the building only of a two story brick building, &c.,\nWe must, I think, read the finding of the jury to be that in the requisition the building was described as being built of boards.\nThe company\u2019s agent, whose duty it was to fix the rate, inspected the building before accepting the risk, and was aware of the precise nature of the structure which he considered to be safer than brick as against loss or damage by fire, and he fixed the rate according to the company\u2019s rate for a brick building. The description of the building in the policy as being of brick appears to have been the mistake of the company themselves, and in a matter which, in their opinion, was not material, judging by their acts after they had full knowledge that the building was not of brick, for they instituted a reference to arbitration under the 16th statutory condition to determine the amount of the plaintiff\u2019s loss in respect of the property insured. This reference, although not interfering with the defendant\u2019s right to dispute the plaintiff\u2019s right to recover under the policy (having regard to its conditions) is based however upon the fact of the existence of the policy as a contract between the insurers and the insured, and was a recognition by the defendants of the then existence of the policy. The institution by the defendants of such reference after their attention had been specially drawn to the fact that the building was not brick appears to be quite inconsistent with their present contention, namely, that there never was any contract in existence by reason of the defendants and the plaintiff never having been ad idem. Neither do I think, in view of the finding of the jury upon the other questions submitted to them to support which findings I cannot say that there was not sufficient evidence if believed, that we can disregard these findings and order a new trial.\nThe only remaining question is that arising upon the construction of the 17th statutory condition and the variation thereof endorsed upon the policy.\nIt may perhaps seem singular that so much difficulty should have arisen in construing these statutory conditions when we reflect that they were framed by a committee of the learned judges of Ontario specially commissioned for the purpose.\nThis 17th condition is not one affecting the validity of the policy or the right of the insured to indemnity for his loss, it is a condition affecting the insured\u2019s remedy only and it prescribes merely the time when his loss shall be exigible. This being its nature, its more natural place would seem, I think, to have been in the body of the act rather than as a condition endorsed upon the policy.\nIf the condition be one which is subject to variation under the provision in the act relating to variations I must say that I can see nothing which would justify a court in adjudging a variation from 30 days to 60 days from the completion of the proofs of loss before the loss should be paid to be unjust and unreasonable. I cannot concur in the opinion that every variation which makes a condition more onerous upon the insured than is the statutory condition is of necessity unjust and unreasonable\u2014that, in fact, the terms \u201cmore onerous and burshensome\u201d are equivalent to \u201cunjust and unreasonable.\u201d I cannot bring my mind to believe that either the committee of judges who framed these conditions or the legislature which gave to them the force of law were of opinion that the conditions thus made statutory reached the utmost limit of exaction that was just and reasonable. As framed they were no doubt deemed to be just and reasonable, but if they were intended to express the utmost limit of exaction that was just and reasonable the provision as to variations could not have been framed as it is, nor, indeed, would any provision at all as to variations have been necessary. It is as exactions that the variations are authorized. Now an exaction is something forced upon the insured against his will, at the sole will of the insurer if the policy is accepted. If then only such variations were intended to be authorized as should be less onerous and burdensome upon the insured than the statutory condition in the same matter, neither the committee of judges nor the legislature would have spoken of such variations as \u201cexactions\u201d and it would have been quite absurd that the legislature should have clogged such variations with the condition that to acquire validity\nthey should be held by the judge or court before whom a question is tried relating thereto, to be just and reasonable to be exacted by the company.\nThe statutory conditions being themselves framed as being conditions just and reasonable to be exacted a variation which should make any such conditions to be less onerous, must of necessity be just and reasonable, and it is only in the case of a variation exacting something more onerous upon the insured than the statutory condition in the same matter enacts, that any question could arise calling for the decision of a judge or court to determine whether the variation is a just and reasonable one to be exacted by the company.\nI do not see that any rigid rule can be laid down applicable to all cases as a test adequate to determine whether a variation of any of the statutory conditions is just and reasonable or not. The question can only arise when to an action on the policy the defence is rested upon the breach by the insured of some or one of the statutory conditions as varied, which defence is met by the contention set up by the plaintiff that the condition as varied is not just and reasonable, and that therefore the statutory condition without the variation (which is suggested to be unjust and unreasonable) should apply. Such affirmative proceeding from the insured to avoid the effect of the variation would seem to require, in accordance with the ordinary rule, that he should suggest in support of his contention some reason to the court or judge called upon to determine the question. Every case must, as it appears to me, depend upon its own circumstances and the sound sense of those who are called upon to determine the question, and no rule can be laid down applicable to all cases. In the present case the question does not, as it appears to me, arise, for the language of this l7th statutory condition is peculiar and seems to me to exclude this condition from the general provisions as to variations in conditions. The condition is:\u2014\nThe loss shall not be payable until thirty days after completion of the proofs of loss unless otherwise provided by the statute or agreement of the parties.\nWhat is meant by the words \u201cunless otherwise provided by statute\u201d it is difficult to see but with this we are not at present concerned; but the latter words, \u201cor agreement of the parties,\u201d seem to me to point to an actual, positive agreement of the parties and not to a variation exacted by the company\u2014as to which the provision of the statute is that the court or judge before whom the question arises is to determine whether the variation be just and reasonable. I agree with Mr. Justice Burton that the condition critically examined is that the loss shall not be payable until thirty days after completion of the proofs of loss unless a shorter period is agreed upon by the parties. It shall not be payable before the expiration of thirty days from completion of the proofs of loss, unless otherwise provided by agreement of the parties\u2014that is to say unless the parties agree that it shall be; the language of the condition is nor, that the loss shall be payable upon and after the expiration of thirty days from the completion of the proofs of loss unless otherwise provided by agreement of the parties\u2014the object is merely to postpone the insured\u2019s remedy for thirty days after completion by him of his proofs of loss; that such a length of time shall elapse after completion of his proofs of loss before he can bring his action unless the parties shall provide otherwise, that is to say shall agree that such a length of time shall not elapse after completion of his proofs of loss before he can bring his action. This being the literal construction of the 17th condition I think we should so read it to prevent the plaintiff\u2019s right of action being, as it would now be, wholly barred by the provision of the 22nd statutory condition which provides that\nEvery suit, action or proceeding against the company for the recovery of any claim under or by virtue of the policy shall be absolutely barred unless commenced within the term of one year next after the loss or damage occurs.\nFor the above reasons I am of opinion that the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellants: Morphy & Millar.\nSolicitors for respondent: McCarthy, Osler, Hoskin & Creelman.\n[1] 14 Ont.

J. Ritchie C.J., and Fournier, Strong, Taschereau and Gwynne JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF NOVA SCOTIA.\nWill\u2014Devise under\u2014Absolute\u2014Subsequent restriction\u2014Repugnancy\nA testator directed his real estate to be sold and the proceeds, after payment of debts and certain legacies, to be divided into twelve equal parts, \"five of which I give and devise to my beloved daughter C. M., four of which I give and devise to A. E. F. (daughter), and three of which subject to the conditions and provisions hereinafter set forth, I reserve for my son C. W. M. But in no case shall any creditor of either of my children, or any husband of either of my children, daughters have any claim or demand upon the said executrices, &c., but their respective shares shall be kept and the interest, rents, and profits thereof shall be paid and allowed to them annually * * * during their respective lives.\" In an action by the daughters to have their shares paid over to them untrammelled by any trust.\u2014\nHeld, affirming the judgment of the court below, that it was clearly the intention of the testator that the daughters should only receive the income from the shares during their lives.\nAppeal from a decision of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia[1] giving judgment for the defendants on a special case.\nThis action arose from the provisions of the will of the Hon Jonathan McCully, which contained the following clause, after directing that the real estate be sold and certain debts and legacies paid out of the proceeds:\u2014\n\"I order and direct that the whole balance of proceeds of the estate be divided into twelve equal parts, five of which I give and devise to my beloved daughter Celeste Marie, four of which I give and devise to Agnes E. Foot, and three of which, subject to the conditions and provisions hereinafter set forth, I reserve for my son Clarence W. McCully. But in no case shall any creditor of either of my children or any husband of either of my children, daughters, have any claim or demand upon the said executrices, executors or trustees, but their respective shares shall be kept and the interest, rents and profits thereof, shall be paid and allowed to them annually by their co-trustees and the survivors of them during their respective lives and their receipts only shall operate as discharges.\"\nThe action was brought by the above devisees Celeste Marie and Agnes E. Foot and their respective husbands to have the several shares devised to them paid over at once untrammelled by any trust, they claiming that the gift of five-twelfths and four-twelfths so devised was absolute and could not be cut down by doubtful words or by implication, and that the restrictions as to claims of creditors and husbands were repugnant and illegal.\nThe Supreme Court of Nova Scotia held that the clear intention and direction of the testator was, that the shares of the daughters should be held and invested by the trustees during coverture and the income only paid to them, and gave judgment for the defendants The plaintiffs then appealed to the Supreme. Court of Canada.\nHenry Q.C. for the appellants.\nProtecting the property devised from claims of creditors is against public morality and protecting it from claims of a husband of the devisee is an infringement of his marital rights as given by law. Therefore, either of these limitations standing alone would be void.\nThe following authorities deal with the question of restrictions on alienation, Brandon v. Robinson[2]; Hulme v. Tenant[3]; Tullett v. Armstrong[4]; Percy v. Percy[5]; Re Bown[6]; Gray's Restraints on Alienations[7].\nGraham Q.C. for respondents referred to Re Grey's Settlements, Acason v. Greenwood[8]; D'Oechsner v. Scott[9]; Doolan v. Blake[10]; Freeman v. Flood[11].\nSir W. J. RITCHIE C.J.\u2014(His Lordship read the material clauses of the will and then proceeded as follows.)\nTo hold that the plaintiffs are entitled, under the said will and codicils, to have the relief claimed, and to have it declared that Celeste Marie James and Agnes E. Foot and their husbands are entitled to have their respective shares passed over to them absolutely, would be, in my opinion, to ignore and set at defiance the, to my mind, very clearly expressed intention of the testator which, I think, was to withhold the principal from his daughters and their husbands and to allow the daughters only the annual income thereof during their respective lives, and this intention the provision seems to me very clearly to express.\nIf these principal moneys are now to be handed over to the daughters and their husbands, and they are to have the right to the absolute control of them free from all trusts and therefore free from the control of the trustees, how can it be said that their respective shares shall be kept and the interest, rents, and profits thereof shall be paid and allowed to them annually by their co-trustees and the survivors of them during their respective lives, and their receipts only shall operate as discharges? If the corpus is handed over how can the income be paid annually?\nThen we have a provision for allowing Celeste Marie an amount suitable to her rank until she arrives at the age of twenty-one years, but not to exceed the interest on her five-twelfths, and this clause:\u2014\nIn case of the death of Celeste before she becomes of legal age or before marriage, or in case of her death without issue, then her interest and share shall be inherited and become the property of Agnes E. Foot, her sister and her heirs as fully and completely as if devised herein and hereby. Subject only to the same provisions as in the hands of her deceased sister Celeste.\nvery clearly shows that the trusts were to be continued, and that the testator never intended that they were not to exist at all as to Agnes E. Foot who was married at the time of the making of the will, which would, practically, be the result of the plaintiffs' contention, or as to Celeste Marie to cease on her attaining twenty-one years of age.\nUnder these circumstances I think the decision of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia quite right and that the appeal should be dismissed.\nSTRONG J.\u2014The question presented for decision by this appeal is purely one of construction arising on the will of the late Hon. Jonathan McCully, and relates to the bequests of certain shares of the residue of the testator's estate, made respectively to his two daughters, Agnes E. Foot and Celeste Marie McCully.\nThe clause of the will which we are now called upon to construe is in the following words:\u2014 I release and discharge each of my children from all debts due and owing to me, and for all advances made previous to my death, and in order that there may be as nearly as can be ascertained a fair division of what shall remain after payment or deduction of the legacies herein named, I order and direct that the whole balance of proceeds of the estate be divided into twelve equal parts, five of which I give and devise to my beloved daughter Celeste Marie, four of which I give and devise to Agnes E. Foot, and three of which subject to the conditions and provisions hereinafter set forth I reserve for my son Clarence W. McCully. But in no case shall any creditor of either of my children or any husband of either of my children, daughters, have any claim or demand upon the said executrices executors or trustees, but their respective shares shall be kept and the interest, rents and profits thereof shall be paid and allowed to them annually by the co-trustees and the survivors of them during their respective lives and their receipts only shall operate as discharges.\nAt the time of the testator's decease his daughter, Mrs. Foot, was married; his other daughter, Celeste Marie, was unmarried, but previous to the time of the institution of the present action she had married, and both daughters were under coverture when the action was brought.\nThe daughters and their husbands by this action seek to have it declared that they are entitled to the immediate payment over to them of the capital of the funds respectively bequeathed to them. The defendants, who are the trustees under the will, submit that they are not entitled to such payment, inasmuch as the legacies were for their separate use, and as regards the corpus at least, without power of anticipation.\nThe court below has determined both these questions against the plaintiffs, and I am of opinion that their decision is entirely right and ought to be affirmed.\nAs regards the question of separate use the exclusion of the husbands of the daughters from any right to call for payment of the legacies, and the direction that the legacies \"shall be kept\" (by which, of course, it is meant that the corpus of the respective funds shall be retained in the hands of the trustees) are conclusive to show that it was the testator's intention to limit the legacies to the separate use of his daughters. It would be idle and superfluous to cite cases in support of this construction, since it suffices to refer to the general principle that in order to create a limitation to the separate use of a married woman all that is required is the demonstration of an intention to exclude the husband. Then, there could not be a plainer indication of an intention to that effect than we have in the present instance.\nAs regards restraint upon anticipation that is divisible into two heads\u2014first, in relation to the corpus, secondly, with reference to the income.\nThe words \"shall be kept\" which, as I have already said, are equivalent to an expression that the corpus of each legacy shall be retained by the trustees, and can have no other meaning than that, coupled with the direction to pay the income to the legatees, clearly exclude the inference that the legatees were entitled to call for payment of the funds to themselves. Whatever doubt there may have previously been as to the sufficiency of such a direction to constitute a restraint on anticipation, modern decisions of the highest authority and of very recent date[12] have conclusively established that where there is anything to show that the fund is to be retained by the trustees, and the income only paid to the married woman during coverture, the restraint takes effect.[13].\nThe will now before us undoubtedly complies with these conditions. It contains a distinct direction that the corpus shall be retained by the trustees and the income only paid to the married women, beneficiaries. Consequently, the gift to separate use with the restriction on all power of disposition during coverture as regards the corpus took effect, as regards the bequest to Mrs. Foot, immediately on the testator's death. And in the case of Mrs. James, when she married without having, in the interval between the testator's death and her marriage, made any disposition of her legacy the same result followed.\nI find nothing in the will indicating any intention to restrain anticipation of the income. The direction that the receipts of the married woman alone shall operate as discharges, the only grounds in this will which can be referred to as affecting the right of disposition of income, have been held ineffectual for this purpose[14].\nThe appeal must be dismissed, but I think it reasonable that the costs should come out of the estate, inasmuch as the testator himself, by the loose and inaccurate language in which he expressed himself, has really been the cause of doubts which the parties were justified in asking the court to solve.\nFOURNIER J.\u2014I am in favor of dismissing this appeal for the reasons given by the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014I would dismiss this appeal for the reasons given in the court below. Upon the reading of the will alone, without reference to authorities, I would determine that these plaintiffs are not entitled to the capital of the moneys in question.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014I agree with the opinion expressed by my brother Strong.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellants: Henry, Ritchie & Weston.\nSolicitors for respondents: Graham, Tupper, Borden & Parker; Sedgewick, Ross & Sedgewick.\n[1] 20 N.

Ins.\u2014 Warranty in policy\u2014Time of sailing\u2014Action on policy\u2014Limitation of time\u2014 Defective proof\u2014Whether time runs from filing of.\nA vessel insured for a voyage from Charlottetown to St. Johns, Nfld., left the wharf at Charlottetown on December 3, with the bon\u00e2 fide intention of commencing her voyage. After proceeding a short distance she was obliged, by stress of weather, to anchor within the limits of the harbor of Charlottetown and remained there until December 4 when she proceeded on her voyage.\nHeld, that this was a compliance with a warranty in the policy of insurance to sail not later than December 3, but a breach of a warranty to sail from the Port of Charlottetown not later than December 3.\nA clause in a marine policy required action to be brought out on it within twelve months from the date of depositing claim for loss or damage at the office of the assurers. A protest was deposited accompanied by a demand for the insurance. The protest was defective and some months later an amended claim was deposited.\nHeld, affirming the judgment of the court below, that an action begun more than twelve months after the original, but less than twelve months after the amended, claim was deposited was too late.\nAppeal from a decision of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia[1] sustaining, by a divided court, the judgment for the defendant on the trial.\nThis is an action on two marine policies of insurance issued by the Chebucto Marine Association, whereof defendant was a member, to the plaintiffs, bearing date the 29th November, 1882, one for $1,500 upon the hull of the schooner \"Marion Robertson,\" the other for $500 upon the freight laden on board thereof, on a voyage from Charlottetown, P.E.I., to St. John's, Nfld. Each policy contained the following clauses:\u2014\n\"All losses and damages which shall happen to the aforesaid vessel shall be paid within sixty days after proof made and exhibited of such at the office of the association.\n\"No suit or action of any kind for the recovery of any claim upon, under, or by virtue of this policy, shall be sustainable in any court of law or chancery, unless such suit or action shall be commenced within the term of twelve months next after claim for loss or damage shall be deposited at the office of the assurers; and in case any such suit or action shall be commenced against the assurers after the expiration of twelve months next after claim for loss or damage shall be deposited as aforesaid, the lapse of time shall be taken and deemed as conclusive evidence against the validity of the claim thereby so attempted to be enforced.\"\nThe policy on hull contains this clause: \"Warranted to sail not later than 3rd December, 1882.\"\nThat on freight the following clause: \"Warranted to sail from Charlottetown not later than 3rd December, 1882.\"\nThe vessel sailed from Peake's Wharf, Charlottetown, on the 3rd December, 1882. After proceeding two and and a half or three miles she came to anchor at Three Tides, \"half way down the harbor, inside of the headlands\" of the harbor of Charlottetown, and inside the lighthouse at the mouth of the harbor. She remained there until December 4 when she proceeded on her voyage. The vessel on the 9th inst., went on shore at Langlade, Miquelon.\nA paper signed by the master at the place of the loss represented the date of sailing from Charlottetown as December 4, and on January 22, 1883, the master made an extended protest in which he also gave December 4 as the day of sailing. This protest was, on January 14, 1883, received by defendants as part of the proofs of loss.\nThe defendants refused to pay the insurance on the ground that the proofs of loss showed a breach of the condition as to time of sailing. In October, 1883, a declaration made by the master of the vessel, stating that the true date of sailing was December 3 and explaining how it was wrongly stated in the protest, was delivered to the defendants, and in February, 1884, a statement by the supercargo of the vessel confirming that of the master was also delivered.\nThe case was tried before a judge without a jury and the following facts were found among others:\u2014\nThat the vessel sailed on the 3rd December, 1882, being then ready for sea, and that the master left the wharf with the bon\u00e2 fide intention of commencing the voyage and proceeding to sea that day.\nThat the vessel was so much injured by the perils insured against that she could not be floated without repairs, and that she could not be repaired at Langlade or any where in its vicinity at that season of the year, or taken to a place of repair.\nThat this action was commenced on the 5th April, 1884, as proved by the copy of pleadings filed by the plaintiffs to be used on the trial.\nOn this last finding judgment was given for the defendants, the judge holding that the twelve months limited for the bringing of the action ran from the date of delivery of the protest to the defendants, January 22, 1883, and not, as claimed by the plaintiffs, from the filing of the amended proofs. This judgment was sustained by the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia the judges of the court being equally divided in their opinions. The plaintiffs then appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada. Henry Q.C. for the appellants cited Kimball v. Hamilton Fire Ins. Co.[2]; Chandler v. St. Paul Ins. Co.[3]; Mayor v. Hamilton Fire Ins. Co.[4]; Campbell v. Charter Oak Ins. Co.[5].\nGraham Q.C. for the respondent referred to Parsons on Marine Insurance[6]; Cossman v. West[7]; Arnould on Marine Insurance[8].\nSir W. J. RITCHIE C.J.\u2014I think there was a strict compliance with the warranty in the policy on the hull not to sail later than the third of December, 1882, because I am of opinion that the ship broke ground for her sea voyage, and got fairly under sail for her place of destination on the day limited in the warranty and that there was a bon\u00e2 fide commencement of the voyage insured on the given day, and that she was undoubtedly detained and delayed in pursuing her voyage by stress of weather and as there was a beginning to sail on the voyage insured on the day named in the warranty the warranty was complied with.\nI am equally clear the warranty that she should sail from Charlottetown not later than the 3rd of December, 1882, was not complied with because it is clear that she did not leave, but was in, the port of Charlottetown until the 4th of December; therefore, the warranty was not complied with and the learned judge should have found on the 17th plea to the third count on the policy on freight, that the said vessel did sail from the port of Charlottetown later than the 3rd of December, to wit, on the 4th of December, 1882.\nIn Arnould on Marine Insurance the law is thus stated[9].\nWe now proceed to notice those cases which have been decided on warranties \"to depart\" and \"to sail from.\" Moir v. Royal Exch. Ass. Co.[10].\nUnder a policy \"lost or not lost, at and from Memel from her port of discharge in England, warranted to depart on or before the 15th of September.\" The \"Neptunus\" having completed her loading, and clearing at the Custom House of Memel on the 9th September, in a state of perfect readiness for her voyage hove up her anchor, and dropped down the river, with the intention of at once proceeding to sea; a change of wind, however, obliged her to lie to at a place in the river, still within the limits of the port of Memel, till the 21st, when she finally got to sea. Lord Ellenborough, at the trial, held that a warranty, \"to depart on or before the 15th of September, must mean that she should be out of the port of Memel and at sea by the given day, but she was still in that port on that day, and, therefore, the warranty was not complied with.\" The Court of King's Bench supported this ruling[11]; and in another action on the same policy in the Court of Common Pleas, the unanimous judgment of the court was given in the same way[12].\nA warranty \"to sail from\" receives precisely the same meaning as the warranty \"to depart \"; this was admitted in the following case, (citing Lang v. Anderdon[13]) the only question being as to what in mercantile usage were the limits of the port of departure, with references to ships of the burden of the ship insured.\nBut it is not necessary to pursue this discussion further because the next objection, which applies alike to both policies, must, in my opinion, prevail, viz., was the action brought within the time limited under the clause in the policy which provides that:\u2014\nNo suit or action of any kind for the recovery of any claim upon, under or by virtue of this policy shall be sustainable in any court of law or chancery, unless such suit or action shall be commenced within the term of twelve months next after claim for loss or damage shall be deposited at the office of the assurers; and in case any such suit or action shall be commenced against the assurers after the expiration of 12 months next after claim for loss or damage shall be deposited as aforesaid, the lapse of time shall be taken and deemed as conclusive evidence against the validity of the claim thereby so attempted to be enforced.\nThe claim of loss and a protest in proof thereof made on the 22nd of January, 1883, at Buctouche was furnished to and deposited at the office of the assurers on the 24th of January, 1883. The claim is as follows:\u2014\nBuctouche, December 19, 1882.\nMr. G. A. Mackenzie:\u2014\nWe beg to inform your company of the loss of our vessel or schooner called the \"Marion Robertson,\" at Miquelon, which happened on the 9th inst. We hold policy upon the said vessel and freight to the extent of two thousand dollars\u2014fifteen hundred dollars upon the vessel, and five hundred dollars upon the freight, &c., which policies were effected through the agency of your company at Charlottetown, P. E. Island. You will please give the matter your earliest attention, and oblige yours,\nG. & J. ROBERTSON.\nIn this protest there is the statement that the said vessel \"did, on the 4th day of December last past, sail from her last mentioned place of loading (viz., Charlottetown,) bound directly for the port of St. John's. This plaintiffs insist was an accidental error, which they subsequently corrected by papers furnished to defendants in October, 1883, and confirmed by McMillan's statement sworn on the 1st of February, 1884, and they seek to make the date of the alleged correction the time from which the twelve months is to commence to run. But the fact appears to have been entirely overlooked that the vessel actually sailed from Charlottetown on the fourth, for though she did leave the wharf and did sail on her voyage on the third, she was after such sailing, by reason of stress of weather, detained in the said port of Charlottetown and did not sail therefrom until the fourth.\nUnless this provision of the contract is to be entirely ignored, which it cannot be on any principle of the law of contracts of insurance, I cannot escape the conclusion (I wish I could) that the learned judge was quite right in finding that the claim for loss or damage under the policies sued on was deposited by the plaintiffs at the office of the insurers before February, 1883, from which time the limitation commenced to run; and as the action was not commenced until the 5th of April, 1884, and so not brought within the time limited therefor by the policies, the judgment must be for the defendants.\nSTRONG J.\u2014This action is brought upon two separate policies of insurance, one on the hull of the schooner \"Marion Robertson,\" the other on the freight to be carried by the same vessel on a voyage from Charlottetown, P. E. Island, to St. John's, Newfoundland. The policies were both dated the 24th of November, 1882, and each contained a limitation clause in the following words:\u2014\nNo suit or action of any kind for the recovery of any claim upon, under, or by virtue of this policy, shall be sustainable in any court of law or chancery, unless such suit or action shall be commenced within the term of twelve months next after claim for loss or damage shall be deposited at the office of the assurers; and in case any such suit or action shall be commenced against the assurers after the expiration of twelve months next after claim for loss or damage shall be deposited as aforesaid, the lapse of time shall be taken and deemed as conclusive evidence against the validity of the claim thereby so attempted to be enforced.\nThe policy on the vessel contains also the following warranty: \"Warranted to sail not later than 3rd of \"December, 1882,\" and that on freight contained the clause, \"warranted to sail from Charlottetown not \"later than 3rd of December, 1882.\"\nThe vessel sailed from Peake's wharf at Charlottetown on the 3rd of December, 1882, but owing to a snow storm and bad weather did not go to sea, but came to anchor at a place within the harbor called \"Three Tides,\" from which she again sailed on the 4th of December, 1882, and was subsequently lost on the 9th of December, 1882, at Langlade, Miquelon, where she was surveyed and sold by the master.\nThe master afterwards went before a notary public at Buctouche, N.B., who on the 22nd of January, 1883, drew up a formal protest of the loss. This protest was lodged with the secretary of the underwriters on the 24th of January, 1883.\nThe action was not brought until the 5th of April, 1884. As regards the policy on freight it is clear that the appellants are precluded from recovering by reason of the admitted fact that the vessel did not sail from the port of Charlottetown until after the 3rd of December, 1882, that is to say, not until the 4th of December. The passage quoted from Arnould on Insurance[14] by the respondents in their factum, and the authorities there referred to, are conclusive on this point. Sailing on the voyage is not a compliance with a warranty to sail from a particular port before a named date, if the vessel does not actually leave the port or harbor before the day indicated. The proposition that a sailing from one point within a port to another within the same port, though it may be a bon\u00e2 fide sailing on the voyage, is not equivalent to a sailing from the port has long been so well established that it cannot now be called in question.\nAs regards the warranty in the policy on the vessel which only required that she should sail on the voyage not later than the third December, there was a sufficient compliance with its terms, inasmuch as it is not disputed that the vessel, in good faith, left her moorings at Peak's wharf, Charlottetown harbour, and proceeded on her voyage on that day, but was detained by bad weather from leaving the bounds of the port until the next day[15].\nThen the underwriters (the present respondents) rely on the limitation clause as an answer to the action as respects both policies, and if we are to consider the lodging of the protest with the underwriters, on the 24th January, 1883, as a depositing of the claim for loss within the meaning of those words as used in the clause under consideration, it is clear that this action instituted on the 5th April, 1884, was too late. The appellants contend, however, first, that the protest was not a claim for loss within the meaning of the limitation clause, and second, that though it might have been so considered if it had been accurate, yet, inasmuch as it contained an inaccurate statement of the date of sailing it was not to be considered a complete claim. The answer to this is, however, very plain. The \"claim for loss or damage\" is manifestly the same thing as the \"proof\" referred to in the preceding clause, which provides that \"all losses and damages\" shall be paid within sixty days after \"proof,\" made and exhibited at the office of the association.\nThen the protest was intended and drawn up as a formal record of the loss and the facts attending it, and is to be considered as having been lodged with the secretary as a compliance with the limitation clause, and also as showing a title to be paid the indemnity. The case of Cossman v. West[16], in the Privy Council, shows that this is to be considered proof of the loss.\nFurther, there was no mistake or inaccuracy either in the protest or in the master's declaration before the French authorities at Langlade. Both these documents were strictly accurate in stating that the schooner sailed from Charlottetown on the 4th December, but even if it were otherwise, and she had in fact sailed from that port on the 3rd (the day on which she actually commenced her voyage, though she did not leave the harbor until the next day), that would not have disentitled the plaintiff to show the real fact at the trial. So that even if the protest had been inaccurate, it would nevertheless have been a \"claim and proof of loss\" within the terms of the policy. It follows that the 24th of January, 1883, the date on which it was deposited with the secretary of the association must be considered as the date from which the period of one year prescribed by the limitation clause began to ran. The action was not brought within a year from this date, and therefore the court below were right in holding the plaintiff debarred from recovering. The appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nFOURNIER J.\u2014I concur in the judgment delivered by the Chief Justice.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014I am of opinion that this appeal should be dismissed for the reasons given by Ritchie J. in the court below that the action was too late.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014Concurred.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellants: Henry, Ritchie & Weston.\nSolicitors for respondents: Graham, Tupper, Borden & Parker.\n[1] 20 N.

J. Ritchie C.J., and Strong, Fournier, Taschereau and Gwynne JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF QUEEN'S BENCH FOR LOWER CANADA (APPEAL SIDE).\nAttorneys lien for costs Opposition en sous ordre\u2014Moneys deposited in hanss of prothonotary\u2014C. C. P. Art. 753.\nHeld, per Ritchie C.J., Strong and Taschereau JJ., affirming the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench, Montreal, that where moneys have been voluntarily deposited by a garnishee in the hands of the prothonotary, and the attachment of such moneys is subsequently quashed by a final judgment of the court, there being then no longer any moneys subject to a distribution or collocation, such moneys cannot be claimed by an opposition en saus ordre.\nFournier and Gwynne JJ. dissenting, on the ground that as the moneys were still subject to the control of the court at the time the opposition en sous ordre was filed, such opposition was not too late.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada (appeal side) ([1]), affirming two judgments of the Superior Court ([2]), which dismissed an opposition en sous ordre of the appellant fyled in the original case of J. T. Carter y. Alexander Molson.\nOn the 11th September 1885, the respondent, without giving notice to the appellant, who had been his attorney in the case of Carter v. Molson and Freeman, tiers-saisi, applied through new attorneys to the Superior Court for an order upon the prothonotary to pay him the moneys deposited in court by Freeman, and a judgment was rendered accordingly, the prothonotary, however, being directed by the judgment to retain the court house tax and the poundage.\nBy an opposition, dated 22nd September 1885, the appellant alleged that in cause No. 1135 S. C., Carter v. Molson and Freeman, tiers-saisi, the said tiers-saisi deposited certain moneys in court, and that the moneys in question were the proceeds of a legacy made by the late Hon. John Molson in favor of the defendant, his wife and children, and were declared by a Judgment of the Privy Council alimentary and insaisissable. He also alleged the insolvency of the defendant and claimed $3,932.17, by special privilege en sous ordre, for professional services incurred in the \"proceedings for the protection of the legacy. The opposition was supported by an affidavit stating that all the facts alleged in the opposition were true.\nThe respondent began by moving that the opposition should be dismissed as irregular and illegal, but the motion was dismissed.\nThe respondent, on 26th October, demurred to the opposition on the following grounds :\u2014\n1. Because the opposition en sous ordre is on its face a proceeding by way of execution, and there is nothing to show that opposite\u2019s claim carries execution.\n2. Because the moneys are declared in the opposition to be exempt from seizure\n3. Because the opposition though styled an opposition en sous ordre, is on its face not such an opposition, but an attempt to attach moneys of a defendant in the hands of third parties, before judgment, without issuing a writ of attachment, and without compliance with the requirements of law necessary to entitle opposant to such a writ.\n4. Because the affidavit forming part of the opposition is illegal and insufficient 5. Because the moneys attached are in the hands of the prothonotary merely as a conservatory process between the parties in the original suit and. are not moneys levied subject to an opposition as made.\nOpposant answered generally.\nThere was also a motion presented on behalf of the respondent in the Superior Court for an order to the prothonotary of said court, notwithstanding the said opposition to pay to respondent contesting the sum of $9,572.65, with costs, being the balance between the amount in his hand ($13,504.10) after deduction of the amount claimed by opposant:\u2014\n1st. By the judgment Mr. Justice Mathieu (20th January, 1886), maintained the demurrer to the opposition en sous ordre filed by the appellant:\n2nd. By the judgment (rendered at the same time) the motion of respondent was granted.\nThe Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada (appeal side) affirmed the judgments of Mr. Justice Mathieu, but resting the decision on the ground that after the 11th of September, 1885, there was no longer any case pending wherein an opposition en sous ordre could be fyled, and that in consequence the appellant could only proceed by saisie-arret before judgment, accompanied by an affidavit of secretion.\nOn appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nLatcoste Q.C. and Beique for appellant contended;\u2014\n1st. That appellant has, under the French law, a privilege for his costs of the nature of a solicitor's lien under the English law, which necessarily involves the right to stop the moneys without an affidavit;\n2nd. That even if he had no solicitor's privilege or lien, the respondents insolvency alone, under article 753 C.C.P., gave him the right, by means of an opposition en sous ordre, to stop the moneys without an affidavit, and referred to Arts. 602, 603, 604, 612, 616, 622, 629 and 630 C.C. P. Martin v. Labelle ([3]); Doutre V. Leblanc es-qual ([4]);\n3rd. That his opposition en sous ordre was equally regular whether it came after or before the judgment of the 11th September, 1885, so long as the moneys were still in the hands of the prothonotary.\nCiting Jousse Ordonnance 1667 ([5]); Ferri\u00e8re Grand Coutumier ([6]); McDonnell v. Buntin ([7]); Motteur & Marchand v. The Atty. Gen. ([8]); Pigeau ([9]).\nLaflamme Q.C. and Robertson Q.C., for respondent, contended :\nThat Art. 753 C. C. P. governed oppositions en sous ordre. At the time of the present opposition there were no moneys which could be distributed, and as the respondents had not been collocated therein under Art. 724 c. c. P., the appellant could not claim by a sub-opposition. Moreover, the moneys which were in the hands of the prothonotary at the time of the opposition were not moneys levied.\nThe deposit in the hands of the prothonotary was a mere substitution of one garnishee under the control of the court for another. The final judgment, as alleged, having declared the money to be the property of defendant, respondent, he immediately became entitled to withdraw it, and any creditor wishing to attach it before obtaining a judgment must do so in the usual way by a saisie-arr\u00eat, supported by a legal affidavit, and third parties can have no greater rights to interfere with respondent's enjoyment and possession of his property, because it has been placed temporarily in the hands of the prothonotary, than they could have were it in the respondent' s personal possession. The attachment, in fact, by the effects of the judgment set up in the opposition, became of no effect, and was declared null. There is no pretence that respondent was collocated for any sum. The money in question was his from the beginning, and held by the prothonotary only to abide a judgment on a claim made on it but subsequently declared to be unfounded.\nIt is also necessary to make a claim by means of a sub-opposition, as laid down in Art. 753, that the debtor be insolvent, or the creditor's claim must carry execution. There is no pretence that the latter is the case; but there is an allegation of insolvency. Respondent submits, however, that the insolvency contemplated by the article is such insolvency as would be sufficient for a writ of seizure before judgment. A sub-opposition is really of the nature of a saisie-arr\u00eat before judgment, and therefore should be accompanied with an affidavit, as required by Art. 834 and 855 C. C. P. This was the view taken in Sterling v. Darling & Fowler. ([10]) by three judges of the Superior Court, and which has never been over-ruled.\nThe fact is, that the appellant, considering that he has a claim against respondent, is desirous of attaching his debtor's property before obtaining a judgment against him. This the law gives him a right to do, but only in certain cases, viz. :\u2014those specified in Arts. 834 and 855 of the Code of Civil Procedure To avail himself of this remedy he must bring his case within the provisions of the law and also comply with the formalities the law requires. He must allege not insolvency only, but fraud. If appellant found the respondent attempting to defraud him out of a just debt he might easily have attached the money by a writ in the usual way; but evidently knowing that he could not take the affidavit necessary for an attachment before judgment, he styles his opposition an opposition en sous ordre, and endeavors to evade the law and accomplish his object in an indirect way. Secondly,\u2014As to the appeal from the judgment ordering the payment to defendant of balance after holding $3,932.17 to secure appellant's claim. If the judgment on the demurrer is maintained, the judgment on the motion will be maintained at the same time; but even should the demurrer be overruled, respondent submits that it is contrary to all law and equity that opposant's pretension with regard to this balance should be upheld. On his own showing' opposant claims $3,932.17. He asks, in addition to this, a further sum of $9,572.65 to be held,\u2014for what purpose, unless it be to harass the respondent by keeping him out of his money, it is hard to tell. He can have no interest save as security for costs in case he succeeds, and respondent being a resident in Lower Canada and a defendant it is difficult to see on what grounds such security can be demanded; and the amount the opposant attempts to hold as security is $9,572.65. The proposition carries its own condemnation.\nSIR W. J. RITCHIE C.J.\u2014I think the appeal must be dismissed, agreeing, as I do, with the reasons which Mr. Justice Taschereau will state\nSTRONG J.\u2014was also of opinion that the appeal should be dismissed.\nFOURNIER J.\u2014Le pr\u00e9sent appel est d'un jugement de la cour du Banc de la Reine, en date du 17 septembre dernier, confirmant pour d'autres raisons un jugement de la cour Sup\u00e9rieure du district de Montr\u00e9al renvoyant une opposition en sous-ordre, produite par l'appelante dans une cause entre John T. carter v. Alexander Molson, et Freeman, tiers-saisi. L'instance entre ces derniers avait \u00e9t\u00e9 commenc\u00e9e par un bref de saisie-arr\u00eat entre les mains de Freeman en ex\u00e9cution du jugement obtenu par Carter contre Molson. La contestation fut soulev\u00e9e sur le caract\u00e8re d'insaisissabilit\u00e9 des deniers saisis, entre les mains de Freeman, d\u00e9pos\u00e9s plus tard en cour.\nCe proc\u00e9s qui a dur\u00e9 plusieurs ann\u00e9es et a \u00e9t\u00e9 m\u00eame port\u00e9 deux fois en appel au Conseil Priv\u00e9, avait pour but de faire d\u00e9clarer saisissables certains biens de Molson et d'en amener le produit devant la cour pour en faire la distribution entre ses cr\u00e9anciers.\nL'appelant Bernard, dans tout le cours de cette longue contestation et de ses nombreux incidents, a repr\u00e9sente comme avocat et procureur non seulement les int\u00e9r\u00eats de Molson, mais aussi ceux de sa femme et de ses enfants int\u00e9ress\u00e9s comme lui \u00e0 faire d\u00e9clarer que lee biens qui lui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 l\u00e9gu\u00e9s par l'honorable John Molson, son p\u00e8re, avec clause d\u2019aliment et d'insaisissabilit\u00e9 ne pouvaient pas \u00eatre saisis et ex\u00e9cut\u00e9s pour ses dettes. Les frais qu'il a aiusi encourus se montaient \u00e0 la somme de $3,932.67. Le tiers-saisi Freeman ayant d\u00e9pos\u00e9 ' entre les mains du Protonotaire de la cour Sup\u00e9rieure, district de Montr\u00e9al, une forte somme d'argent provenant des revenus des biens de Molson, l'appelant a produit une opposition en sous-ordre sur ces deniers, pour \u00eatre pay\u00e9 du montant de ses frais. Lorsque cette Opposition a \u00e9t\u00e9 produite, le 22 septembre 1885 le protonotaire avait d\u00e9j\u00e0, le 11 du m\u00eame mois, sur la demande de l'intim\u00e9, et sans avis \u00e0 l\u2019appelant, ordonn\u00e9 de remettre \u00e0 Molson les argents d\u00e9pos\u00e9s en cour par Freeman, sous la d\u00e9duction des taxes judiciaires. Cependant, les deniers \u00e9taient encore entre les mains du protonotaire lorsque l'opposition fut re\u00e7ue. Le paiement s' est en cons\u00e9quence trouv\u00e9 arr\u00eat\u00e9.\nUne premi\u00e8re motion de l'intim\u00e9 demandant le renvoi de cette opposition a \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9e. II a ensuite invoqu\u00e9 les m\u00eames moyens par des plaidoyers au m\u00e9rite et en droit. Ces moyens sont : 10. Que l'appelant ne peut saisir les argents sans faire un affidavit que l'intim\u00e9 cache ses effets ou se soustrait \u00e0 lection de ses cr\u00e9anciers. 2o. Que les argents d\u00e9pos\u00e9s en cour n'ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9lev\u00e9s en vertu d'une ex\u00e9cution et ne peuvent \u00eatre arr\u00eat\u00e9s par une opposition en sous-ordre. 3o. Que ces deniers \u00e9tant exempts de saisie, l'insolvabilit\u00e9 de l'intim\u00e9 n'est pas un motif suffisant pour les arr\u00eater par opposition en sous-ordre. Ii fit aussi une autre motion pour que l'exc\u00e9dant du montant de la cr\u00e9ance de l'appelant lui fut remis en attendant la fin de la contestation. La cour Sup\u00e9rieure a renvoy\u00e9 l'opposition pour les deux premi\u00e9res raisons, et accord\u00e9 la motion pour paiement d'une partie des deniers d\u00e9pos\u00e9s.\nSur appel, la cour du Banc de la Reine a confirm\u00e9 le jugement sur le principe qu'apr\u00e8s le 11 septembre 1885, it n'y avait pas alors de cause pendante dans laquelle une opposition en sous-ordre p\u00eat \u00eatre produite, et que l'appelant ne pouvait alors proc\u00e9der que par\" voie de saisie-arr\u00eat avant jugement, en produisant l'affidavit ordinaire. Toutefois la cour intima qu'il en e\u00fbt \u00e9t\u00e9 autrement si l'opposition e\u00eat \u00e9t\u00e9 produite avant l'ordre du 11 septembre 1885. La raison qu'il ne pouvait pas \u00eatre produit d'opposition, parce que l'instance avait \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9teinte par le jugement du 11 septembre, n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 invoqu\u00e9e par li intim\u00e9 dans sa d\u00e9fense ni mentionn\u00e9e dans le jugement de la cour Sup\u00e9rieure. C'est un nouveau moyen soulev\u00e9 par la cour du Banc de la Reine elle-m\u00eame.\nL'appelant demande l'infirmation du jugement en s'appuyant sur les trois propositions suivaltes : 1o. Qu'il a en vertu de la loi de la province de Qu\u00e9bec in privil\u00e8ge sur les deniers en question pour les frais de justice qu'il a encourus pour leur conservation dans l'int\u00e9r\u00eat des parties int\u00e9ress\u00e9es; 2o. Qu'ind\u00e9pendamment de ce privil\u00e8ge, son d\u00e9biteur Molson \u00e9tau insolvable, l\u2019appelant a droit en vertu de l'art. 753, C.P. d'arr\u00eater ces deniers par une opposition en sous-ordre et sans affidavit; 30. Que son opposition en sous-ordre ait \u00e9t\u00e9 produite avant ou apr\u00e8s le 11 septembre, elle l'a \u00e9t\u00e9 toutefois en temps utile puisque les deniers \u00e9taient encore entre les mains du protonotaire.\nLa premi\u00e8re de ces trois propositions relative au privil\u00e8ge de l'appelant pour les frais de justice qu'il a encourus pour la conservation des deniers dans l'int\u00e9r\u00eat des parties int\u00e9ress\u00e9s, ne semble pas avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 s\u00e9rieusement contest\u00e9e. Elle avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 amplement d\u00e9battue et plusieurs fois d\u00e9cid\u00e9e par les cours. qui, apr\u00e8s quelques diff\u00e9rences d'opinions ont fini par s'accorder sur la maniere de donner effet \u00e0 un privil\u00e8ge qui ne peut certainement plus \u00e9tre contest\u00e9 en face de l'article 2007 C. C. Ii suffit maintenant de r\u00e9f\u00e9rer aux principales d\u00e9cisions sur ce point. Au 29 vol. de L. C. Jurist. ([11]), on trouve la cause de Normandin v. Normandin, o\u00f9 cette question a \u00e9t\u00e9 savamment discut\u00e9e par feu l'honorable juge Loranger en s'appuyant sur les principales autorit\u00e9s de notre droit. Le m\u00eame principe a \u00e9t\u00e9 soutenu dans la cause de Wisson v. Leblanc et Doutre et al, cr\u00e9anciers colloqu\u00e9s et Leblanc \u00e9squalit\u00e9 ([12]). Dans cette derni\u00e8re cause comme dans la pr\u00e9sente, l'avocat repr\u00e9sentant le propri\u00e9taire d'un bien qu'il avait fait declarer alimentaire et insaisissable, se voyait contester son droit aux frais sur ces m\u00eames biens qu'il avait conserv\u00e9s \u00e0 son client, mais la cour d\u00e9cida que l'avocat avait acquis contre son client une cr\u00e9ance alimentaire pour la r\u00e9p\u00e9tition de ses d\u00e9bours\u00e9s et honoaaires conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l'article 558 C. P. C.\nL'appelant dont presque tons les frais ont \u00e9t\u00e9 encourus pour soutenir dans l'int\u00e9r\u00eat de l\u2019intim\u00e9 le caract\u00e8re de biens alimentaires et insaisissables aux biens qui lui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 l\u00e9gu\u00e9s, veut maintenant se pr\u00e9valoir \u00e0 l'encontre de son avocat du caract\u00e8re particulier de ces biens pour refuser de le payer. La loi s'oppose \u00e0 ce qu'il commette un acte aussi injuste que le serait celui-l\u00e0. Par ses proc\u00e9d\u00e9s pour la conservation des biens l\u00e9gu\u00e9s, l'avocat a acquis contre ces m\u00eames biens une cr\u00e9ance alimentaire pour assurer le paiement de ses frais el honoraires. Le jugement cit\u00e9 plus haut la d\u00e9cid\u00e9e formellement en conformit\u00e9 de l'art, 558 C. P. C., qui a consacr\u00e9 un principe depuis longtemps reconnu dans le droit fran\u00e7ais.\nJe crois qu'il serait inutile d'insister davantage sur l'existence du privil\u00e9ge pour les frais de justice. Dans le cas dont ii s'agit ii ne peut \u00eatre contest\u00e9.\nL'instance entre carter v. Molsor \u00e9tait sans doute termin\u00e9e. Barnard n'avait rien \u00e0 y voir et n'\u00e9met aucune pr\u00e9tention d'y prendre part. Mais la cour ayant encore sous son contr\u00f4le, comme Molson le reconnalt les deniers soumis \u00e0 son privil\u00e8ge l'appelant ne se pr\u00e9sentait-il pas en temps utile pour le faire valoir. Il lui \u00e9tait indiff\u00e9rent qu'il exist\u00e0t une instance entre Carter et Molson, ce qui importait \u00e0 lappelant c'\u00e9tait de pouvoir en soulever une eitre Molson et lui. Puisque son privilege n'est pas contest\u00e9, que peut lui faire le jugement du 11 septembre 1885, ordonnant de remettre les deniers d\u00e9pos\u00e9s\u00bb \u00e0 Molson ? Est-ce que ce jugement a Pu an\u00e9antir le privil\u00e8ge de l'appelant on le transformer en aucune mani\u00e8re ? Personne n'a pr\u00e9tendu cela. Les deniers soat toujours rest\u00e9s soumis au privil\u00e8ge qui ne pouvait cesser que par leur remise actuelle entre les mains de Molson. M\u00eame, en passant par les mains d'un tiers pour arriver \u00e0 lui ils restent toujours soumis au privilege.\nCette raison que l'instance \u00e9tait termin\u00e9e aurait sans doute toute sa force s'il s'agissait d'une intervention dans le d\u00e9bat entre Carter et Molson, Mais ce n'est pas le but de l'opposition de l'appelant. Ii trouve des deniers r\u00e9alis\u00e9s et d\u00e9pos\u00e9s en cour en vertu de proc\u00e9d\u00e9s judiciaires, en ex\u00e9cution d'un jugement, sur lesquels ii a un privil\u00e8ge r\u00e9el, et ii demande \u00e0 le faire valoir; c'est une nouvelle instance qu'ii introduit, il n'a \u00e0 d\u00e9battre ses pr\u00e9tentions qu'avec celui qui r\u00e9clame ces deniers. Celles qu'avait avanc\u00e9es Carter out \u00e9t\u00e9 finalement rejet\u00e9es. Ii est maintenant tout-\u00e0-fait sans int\u00e9r\u00eat. Le fait.que l'instance Carter est termin\u00e9e est donc sans importance, et ne peut nullement influer sur la nouvelle instance soulev\u00e9e entre Barnard et Molson.\nAdmettre dans le cas actuel que l'opposition est venue trop tard, ce serait presque dire que les cr\u00e9anciers d'un d\u00e9fendeur dont la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 vendue en justice et le prix d\u00e9pos\u00e9 en cour, ne peuvent pas faire valoir leurs cr\u00e9ances sur ces deniers, parce qu'ils se pr\u00e9sentent apr\u00e8s la contestation principale termin\u00e9e, entre le demandeur et le d\u00e9fendeur. Ii eat \u00e9vident qu'on ne pourratt pas plus leur faire cette objection qu'on ne peut l'opposer \u00e0 l'appelant, car dans l'un et l'aurre cas lea deniers sont apport\u00e9s en cour et pr\u00e9lev\u00e9s en vertu de l'ex\u00e9cution d'un jugement rendu le' 20 Mars 1883 par la cour Sup\u00e9rieure, \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al, et d'un autre; rendu par la m\u00eame cour, le 31 octobre 1884; que c'est en ex\u00e9cution de ces jugements que la saisie-arr\u00eat a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9man\u00e9e entre les mains de Freeman qui a fait en cour le d\u00e9p\u00f4t des deniers saisis. Contrairement \u00e0 la pr\u00e9tention de l'intim\u00e9 que ces deniers n'ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9leves par le sh\u00e9rif, ni par aucun autre autorit\u00e9 judiciaire il est \u00e9vident qu'ils n'ont \u00e9t\u00e9 mis sous le contr\u00f4le de la justice que par la seule voie admise, lorsque lea deniers ou effets du d\u00e9biteur sont en mains tierces\u2014la voie de la saisie-arr\u00eat apr\u00e8s jugement. C'est le mode indiqu\u00e9 par l'art. 612 C. P. C. L'ex\u00e9cution des effets mobiliers du d\u00e9biteur qui sont en possession d'un tiers peut, dans tous les cas, et doit, lorsque ce tiers ne consent pas \u00e0 leur saisie imm\u00e9diate, se faire par la voie de la saisie arr\u00eat. L'art. 613 indique la proc\u00e9dure \u00e0 suivre pourop\u00e9rer cette saisie et l'article 616 en d\u00e9clare les effets l\u00e9gaux, comme suit:\u2014\nL'effet do la saisie est do mettre los effets et cr\u00e9ances dont le tiers-saisi est d\u00e9biteur, sous la main de la justice, et do s\u00e9questrer les objets corporels entre ses mains, do m\u00eame quo s'il en \u00e9 ait nomm\u00e9ment constitu\u00e9 gardien.\nOn voit par ces articles que c'est par saisie en ex\u00e9cution d'un jugement que les deniers se trouvent en cour et qu'ils y sont, sous la main de la justice comme le dit l'art. 616. L'intim\u00e9 l'a lui-m\u00eame reconnu dans sa d\u00e9fense en droit o\u00f9 il s'exprime ainsi :\nBecause the moneys of defendant in the hands of the Superior Court through the Prothonotary without levy by the Sheriff or other judicial officer are not subject to seizure and are under the control of said Court as a conservatory proceeding between the parties in the said suit and which were and are the property of defendant.\nPuisque les deniers mis sous le contr\u00f4le de la cour en vertu d'une ex\u00e9cution v sont encore, le droit de l'appelant de se pr\u00e9senter comme opposant ne peut \u00eatre contest\u00e9, pourvu qu'il soit dans l'une ou l'autre des deux conditions requises par l'art. 753 C. P. C. savoir, que son d\u00e9biteur soit insolvable ou qu'il ait un titre ex\u00e9cutoire contre lui. Ii n'a pas de titre ex\u00e9cutoire mais l'insolvabilit\u00e9 incontestable et notoire de son d\u00e9biteur lui donne le droit de se porter opposant sur les deniers lui appartenant, et qui, malgr\u00e9 l'opinion contraire exprim\u00e9e par l'hon juge Mathieu, sont des deniers pr\u00e9lev\u00e9s en ex\u00e9cution d'un jugement et cons\u00e9quemment soumis \u00e0 la distribution et \u00e0 l'opposition en sous-ordre.\nII est vrai que la saisie qui a amen\u00e9 ces deniers en cour a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9clar\u00e9e nulle, mais pour une raison qui n'affectait nullement la validit\u00e9 de la saisie Elle \u00e9tait r\u00e9guli\u00e8re de tous points. Mais comme elle ne portait que sur des deniers et des effets qui sur une contestation entre Molson et Carter, port\u00e9e jusqu'au Conseil Priv\u00e9, avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9clar\u00e9s insaisissables la saisie en fut d\u00e9clar\u00e9e sans effet. Cette raison d\u2019insaisissabilit\u00e9 affectait Carter qui n'avait pas fait preuve d'une cr\u00e9ance alimentaire lui donnant droit d'\u00eatre pay\u00e9 sur ces deniers, mais elle ne pouvait \u00eatre oppos\u00e9e \u00e0 l'appelant dont la cr\u00e9ance est reconnue par la loi comme ayant le m\u00eame caract\u00e8re que les deniers saisis et se trouvait privil\u00e9gi\u00e9e sur ces m\u00eames deniers. Quoique l\u00e9galement annull\u00e9e par rapport \u00e0 Carter, cette saisie n'en a pas moins valablement amen\u00e9 les deniers saisis devant la cour en vertu d'une ex\u00e9cution, et les parties int\u00e9ress\u00e9es peuvent y faire valoir leurs droits. Ce principe est consacr\u00e9 par l'ordonnance de 1667, voir Jousse ([13]).\nMais lorsque la saisie est d\u00e9clar\u00e9e nulle sur le fondement quo le saisi ne doit rien au saisissant, Bolt parce quo lobligation port\u00e9e par le titre \u00e9tait acquitt\u00e9e ou prescrite, etc., alors cette nullit\u00e9 ainsi prononc\u00e9e n'emp\u00eache pas que los oppositions subsistent pourvu que ls saisie ait \u00e9t\u00e9 faite avec toutes los formalit\u00e9s n\u00e9cessaires.\nCe principe ne saurait recevoir d'application plus juste et plus \u00e9quitable que dans le cas actuel, o\u00f9 les deniers encore sous le contr\u00f4le de la cour sont soumis \u00e0 un privil\u00e8ge reconnu qui serait in\u00e9vitablement frustr\u00e9 s'ils \u00e9taient remis au d\u00e9biteur, puisqu'il est insolvable. D'ailleurs, tant que les deniers ne sont pas actuellement remis a la partie colloqu\u00e9e, et qu\u2019ils sont encore entre les mains de la cour, ils sont toujours sons son contr\u00f4le et le cr\u00e9ancier qui arrive \u00e0 la derni\u00e8re heure n'arrive pas trop tard, s'il arrive avant que les deniers aient \u00e9t\u00e9 pay\u00e9s, ainsi qu'il est \u00e9tabli par l'autorit\u00e9 suivante ([14]):\nLa contribution se peut demander tant que les choses sont enti\u00e8res c'est-\u00e0-dire avant quo le cr\u00e9ancier ait touch\u00e9 los deniers, quoique par sentence ou arr\u00eat il e\u00fbt \u00e9t\u00e9 ordonn\u00e9 qu'il les toucherait, car avant la d\u00e9livrance d'iceux tout autre cr\u00e9ancier est recevable \u00e0 demander la contribution en cas do l'insolvabilit\u00e9 du d\u00e9biteur comme remarque Brodeau, No. 7, in fine, qui dit l'avoir vu juger ainsi par plusieurs arr\u00eats tant du Parlement quo do la cour des Aides et notamment par un du 17 f\u00e9vrier 1622 au rapport de Monsieur Foucault, au profit de Ma\u00eetre Pierre Durier; centre Ma\u00eetre Pierre de la Biothade et dit F avoir \u00e9crit au proces.\nRien dans le code de proc\u00e9dure n'autorise \u00e0 dire que l'opposition a \u00e9t\u00e9 produite trop tard. L'art. 755 semble indiquer que l'opposition en sous-ordre ne sera produite qu'apr\u00e8s le rapport de distribuions lorsque le droit \u00e0 une collocation a \u00e9t\u00e9 constat\u00e9, la distribution en sous-ordre peut \u00eatre faite \u00e0 la suite de l'ordre et dans le m\u00eame rapport ou par un rapport s\u00e9par\u00e9. Dans le code de proc\u00e9dure fran\u00e7ais le sous-ordre n'a lieu qu'apr\u00e8s la collocation. Ii est d\u00e9fini par Bioche ([15]), la r\u00e9partition d'une somme colloqu\u00e9e dans un ordre. Le m\u00eame auteur au 580, dit :\nDe nouveaux opposants pouvant se pr\u00e9senter jusqu'\u00e0 la cl\u00f4ture, le sous ordre no doit se faire qu'apr\u00e8s cette \u00e9poque. Au No. 586. Apr\u00e8s la cl\u00f4ture do l'ordre, il est proc\u00e9d\u00e9 au sous-ordre dans la forme prescrite pour la distribution par contribution.\nJe crois avec l'hon. Sir A. A. Dorion que l'ordre du 11 septembre, peut dans les circonstances \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme un rapport de distribution ou du moins comme l'\u00e9quivalent. En effet, les derniers avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9s en cour en cons\u00e9quence de l'ex\u00e9cution d'un jugement par voie forc\u00e9e, et \u00e9taient sujets \u00e0 la distribution si les cr\u00e9anciers s'\u00e9taient pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s Ce n'est qu'en cons\u00e9quence de leur absence due sous doute \u00e0 leur connaissance du caract\u00e8re d\u2019insaisissabilit\u00e9 de ces deniers, que Molson s'est trouv\u00e9 seul et qu'un ordre de lui remettre les deniers a \u00e9t\u00e9 prononc\u00e9. Mais ce fait ne change pas le caract\u00e8re de l'ordre rendu. Les deniers dans ce cas pas plus que dans celui d'un rapport de distribution, n \u00e9taient payables qu\u2019a l\u2019expiration de quinze jours en vertu de l'art. 757 0. P. C et se trouvaient encore sous le contr\u00f4le de la Cour comme l'admet Molson dans sa d\u00e9fense. Ii y a cependant une diff\u00e9rence essentielle entre cet ordre et une collocation dans un rapport de distribution. Par la cl\u00f4ture de l'ordre ii s'op\u00e8re au profit du cr\u00e9ancier un transport des deniers pour lesquels ii est colloqu\u00e9, il en devient propri\u00e9taire; l\u2019ordre dont il s'agit n'a pu avoir un semblable effet \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de Molson qui en \u00e9tait le propri\u00e9taire avant et en est rest\u00e9 le propri\u00e9taire apr\u00e8s. L'ordre n'a produit aucun transport des deniers qui \u00e9taient toujours sa propri\u00e9t\u00e9 quoique sous le contr\u00f4le de la justice. Son seul effet l\u00e9gal se bornait \u00e0 autoriser le d\u00e9positaire \u00e0 se dessaisir apr\u00e8s le d\u00e9lai de quinze jours des deniers alors sous le contr\u00f4le de la justice. L'appelant trouvant encore les deniers entre les mains de cet officier, a pu, vu l\u2019insolvabilit\u00e9 de Molson, faire son opposition de m\u00eame qu'il aurait pu le faire entre les mains d'un syndic \u00e0 la faillite de Molson.\nJ'aurais \u00e9t\u00e9 d'opinion de confirmer le jugement de la cour Sup\u00e9rieure sur la motion pour paiement d'une partie des deniers d\u00e9pos\u00e9s, mais la majorit\u00e9 de la cour \u00e9tant d'avis de renvoyer l'appel en entier, cette opinion ne peut plus avoir d'effet.\nPar tous ces motifs je suis d'opinion que l'appel devrait \u00eatre accord\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens.\nTASOHEREAU J.\u2014This appears to be a very simple case.\nOne Carter, having obtained a judgment against Molson, the present respondent, issued a saisie-arr\u00eat in the hands of one Freeman. Freeman declared to have in his hands as belonging to Molson a sum of $13, 712.50, which sum he, afterwards, was allowed by consent to deposit into court to abide the final judgment. Molson fyled a contestation of this saisie\" arr\u00eat, and by a judgment of the Court of Appeal ([16]) confirmed in the Privy Council ([17]) obtained the quashing of the seizure and main-lev\u00e9e thereof\nSubsequently before the said monies were paid over to Molson Barnard the present appellant, fyled, as a creditor of Molson, an opposition en sous ordre, claiming to be paid on these monies the sum of $3,932 by privilege.\nTo this opposition Molson demurred, and by a judgment of the Superior Court his demurrer was allowed and the opposition was dismissed. The Court of Appeal confirmed this judgment, and Barnard now appeals to this court. I am of opinion that the appeal should be dismissed. The conclusions reached in the court below are clearly right. When a saisie-arr\u00eat has been quashed by a final judgment, the garnishee's hands are freed instanter, and he becomes liable towards his original creditor as he was before the seizure. A saisie-arr\u00eat is a provisional order, and conservatory process, attaching monies or movables in the garnishees hands till otherwise ordered by the court, till the final judgment on the attachment. This garnishee is a mere sequestrate. Arts 612 613 616 C. C. P. ([18]) If the attachment is declared valid he then pays over to the seizing party, or if he has declared to have in his possession movables belonging to the defendant they are sold en justice Arts 629 630 COP. If the attachment is quashed he has to pay his original creditor, or hand him over whatever movables belonging to him he has in his hands. There is then no distribution de deniers no collocation, and it is clear that it is only in the case of such a distribution de deniers and collocation that an opposition en sous ordre lies. Art. 753 C.O.P.\nLe cr\u00e9ancier qui voudrait avoir part \u00e0 une somme frapp\u00e9e de saisie-arr\u00eat par un autre, (says Roger, Sa -ar., page 23,) ne pourrait atteindre ce but en se bornant \u00e0 intervener dans l'instance en validit\u00e9 do cette saisie Il devrait lui-m\u00eame former une saisie-arr\u00eat en suivant la memo marche quo le premier saisissant It is evident here that what this appellant under this guise of an opposition en sous ordre has attempted was to seize before judgment these oonies belonging to Molson, without the affidavit and formalities required for that proceeding.\nMais aussi m\u00eame cette opposition est subordonn\u00e9e \u00e2 la \"validit\u00e9 de la saisie-arr\u00eat says (Roger, Sa.-ar., page 24,) si celle-ci n'est pas d\u00e9clar\u00e9e valable, les oppositions au prix de la vente resteront sans effets S'ils les opposants) craignent quo la saisie\u2014ex\u00e9cution no soit d\u00e9clar\u00e9e nulle, la prudence exige qu'ils pratiquent sur los objets saisis une saisie-arr\u00eat suivie d'une demande en validit\u00e9 dans toutes los formes voulues \"pour les modes d'ex\u00e9cution de ce nom.\nIn the same sense, an arr\u00e9t of 30th August, 1811, Dalloz ([19]) declares that:\nAttendu quo les saisies-arr\u00eats no peuvent avoir de suites et d'effets qu'apr\u00e8s avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 jug\u00e9es valables: contre les parties saisies.\nJousse, Ordonn, 1667 ([20]) has been cited by the appellant, but a reference to it will show that the passage referred to herein is probably not at all applicable to our system for procedure on the matter, has reference to a jieri facias and not to a saisie-arr\u00e9t I refer on the same question tO Bioche ([21]).\nLorsque la saisie-arr\u00eat a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9clar\u00e9e valable, (says this author under No. 251.) et que les deniers arr\u00eat\u00e9s sur los prix des effets no suffisent pas pour d\u00e9sint\u00e9resser los cr\u00e9anciers ii v a lieu \u00e0 distribution par contribution Only where the attachment has been declared valid\nSame author ([22]) Ordr\u00e9 entre cr\u00e9anciers ([23]) Nota sigle case has been cited by the appellant to support the proposition that when a saisie-arr\u00eatt has been quashed there can be had a distribution de deniers or an opposition en sous ordre, for any creditor, privileged or not. A reference to many of these authorities he has cited leaves me under the impression that he may have been misled by the confusion of the two words saisie-arr\u00eat and opposition, which in many books, specially under the old system are used as meaning the same proceedings.\nBioche Vo. Sa.-Ar. No. 1. This author himself entitles his article on the subject : Saisie-arret on opposition.\nAs to the motion ordering the payment to the respondent of $9,572.72, not only must the appeal be dismissed, but as the case now stands it seems to me that the respondent is entitled to the whole of the monies deposited, in accordance with the judgment of the 11th September, 1885. The appellant admits this in his factum when he says: If the opposition be dismissed there is no need of a judgment on the motion.\"\nI am of opinion that this appeal should be dismissed with costs distrails to Messrs. Robertson Fleet & Falconer, attorneys for respondent.\nGWYNEE J. I do not feel competent to form a decided opinion in this case, but as the justice and equity of the case seems to me to be in favor of the appellant Barnard, I concur in the opinion of my brother Fournier that the appeal should be allowed\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for appellant: F.

Ritchie C.J. and Strong, Fournier, Taschereau and Gwynne JJ.\n(Mr. Justice Henry was present at the argument, but died before judgment was delivered.)\nON APPEAL FROM THE EXCHEQUER COURT OF CANADA.\nCustoms duties\u2014Article imported in parts\u2014Rate of duty\u2014Scrap brass\u2014Good faith\u201446 Vic. ch. 12, s. 153\u2014Subsequent legislation\u2014Effect of\u2014Statutory declaration.\nG., manufacturer of an \"Automatic Sprinkler,\" a brass device composed of several parts, was desirous of importing the same into Canada, with the intention of putting the parte together there and putting the completed articles on the market. He interviewed the appraiser of hardware at Montreal, explained to him the device and its use, and was told that it should pay duty as a manufacture of brass. He imported a number of sprinklers and paid the duty on the several parts, and the Customs officials then caused the same to be seized, and an information to be laid against him for smuggling, evasion of payment of duties, undervaluation, and knowingly keeping and selling goods illegally imported, under secs. 153 and 155 of the Customs Act of 1883.\nHeld, reversing the judgment of the Exchequer Court, that there was no importation of sprinklers, as completed articles, by G. and the act not imposing a duty on parts of an article the information should be dismissed.\nHeld also, that the subsequent passage of an act [48-49 V. c. 61, s. 12, re-enacted by 49 V. c. 32, s. 11] imposing a duty on such parts was a legislative declaration that it did not previously exist.\nAppeal from the judgment of Mr. Justice Gwynne in the Exchequer Court in favor of the crown.\nThe claimant Grinnell was a manufacturer of an article known as \"Grinnell's Automatic Sprinkler,\" and having had the, same patented in Canada, he was obliged to manufacture it here. Before importing any of the materials he called on the Custom house appraiser at Montreal, and showed him the different parts of a sprinkler, as well as one put together ready for use, and asked how these parts should be entered for duty, and according to the evidence of the claimant and one of his witnesses the appraiser informed him that the part should be entered as manufactures of brass, and the claimant proceeded to import the parts for making these sprinklers and had them entered for duty as above.\nThere was little or no labor performed on the sprinklers in Canada, and everything, including solder and screws for putting them together, was imported from the United States. After several of these entries had been made the customs authorities seized a number of the completed articles, and also a number not put together, and claimed that they were undervalued and should pay duty at the rate imposed on the article in its finished state according to its market value. The seizure was made under secs. 153 and 155 of the Customs Act of 1883.\nThe importer filed his claim to the goods in the Exchequer Court of Canada and the matter was heard before Mr. Justice Gwynne.\nGirouard Q.C. for the claimant.\nHogg for the crown.\nHis Lordship decided against the claimant's contention and delivered the following judgment\nGWYNNE J.\u2014In the month of January, 1885, the customs officers at Montreal seized 5,606 articles of manufactures in brass, called \"Grinnell's Automatic Sprinklers\" for non-payment of duty.\nThe article is patented in the United States by a Mr. Grinnell who is president of the Providence Steam and Gas Pipe Company, which company has the monopoly of manufacturing the patented invention in the United States by license from Mr. Grinnell, the patentee.\nMr. Grinnell obtained letters patent for his invention in Canada, also, upon the 28th day of April, 1882. These letters patent are subject to conditions therein contained that the same and all the rights and priviledges thereby granted should cease and determine, and the patent should be null and void, at the end of two years from the date thereof, unless the patentee, his executors or administrators, or his assignee or assignees, should within that period have commenced, or should after such commencement continuously carry on in Canada, the construction or manufacture of the invention thereof thereby patented in such manner that any person desiring to use it might obtain it, or cause it to be made for him, at a reasonable price at some manufactory or establishment for making it or constructing it in Canada, and further that the patent should be void if after the expiration of twelve months from the granting thereof the patentee, his executors or administrators, or his assignee or assignees for a whole or part of his interest in the patent, should import or cause to be imported into Canada the invention for which the patent was granted.\nIn the months of February, March and August, 1884, Mr. Grinnell, the patentee, not having previously made, or caused to be made, the patented invention at any manufactory or establishment in Canada, imported into Canada a large number of the several pieces manufactured in brass, which had been manufactured in the United States by and under the license held by the \"Providence Steam and Gas Pipe Company,\" and which being put together constituted the complete patented article, to the number in the whole of about 10,000 sprinklers. These he entered, not as the automatic sprinklers but simply as manufactures in brass valued at 8c. per pound, and his claim is that this was a proper entry and valuation and that he had, therefore, in fact, paid all duty chargeable under the circumstances.\nThis claim rests upon the contention that the mere putting together in Canada of the parts of the sprinklers so imported constituted the manufacturing or constructing of the patented article in Canada, within the meaning of the above condition in that behalf contained in the letters patent of the 28th April, 1882.\nThere is evidence that the cost of putting them together in Canada would be little over 3 cents apiece, although the patentee sets the price at or about 12 1\/2 cents apiece.\nIt is established beyond all doubt by the evidence that the pieces of manufactures in brass so imported constituted all the parts of the patented article to the minutest particular, and that they had no value whatever, and in the condition they were, as imported, could have been applied to no use whatever, except as parts of the patented article for which purpose they had been imported.\nThe price of the patented article sold in Canada was $1.25 apiece, but the claimant insists that 75 cents of this is for royalty, and he contends that the sprinklers seized were constructed or manufactured in Canada, and that he has complied with the conditions of the letters patent in that respect, and that, therefore, the utmost that could be charged against him is an undervaluation of the material of which they are made, and as he contends a bon\u00e2 fide undervaluation if it be one at all, and that the case does not come within sections 153 and 155 of the Customs Act of 1883 upon which the information is framed.\nThis contention necessitates an enquiry, whether the putting together of the pieces of the sprinklers in Canada, which pieces had all been manufactured in the United States, is a construction or manufacture of the patented invention in Canada within the meaning of the conditions in the letters patent, and I am of opinion clearly that it is not, and that the conditions of the letters patent were violated by the importations made in February, March and August, 1884. The articles then imported constituted in fact Grinnell's automatic sprinklers in pieces, and so were importations of the patented invention after the expiration of twelve months from the issuing of the letters patent, and the putting the several parts together in Canada was not a compliance with the conditions of the letters patent that within two years from their date the patentee should commence and continuously thereafter carry on in Canada the construction or manufacture of the patented invention.\nIt is a preposterous fallacy to say that a patented invention, every minutest particle of which was manufactured and constructed in the United States, was manufactured or constructed in Canada. I confess that I am wholly unable to understand how any business man of plain common sense could conscientiously entertain the idea that it was.\nI am obliged, therefore, to come to the conclusion that the manner in which these \"automatic sprinklers\" which have been seized, and which were so, as aforesaid, imported in pieces, were imported into Canada, was a plain evasion of the letters patent and of the \"Customs Act.\"\nAs they must be regarded when so imported as having been the patented invention, as in fact they were in pieces, they should, in my opinion, have been entered at the price of the patented invention in the United States, where they were manufactured, that being the only market value which they had in the country from which they were imported.\nOf those so imported some three thousand or over were sold by the patentee in Canada at the price of $1.25 apiece, and it cannot, I think, admit of a doubt that the object of importing them as they were imported, and of setting the valuation of 8c. per pound upon them, was to obtain the benefit of sales of the patented article in Canada at the full price, including the royalty, without paying duty upon them as the patented article. I must therefore, I think, hold that the case does come within the sections upon which the information is framed, and that the crown is entitled to judgment.\nIt was alleged by the claimant that upon entering the pieces of the sprinklers he consulted one of the Government appraisers, who, as he says, directed him to enter them as he did, as \"manufactures in brass,\" but he does not allege in his evidence that such appraiser directed him to value them at any particular price; that was the independent act of the claimant himself.\nIt was in point of fact under the item, \"manufactures in brass,\" that as automatic sprinklers they should have been entered, but at the value of the patented article which, in truth, the parts entered substantially were. The appraiser, however, says that he has no recollection of having ever seen the parts until the sprinklers were seized, and that he has no recollection either of Mr. Grinnell or any other person having ever spoken to him upon the subject of the sprinklers or their parts, but he says it is frequently the practice of parties to make partial statements, keeping back some of the main facts, in order to feel their way before passing entries, and that something of this kind may have passed, although he does not recollect that it did in the present case; but he is quite certain that if he had been shown the parts, and if the patented article had been explained to him, and if he had been asked how the parts of the patented invention should have been valued for duty, he would have replied, \"At the value of the patented article in the United States, less the cost of putting them together in Canada.\" This advice would, I think, need qualification as to the right of deducting the cost of the putting together of the parts in Canada, assuming such putting together in Canada not to have been, as I am of opinion it was not, a compliance with the act of Parliament relating to patents of invention and the conditions contained in the letters patent.\nThe claimant declares that he acted bon\u00e2 fide, and that his intention was to comply in good faith both with the conditions of his letters patent and the customs law.\nAs to this, I can only say that, in my opinion, it is to be much regretted that good intentions should have been obscured by any veil, however flimsy and transparent, when we come to observe it closely, it proves to be.\nJudgment must be for the crown.\nFrom that judgment the claimant appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nGirouard Q.C. and MacMaster Q.C. for the appellant contended that no automatic sprinklers were ever imported, and the crown could not claim duty for such on the importation of these parts. The same claim might be made if only one part was imported and thus each part might have to pay the duty on the whole. The United States v. Breed[1], Adams v. Bancroft[2] and Wile v. Cayley[3] were cited.\nHogg for the crown, referred to the Customs Act of 1883, secs. 68-9 and 153, and cited Torrance v. Boutillier[4], Attorney General v. Rothstein[5].\nSir W. J. RITCHIE C.J.\u2014The information in this case contains four counts: the first is that a certain person or person did, with intent to defraud the revenue, smuggle or cladestinely introduce into Canada, at the port of Montreal, certain goods subject to duty, portions of which consisted of 5,606 Grinnell's Automatic Sprinklers.\nThe second count, under section 153 (Customs act of 1883) was, that certain persons did, between 1st February, 1884, and 1st September, 1884, make out and attempt to pass and did pass, through the Custom house at Montreal false and fraudulent invoices of certain goods subject to duty, viz., 5,606 Grinnell's Automatic Sprinklers, imported from the United States of America.\nThe third count, under section 153 was: That certain persons did, between the 1st of February and the 1st of October, 1884, attempt to evade, and did evade, the payment of part of the duties on certain goods, viz., 5,606 Grinnell's Automatic Sprinklers of great value, viz., $5,606, by entering said goods at the Custom house at a value much below the proper value, namely, $655. 33, and said entry was made with intent and design of defrauding the revenue.\nThe fourth count, under section 155, was: That certain persons, between 1st February, 1884, and September 1st, 1884, did knowingly keep and sell certain dutiable goods, portions of which consisted of 5,606 Grinnell's Automatic Sprinklers, which had been illegally imported into Canada whereon duties lawfully payable had not been paid.\nIt seems to me that the question in this case is not whether the bringing in the parts composing the sprinklers in an unfinished state, and completing them so as to be in a state to be used as automatic sprinklers with a view of satisfying the provisions of the patent law, as contemplated by the claimant, is a bon\u00e2 fide compliance with the conditions of the claimant's letters patent. The only question, it appears to me, we have to deal with is simply: Do the invoices presented to the Customs officers correctly describe the goods which were entered as boxes of brass at SO per cent., machine at 25 per cent., boxes mechanics' tools at 30 per cent., solder at 25 per cent., punched brass at 30 per cent. and manufactured brass, boxes brass bodies at 30 per cent.? And do such invoices give the true and fair market value of the articles as invoiced? And was, or was not, this a compliance with the Customs laws?\nSTATEMENT OF DEFENCE.\nThe statement of defence of the claimant, Grinnell, and the evidence given in support of it, is as follows:\u2014\n5. That at the time of the arrival of the first shipments, and before making the entry thereof, the said claimant requested the hardware appraiser of the Customs Department at Montreal, one J. F. Hilton, to inform the said claimant, as a foreigner, under which item of the Canadian tariff the said parts so imported should be entered, exhibiting the same to him at the same time and explaining to him the purpose for which they were intended; and that it was on his information that the said parts were entered under the heading and in the manner in which they were entered.\n6. That the said parts were entered at their proper valuation in the market where they were produced, and the invoices exhibited were, and are, true and according to the facts, and the said valuation was made in good faith.\nEXTRACT FROM AFFIDAVIT OF MR. GEORGE REAVES.\n5. That deponent was present at the interview between the said Frederic Grinnell and the said hardware appraiser, J. F. Hilton, and that the statement thereof made in paragraph five of the said claim and answer is true.\nCLAIMANT'S EVIDENCE.\nQ. Did you have any conversation with any of the Custom officers about the time of making the first entry to the Custom house in Montreal? A. I did; I went to the Custom house with Mr. George Reaves for the express purpose of showing the material which I wished to import, and of explaining fully the intended use, so far as the Custom house officials should require me to do, in order to instruct him as to the dutiable value of the material that I was wishing to import.\nQ. You went with whom? A. Mr. Reaves, as stated in the previous answer.\nQ. Did you say that you saw Mr. Hilton? A. I saw an official whom I knew at the time to be an appraiser, and was, no doubt, informed by introduction of his name, but that, of course, was not material to me, my whole thought being to give full instructions as to what I wanted to do, and after this seizure had been made I learned that this appraiser's name was Hilton.\nQ. Who told you that his name was Hilton? A. I think, as a matter of accident, perhaps, more than anything when I went to Montreal after the seizure, that I learned his name when I called upon Mr. Wolff at the Custom house in Montreal and Mr. Hilton was called in.\nQ. You identified the same man? A. If I was called upon to swear whether it was the same man or not I should prefer not to swear.\nQ. Was Mr. Reaves with you? A. He Was. Mr. Reaves was personally acquainted with Mr. Hilton at the time of our first call and had had business of the same character with him before and, of course, knew him when he called the second time.\nQ. What did you show to Mr. Hilton at the time of your first interview? A. I showed him the parts of the sprinklers just as shown in Exhibit 6. I took those parts to Montreal for the express purpose of showing them to the proper authorities, and explained to the appraiser the purpose for which they were intended and showed him a sprinkler with parts put together.\nQ. Did you explain to him the parts of the sprinkler? A. I do not think that I explained to Mr. Hilton anything in the nature of the operation of the automatic sprinkler; I had no object in doing so.\nQ. Did you tell him what was the object of that sprinkler complete? A. I presume that I did; but I have no distinct recollection of explaining the working of the device. I showed the device in order. to show Mr. Hilton that these parts entered into a constructed device.\nQ. Mr. Reaves was present? A. He was.\nQ. What answer did you receive from Mr. Hilton? A. I cannot recall Mr. Hilton's language, but it was then decided that the articles were dutiable as manufacturers' brass, and the amount of duty was not discussed because that is all shown in the schedule or in the tariff.\nQ. Did you come to that conclusion in the presence of Mr. Hilton? A. We got that information from Mr. Hilton.\nQ. And you so entered the first shipment in that way? A. We did.\nQ. Had no trouble? A, No question whatever was raised. The second shipment was made the same way and no question was raised.\nQ. The third shipment in August was also made the same way; and when did you hear of any complaint on the part of the Custom authorities in Montreal? A. I heard no complaint whatever until I was notified by telegraph from the Providence Steam and Gas Pipe Company, sent to me in the South, saying that they received word from Mr. Reaves that the Customs authorities had seized all of my sprinklers, and tools for constructing the same, which were in his building in Montreal.\nQ. That was when? A. The date of Mr. Reaves' despatch from Montreal to the Providence Steam and Gas Pipe company was January 6th, 1885, and that despatch was repeated, or the substance of that repeated, to me. Mr. Reaves also wrote to me on January 5th.\n* * * * * *\nQ. Till the time of the seizure made by the Customs authorities Jiad you any knowledge of the customs laws of Canada? A. I had not any knowledge of the customs laws of Canada, and did not seek any information other than what I sought from the appraiser, supposing that his information was all-sufficient, with no thought that there was any statute that would apply to my importation as relating to parts of devices.\nQ. Did Mr. Hilton allude to the duty on parts? A. Mr. Hilton, or the appraiser whom I saw at my first visit in this connection, made no allusion whatever to the duty on parts of devices, nor raised any discussion or question, or doubt as to whether he was correct in his decision.\nEvidence of Mr. George Reaves. Examined by Mr. Girouard, Q.C., on behalf of the claimant, Grinnell.\nI have already given my affidavit in this matter when the case was pending before the Department of Customs, and a copy thereof has just been communicated to me for inspection. I acted here for Mr. Grinnell in a friendly way in connection with the importation of sprinklers; this was without consideration of any kind. I am familiar with the facts of this case from its inception. Mr. Grinnell used a part of my premises for the purposes of these sprinklers; the first three months he was charged no rent; after that time he paid rental. He used this place as a manufacturing shop for the purposes of these sprinklers. During the carnival, that is, in the early part of eighteen hundred and eighty-four, the first importation of these sprinklers was made; it was first addressed to me\u2014the first shipment was sent to my care and the first customs entry was passed by Moses Davis, custom broker. Mr. Grinnell wished to be here before the first customs entry was made, as he wished to put matters in such a shape that in the event of any patent suits being instituted he would have everything clear and satisfactory. He came to Montreal and he interviewed Mr. Hilton, the hardware appraiser, in my presence; he showed the different parts of the sprinkler to Hilton, and informed him what his intentions were with regard to their manufacture. He also informed him by whom the different parts were made in the United States, and why they were manufactured out of the manufacture of the Providence Steam Pipe Company, of which he was president. He also told him he intended to manufacture a sprinkler in Montreal and that he had to do it in that manner to protect his Canadian patent. Hilton looked at the different parts of the sprinkler which were shown to him and he told him how to enter them, and his directions were followed by his broker, Davis, in making the entry. I believe that Mr. Grinnell showed a sprinkler all finished, but I am positive he showed him all the parts and how to put them together to make a perfect sprinkler. There was no trouble about the first shipment just mentioned. More shipments were made during the same year in the same manner without any trouble. The sprinklers were all made up and constructed and it was only after this that the customs seizure was made by Messrs. Wolff and Grose, during the following summer or fall. They asked for the key and took possession of the place; they applied for my correspondence with the Providence Steam Pipe Company and got it as I happened to be out the time. My clerk gave it. I am not aware that I have any correspondence now with Mr. Grinnell with reference to the matters at issue in this case; the officer saw the whole correspondence I had with him or the company.\nCross-examined by William D. Hogg, Esq., barrister, on behalf of the plaintiff, to whose questions deponent answers as follows:\u2014\nThe first entry was made after our interview and visit with Hilton. It was during the carnival of 1884, or thereabouts. I saw Hilton in his own office at the examining warehouse in the customs building. Mr. Grinnell and I were the only ones present. I introduced Grinnell to Davis as a broker, and Grinnell explained the business to Davis which he wanted him to do for him. Mr. Hilton, after hearing the explanations of Grinnell, told him the classification for customs duties under which the entry should be made, and told him the rate of duty at which the material would be charged. The explanations which Mr. Grinnell gave, as I remember, were full and clear and sufficient to obtain from Mr. Hilton the information which he, Grinnell, required. I have no doubt that throughout Mr. Grinnell acted in good faith. Our interview with Mr. Hilton lasted about ten or fifteen minutes. I think the interview was in the forenoon. Mr. Hilton seemed to take an interest in the explanation and understood what was said. And further deponent saith not, and the foregoing having been read over to him he declares it contains the truth and has signed.\nIt is true that Mr. Grinnell is an interested party, but Mr. Reaves is, as appears by the evidence, entirely disinterested, and Mr. Grinnell thus speaks of him:\u2014\nQ. Has Mr. Reaves, who was with you at the time of said interview or since, any interest in your sprinkler business or in the sprinkler business of the Providence Steam and Gas Pipe Company in the United States or Canada? A. Mr. Reaves had no interest either at that time or since, or any expectation, so far as I know, of any interest in any sprinkler business. My business intercourse with Mr. Reaves was purely and wholly in the nature of seeking information from an experienced business man in high standing in the city of Montreal, so that my matters might be attended to with the least expense and care on my part.\nQ. Has he been your agent in Montreal charged with looking to your interest in that matter whenever you were not present there? A. He has been my agent, but without any compensation whatever except in the matter of the rent of his building and a small amount which I remitted him to cover his expenses to Ottawa.\nAnd not the slightest imputation has been cast on the character of either Mr. Grinnell or Mr. Reaves, nor does there appear to have been anything in the manner in which these witnesses gave their evidence to discredit their testimony, and therefore we must assume them to be reputable and credible witnesses.\nNow, how is this clear and most circumstantial account of the interview met? Simply by the non mi ricorao of Mr. Hilton. This is what he says:\u2014 John F. Hilton sworn. Examined by Mr. Hogg:\u2014\nQ. What is your occupation? A. Appraiser of hardware, port of Montreal.\nQ. I suppose you have heard of this seizure? A. Yes.\nQ. Did you ever see the boxes containing the parts of an automatic sprinkler like this (Grinnell's Ex. 6)? A. I could not say.\nQ. Do you remember having an interview with Mr, Grinnell? A. I do not.\nQ. Do you know Mr. Grinnell? A. No.\nQ. Do you know Mr. Reaves of Montreal? A. Yes.\nQ. Do you remember having an interview with Mr. Reaves? A. I could not say that positively; I think he called on me at one time.\nQ. I suppose you have a great many interviews in your capacity of appraiser? A. A great many.\nQ. It is stated by Mr. Grinnell in his evidence (counsel reads from evidence as to conversation by claimant with witness in company with Reaves). Do you remember these gentlemen showing you a box containing the parts of an automatic sprinkler? A. I do not.\nHis Lordship\u2014Did you ever see those parts before the seizure? A. Never to my knowledge.\nQ. Have you had long experience as appraiser in the customs? A. Yes.\nQ. How many years? Between seven and eight.\nQ. As appraiser of hardware? A. Yes.\nQ. If these parts had been shown to you as you see them now, and the device explained to you, what would you say? A. I should say that the duty should be paid on the cost of the completed article manufactured in the United States, less the cost of putting it together in Canada.\nQ. You have no recollection of stating to Mr. Reaves that it was to be entered as brass? A. No.\nQ. If the parts had been shown to you, would it have been possible for you to have said so? A. I would not have made the answer that is there stated.\nQ. You are sure of that? A. As certain as I can be of anything.\nQ. What do you say now about the interview? I cannot recollect it now.\nHis Lordship\u2014Have you no recollection of anything of the kind? A. No, my Lord.\nQ. And what do you say would be the proper value for duty on these articles? A. The proper value would be 30 per cent. on the cost, as I have stated\nCross-examined by Mr. Girouard:\u2014\nQ. If you were called upon to-day by an importer to make an entry of these goods you would tell him to enter it as the finished article. Was not the tariff changed within a year or two? A. There has been no alteration in that respect.\n(Counsel refers witness to clause 10 of the customs' tariff of 1885.)\nQ. Is not that clause direct upon the point? A. Yes.\nQ. Would you undertake to swear that you did not say to Messrs. Grinnell and Reaves to enter these goods as manufactured brass? A. I would not swear.\nQ. Under what clause of the act of 1883 are you justified in telling them to enter the goods as finished brass? I should only give my decision upon the value and get at it as if the article was finished.\n(Letter from J. F. Hilton, appraiser to the Collector of Customs).\nAppraiser's Office, Customs Examining Warehouse,\nHardware Department,\nMontreal, 16th February, 1885.\nSir,\u2014I beg to return to you copy of letter from the Commissioner of Customs, which was contained in departmental file No. 235, referring to entries at this port of parts of Grinnell's automatic sprinklers. In reply to the statement by Mr. Grinnell that he, in company with Mr. G. Reaves, called upon me previous to the first entry for these goods, and presented samples of the different parts, explaining the purpose for which they were intended, and asked the status which they should take under the customs tariff, on which he was informed by me that he might enter them as manufactures of brass not elsewhere specified, and not as finished machines, or parts of finished machines, etc., I beg to say that at this time I have no recollection whatever of any such visit having been made by Mr. Grinnell or Mr. Reaves, and regret to say that I am unable to give Mr. Grinnell's statements either an explicit denial or confirmation. I consider it extremely unlikely, however, that I should have given such answers to Mr. Grinnell's enquiries as he states.\nHow can any court refuse to accept and act on the uncontradicted testimony of two such witnesses as Grinnell and Reaves, when the party with whom the interview is alleged to have taken place will not even deny the accuracy of Grinnell's and Reaves' statements, but simply says that he has \"no recollection whatever of any such visit by Grinnell or Reaves, and that he is unable to give Mr. Grinnell's statements either an explicit denial or confirmation?\" Under these circumstances, I think we are bound to find, as a matter of fact, that the statements of Grinnell and Reaves are true, and that all the parts of a sprinkler were shown to the appraiser, and the purpose for which they were intended explained to him, and that a sprinkler was shown to him with the parts put together, and that it was then decided that the articles were dutiable, and should be entered as manufacturers' brass, and not the slightest intimation given that they should be entered and pay duty as automatic sprinklers. If confirmation of the truth of Mr. Grinnell's and Mr. Heaves' statements was required, could stronger evidence be found than in the invoice submitted for entry, where the goods were described as \"automatic sprinkler materials,\" and in the action of the customs authorities on those invoices in entering the goods as manufactured brass at the values set forth in the invoices? And in such a case as this, to whom could an importer apply with more propriety and confidence than to the appraiser of hardware?\nThe first shipment having been entered in that way and no question whatever raised, and the second in the same way and no question whatever raised, and the third shipment also made in the game way and no question raised, under such circumstances does it not look rather strange and, to say the least of it, a very harsh proceeding that the first intimation to Mr. Grinnell should be by a telegram on the 6th of January, 1885, that the customs authorities had seized all his sprinklers and tools for constructing the same which were in his building in Montreal? Apart from the question of harshness or hardship, with which we have really nothing to do, except that it would seem but right that when public officers undertake to act in such a harsh manner they should be well satisfied before they do, by such a summary proceeding, destroy the business operations of importers, that the law will justify their action, as I shall show it will not in this case, if the statement of Grinnell and Reaves in reference to the interview with Hilton are true, was not the charge of smuggling completely answered and rebutted, as well as the charges of false and fraudulent invoices, evading duties by entering the goods below their proper value with intent to defraud the revenue, and of knowingly keeping and selling goods illegally imported? If this is not so let us consider the case on strictly legal grounds.\nLet us see what the law is as to the construction of revenue laws.\nThe term \"smuggling\" has been defined to be\nThe difference of importing prohibited articles, or defrauding the revenue by the introduction of articles into consumption without paying the duties chargeable thereon[6].\nIt is a technical word, having a known and accepted meaning. It implies illegality, and is inconsistent with innocent intent. The idea conveyed by it is that of a secret introduction of goods with intent to avoid payment of duty[7].\nMaxwell on Statutes[8] says:\u2014\nStatutes which encroach on the rights of the subject, whether as regards person or property, are similarly subject to a strict construction. It is presumed that the legislature does not desire to confiscate the property, or to encroach upon the rights of persons; and it is, therefore, expected that if such be its intention it will manifest it plainly, if not in express words, at least by clear implication and beyond reasonable doubt.\nSee per Bramwell L. J. in Wells v. London, Tilbury, etc., Ry. Co.[9]; per Mellish L. J. in Re Lundy Granite Co.[10]; per James L. J. in ex parte Jones[11]; per curiam in Randolph v. Milman[12]; Green v. The Queen[13]; ex parte Sheil[14].\nNo doubt revenue laws are to be so construed as will most effectually accomplish the intention of the legislature in passing them, which simply is to secure the collection of the revenue. And it is clear that this intention of the legislature, in the imposition of duties, must be clearly expressed, and in case of doubtful interpretation the construction should be in favor of the importer; as said by Lord Cairns in Cox v. Rabbits[15]:\u2014\nMy Lords, a taxing act must be construed strictly; you must find words to impose the tax, and if words are not found which impose the tax it is not to be imposed.\nAnd by the same learned judge (Lord Cairns) in Partington v. The Attorney General[16]:\u2014\nI am bound to say that I myself have arrived without hesitation at the conclusion that the judgment ought to be affirmed. I do so both upon form and also upon substance. I am not at all sure that in a case of this kind\u2014a fiscal case\u2014form is not amply sufficient; because as I understand the principle of all fiscal legislation, it is this: if the person sought to be taxed comes within the letter of the law he must be taxed however great the hardship may appear to the judicial mind to be. On the other hand, if the crown seeking to recover the tax cannot bring the subject within the letter of the law the subject is free, however apparently within the spirit of the law the case might otherwise appear to be. In other words, if there be admissible, in any statute, what is called an equitable construction, certainly such a construction is not admissible in a taxing statute, where you can simply adhere to the words of the statute.\nWhat were the laws in force bearing on this case at the time these goods were imported? By the customs acts and tariff then in force, 46 Vic., ch. 12, it is enacted:\u2014\nSection 68. Where any duty ad valorem is imposed on any goods imported into Canada the value for duty shall be the fair market value thereof, when sold for home consumption, in the principal markets of the country whence and at the time when the same were exported directly to Canada.\nSection 69. Such market value shall be the fair market value of such goods in the usual and ordinary commercial acceptation of the term at the usual and ordinary credit, and not the cash value of such goods, except in cases in which the article imported is, by universal usage, considered and known to be a cash article and so, bon\u00e2 fide, paid for in all transactions in relation to such article; and all invoices representing cash values, except in the special cases. hereinbefore referred to, shall be subject to such additions as to the collector or appraiser of the port at which they are presented may appear just and reasonable to bring up the amount to the true and fair market value as required by this section.\nThe only item in the tariff under which these goods could be entered, and a duty imposed, was under schedule A:\u2014Goods subject to duty: brass, manufactures of brass not elsewhere specified, 30 per cent. ad valorem. And the 41st section of 46 Vic., chap. 12, 1883, provides that the person entering goods inwards shall deliver to the collector or other officer an invoice of such goods, showing the place and date of purchase and the name or style of the person or persons from whom the goods were purchased, and a full description thereof in detail, giving the quantity and value of each kind of goods so imported.\nThis being the law governing the case, what are the facts as applicable to the law? It is established beyond controversy that no Grinnell's automatic sprinklers, in a condition to be used as such, were imported into Canada; that to complete them required labor and skill in drilling, riveting, soldering and testing. The evidence on this point is as follows:\u2014\nMr. Grinnell continues his evidence as follows:\u2014\nThe sprinklers were constructed at No. 18 Hospital street, city of Montreal. They were constructed from pieces of stamped and punched and cast brass which were imported from the United States by me, which pieces were purchased of parties in the United States making, a specialty of such work, and the construction in Canada consisted in putting these pieces together, doing a certain amount of mechanical work in the way of drilling and pinning and soldering necessary to constitute them a completed device. After so being constructed careful examination was made of them by a party expert in this work. They were also subject to a test by hydraulic pressure, by means of a force pump, to ascertain whether the castings were sound, and also whether the valve which is embodied in the sprinkler was correctly adjusted so as to be, and to remain, permanently water-tight. The sprinklers were then packed in suitable boxes for shipment to any desired point.\nQ. Do you require workmen of some skill to properly put the said parts together and test the sprinklers? A. We do. We require men who are experienced in that work; men of more intelligence than the average mechanic, and men that are strictly to be depended upon in the matter of the care which it is necessary to exercise in determining whether those sprinklers when constructed are properly constructed.\nQ. How many men did you employ in Montreal so to construct the said sprinkler? A. There were three men at work.\nThe witness Stone says:\u2014\nQ. For what purpose did you go to Montreal? A. For the purpose of manufacturing sprinklers.\nQ. Which sprinklers? A. The Grinnell Automatic Sprinkler.\nQ. What do you mean by manufacturing? A. Well, I did what work there was to be done on them.\nQ. What did you do on them? A. Well, I had the drilling, and pipping, and the setting up, soldering and inspection of them, testing.\nQ. Where was that done? A. 18 Hospital street, in the city of Montreal.\nQ. In the same building as Mr. George Reaves? A. Yes, sir.\nQ. Did you have tools there for that purpose? A. Yes, sir.\nQ. Does exhibit No. 20 contain a list of said tools? A. Yes, sir; I should say it did.\nQ. You had a fire in the place? A. Yes, sir.\nQ. You produce, then, there the automatic sprinkler exactly as exhibit 13 is? A. Yes, sir.\nQ. Before producing the automatic, did you make what may be called the open sprinkler, as exhibit 12? A. Before producing the automatic I had to make it exactly as exhibit No. 12\u2014that is the open sprinkler and after that I added the automatic feature and it became exhibit 13.\nQ. You soldered the automatic, too? A. Yes, sir, I soldered the automatic and put together the other parts.\nQ. Those parts were coming where from? A. They were coming from Providence.\nQ. And shipped to Montreal? A. Yes, sir.\nQ. Did you have anything to do with the preparation of the entry in the custom house in Montreal. A. I went there several times get them.\nQ. But you had nothing to do with the preparation of the necessary papers? A. No, sir.\nQ. Do you know who it was done by? A. I think Mr. Reaves attended to that.\nQ. After putting together the said parts, what did you do to asscrtain that the automatic sprinkler was perfect? A. We had a testing machine there. Q. Could it become a perfect sprinkler till then? A. No, sir.\nQ. And that was done in Montreal? A. Yes, sir.\nQ. Without being tested, what did it amount to? A. Well, it would amount to considerable, probably, if we put them up, and if they proved defective it would be a serious loss.\nQ. It is an impossibility to use the sprinkler without testing it? A. Yes, sir, I should say it was.\nIt was shown that 10 or 15 per cent. of the materials imported proved unfit for completing the sprinklers and making them fit for use and had to be reshipped to the United States as scrap brass. It was equally well established that the materials of parts of the sprinklers, with a view of being put together and completed in Canada, were purchased from two different and independent manufacturing establishments, neither of which manufactured all the parts belonging to the sprinklers; that the prices charged by these manufacturers, respectively, were the proper and fair market values, honestly invoiced, and were entered in accordance therewith, the separate invoices forming apportion of the entries as showing clearly what was purchased from the one and from the other, and the prices paid therefor. There was no item of the tariff imposing either a specific or ad valorem duty on automatic sprinklers; if there had been then the observation of Taney C.J. in Karthaus v. Frick[17], would be applicable. He says: \"The charge of a specific duty upon an article in a particular form or vessel is a charge upon the whole article as described, including the vessel or material described as containing it!\"\nWe have seen that the item of the tariff under which these goods could be entered and a duty imposed was under schedule A\u2014Goods subject to duty: Brass\u2014Manufactures of brass not elsewhere specified, 30 per cent. ad valorem. Let us carefully examine these invoices and entries, and see whether they are or are not the invoices and entries contemplated by the act. The first invoice is 2th February, 1884, and is as follows:\u2014\n(His Lordship here read the invoice, exhibit No. 20, page 13 of the case, of tools sent to Montreal and shipped to Grinnell by the Providence Steam and Gas Pipe Company, Providence, R.I., dated at Providence, Feb. 1st, 1884, and signed by F. H. Maynard, secretary of the company. Also exhibit 15, an invoice of a number of pieces of punched brass, with the weights, and of lead, dated 17th January, 1884, shipped by the Gorham manufacturing company to Grinnell. Next exhibit 19, an invoice of brass bodies and other articles, from the Providence Steam and Gas Pipe company to Grinnell. Next exhibit 31, the entry of these goods dated 12th February, 1884, being report No. 15109 and entry No. 32072, the value for duty being $366 and the duty 105.55, with the affidavits of Grinnell and of his agent J. Kinleyside attached. Next exhibit 9 A, invoice of brass bodies, etc. from the Providence Steam and Gas Pipe company dated 6th March, 1884. amounting to $215.25. Then exhibit 16, invoice of punched brass and lead from the Gorham Manufacturing company, dated 10th March, 1884, $83,76. Then exhibit 32, entry of the last two invoices dated 25th March, 1884, being report No. 19139 and entry No. 38074. Value for duty in dollars $299, duty $89,70, with the same affidavits as the former entry, made by Charles A. Stone and J. Kinleyside. And lastly, exhibit 18, invoice from the Providence Company of brass bodies, punched brass, etc., amounting to $614.74, and dated 19th August, 1884, and exhibit 30 entry of the same dated 30th August, 1884, being report No. 5055 and entry No. 9481. Value for duty $615 and duty $184,50 with a similar affidavit by J. Kinleyside.)\nIt has not been attempted to be controverted that: for the parts Grinnell purchased from the Providence Steam and Gas Pipe company, and the Gorham Manufacturing company, respectively, he paid the prices at which they were supplied to him, and that for those articles he was charged the fair market price or value, and that at those prices he entered the goods. The evidence on this point is as follows:\u2014\nQ. For that purpose, I believe, Mr. Grinnell, you imported into Canada certain parts, and you will please state what parts and from whom? A. I imported all of the parts necessary to construct the automatic sprinkler in Canada. A certain part of the sprinkler known as the body of the sprinkler was furnished to me by the Providence Steam and Gas Pipe company, partially finished; the remaining parts of the sprinkler, which consisted of the punched or stamped brass, I obtained from the Gorham Manufacturing company for two shipments, and from the Providence Steam and Gas Pipe company the same material which they had previously purchased of the Gorham company, and imported all of these parts into Canada for the purpose of constructing the automatic sprinkler.\nQ. The entries in the custom's in question in this cause, I believe, refer to those very importations of parts? A. Yes, they do.\nQ. At what price did you get the said parts from the said parties; was it the usual market price? It was the usual market price so far as the market price had ever been established for such pieces.\nQ. Did you get the said parts from the Gorham company at the same price they were selling the same to other parties? A. I did; I obtained them at the same price. They were selling them to the Providence Steam and Gas Pipe Company, who were the only parties purchasing these particular pieces.\nQ. Now, could you tell at what price you got the parts that were manufactured by the Providence Steam and Gas Pipe Co.; was it a fair market price? A. It was.\nQ. Upon what basis did you place that market price? A. The Providence Steam and Gas Pipe Company's account of the cost of this work was taken, and a fair margin of profit was added to the cost of the part they furnished.\nQ. You made the entries in the Custom house in Montreal, or caused them to be made? A. I attended personally to part of the proceedings of entering the first invoice; the remaining part of the work was done by an authorized broker in Montreal, to whom I was introduced by Mr. Reaves.\nQ. Were the said entries made upon the prices you paid to the said concern? A. They were on invoices that were sworn to by representative officers of each of these concerns before the British consul here in Providence.\nQ. Can you tell to-day whether, by error or other cause or causes, there was any mistake or omission in the said entries or value of said parts? A. No error; none whatever, to my knowledge.\nQ. Were they done in good faith? A. Entirely in good faith.\nI do not understand that it is contended that the invoices submitted were not bon\u00e2 fide and truthful; if it is the evidence of Mr. Grinnell is direct, and I am bound to believe, and do believe, in the absence of any evidence to the contrary, that what he says is strictly true. He says, in answer to the question:\nQ. Have you personal knowledge of the invoices furnished on your behalf with the Department of Customs in Montreal in connection with this case? A. I have.\nQ. Are they correct and true? A. They are.\nQ. Genuine? A. They are.\nQ. Are they according to facts? A. They are.\nQ. In good faith? A. They are.\nQ. Will you say the same thing about the letters coming either from you or from the Providence Steam and Gas Pipe Co., filed in this matter? A. I do; they were all written in good faith and in the strict line of honest business correspondence, and contain the facts in every particular. The same is to be said of my correspondence with my counsel, Mr. Girouard, wherein I set forth the facts in relation to this whole matter for his instruction.\nThe invoices, then, having been duly produced, and the articles correctly described and bon\u00e2 fide entered at the prices paid for them at the place from which they were imported, how can it be said that any of the counts of the information can be sustained? What other invoices could the claimant have produced or the collector accepted? Were they not in the very terms of the statute? How can it be said that the goods were undervalued, when they were valued at the prices paid for them by the importer in the market where he bought them? How otherwise can their market value be established than by showing the market value of the article at the place of production, and the fair, bon\u00e2 fide amount there paid? It being always borne in mind that at the time these articles were imported there was no law applicable to this case authorising the imposition of the same rate of duty when imported in Canada in separate parts as there is now by the statute 48 Vic., ch. 61, which declares as follows:\u2014\nCustoms and Excise acts amended\u201448 Vic., cap. 61.\n12. When any manufactured article is imported into Canada in separate parts, each such part shall be charged with the same rate of duty as the finished article, on a proportionate valuation, and when the duty chargeable thereon is specific, or specific and ad valorem, an average rate of ad valorem duty, equal to the specific and specific and ad valorem duty so chargeable, shall be ascertained and charged upon such parts of the manufactured article.\nand which was re-enacted by 49 Vic., cap. 32, sec. 11.\nWhat is now desired to be accomplished seems to me an endeavor to give a retroactive operation to this section which, instead of showing a retroactive operation, may fairly be said to indicate that until this clause was enacted there was no justification for the imposition of duties on parts of articles proportionate to the finished article, and I am much inclined to think that it was in this view that Mr. Hilton considered that it was right that the duty should be imposed on the material as imported, and not on the finished article which clearly was not imported; and in giving his testimony I am inclined to think he had in his mind the then state of the law, and not what it was when the goods were imported. This enactment would seem to be a legislative declaration that, until the passing of these acts of 48-49 Vic., and 49 Vic., there was no law to justify the imposition of duty on imported parts of manufactured articles in reference to the value of the finished article. In Morris v. Mellin,[18] Edward Holroyd amicus curi\u00e6, suggested that the statute 7 G. 4, c. 57, s. 33 was a legislative declaration that the provisions of the statute 3 Gr. 4 c. 39 did not extend to the assignees of an insolvent debtor.\nLittledale J.\nThe statute of 7 Gr. 4 c. 57 s. 33 recites that it was expedient to extend the provisions of the statute 3 Gr. 4 c. 39, and enacts that the last mentioned act shall extend to the assignee of every prisoner who shall, within the time therein mentioned, apply to the insolvent court for his discharge from confinement, as if the last mentioned act had been expressly therein enacted; and it then declares that all warrants of attorney, etc., etc., which, by the last mentioned act, were declared to be fraudulent and void against the assignees of a bankrupt, shall be deemed fraudulent and void against the assignees of an insolvent debtor. This, as it seems to me, is a legislative declaration that the statute 3 G. 4 c. 39 did not make such instrument void against the assignees of an insolvent debtor. Upon the whole, I think that this rule ought to be discharged.\nAnd in Bennett v. Daniel[19] Lord Tenderten C. J., recognized Morris v. Mellin as good law.\nWhere, then, is the evidence in this case to support the charges of smuggling, false invoices, false and fraudulent undervaluation, or of knowingly keeping and selling goods illegally imported? I cannot discover it. Therefore, on the law and the facts, apart from the conduct and declarations of Hilton and the action of the Customs officials in passing the goods with full knowledge of all the circumstances connected with their importation which, in the absence of any evidence to the contrary, it is to be presumed they must have had through Hilton, I think the crown has failed to establish any breach of the revenue laws as alleged in the information, and the appeal must be allowed with costs and the information dismissed with costs.\nSTRONG J.\u2014I am of opinion that the judgment of the Exchequer Court cannot be sustained. The statute of 1885 introduced, for the first time, the principle of valuing manufactured component parts of a manufactured article according to the proportions they bear to the market value of the completed article for purposes of home consumption. Previous to that amendment of the law there could have been no valuation of these pieces of brass, intended to form component parts of these sprinklers, except according to their actual separate value as pieces of manufactured brass, as they were, in fact, valued. Then, if they were entered and valued according to law there can be no question of an intention to evade the revenue. Sprinklers, as completed articles, never were, in fact, imported, and these pieces of brass never had existed as sprinklers before their importation. Therefore, the crown does not establish that there was an importation of automatic sprinklers in detached pieces, but it is simply a case of the importation of manufactured pieces of brass which were, it is true, intended to constitute parts of automatic sprinklers to be formed out of them after importation when, for the first time, the different pieces were to be adjusted to each other. The case of a watch or a carriage completed abroad, then taken to pieces and imported in separate parts, is wholly different, and the same may be said of the case where the several parts, without being actually put together previous to importation so as to form one whole, are yet so identified with the one specific whole which is to be formed out of them that they are appropriated to one particular instrument or machine, and to no other; in such circumstances it may well be said that there is an importation of a particular machine in parts, but in the present case there was nothing resembling this.\nIt is, of course, a rule that a statute cannot be evaded by doing indirectly that which it forbids to be done directly. But this rule is not to be extended so as, by implication, to bring within the statute a case not provided for nor in the contemplation of the legislator, even though, owing to its omission, parties may be enabled to contravene the policy of the act and to do, though not in the way prohibited by the act, that which it was the object of the legislature to prevent. In order to bring a case within the purview of a statute the language in which the law is expressed must be sufficiently comprehensive to include the alleged infraction. In other words, it is no evasion of an act of Parliament, in a legal sense, to do that which may tend to prevent the attainment of the end which the legislature-had in view, provided parties keep outside the provisions of the statutes[20]. If any authorities are wanting for this principle of construction two strong instances in which it was recognized and applied in recent times are afforded by the cases of Wilson v. Robertson[21], and Deal v. Schofield[22].\nI think the present was casus omissus in the customs and tariff laws until express provision was made for it by the act of 1885. Indeed, the very circumstance that such an act was considered necessary and was passed implies that the previously existing state of the law contained no provision applicable to the importation of such articles otherwise than as manufactured brass.\nThe judgment of the Exchequer Court should be reversed with costs, and the claim of the appellant to a release of the goods allowed with costs.\nFOURNIER J.\u2014I entirely agree with the judgment of the Chief Justice in this case.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014I would allow this appeal with costs, and dismiss the information with costs, for the reasons given by the Chief Justice.\nGwynne J. took no part in the judgment.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellant: Girouard, Delorimier & Delorimier.\nSolicitors for respondent: O'Connor & Hogg.\n[1] 1 Sum. 166.\n[2] 3 Sum. 384.\n[3] 14 U.

Swinney and others (Plaintiffs)\nRespondents\n1888: Nov. 8 & 9th; 1889: April 30.\nON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW BRUNSWICK.\nMortgagor and mortgagee\u2014Sale of mortgaged lands\u2014Power of attorney\u2014Authority of agent\u2014Sale on credit\u2014Power of sale in mortgage\u2014Application of proceeds\u2014Duty of purchaser.\nA power of attorney by mortgagees authorized their agent to enter and take possession of the mortgaged lands and sell the same at public or private sale, and for the best price that could be gotten for them, and to execute all necessary receipts, &c., which receipts \"should effectually exonerate every purchaser or other person taking the same from all liability of seeing to the application of the money therein mentioned to be received and from being responsible for the loss, mis-application or non-application thereof.\" The agent took possession and sold the land, receiving part of the purchase money in cash and the balance in a promissory note of the purchaser payable to himself, which he caused to be discounted and appropriated the proceeds. The purchaser paid the note to the holders at maturity.\nHeld, affirming the judgment of the court below, that the power of attorney did not authorize a sale upon credit, and the sale by the agent was, therefore, invalid, and the purchaser was not relieved by the above clause from seeing that the authority of the agent was rightly exercised. The sale being invalid the subsequent payment of the note by the purchaser could not make it good.\nAppeal from a decision of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick dismissing an appeal from the decree of the judge in equity in favor of the plaintiffs.\nThis was a suit in equity to set aside a deed to the defendant Rodburn of certain timber lands in New Brunswick, and to restrain him from disposing of or encumbering the same, or cutting the timber thereon. The facts of the case may be stated, shortly, as follows:\nIn 1874 one of the plaintiffs mortgaged the lands in question to the others for some $45,000, which sum was payable in six months from the date of the mortgage. There was a power of sale given to the mortgagees in case of non-payment, which was to be exercised after publication for three months in the Royal Gazette of notice of intention to sell, and such sale might be made either at public auction or private sale. Provision was made for the application of the proceeds of such sale, but it was declared that the purchaser need not inquire whether they were applied as directed or not, or whether or not proper notice of sale had been given.\nWhen the mortgage was nearly three years over due the mortgagers, who resided in England, gave a power of attorney to the defendant Rice, authorizing him to take possesion of the mortgaged lands and sell them for the best price he could obtain. Rice came to New Brunswick in 1877, took possession of the premises, and published a notice of sale in the Royal Gazette for 3rd August, 1877. The sale was postponed several times, but could not be effected at a satisfactory price, and in the fall of 1880 Rice offered the land to the defendant Rodburn at private sale. Rodburn had the land examined and offered to buy it for $6,000\u2014which Rice at first would not accept, but asked $10,000. Rodburn refused to pay more than his offer; and Rice, after making further endeavors to sell, accepted the $6,000 from Rodburn and gave him a deed. Part of the purchase money was paid in cash and the balance by a promissory note in favor of Rice.\nThe plaintiffs filed their bill to set aside the sale, charging therein fraud on the part of Rice in making the sale; that Rodburn took the deed knowing that Rice had acted fraudulently; that Rodburn paid no money for the land and that the sale was not bon\u00e2 fide. The answer of the defendant negatived these charges.\nAt the hearing, at the request of the plaintiff, a jury was summoned and certain issues were left to them, the finding on which would determine the bon\u00e2 fides of the sale and the question of fraud. These issues were found in favor of the defendants. A new trial was moved for and the verdict set aside, the learned judge deciding that the sale was invalid, as Rice had exceeded the authority given to him by the power of attorney in two respects\u2014first, in selling some three years after publication of the notice in the Royal Gazette, which was really selling without notice; and secondly, in taking a note payable to his own order for a portion of the purchase money.\nThe Supreme Court of New Brunswick dismissed an appeal from the decision of the judge in equity, and thereupon the defendants appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nGilbert Q.C. for the appellants:\nThe only ground upon which the plaintiffs could succeed without recouping Rodburn for the money paid Rice is that of collusion between the defendants, and the whole evidence contradicts that position.\nThere can bo object in requiring a special notice in order to effect a private sale, and the notice given fully complied with the terms of the power of sale.\nThe following authorities were referred to: Jenkins v. Jones[1], Hewitt v. Loosemore[2], Davey v. Durrant[3].\nBarker Q.C. for the respondents:\nThe evidence is ample to show collusion between the defendants, to enable Rice to appropriate the purchase money to his own use.\nThe power of sale requires notice as well for a private as for a public sale, and the power must be strictly followed Dicker v. Angerstein[4].\nThe learned counsel also referred to the following cases: Parkinson v. Hanbury[5], Jenkins v. Jones[6], Jones v. Smith[7].\nSir W. J. RITCHIE C. J.\u2014I am of opinion that the appeal should be dismissed.\nSTRONG J.\u2014This is a suit in equity instituted by the respondents, who were plaintiffs in the court below, and who are respectively the mortgagor and mortgagees in a certain indenture of mortgage, dated the 29th of January 1874, whereby the respondent, Henry Hoste Swinney, mortgaged the lands in question, situate in New Brunswick, to the other respondents to secure a sum of $35,420, or thereabouts, together with interest. The mortgage contained a power of sale under which the mortgagees were authorized to sell in case of default.\nThe object of the suit is to set aside and have declared void an alleged sale in pursuance of this power of sale made in December, 1882, by the defendant Rice, assuming to act under a power of attorney from the mortgagees. The sale in question was made to the defendant Rodburn, the present appellant; it is alleged to have been made in November, 1882, and was carried out by a conveyance bearing date the 8th of November, 1882. The alleged consideration for this sale was $6,000, of which the appellant states he paid to Rice, the attorney of the mortgagees, $2,500 in cash and gave him for the balance of $3,500 a promissory note payable two months after date, which note the appellant now produces, swearing that he paid it at maturity to the Chemung Valley Bank, the holders of it. The bill, which offends against well established rales of equity pleading forbidding multifariousness and misjoinder, amalgamates at least two distinct equities,\u2014one that of the mortgagees to have the sale set aside as not having been made in conformity to the terms of the power of sale in the mortgage, a case in which the mortgagor alone is interested; and it further impeaches the sale as having been made by Rice, who was the attorney of the mortgagees only, in excess of the authority conferred upon him by his constituents. No effect was given to this objection to the pleading in the courts below, and it is only noticed now for the purpose of pointing out that there are thus two separate and distinct grounds for relief embraced in the same suit, which must, in considering the case, be kept separate.\nThe cause having come on to be heard before the judge in equity, pro confesso as regards Rice, the defendant Rodburn alone having answered, that learned judge directed certain issues to be tried before himself with a jury. On the trial of these issues a verdict was found for the appellant. On a motion for a new trial this verdict was set aside and a new trial was granted. Subsequently the learned judge discharged the order directing the issues, and the cause again came on before him, when he pronounced the decree which the Supreme Court has affirmed and which is now brought under appeal here. By this decree the conveyance of the 8th of November, 1882, was declared to be fraudulent and void, and was ordered to be set aside. From the order of the Supreme Court sitting in appeal, the present appeal to this court has been taken.\nThe objection to the sale as an undue exercise of the power conferred upon the mortgagees by the mortgage deed is that the notice required by the terms of the power was not given. The purchaser insists that he was not bound to see to this, and that he is protected against the objection by the express words of the deed. The judge in equity appears from his judgment, delivered when deciding the motion for a new trial, to have considered this objection established, and the full court, with the exception of Mr. Justice Tuck, appear to have, adopted all the reasons assigned by the judge of first instance. I do not, however, purpose to enter upon this part of the case, as it appears to me the present appeal can be decided in accordance with the views of both the courts below on a much plainer and shorter point.\nThe ground upon which the mortgagees impeach the sale is that their agent, Rice, and the purchaser, Rodburn, acted fraudulently and collusively in the matter of the sale; and further, that the power of attorney under which Rice acted conferred upon him no authority to make such a sale as he assumed to make. Upon this latter point the judge in equity, Mr. Justice Palmer, is very emphatic and distinct. In his judgment, delivered on the 22nd of September, 1885, that learned judge says upon this head:\u2014\nFourth.\u2014That Rice had no authority to take a note payable to himself and give time for payment, and the taking of it instead of money was a violation of his duty, and Rodburn was assisting in this and thereby assisting the agent to dispose of his principal's property, not for the benefit of such principal, but for the agent's own benefit.\nI have come to the conclusion that the last point is well taken, is unanswerable, and is decisive of the case. I take the law to be that when an agent parts with the property of his principal under such circumstances that the person purchasing it must be taken to know that it was sold, not for the benefit of the principal, but for the purpose of the agent selling it and disposing of it for his own benefit, the result is that the purchaser holds the property as if he himself were the agent of the principal.\nThis ground of decision was affirmed and acted upon by the Supreme Court on appeal, for Mr. Justice Fraser, in delivering the judgment of the majority, says:\nAs the judgment of the learned judge in equity will be printed in the report of the ease, I may say without quoting from it that I agree with the result he has reached and with the reasons therefor given by him.\nI agree with Mr. Justice Palmer and the Supreme Court that this objection to the validity of the sale is not susceptible of any answer. The letter of attorney under which Rice acted contains authority to sell, but not to sell upon credit. So much of the instrument as is relevant to the present question is contained in the following extract:\u2014\nTo enter and take possession, make sale and absolutely dispose of at any time, or from time to time, either by way of public auction or private contract, or partly in each such mode as he, in his discretion, may think fit, for the best price or prices that can be gotten for the same respectively, all or any part or parts of the freehold and other estates, lands, &c.\nIt needs no demonstration or argument to show that this authority is insufficient to warrant a sale upon credit such as that which was made by Rice to the appellant.\nAs to the terms of the sale actually made there can be no doubt, for we have it from the appellant himself that having paid Rice in cash only $2,500,\u2014the latter executed the absolute conveyance which has been put in evidence, dated the 8th of November, 1882, thus purporting to convey the land absolutely and without any real security when less than half the purchase money had been paid\u2014the residue of the price, $3,500, being secured merely by the promissory note of the appellant, payable to the order of Rice himself two months after date. Such a sale as this was entirely unauthorized by the only instrument to which Rice's authority can be referred\u2014the power of attorney of the 5th of April, 1877, already quoted from. It was, in the first place, a sale upon credit instead of for cash; and in the next place, even if there had been authority to sell upon credit, the security given for the unpaid portion of the purchase money was one to Rice himself, and a mere personal security, which, from its form, Rice could easily convert to his own use, as he in fact did by discounting it with the bank to whom the appellant afterwards paid it. There is nothing in the power of attorney exonerating a purchaser from seeing that its terms are properly pursued as regards the mode of selling. It does, it is true, contain a clause exonerating the purchaser from seeing to the application of the purchase money, but that is nothing to the purpose as regards the present question. The appellant was bound to see that Rice in selling kept within his powers. This he clearly did not do. It is no answer to this to say that the appellant afterwards in good faith paid the $3,500 which formed the residue of the purchase money to the holder of the promissory note which represented that amount. If the sale was not good as a proper exercise of the powers of agency conferred by the letter of attorney the day after the conveyance by which the sale was carried out was executed, it could not be made good by matter ex post facto; so that even if the cash had been paid at the maturity of the note to Rice himself, instead of to the bank with whom he had effected the discount of it, the result would have been just the same\u2014the sale would still have been unauthorized and invalid. Further, it is of no avail to say that the deed of conveyance thus being void is void at law, and therefore the interposition of equity to avoid the sale or to declare the deed a nullity was not requisite. The deed forms a cloud on the respondent's title, which alone justifies the resort to a court of equity to have it removed.\nTherefore, upon this ground the appeal ought to be dismissed, though in saying this I am far from meaning to imply any dissent from the other grounds upon which the judge in equity proceeded. As to them, I express no opinion.\nThe appeal must be dismissed with costs.\nFOURNIER, J.\u2014Concurred. Gwynne J.\u2014I entirely concur in the judgment prepared by my brother Strong in this case, to which I can add nothing, unless it be to say that there appears to me to be abundance in the evidence to justify the imputation that the conveyance by the defendant Rice to Rodburn was contrived fraudulently and collusively between them to indemnify or compensate Rodburn in respect of some transactions between them, which are only hinted at without the particulars being disclosed or being capable of being discovered. If the transaction had been a bon\u00e2 fide one it would have been Rodburn's interest to have produced the testimony of Rice which there is no doubt he could have done had he been so minded. In view of the facts which do appear, I do not think that Rodburn could reasonably expect a judgment in his favor, unless Rice should be produced as a witness on his behalf, and should be able to withstand a sifting cross-examination as to his dealings with Rodburn and the precise circumstances attending the execution of the conveyance to him. But instead of Rodburn attempting to support the purchase which he relies upon, by calling Rice as a witness on his own behalf, there seems, upon the evidence which we have, just ground for concluding that Rice's evidence was withheld in Rodburn's interest, in whose house he was when the commission under which Rodburn gave his evidence was being executed.\nPATTERSON J.\u2014Concurred.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellant: Gilbert & Straton.\nSolicitors for respondents: Rainsford & Black.\n[1] 6 Jur.

The attesting witness to C.'s execution of the bond, and the magistrate, each swore to the correctness of his own action, and that C. must have properly executed the bond or the affidavit would not have been made or the certificate given.\nHeld Per Ritchie C. J., Strong, Founder and Gwynne JJ., reversing the judgment of the court below, that the weight of evidence was in favor of the due execution of the bond by C.\nPer Patterson J., that C. was estopped from denying that he had executed the bond.\nHeld also, Per Patterson J., reversing the judgment of the court below, that the execution of the bond, and not the certificate of the magistrate, was the proximate, or real, cause of its acceptance by the crown.\nAppeal from a decision of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia[1] sustaining a verdict for the defendant at the trial.\nThe action in this case was on a bond given by one VanBlarcom as principal, and the defendant and another as sureties in the sum of $2,000 each, as security for the faithful discharge by VanBlarcom of his duties as agent of the government savings bank at Annapolis, N. S.\nBy 31 V. c. 37, as amended by 33 V. c. 5, certain officers of the Dominion Government are required to give security for the proper discharge of their duties, by means of an approved bond with sureties. The sureties are required to make affidavit that they are respectively possessed of real or personal estate, or both, of double the value of the amount for which they become surety, and the attesting witness to the execution of the bond must make affidavit of such execution before a justice of the peace. The bond, with the affidavits attached, is filed in the department of the Secretary of State.\nThe defendant, Chesley, gave the following account of the manner in which he executed the bond, having set out the same in one of his pleas:\u2014\n\"I live in Granville, 18 miles from Annapolis, by way of Bridgetown. In the winter of 1881 I was in Annapolis, and about leaving in the morning. On the previous evening VanBlarcom requested me to become surety on a bond to the extent of $500 or $1,000 with another person and himself. I refused. Next morning early I was in VanBlarcom's office; he again solicited me. Upon further persuasion I consented to his request. He then took from his desk a blank bond and laid it before me, and asked me to sign it, and he would fill it out as he had explained, that I should be responsible with himself and another for $1,000, and I could inspect it when called on to swear the affidavit attached. I placed my name where it is on the bond, hastily, and went by the train. There was no seal on it. There was no date, and nothing but the printed matter in the paper A. W. (affidavit of VanBlarcom for faithful service). VanBlarcom followed with the bond from his office, and said we must get a witness. Mr. Hall was a postal clerk on the train, and I said, \"Mr. Hall, that is my signature.\" I put my name to the blank affidavit, and never swore to it, and from the day I put my name there till VanBlarcom absconded I never saw the bond or affidavit. VanBlarcom agreed not to use the bond till filled up and shown to me.\n\"Cross-examined\u2014I often saw VanBlarcom and never asked him about the bond. I am a barrister of this court. I put the name on the condition that it would be filled up for $1,000. I did not read the printed matter. I may have read the affidavit\u2014the blank. I knew I would be required to swear the affidavit, and then I would have an opportunity of further examination. I am sure there were no seals.\"\nThe attesting witness proved his signature to the bond and to the affidavit of its execution, and testified as follows:\u2014\n\"I swore to the affidavit. I must have been present and saw the execution. I should say so. I should say that the affidavit was made at a time when the facts were fresh. I have no doubt about the matter.\n\"Cross-examined\u2014I have no recollection and I do not know where I saw Chesley sign. I only know from what I see on the paper. I live at Annapolis, and at the time of bond was mail clerk.\"\nThe justice before whom the affidavits were sworn gave the following evidence:\u2014\n\"These signatures, \"A. W. Corbett, J.P.,\" to the four affidavits, to papers A. W. and B. W. (the affidavit of VanBlarcom and the bond) are mine. It has been so long since the thing was done, and I kept no minute, that I have no recollection, but my name would not be there unless the parties affirmed or swore, and acknowledged their signatures, or made those signatures. I can't tell who wrote the affidavits.\n\"Cross-examined\u2014I have no recollection of the facts at all, and had none till I saw this paper last night Sometimes, if parties came in and acknowledged that they affirmed, that would do. Some parties swore, and some, if they acknowledged that they had sworn, I would sign.\n\"Re-examined\u2014To my knowledge, I have never so done it without the parties being present. I would not sign unless I saw the signature made, or it was certified that it had been made.\"\nIt was agreed at the trial that the question as to whether or not the defendant executed the bond should be first tried, and that of the breach of the conditions and amount due (if any) should be postponed.\nOn the above evidence the learned judge who tried the case, Mr. Justice Weatherbee, found as follows:\u2014\n\"That the printed form of bond and affidavit were signed in blank by defendant, the bond being at the time without seals, date or amount; and that the affidavit was never sworn; and that defendant only authorized the filling in of the sum of one thousand dollars.\"\n\"That the defendant was negligent in his conduct in so signing, and in neglecting to make enquiries afterwards as to the disposal of those papers.\"\n\"That the bond would not have been received by the officers of the crown without the certificate of the justice.\"\n\"That from defendant's conduct there is to be implied authority to VanBlarcom to affix a seal to the bond to plaintiff.\"\n\"That the careless and illegal act of the justice (though without fraudulent intent) in signing the certificate to the affidavit was promoted by reason of the name of the defendant, a barrister, being attached thereto.\"\n\"That the defendant was culpably negligent in not withholding his name from the affidavit till the same was ready for attestation, so as to guard against the possibility of illegal or fraudulent use of the affidavit form, especially as there was no object whatever in attaching his name until such attestation could be made before the justice.\"\nUpon these findings, Mr. Justice Weatherbee gave a verdict or judgment for the defendant, deciding that negligence might estop the party from denying that he executed a deed, but that such negligence must be the proximate and not the remote cause of the acceptance by the other party of such deed.\nThe Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, the Chief Justice dissenting, sustained this verdict. The plaintiff then appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nBorden for the appellant referred to Coventry v. The Great Eastern Railway Co.[2]\nHarrington Q.C. for the respondent. The facts have been found in our favor by the trial court and the appeal court of Nova Scotia, and will not be questioned by this court. Ungley v. Ungley[3]; Gray v. Turnbull[4]; Allen v. Quebec Warehouse Co.[5]; Metropolitan Railway Co. v. Wright[6]; Webster v. Friedeberg[7].\nThe negligence was not the proximate cause of the bond being accepted. Swan v. North British Australasian Co.[8].\nOn the question of estoppel the learned counsel cited Taylor v. The Great Indian Peninsular Ry. Co.[9] The Bank of Ireland v. The Trustees of Evans' Charities[10].\nBorden in reply cited, as to the findings on the facts, Cross v. Cross[11]; Bigsby v. Dickinson[12]; Jones v. Hough[13]; The Glannibanta[14]; Sovereign Fire Insurance Co. v. Moir[15].\nAs to estoppel. Re North of England Joint Stock Banking Co.[16]; Stewart v. Boak[17]; Seton v. Lafone[18]; Easton v. London Joint Stock Bank[19]; Williams v. Colonial Bank[20].\nAnd on the facts see Hunter v. Walters[21].\nSir W. J. RITCHIE C.J. concurred in the judgments allowing the appeal.\nSTRONG J.\u2014I am of opinion that we must allow this appeal. The bond is regularly proved by Samuel Hall, the subscribing witness. His evidence is short, and is as follows:\u2014\nSamuel Hall\u2014Proves his signature to bond B. and to the affidavit on the back. I swore to the affidavit. I must have been present and saw the execution. I should say so. I should say that the affidavit was made at a time when the facts were fresh. I have no doubt about the matter.\nCross-examined\u2014I have no recollection, and I do not know where I saw Chesley sign. I only know from what I see on the paper. I live at Annapolis, and at the time of bond was mail clerk.\nThen the deposition of Mr. Corbett, the justice of the peace whose signature is appended to the jurats of the affidavit of execution purporting to have been sworn to by Hall, and to the affidavit of justification purporting to have been sworn to by the defendant, is to the following effect:\u2014\nA. W. Corbett\u2014I reside at Annapolis, and am a justice of the peace. Have been so for twenty years. (Proves the signature of H. H. Van Blarcom to paper A. W. also signatures of H. H. VanBlarcom, Lawrence Delap and T. W. Chesley to paper B. W. and the signatures of Lawrence Delap and T. W. Chesley an affidavit annexed to B. W.). These signatures \"A. W. Corbett, J. P.\" to the four affidavits to papers A. W. and B.W. are mine. It has been so long since the thing was done, and I kept no minute, that I have no recollection; but my name would not be there unless the parties affirmed or swore, and acknowledged their signatures or made those signatures. I can't tell who wrote the affidavits.\nCross-examined.\u2014I have no recollection of the facts at all, and had none till I saw this paper last night. Sometimes if parties came in and acknowledged that they affirmed that would do. Some parties swore, and some, if they acknowledged that they had sworn, I would sign.\nRe-examined.\u2014To my knowledge I have never so done it without the parties being present. I would not sign unless I saw the signature made, or it was certified that it had been made.\nThe signatures of the defendant and Hall to the bond and affidavits are thus proved and not disputed. This constituted regular and entirely sufficient proof of the making of the bond on the issue of \"non est factum.\"\nAgainst this we have nothing but the evidence of the defendant himself, who says he signed the bond in blank; that he authorized VanBlarcom to fill it up for $ 1,000 only, instead of the actual amount of $2,000 now appearing on its face; that the bond was in blank when Hall attested it\u2014and further, that neither of the affidavits were ever sworn to, and that Corbett must consequently have signed the jurats irregularly and have falsely certified that the respective deponents swore to the affidavits before him.\nAlthough the learned judge who tried the case has found for the defendant I am unable to acquiesce in this finding. The defence depends wholly and exclusively on the direct testimony of the defendant himself, and I cannot agree that a party, who admits that his signature appended to a solemn instrument like this bond is in his own handwriting, can discharge himself in the way attempted here in the face of such proof as we have from the subscribing witness and the magistrate who took the affidavit of execution and justification. Had there been any circumstantial evidence confirmatory of the defendant's account the case might have been different but there is no such proof. Are we then, upon the mere denial and statement of the defendant, the party interested, and without the least circumstance confirming it,\u2014to conclude that Mr. Hall, the witness, who swears that he must have been present and have seen the execution, and who says he swore to the execution when the matter was fresh, and Mr. Corbett who says his name would not appear affixed to the affidavits if the parties had not sworn them in his presence, and also either signed or acknowledged their signatures in his presence\u2014are we to conclude on the mere oath of the defendant himself that these two gentlemen, who it is not pretended had any interest in the matter, were each of them parties not merely to what would be a deliberate fraud upon the crown, but also to what would amount, at least in the case of one of them\u2014Mr. Corbett, the magistrate, and probably in the case of both\u2014to an indictable offence? I think sound public policy requires us to say that a party who admits his signature to a deed or bond cannot be permitted to exonerate himself in this way on his own unsupported oath, by swearing to its irregular and insufficient execution, in the face of the evidence of disinterested parties sufficiently proving that execution.\nI think it, too, more consistent with probability, and altogether a more just inference from the evidence, to conclude that the defendant is mistaken in his recollection of the circumstances attending the execution of the bond, than that Mr. Hall and Mr. Corbett were guilty of the gross irregularities which the defendant imputes to them. I say nothing about estoppel. I proceed entirely on the weight of evidence, which, in my opinion, is overwhelming.\nThe appeal must be allowed with costs, and judgment entered in the court below for the crown with costs, FOURNIER J.\u2014Concurred.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014The proper conclusion to arrive at upon the evidence, in my opinion, is that when the bond was acknowledged by the respondent in the presence of the witness Hall it was in the condition in which it now is. Hall, immediately after such acknowledgment testified upon his oath to the due execution of it by the respondent, and he has no doubt whatever upon the subject\u2014that the bond was originally signed in blank by the respondent, as he swears it was; but, as he admits, VanBlarcom followed him to the train for the express purpose of getting the bond acknowledged in the presence of a witness; for this purpose I can entertain no doubt that VanBlarcom had in the meantime filled in the blanks in the instrument and made it perfect, and followed the respondent to the train to get him to re-execute the bond in the presence of a witness who could swear to such execution, and that thereupon the respondent went before the witness Hall and acknowledged the signature now at the foot of a perfected instrument to be his signature. The time as to which the respondent speaks of the instrument not having been perfected, no doubt must be when he first set his signature to the incompleted instrument, for there would be no sense whatever in acknowledging his signature before a witness unless the instrument was then complete, and the witness before whom he acknowledged the instrument has no doubt that it was. It would be senseless in the extreme that the respondent, himself a lawyer, should go through the form of acknowledging before a person called upon to assume the position of a subscribing witness to the execution of an instrument, that a signature to a paper with a number of blanks in it not filled up, and so utterly defective, was his signature. If the respondent executed the bond, as I have no doubt, upon the evidence, that he did, that is all that is necessary to decide. The appeal must be allowed with costs, and judgment be rendered for the crown in the action.\nPATTERSON J.\u2014This is an action against the defendant as one of the sureties for one VanBlarcom in a bond dated the 25th day of January, 1881, made in the form given in 35 Vic. ch. 19, to secure the due performance of VanBlarcom's duties as saving's bank agent at Annapolis.\nThe security was given in pursuance of 31 Vic. ch. 37, the 3rd section of which had been twice amended with regard to the affidavit of execution and the affidavits of justification to be made by the sureties, and the registration and custody of the bond, and was to be read from 43 Vic. ch. 3, at the time of the execution of this bond.\nThe parties to the bond were VanBlarcom, the principal, and the defendant and one Lawrence Delap as sureties, each of the three parties being bound in the sum of $2,000, for the payment of which sums they bound themselves severally, and not jointly or each for the other.\nThe statute required the bond to be proved as to the due execution and delivery of the same by an affidavit of an attesting witness made before a justice of the peace, and also required every surety to make an affidavit of justification in the form given or to the effect thereof; and that the bond, with the several affidavits, should be recorded at full length in the department of the Secretary of State of Canada, and the original bond and affidavits to be deposited, after registration, in the same department.\nIt is the duty of the Secretary of State, under section 15, to cause to be prepared for the information of parliament, within fifteen days after the opening of every session, a detailed statement of all bonds and securities registered at his office, and of any changes and entries that have been made in reference to the names and residence of any sureties, and of the amounts in which they have become severally liable, since the period of the previous return submitted to parliament.\nThe act under which the savings banks were established, 34 Vic ch. 6, required every agent to promise on oath to faithfully perform his duties.\nThe bond in this case is on a printed form, which gave also blank affidavits for the principal, subscribing witness and sureties.\nThe four affidavits purport to have been made on the day of the date of the bond, the 25th of January, 1881, before A. W. Corbett, J.P., at Annapolis.\nIt is unnecessary to refer to the pleadings, because it was agreed at the trial that the question to be tried was Mr. Chesley's execution of the bond or his liability to pay anything under it in case the breach of the condition should be proved, the trial of that issue being postponed.\nFor the crown the bond and affidavits were produced. Mr. C. J. Anderson, the chief of the savings bank branch of the Finance department, spoke of the bond only from the entries he looked at and not from recollection of the particular paper. He says he sent the blank form to VanBlarcom and received the bond through the post. He says it was received by him on the 22nd February, 1881, but I do not feel clear, from reading the note of his evidence, whether that, which he read from an indorsement on the bond, was the first receipt of it, or the receipt of it for filing after it had been registered in the department of the Secretary of State. By the act of 1880 it ought to have remained in that department, though I should gather from what Mr. Anderson is reported to have said that the former statutes, which required the securities after registration to be deposited in the finance department continued to be acted on. The other witnesses for the crown were Mr. Corbett, the J.P., and Mr. Hall, the attesting witness. I shall read their evidence, which is short:\u2014(See pp. 308 & 309).\nOpposed to this there is only the testimony of the defendant himself. The main question is whether it should be taken to rebut the case made for the crown. (His Lordship read defendant's evidence set out on page 307)\nThe learned judge who tried the issue without a jury gave credence to the defendant's account, and after discussing the question whether the defendant was estopped by his conduct from denying that the bond was his deed, and answering that question in the negative, he gave judgment for the defendant, which judgment was affirmed by a majority of the court, the Chief Justice dissenting.\nThe following are the trial judge's findings of fact:\u2014 (See p. 309).\nI do not understand the dissent of the learned Chief Justice to have involved any difference in opinion from the trial judge upon the facts found,\u2014on the contrary, he says the findings were not attacked\u2014but to have turned on the question of estoppel. The majority of the court, whose opinions were expressed by Mr. Justice Smith, appear to have inclined to the opinion that the defendant would be estopped if the negligence imputed to him had been the proximate cause of the acceptance of the bond by the government, but they considered the proximate cause to have been the magistrate's false certificate that the defendant had been sworn before him. The Chief Justice, dissenting from that understanding of the part played by the certificate, and agreeing with the other members of the court on the general doctrine of estoppel, was of opinion against the defendant.\nMy impression is that, had I been trying the case, I should have given more weight than seems to have been given to the intrinsic improbabilities and other considerations, some of which I may allude to further on, which appear to me to tell against the defendant's version of the making of the bond. Still, it is proper to bear in mind that there are sometimes matters of local knowledge understood by the persons concerned in the trial which influence the verdict without finding their way into the notes of the evidence.\nFor example, the fact stated by the Chief Justice to be admitted that the condition of the bond was violated by the misconduct of the officer does not appear in any formal manner, nor does the fact, freely spoken of, that VanBlarcom absconded. He is alleged in the declaration to have held office till the 12th of May, 1881. Mr. Anderson says that he was at Annapolis in May, 1881, and had the bond there. We may fairly infer that he was there in consequence of the absconding of VanBlarcom, and, that being at so early a date, less than three months from the time the bond first reached his hands, it is somewhat remarkable that we hear nothing of any communication at that time with the defendant, because his repudiation of liability would naturally have led to some reference to Mr. Hall and Mr. Corbett, whose recollection could scarcely have failed them so much as it did when in the witness box three years and a half later. Under all the circumstances it cannot be said that any sufficiently clear ground has been made to appear for disturbing the findings of fact. The decision of the appeal must therefore turn, as did the judgments in the court below, on the question of estoppel.\nThere are two propositions formulated by Lord Esher in Carr v. London and N. W. Ry. Co.[22] one or both of which will furnish the test of the application of the doctrine to the facts as found by the judge and as admitted by the defendant. One proposition, which is found at p. 307, is that if a man, whatever his real meaning may be, so conducts himself that a reasonable man would take his conduct to mean a certain representation of facts, and that it was a true representation, and that the latter was intended to act upon it in a particular way, and he with such belief does act in that way to his damage, the first is estopped from denying that the facts were as represented; and the other[23] that if, in the transaction itself which is in dispute, one has led another into the belief of a certain state of facts by conduct of culpable negligence calculated to have that result, and such culpable negligence has been the proximate cause of leading, and has led, the other to act by mistake upon such belief, to his prejudice, the second cannot be heard afterwards, as against the first, to show that the state of facts referred to did not exist.\nSee also The Mayor, Constables and Company of the Merchants of the Staple of England v. The Bank of England[24] for a very late judgment of Lord Esher.\nIt has to be assumed for the purpose of the branch of the case involved in this appeal, which is, by arrangement, to be decided before the investigation of VanBlarcom's dealings in his office is entered upon, that VanBlarcom is a defaulter, and that the government was prejudiced by accrediting him as agent.\nThe difference of opinion in the court below arose from the different views taken of what was the proximate cause of that action of the government.\nThe majority of the court held it to be the affidavits of justification attached to the bond and falsely certified by the magistrate to have been sworn before him, while the Chief Justice considered it was the bond itself, the proof of the pecuniary responsibility of the sureties being a collateral matter not affecting the legal validity of the security, and which might have been dispensed with without prejudicing any remedy on the bond, although the departmental officials would have failed in their duty if they had accepted the bond without the affidavits.\nI think the view of the Chief Justice is the correct view. That of the majority of the court seems to have been influenced by attaching too literal a significance to the word \"proximate\" as used in one of the propositions I have quoted.\nLord Esher explained in Seton v. Lafone[25] that he had taken the word from the judgment in the case of Swan v. N. B. Australasian Co.[26], and that the word was there used as meaning the real cause, and he expressed his preference, in which Bowen L. J. joined him, for the word \"real\" as more accurate than the word \"proximate,\" while Fry L.J. said that he did not feel sure that the term \"real\" was any more free from difficulty than the word \"proximate.\"\nWhat was to be done here was to obtain from VanBlarcom a bond with two sureties for the prescribed amounts. It might have afforded some assistance upon the issue of fact relating to the actual execution of the bond to have known the terms of the order fixing the amount of security required from VanBlarcom, perhaps as a means of checking the defendant's statement that $500 or $1,000 was the amount named to him.\nThat is one particular in which there seems to have been slackness in bringing out all that might have thrown light on the investigation. We must for our present purpose assume that the bond required was the bond that was furnished. The real cause of the accrediting of VanBlarcom as agent was the furnishing of that bond, and, taking that to be so, the question is whether under the evidence the defendant can be heard to deny that it is his deed. On this form of the question the unanimous opinion of the court below is against him.\nI think we should give effect to that opinion by allowing the appeal and reversing the judgment which proceeded upon the erroneous conception of the proximate cause.\nI assume of course that the affidavit of execution was untrue as well as the magistrate's certificate to the other affidavit, but I do not assume that Hall did not swear before the magistrate to the execution of the bond. His affidavit as produced to the department conformed to the requirement of the statute respecting proof of the execution, and I take the true effect of the defendant's own statement to be that Hall, in making the affidavit, did precisely what the defendant intended that he should do.\nThe defendant is a barrister and must be credited with the knowledge of the mode in which these things are done. When he acknowledged his signature before Hall in order that Hall should attest the bond as witness, he did an act which I should, if trying the case, have considered so inconsistent with his statement that there was no seal to the paper as to make a strong demand on my credulity when asked to find that there was no seal. But, at all events, he said in effect to Hall: \"I have executed this paper which requires an attesting witness who shall swear to its due execution. You are to be the witness and to make the affidavit.\"\nHis signature of the affidavit of justification, at the time and under the circumstances, is nearly as hard to reconcile with his denial, implied if not expressed, of connivance at the irregularity of Corbett's proceeding, or even of procuring Corbett to act as he did. It is true that he says he relied upon having an opportunity of seeing that the blanks had been filled up as he had agreed that they should be filled up, when he should have the bond before him for the purpose of swearing to the affidavits. But that theory gives no reasonable explanation of his signing the affidavit, or even of his signing the deed itself, at the time. Confining ourselves, however, to Hall and his affidavit, there can be no other conclusion than that nothing further was intended to be done towards the more complete execution of the deed, in the presence of Hall, and that Hall was intended to make affidavit of the due execution of a completed instrument\u2014in fact to make the affidavit which he did make as the statutable proof of the execution.\nThe case of Awde v. Dixon[27] was mentioned during the argument, I think, by one of my learned brothers. In that case an agent had exceeded his authority by filling up a promissory note for too large an amount. The court did not say whether or not a forgery had been committed, but dealt with the case on the question of authority, not, however, ignoring the liability of the principal to be estopped from denying the authority of the agent.\nA party who takes such an incomplete instrument, Parke B. observed, \"cannot recover upon it unless the person from whom he receives it had a real authority to deal with it. There was no such authority in this case, and unless the circumstances show that the defendant conducted himself in such a way as to lead the plaintiff to believe that the defendant's brother had authority, he can take no better title than the defendant's brother could give.\"\nIt was argued for the defendant that the principle of estoppel in pais does not apply to preclude a man from denying the execution of a deed.\nThe argument overlooks the essential principle of estoppel which is to prevent the assertion that the fact is contrary to the party's representation in reliance on which another has changed his position to his prejudice, and the fact of the execution of a deed does not differ, in view of this principle, from any other fact.\nThe authority mainly relied upon in support of the argument was Swan v. N. B. Australasian Co.[28]. That case may not inaccurately be said to contain all the law upon the subject, but I understand it to discredit, in place of supporting, the wide proposition for which it is appealed to.\nIt is undoubted law that authority to execute a deed for another cannot be conferred by parol, and that a deed executed with blanks left for material parts which are afterwards filled up by an agent whose authority has not been conferred by deed is void. But that doctrine must not be confounded, as I think has been done in the argument, with the principle of estoppel. The doctrine was firmly settled by Hibblewhite v. McMorine[29], which was approved in the House of Lords in the recent case of Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de Paris v. Walker[30]; but when the same deed which was in question in Hibblewhite v. McMorine was attacked on the same ground of imperfect execution in Sheffield Railway Co. v. Woodcock[31], which was an action for calls, it was held binding by estoppel. The court refused a rule nisi on the point of the invalidity of the deed, Parke B. observing[32]:\nThe defendant held out false colours to induce the company to register him as a proprietor, and therefore to bring this action against him. It is a universal rule of law, that when a party makes a representation to another whereby the situation of the latter is altered he is bound thereby.\nIn Everest and Strode on Estoppel[33] Swan's case is discussed at some length, and it is said that the majority of the judges who gave opinions held that the doctrine of estoppel by executing instruments in blank is confined to negotiable instruments and does not apply to deeds.\nThe general form in which the learned authors express this proposition may, perhaps, be misleading. The opinions on which it is founded do not go farther than to hold that the fact of executing a deed in blank is not by itself such a representation as will work an estoppel, while all the judges without exception concede that the principle of estoppel applies to deeds.\nThe case came first before the courts on an application to the Common Pleas to rectify the company's register; Ex parte Swan[34]. The subject of estoppel was touched upon by all the judges who delivered opinions. Erle C.J. said[35]:\u2014\nNow although the deeds of transfer as between Swan and Oliver were null and void, yet as between Swan and a purchaser for value on the faith that they were valid, they may be valid to pass the property, if not directly, yet indirectly by estopping Swan from setting up his right against such purchaser.\nAgain[36]:\nThe principal whose negligence has enabled his agent to cheat a third party acting with ordinary caution is universally estopped from denying the authority of the agent.\nFurther on, referring to the case of the Bank of Ireland v. Evans' Charities[37], he said:\nLord Cranworth, in giving judgment, explains the case of Young v. Grote[38] by the estoppel of a principal from denying his authority to an agent, where his negligence has enabled the agent to cheat a person acting with ordinary caution. In Ireland and in the House of Lords this rule of law was treated as applicable to deeds as well as to negotiable instruments; and the judgment of the House of Lords, holding that the negligence was not proximate, by implication holds that if it had been so between these parties the false deed would have been valid.\nKeating J. made observations to the same effect. Williams J. and Willes J. took a different view, but, as I understand the judgments, only as to the signature in blank being itself sufficient to estop. They thought it would be inconvenient to carry the principle of Young v. Grote[39] beyond negotiable instruments, Williams J. using this illustration:\nIf a man were induced to sign, seal, and deliver to his attorney a deed of conveyance with the parcels in blank upon the understanding that it should be filled up by a description of estate A, it would surely be difficult to contend that if the attorney were fraudulently to fill up the blank by a description of estate B, the latter would pass to a bon\u00e2 fide purchaser who paid for the estate on the supposition that he was buying the latter estate.\nWilles J. said:\nAs a general rule no one can found a title upon a forgery. The doctrine adopted in Young v. Grote (1) as to negotiable instruments which form part of the currency has never yet been extended to conveyances by deed of land or other property. I am unwilling to be the first to do so.\nIn the Exchequer in Swan v. N. B. Australasian Co.[40], Wilde B. said[41]:\nIt has been further contended by some that the doctrine of estoppel does not apply to the case of instruments under seal. I have great difficulty in appreciating this as applied to the case in hand. Greater effect and more solemn sanction has always been yielded by the law to deeds than to parol instruments\u2014notably so in ancient times. Whether in the present day there is any practical benefit in preserving this distinction I do not stop to inquire, for there is no question here of invalidating or impeaching a deed by estoppel. The case sets out with a deed of transfer by the plaintiff. It is the plaintiff who avers it to be void; and the doctrine of estoppel, so far as it intervenes at all, is called in aid to support the deed, not to impeach it. Whatever the superior sanction or extra force of a deed may be, the estoppel in this case, so far from coming into conflict with it, is in harmony with it; and it is difficult to see why, if a man is restrained or estopped from repudiating a parol transfer, he should be less restrained by the same estoppel from repudiating a solemn transfer by deed.\nPollock C.B. concurred with the judgment of Wilde B. Martin B. and Channell B. held that there was no estoppel in the case, but on the ground that it would be worked only by some representation made by statement or by conduct of what was untrue, and not by negligence only. This will appear from a short extract from each of their judgments. Martin B.[42]:\nThose are the cases which have been cited, and I think it may be said with certainty that there is not one of them, which is an authority for the proposition, that when a deed is not the deed of the party he may be estopped by negligence or carelessness on his part from being permitted to aver that it is not.\nAnd Channell B.[43]:\nIn all cases of the kind of estoppel we are now called upon to consider, the party has, I conceive, either himself made, or authorized to be made, a statement of fact, untrue, or he has conducted himself so as to give rise to the belief of a fact not true.\nI call attention to this dictum as very closely applicable to the conduct of the present defendant.\nIn the Exchequer Chamber[44] Mellor J., referring to the judgment delivered by Wilde B. in the court below, said[45]:\nThere are also cases in which \"when a man has wilfully made a false assertion calculated to lead others to act upon it, and they have done so to their prejudice, he is forbidden, as against them, to deny that assertion.\" Whilst I and my brother Wilde entirely assent to that proposition, I hesitate as to the next, \"that if a man has led others into the belief of a certain state of facts by conduct of culpable neglect calculated to have that result, and they have acted on that belief to their prejudice, he shall not be heard afterwards, as against such persons, to shew that that state of facts did not exist.\" Assuming for the purposes of this case both these propositions to be true, I agree that they extend to transactions in which a deed is required to transfer an interest or a right, not by validating a void deed, as was supposed on the argument, but by holding that parties shall not be permitted to aver, against equity and good faith, the invalidity of a deed which, either by words or conduct, they have asserted to be valid, and upon which the others have acted:[46] He then examined the facts and held that the judgment below should be affirmed on the ground that negligence in the particular transaction had not been shown to have caused the loss. Keating J. holding that the negligence had been established, said:\nThat a party may so estop himself, even in the case of a deed, although denied in the courts below, has not been argued in this court, and I shall therefore content myself by referring to the judgment of the Chief Justice in ex parte Swan, and of my brother Wilde in this case in the Court of Exchequer in support of that position, merely adding that I am not aware of any decision which counteracts it.\nBlackburn J. held[47] that to preclude a party from denying that a document is his deed, his conduct must\nCome within the limits so carefully laid down by Parke B. in delivering the judgment of the Court of Exchequer in Freeman v. Cooke[48].\nAnd Byles J. said[49] that the position that mere negligence of an alleged grantor may estop him from showing that an instrument purporting to be his deed, is not his deed, is both novel and dangerous. Willes J. merely expressed his concurrence in the judgment of the majority of the court which was against the existence of the negligence relied on in the case. Crompton J. was of opinion that the conduct of the plaintiff was not such as to prevent him from setting up the truth according to the rule laid down in Freeman v. Cooke (2); and Cockburn C. J. also discussed the subject of the estoppel with reference to the principle of the decisions in Pickard v. Sears[50] and Freeman v. Cooke (2) coming to the conclusion that negligence alone, although it may have afforded an opportunity for the perpetration of a forgery by means of which another party has been damnified, is not of itself a ground of estoppel, and being also of opinion that negligence had not been established. I have gone to the trouble of making these extracts, not only for the purpose of demonstrating the consensus of opinion in favor of the appicability of the ordinary doctrine of estoppel to the fact of the execution of a deed in the same way as to any other fact; but also to show that a majority of the judges who took part in the decision cannot with accuracy be said to have held opinions opposed to such estoppel being capable of being worked by culpable negligence.\nOn that side of the question, there are no doubt the names of Cockburn C.J., of Blackburn J. and of Martin and Channell BB. Perhaps Crompton J. should also be counted. On the other side, we must place Erle C.J., Pollock C.B., Keating and Mellor JJ. and Wilde B. I think we should add to these Williams and Willes JJ. for they went no farther, as I understand their utterances, than to hold that the mere fact of executing a deed in blank is not such negligence as will estop.\nSome American cases were also relied on. They could of course have little influence if opposed to what I have shown to be the course of English opinion, but they do not in themselves bring much aid to the defendant's argument.\nThe case that seems most in point, as far as regards its leading facts, is United States v. Nelson[51] decided in 1822 by Chief Justice Marshall in Virginia. A surety for a paymaster there had executed his bond in blank, and was held not bound by it though it had been filled up exactly as he intended it to be. The facts are not so strong as in this case, but would nevertheless have been quite sufficient, as one would think, to estop the party who certainly executed the bond with the intention of its being used to procure credit for his principal. The principles of estoppel, though of course familiar at the time, had not been so systematically stated as they have been in the series of cases beginning with Pickard v. Sears[52] which was decided in 1837. The case was not decided by Chief Justice Marshall with reference to those principles, and it is opposed to the judgment of Chief Justice Parsons in the earlier case of Smith v. Crooker[53]\nPreston v. Hull[54] decided in Virginia in 1873, which was also much relied on, was the case of a bond executed with a blank for the name of the obligee which was intended to be filled up with the name of a person from whom the obligor's agent expected to obtain a loan of money for the obligor. He did not get the money from that person, but got it from another and inserted the lender's name in the blank. It was simply a question of authority. Staples J. concluded his judgment by saying:\u2014\nIn truth the doctrine of estoppel has no application to the case. The party advancing the money is put on his guard by the face of the paper. He sees that it is not a deed and he is bound at his peril to inquire into the authority of the agent to make it a deed. It cannot be justly said that he has been deceived by the party whose signature is attached to the writing.\nThe result is that both of the propositions which I have quoted from Carr v. London & N. W. Ry. Co.[55] apply to the allegation of estoppel with regard to the execution of deeds, and the evidence brings the defendant within them both.\nI have not dwelt upon the evidence as establishing culpable negligence, because that aspect of it was fully and properly dealt with in the court below. I add to the observations there made what I have said as to the active conduct of the defendant in procuring, as in effect he did, the attesting witness to make the affidavit of execution. He directly led to the acceptance of the bond by the department and cannot now be heard to deny its validity.\nThe appeal should be allowed with costs and the rule made absolute for judgment for the crown on the question debated at the trial.\nThe costs below, both of the trial and of the proceedings before the court in banco, should follow the result of the action, but that result will not be known until the conduct of VanBlarcom has been inquired into.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for appellant: Wallace Graham.\nSolicitor for respondent: C.

McK. & Co. and McK. & M. In an action against McK. & M. for goods sold and delivered it appeared on the trial that the goods were ordered by McK. and shipped to the place of business of McK. & M., but were charged in plaintiff's books to C. McK. & Co., which he said was done at McK's. request. McK., called as a witness for plaintiff, corroborated this, and on cross-examination he produced, subject to objection, the books of C. McK. & Co., in which these goods were credited to that firm. A verdict was given for the defendant M.\nHeld, reversing the judgment of the court below, that the books of C. McK. & Co. were properly in evidence on the cross-examination of McK. and the rule for a new trial should be discharged.\nAppeal from a decision of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick[1] setting aside a verdict for the defendant and ordering a new trial.\nThe action in this case was for goods sold and delivered, and the defence was that the credit was given to a third party. The facts were briefly as follows:\u2014\nThe appellant, Miller, and one McKean, who was also a defendant in the suit, carried on a lumbering business in Economy, N.S. McKean was also a member of the firm of Carvill, McKean & Co., of St John, N.B.\nThe goods in question were brought by McKean for the lumbering business of McKean & Miller. They were charged in the plaintiff's books to Carvill, McKean & Co., and the plaintiff had taken a note of Carvill, McKean & Co., in payment of a portion of them.\nWhen these facts came out on the trial the plaintiff explained that the entries in the books were made in this way at the request of McKean, and the note was taken by the plaintiff also at McKean's request, and for the accommodation of McKean & Miller.\nThe defendant, McKean, was examined on behalf of the plaintiff, and gave evidence to the effect that he had purchased the goods\" for himself and Miller. On behalf of the defence the books of Carvill, McKean & Co. were put in evidence, subject to objection, to show that the goods in question were entered in those books as received from the plaintiff and forwarded to Economy.\nA verdict was given for the defendant and a new trial was moved for, on the grounds that the evidence of these books, and that of Carvill, McKean & Co.'s book-keeper, were improperly admitted, and that the verdict was against evidence and misdirection. A new trial was granted, the reason for the judgment stating that it was on the ground that the said evidence was improperly admitted. The defendant appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada from the order for a new trial.\nWeldon Q.C. and C. A. Palmer for the appellant.\nMcLeod Q.C. and A. S. White for the respondent\nSir W. J. RITCHIE C.J.\u2014Was of opinion that the appeal should be allowed.\nSTRONG J.\u2014Concurred in the judgment of Mr. Justice Patterson. TASCHEREAU J.\u2014I concur with Mr. Justice Gwynne, and, for the reasons given by him, I think that this appeal should be allowed.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014This case was eminently one for a jury to determine, and the precise point in the case which was submitted to them was stated by the learned Chief Justice who tried the case, in a manner which admitted of no mistake, in a charge as to which no just ground of complaint, in my opinion, has been, or could be, reasonably made.\nThe jury who tried the case appear to have paid the greatest attention to the trial, so much so as to draw forth this observation from the learned Chief Justice: \"I shall not take up a great deal of your time, for I saw that you paid great attention to the evidence as the case progressed. Many of you are, perhaps, commercial men and so you could apply it\" (that is your attention) to the case as it went along.\nThe action was brought against Henry U. Miller and George McKean for goods alleged by the plaintiff to have been sold and delivered to them. The defendants were partners, in a certain business carried on by them at a place called Economy, in Nova Scotia; the defendants both resided at St. John, New Brunswick, where the defendant McKean was managing partner of a lumbering firm of Carvill, McKean & Co., in which firm Miller had no interest. The goods in question were purchased by McKean, and the firm of Carvill, McKean & Co. having become insolvent a question arose whether the goods had been sold, and credit given, to the firm of Carvill, McKean & Co., or to Miller & McKean. The defendant, Miller, pleaded never indebted and payment; the defendant McKean pleaded never indebted only, but made no defence. The plaintiff gave testimony to the effect that the goods were sold to Miller & McKean, although they were invoiced to Carvill, McKean & Co., and entered both in the books of the plaintiff and of Carvill, McKean & Co. as sold to them; and although Carvill, McKean & Co.'s note for the amount was given to the plaintiff, this entry in the plaintiff's books to Carvill, McKean & Co., and the giving of their note by McKean, was stated by the plaintiff to have been an arrangement made at the special request of McKean, although the sale was in fact made to Miller & McKean, and the goods were shipped to their place of business in Nova Scotia. The plaintiff was submitted to a strict cross-examination upon this his evidence. He called also as a witness on his behalf the defendant, McKean, who also swore, in support of the plaintiff's evidence, that the sale had been to Miller & McKean. This witness was also subjected to a strict cross-examination upon certain entries in the books of Carvill, McKean & Co., kept under his direction and control, which were insisted upon as discrediting certain material evidence given by McKean in his oral examination. This reference to the books of Carvill, McKean & Co., and the examination of McKean in relation to such entries therein, was objected to by the plaintiff's counsel as not being properly admissible in evidence, and a verdict having been rendered for the defendant, and that objection renewed, on a motion to set aside the verdict and for a new trial, the court set aside the verdict and ordered a new trial to take place; and from the order granting the new trial this appeal is taken.\nThere can, I think, be no doubt that the examination of McKean upon the entries in the books of Carvill, McKean & Co. was quite admissible for the purpose for which those entries were used, namely, of testing the proper weight to be attached to McKean's oral testimony upon the main point at issue\u2014which was, whether the plaintiff had sold the goods and given credit to Carvill, McKean & Co., or to Miller & McKean. The fact that those entries accorded with entries in the plaintiff's own books purporting to represent the sale as having been made to Carvill, McKean & Co. was one which could not be withheld from the jury; and the learned Chief Justice did not fail to draw their attention to the matter in a manner which was wholly free from objection. The appeal, therefore, in my opinion, must be allowed with costs, and the verdict of the jury restored, and the rule for a new trial be ordered to be discharged with costs.\nPATTERSON J.\u2014This appeal is from a rule granting a new trial on the motion of the plaintiff, White. The defendant, Miller, appeals. There are one or two questions raised by way of objection to the charge to the jury, but the principal point, and the one on which the new trial has been ordered, relates to the admissibility of certain evidence.\nMiller, the defendant, carried on a lumber business in St. John, under the firm of Miller & Woodman, but that business is not involved in any way in the action. McKean also lived at St. John, where he managed the business, which was that of shippers of lumber, of the English firm of Carvill, McKean & Co., and he was a member of that firm.\nMiller and McKean individually carried on at Economy, in Nova Scotia, where they had saw mills, the business of manufacturers of lumber. The establishment at Economy was in charge of James Miller, a son of the defendant. Supplies for the establishment were purchased in St. John from the plaintiff. This action is to recover the price of those supplies. It is not resisted by McKean, but it is resisted by Miller, on the ground that the supplies, which were purchased by McKean personally or by clerks of Carvill, McKean & Co., were sold on the credit of Carvill, McKean & Co., and not to Miller & McKean. It is not disputed that the goods were bought for the purpose of being used in the Economy establishment, or that they were actually used there, but the contention of the defendant Miller is that the concern in which he was partner got them from Carvill, McKean & Co., and not directly from the plaintiff. The occasion for the contest arises, as is usually the case, from the insolvency of some one. Carvill, McKean & Co. having failed, it is important for the plaintiff to maintain, if he can, his recourse against Miller. The desire of Miller to escape personal liability needs no explanation. It is apparently a fair contest on both sides, with, perhaps, as part of the evidence seems to indicate, some complication of interests other than those of the nominal parties.\nThe contention of the defendant that the credit was given to Carvill, McKean & Co. has been upheld by the jury. There is ample evidence to justify that verdict, but it is objected that some of the evidence was not properly admissible.\nTo render the discussion of that objection intelligible, it may be stated that the general result of the evidence is that the goods (being ordered, as I have said, by McKean personally, or by one of the clerks of Carvill, McKean & Co.), were charged in the plaintiff's books to Carvill, McKean & Co.; that accounts were rendered to that firm for the goods, and notes given for them by McKean in the name of the firm; that in the books of Carvill, McKean & Co. the goods were credited to the plaintiff and debited to an account headed with the name of the defendant Miller; and that on one or two occasions the debit was accompanied by a small charge in the name of commission.\nThe nature of the evidence which is said to have been improperly received, and the way in which the objection was dealt with, will best appear by reading from the judgment of the court as delivered by Mr. Justice King:\u2014\nThe defendants put in evidence the books of Carvill, McKean & Co. to show that this firm (and therefore McKean) had treated these goods as purchased by them of the plaintiff, and then as resold by them to defendants. Amongst other things, in the account in Carvill, McKean & Co.'s books, they relied on a charge of a small commission as indicating (whether it would do so or not) a transaction of sale as between the firm and defendants. They also (on the cross-examination of McKean and the direct examination of the clerk of Carvill, McKean & Co.), put in evidence entries of other goods, purchased from other parties, which in these books were charged against defendants and on which also commissions were charged. Thus, on p. 73 it is stated that \"other items of commission are traced, but none of Mr. White's and on p. 94 McIntyre speaks of the way invoices were made out of goods got from Stephenson as well as White; and again, on p. 95, Mr. McIntyre says: \"When I bought goods, or any of the young men bought goods, they were billed to Carvill, McKean & Co.; they were then credited to the party from whom bought and charged to wherever they were sent. If sent to McAfee they were charged to McAfee, and if to Economy they were charged to H. U. Miller, and if they were bought for Collins they were billed to Collins.\"\nThis evidence seems inadmissible, and it is impossible to say that it might not have had weight with the jury. We therefore think there should be a new trial.\nThe learned judge has not mentioned the grounds on which the evidence was considered inadmissible. I understand it to have been on the ground that the entries in the books of Carvill, McKean & Co. were res inter alios acta as far as the plaintiff was concerned.\nThe plaintiff depends upon establishing that Miller was a principal for whom McKean acted as agent in buying the goods\u2014not an undisclosed principal, for the evidence is that the plaintiff was given to understand that the goods were for the concern in which Miller was a partner. The fact that their destination was the Economy works is consistent with either an immediate purchase by Miller & McKean or a purchase by Carvill, McKean & Co., for the purpose of re-selling to Miller & McKean. It was important evidence for the jury, but not conclusive either way. The plaintiff called McKean to prove that he realty purchased for his Economy firm and that the process of charging the goods, as McKean directed them to be charged, to Carvill, McKean & Co., was a mere matter of convenience in connection with the circumstance that he and Miller had not yet opened a set of books; and he gave some other explanations. In answer to this evidence of McKean the defendant Miller was allowed to educe from McKean, and also to examine McKean's bookkeeper with the object of proving, that the transactions appeared in the books of Carvill, McKean & Co., which were the books of McKean, in a form inconsistent with the testimony given by McKean on behalf of the plaintiff, and consistent with the contention of the defence; and further, that that mode of dealing was not peculiar to these purchases from White, but was the system on which the business was conducted by McKean.\nThis evidence may have had much or little weight, going to the jury, as it did, with whatever explanations were offered. It cannot be said that it had no influence, and it is therefore necessary to decide the question of its admissibility. I do not see that it was improperly received. The question of the agency of McKean in making his purchases was the question at issue. His denial of the purchases being, as the written entries imputed that they were, on account of Carvill, McKean & Co., touched the central fact of the inquiry. To contradict him by direct evidence, whether educed from himself or from another source, which opposed his own acts or statements on other occasions to his testimony in the witness box, was not in violation of any rule of evidence or of nisi prius practice. The opposing evidence may have been such, and I should say was such, as to be not unlikely to go beyond the office of merely contradicting or nullifying his statement, and may have been capable of being regarded by the jury as affirmative evidence in support of the issue. But that is not a consideration which requires the exclusion of the evidence, so long as the matter is a material and not a collateral one. The case of Watson v. Little[2] is an authority for that proposition. That was an action of ejectment, in which the question was the legitimacy of the plaintiff. His mother swore that he was born five days after her marriage, namely, on the 13th of March. She denied, in answer to questions put in cross-examination, that she had been before the magistrates about the child, or said to the magistrates that he was born on the 8th of March, or that she had affiliated the child. Evidence was admitted in reply to show that she had affiliated the child as a bastard born on the 8th of March. The most of the argument in the case related to the admissibility, under the circumstances, of the order of bastardy as proof of the facts contained in it. That question does not concern us.\nMartin B. said:\nThe defendant had a right to put in any legal evidence for the purpose of contradicting her in a material matter; and no doubt it was most material, in a question of legitimacy, to show that the mother had been before the Magistrates and stated that the child was born before marriage.\nBramwell B. said:\nI cannot say that it would be evidence that the child was born on the 8th March, but it was certainly evidence to contradict the witness; though for that purpose the order must be proved by some evidence of the identity of the parties. Possibly it might operate on the minds of the jury for another purpose; but I cannot help thinking that the order tells the truth, and that the mother when before the magistrates, did say that the child was born before marriage. She might have been able to explain her motives for doing so, but as she denied the fact, the consequences must fall on the party who produced her as a witness. And Wilde B. said:\nI give no opinion as to whether the order would be admissible to prove the bastardy. We cannot reject it, because, if admissible for one purpose, it may have an effect upon the jury as evidence for another.\nMcEwan v. Thornton[3]; Fowkes v. Manchester &c. Insurance Co.[4]; Reg. v. Dennis[5]; and Attorney General v. Hitchcock[6].\nI think the evidence was properly received.\nIn the respondent's factum the point is taken that McKean had not been asked respecting invoices made by Carvill, McKean & Co. to Miller and McKean, respecting which McIntyre gave evidence, and also that evidence touching purchases of goods from parties other than the plaintiff was irrelevant. These objecjections are, to my mind, answered by what I have said. The point being the character in which McKean acted in purchasing the goods directly in question, whether as representing Carvill, McKean & Co., or Miller & McKean, and there being no suggestion that in these purchases he departed from the system adopted for carrying on the business, but the contrary appearing from his answers to some questions, particularly as to purchases from De Forest, Burpees, Stephenson, &c., upon which a commission had been charged in the books, the enquiries were relevant. It was the broad question of agency, not one of narrow details.\nObjections are taken to the charge for misdirection and for non-direction. They were not noticed in the judgment below, but they were taken in the rule and may of course be insisted on here.\nI do not think it necessary to say more respecting them than that they resolve themselves into complaints of too much or too little stress being laid on parts of the evidence, or of expressions of opinion upon its bearing on some particular question of fact. I have carefully read the able and lucid charge of the learned Chief Justice. I am not of opinion that any of the complaints are well founded; but they are not matters of misdirection for which a verdict ought to be disturbed, even if the objections had been made at the trial when any supposed omission or oversight could have been remedied.\nI think we should allow the appeal, and of course with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for appellant: C.

Ritchie C.J., and Strong, Fournier, Taschereau and Gwynne JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.\nTrade mark\u2014Infringment of\u2014Effect of registration\u2014Exclusive right of user\u2014Property in descriptive words\u2014Rectification of registry.\nIt is only a mark or symbol in which property can be acquired, and which will designate the article on which it is placed as the manufacture of the person claiming an exclusive right to its use, that can properly be registered as a trade mark under the Trade Mark and Design Act, 1879 (42 V. c. 22.)\nA person accused of infringing a registered trade mark may show that it was in common use before such registration and, therefore, could not properly be registered, notwithstanding the provision in s. 8 of the act that the person registering shall have the exclusive right to use the same to designate articles manufactured by him. Taschereau J. dissenting.\nWhere the statute prescribes no means for rectification of a trade mark improperly registered the courts may afford relief by way of defence to an action for infringement.\nPer Gwynne J.\u2014Property cannot be acquired in marks, &c., known to a particular trade as designating quality merely and not, in themselves, indicating that the goods to which they are affixed are the manufacture of a particular person. Nor can property be acquired in an ordinary English word expressive of quality merely though it might be in a foreign word or word of a dead language.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] affirming the judgment of Mr. Justice Proudfoot[2], by which the plaintiff\u2019s action was dismissed.\nThis was a suit for damages for infringing the plaintiff\u2019s trade mark, and claiming an injunction. The trade mark was used by the plaintiff to designate a particular brand of flour manufactured and sold by him and consisted of a label on the barrels of flour as follows:\u2014\nThe defendants were commission merchants and had been selling the plaintiff\u2019s flour on commission. They was desirous of securing the sole right to sell the plaintiff\u2019s flour in the Maritime Provinces which the plaintiff refused to give them, and they thereupon purchased flour from other millers and branded it as follows:\u2014\nand sold it with such brand on the barrel. This, the plaintiff claims, is an infringement of his trade mark for which he brings this suit.\nThe defendants claim that their brand is sufficiently unlike that of the plaintiff to prevent purchasers from being deceived, and also deny the plaintiff\u2019s right to the exclusive use of such trade mark alleging user of the words \u201cgold leaf\u201d on barrels of flour by other parties.\nThe cause was heard before Mr. Justice Proudfoot who upheld the defendants\u2019 contention as to user and dismissed the suit. The Court of Appeal affirmed this judgment. The plaintiff then appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nW. Cassels Q.C. and Hegler for the appellant.\nThe plaintiff rests his claim for an injunction on two grounds. First, that under the statute he has an exclusive right to the use of this trade mark and\u2014secondly, if not, the evidence is not sufficient to destroy his right to such use.\nIf the plaintiff has a right to the use of the trade mark the infringement by the defendants is clear on the evidence.\nThe statute gives plaintiff an exclusive right to the use of the trade mark which right is absolute until the registry is cancelled.\nSomerville v. Schembri[3] and Barsalou v. Darling[4] were cited.\nMcCarthy Q.C. and Moss Q.C. for respondents. Re Edwards\u2019 Trade Mark[5] and McAndrew v. Bassett[6], show that there must be property in the words constituting the trade mark to make the trade mark itself property.\nUnless such property is acquired there can be no exclusive right of user conferred by registration. SIR W.J. RITCHIE C.J.\u2014The defendants are simply in this position as public millers that they have the right to use this term \u201cGold Leaf\u201d as a brand for patent flour of a particular description, as being \u201ccommon to the trade,\u201d that is in common use by the trade, as a distinctive term applied to flour of a particular description; a common property which anyone in the trade had the right to use; a common mark and publici juris; in other words, that it had been public property; no doubt under sec. 7 the certificate signed by the Minister or his deputy to the effect that the said trade mark had been duly registered in accordance with the provisions of this section and stating the date, month and year of the entering thereof in the register shall be received in all courts of law or equity in Canada as prim\u00e2 facie evidence of the facts therein alleged without proof; but does not the very fact of the act making this certificate prim\u00e2 facie evidence show that this prim\u00e2 facie case may be rebutted by showing that there has been no legal registration? And this section 8, which is relied on as giving an absolute exclusive use, must be read in connection with the other provisions of the statute and it is quite clear that this exclusive use is only to attach when there is a legal registration If, then, there has been no legal registration there can be no exclusive use.\nThen the question arises: Had the plaintiff any right to register this mark as his trade mark? For whom is this register to be kept? As to this the first section of the act is most explicit.\nThe 1st sect. of the 42 Vic. ch. 22, declares that a registry of trade marks shall be kept in the office of the Minister of Agriculture in which any proprietor of a trade mark may have the same registered by complying with the provisions of this act. Does not this clearly show that the applicant must be the proprietor of the trade mark he desires to have registered? And sec. 6, which provides that the proprietor of a trade mark may have it registered, requires a declaration that the same was not in use to his knowledge by any other person than himself at the time of his adoption thereof.\nWhen the applicant under the provisions of the 6th sec. signs a declaration that the same was not in use to his knowledge by any other person, he no doubt makes out a prim\u00e2 facie case for registration; but does not this inferentially involve that if he did know it was in use by any other person it would not be proper that it should be registered? And does it not necessarily follow that though he may not have known that it was so in use, if in reality, as was shown in this case, it was and had been for years in common use as a mark or brand in the very article in reference to which he desires to claim an exclusive use, upon principle should he be permitted to have that exclusive use when, if the fact as it existed had been brought to the knowledge of the officer, the registration would have been refused, or to claim that simply because he had obtained an improper registration he had obtained an indefeasible exclusive right to its use? I think the learned judge was right in receiving evidence to show the invalidity of the plaintiff\u2019s alleged trade mark.\nIt is not the registration that makes the party proprietor of a trade mark; he must be proprietor before he can register; so we see by sec. 17 \u201ca suit may be maintained by any proprietor of a trade mark against any person using his registered trade mark, or any fraudulent imitation thereof, &c.\u201d\nNow, when did this plaintiff become proprietor of this trade mark, to entitle him to register it and to claim under such registration an absolute indefeasible ex- clusive right to it for all time to come as is claimed in this case?\nI think the term \u201cproprietor of a trade mark\u201d means a person who has appropriated and acquired a right to the exclusive use of the mark, and where a party has a trade mark he can institute no proceedings to prevent its infringement until and unless such trade mark is registered in pursuance of this act; but this by no means implies that one man can copy and register a trade mark belonging to another or a trade mark in common use.\nMcAndrew v. Bassett. Lord Westbury[7]:\u2014\nThe essential qualities for constituting that property (property in a trade mark) probably would be found to be no other than these: first, that the mark has been applied by the plaintiff\u2019s properly, (that is to say) that they have not copied any other any other person\u2019s mark, and that the mark does not involve any false representation; secondly, that the article so marked is actually a vendible article in the market; and, thirdly, that the defendants, knowing that to be so, have imitated the mark for the purpose of passing in the market other articles of a similar description.\nI think the evidence in this case shows that the name Gold Leaf had before the registration of plaintiff become public property, and that the plaintiff had not any exclusive right to the use of that term, a term which had been for years before such registration a well-known and convenient name or brand by which the article of patent flour was defined.\nI think the learned judge was right in following the authority of McCall v. Theal[8] which, in my opinion, was rightly decided.\nAs a public user of this trade mark previous to plaintiff\u2019s registration, defendants were not shut out from continuing its use it by reason of plaintiff\u2019s registration.\nI think the defendants had a perfect right to question the validity of plaintiff\u2019s claim to this trade mark, and to show that his ex parte proceedings in obtaining registration thereof were not justified. This is not a case between two conflicting claimants, each claiming to be entitled to this trade mark or brand, but by one of the public who claims, not the exclusive right to the trade mark but the right to use the mark or brand as being the common property of the public at large engaged in the manufacture or sale of patent flour.\nThe following cases show that the defendant plainly had this right:\nIn re J.B. Palmer\u2019s application[9].\nJessel M.R.\u2014It is clear that the 3rd section does not expressly say that the application under the 5th section shall not be made after five years, but the respondents contend that the words which I am about to read impliedly have that effect. \u201cThe registration of a person as first proprietor of a trade mark shall be prim\u00e2 facie evidence of his right to the exclusive use of such trade mark, and shall after the expiration of five years from the date of such registration be conclusive evidence of his right to the exclusive use of such trade mark.\u201d Now what is the meaning of the words, \u201cthe registration of a person as first proprietor of a trade mark?\u201d Does it mean his registration as proprietor of \u201ca mark,\u201d or does it mean what it says, his registration as proprietor of \u201ca trade mark?\u201d I think the literal meaning is to be preferred. It is true that the registrar ought not to enter anything which is not capable of being a trade mark but he may be deceived, and that is alleged to be the case here.\n* * * * *\nIt appears to me that reason and convenience are entirely in favor of the construction which we put upon this act of Parliament. I am glad to see (though I do not know whether it ought to influence us either way) that the well known writer, Mr. Sebastian, takes the same view of the act, so that our decision will be no surprise to anyone. He says (Sebastian on Trade Marks)[10]: \u201cThe registration as a trade mark of a name of this description will somewhat complicate the question, as such registration is to be prim\u00e2 facie evidence, and after five years registration conclusive evidence, of the right of the registered owner to the exclusive use of such trade mark, but this enactment does not preclude a defence on the ground that the name so registered is in fact no trade mark, and was registered or is continued on the register by error.\u201d So Mr. Bryce says (Bryce on the Trade Marks Registration Acts, 1875 and 1876)[11]: \u201cAfter the expiry of five years the right of the registered proprietor becomes absolute, and cannot be disputed by a defendant. But it is apprehended that after, no less than before, the expiry of the five years, the right of the registered proprietor may be contested on any ground going to show that the mark ought never to have been registered at all, for example, that it is not a trade mark within the meaning of the act.\u201d So both writers on the subject take the same view, and go so far as to think that if a description which is not capable of being a trade mark is registered, a person who sells goods under that description, and is sued, may defend himself on the ground that it is not a trade mark, though it has been five years on the register. The question has not been argued before us, and we have not to decide it, but I am not by any means prepared to say that those distinguished writers are wrong, because the act only says that after five years the person who has registered a trade mark shall be entitled to the trade mark, but does not say that the mark as registered shall be deemed to be a trade mark.\nLindley L.J.\u2014After careful examination of sections 3, 5 and 10, of the Trade Marks Registration Act, 1875, I am satisfied that a mark which is not a trade mark, and which therefore ought never to have been registered, does not become a trade mark by being on the register for five years.\nIn re Lloyd & Son\u2019s Trade Mark. Lloyd v. Bottomley[12].\nCHITTY J.\u2014On the evidence it is plain that this so-called mark was common in the trade, inasmuch as it was in use by more than three persons before the application to register, and, if so, it was not a distinctive mark or device, but was common in the trade, inasmuch as it had been publicly used by more than three persons on the same or a similar description before the application to register. If so, goods having this mark on them had no distinctive mark such as was required by section 74. In re Hyde & Co\u2019s. trade mark[13], the late Master of the Rolls on motion ordered the registration which had been made to be struck out. Reliance, however, has been placed on the argument on behalf of the respondents on an observation of the Master of the Rolls, which was to be found in the shorthand notes of the argument in that case. But the Master of the Rolls reconsidered the matter afterwards In re J.B. Palmer\u2019s application,[14] and at best it was a mere dictum. I hold, therefore, that it is competent to the applicants, notwithstanding the expiration of five years from the date of registration, to show that the thing called a trade mark is not a trade mark at all, and ought not to have been registered.\nIn re Wragg\u2019s Trade Mark[15].\nThe registration of a mark as a trade mark and the lapse of five years do not, under sec. 76 of the Trade Marks Act, 1883, confer on the person who has made the registration an indefeasible title to the use of the mark as a trade mark if, by reason of its being at the time of registration in common use in the trade, it ought not to have been registered.\nPEARSON J.\u2014I come, therefore, to the conclusion that in the year 1876, when Mr. Wragg registered this device, it was a device which had been publicly used up to that time by more than three persons, \u201cand had become common to the trade in such goods.\u201d\nBut it is said that, because Mr. Wragg has registered, he has got an exclusive right to it. To my mind he could get an exclusive right only to that which he was authorized to register under the act, and it is quite plain that no person can with propriety go to the Comptroller and ask to register as his exclusive property a mark which is common to all persons engaged in the same trade.\nI hold, therefore, that when Mr. Wragg registered this mark he registered that which he had no right whatever to register, and that he has acquired no title whatever by the lapse of time, and, inasmuch as the mark was not properly registered when it was registered in 1876, it ought to come off the register now. It ought to come off for this reason that, so long as it remains on the register, it apparently gives the person who has registered it an exclusive right to use it; it enables him, if he is minded to do that which is unjust and fraudulent, to terrify other persons by informing them that they have no right to use that which is common to the trade, because he has chosen improperly to register it as his own. I am of opinion that the five years\u2019 registration cannot by any possibility make good that which was invalid in its inception, and on that ground I order this mark to be taken off the register, with cost to be paid by the respondent.\nEdwards v. Dennis[16].\nBacon V.C.\u2014The meaning of the act of Parliament is obvious enough. The whole object is that persons in the enjoyment of what are called \u201ctrade marks\u201d shall, if they register those trade marks in the manner prescribed so that entire publicity may be given to their alleged rights, have an indefeasible right to them. That is the general scope and object of the statute.\n* * * * * The Vice-Chancellor quoted the following from the judgment In re Palmer\u2019s Application[17]:\nThe Master of the Rolls proceeds to read the 3rd section of the act, and then he says: \u201cNow what is the meaning of the \u2018words the registration of a person as first proprietor of a trade mark? Does it mean his registration as proprietor of \u2018a mark,\u2019 or does it mean what it says, his registration as proprietor of \u2018trade mark?\u2019 I think the literal reading is to be preferred. It is true that the registrar ought not to enter anything which is not capable of being a trade mark, but he may be deceived, and that is alleged to be the case here. The registrar of trade marks cannot know nor can the commissioners know the meaning of all technical terms used in a trade.\u201d Then, after dealing with the name \u2018braided fixed stars,\u2019 and with the contention of the respondents, his lordship takes the case of a man selling palm oil soap under the name of \u2018palm oil soap,\u2019 and he says: \u201csuddenly somebody comes down against him and says, \u2018I registered those words five years ago as a trade mark. I therefore change by the force of act of Parliament those words which are ordinary words of description into a trade mark, and now I am entitled to restrain you from using them.\u2019 If this were to be allowed it would be allowing a man who had taken an improper advantage of the ignorance of the registrar, and of the commissioners if it came before them, as to the use of the technical terms of the trade, to lay a trap for an honest tradesman who had done nothing but sell his goods under their proper description.\u201d\nCotton L.J.\u2014In the first place what is the object of that act? Speaking generally, its object is, not to give new rights, but to place restrictions on the bringing of actions for infringement of trade marks by requiring that a trade mark shall be registered before any action to prevent its infringement can be brought. That is provided for by the first section of the act as amended by the subsequent act of 1876. Another object of the act is to facilitate evidence of title to trade marks by means of registration; for the 3rd section of the act provides that registration of a person as first proprietor of a trade mark shall be prim\u00e2 facie evidence of his right to the exclusive use of the trademark, and that five years registration shall be conclusive evidence of his right to such exclusive use.\n* * * * *\nNo doubt the intention of the Act is to give a right to what is on the register so as to enable a person who has been registered for five years as the proprietor of a trade mark to maintain an action against any other person taking or infringing that trade mark;\n* * * * * The 3rd section contains this provision: \u201cThe registration of a person as first proprietor of a trade mark shall be prim\u00e2 facie evidence of his right to the exclusive use of such trade mark, and shall, after the expiration of five years from the date of such registration, be conclusive evidence of his right to the exclusive use of such trade mark.\u201d\nThen the 4th section continues the title of the first proprietor in the hands of a subsequent proprietor. I am not now considering how far the fact of Mr. Edwards and his predecessor having been on the register for five years is an answer to this application, though, in my opinion, it is not. It appears to me that the 3rd section is intended to afford assistance to a person who is bringing an action against another person of passing off his goods as the goods of the person who brings the action. In such a case, if the plaintiff shows that he has been on the register for five years, that dispenses with the necessity of his adducing evidence of exclusive user of his trade mark. But the third section is no bar to an application under the 5th section for rectification of the register, and in the case of such an application the court is bound to consider\u2014as the Court of Appeal held In re Palmer\u2019s Application[18]\u2014whether the trade mark is properly on the register; for, although it may have been on for five year, if it ought not to have been on at all, then it can be taken off. So that, on the question whether a trade mark is properly on the register, the 3rd section is no bar to an application to rectify the register.\n* * * * *\nA trade mark is a mark used in trade to distinguish the goods of the person who uses it; and the act appears to contemplate a user of the particular mark contemporaneously with, if not before, registration. The first section places a restriction on actions being brought for infringement of trade marks for it says that \u201cFrom and after the 1st day of July, 1876, a person shall not be entitled to institute any proceeding to prevent the infringement of any trade mark as defined by this Act until and unless such trade mark is registered in pursuance of this Act.\u201d The person with whom the Act is dealing is a person who would have been entitled under the old law to bring an action for the infringement of his trade mark, that is to say, a trade mark actually used by him. The first section therefore assumes that it is dealing with a person who is using his trade mark.\n* * * * *\nLindley L.J.:\nThen with regard to the five years\u2019 registration. When we come to look at sections 3 and 5 it is clear that they do not depend on one another, sec. 5 not being consequent on section 3. The meaning of the sections is this: when a man brings an action for infringement, if he has been on the register for five years, sec. 3 is conclusive as to his right to bring the action, and in that particular action such registration is conclusive evidence of his right to the exclusive user of his trade mark; but having regard to section five it appears to me that the register can be rectified in respect of that trade mark, notwithstanding the five years registration, if proper proceedings are taken for that purpose.\nI can discover no analogy whatever between this and a crown grant. If the legislature has not provided a special remedy to meet this case in my opinion not the courts but the law clearly gives the remedy by enabling the defendant to say: \u2018You claim by virtue of a registration which, I will show, is no legal registration and therefore confers on you no rights and, therefore, I have the right to ask for a rectification of the register, and cancellation thereof, on the ground that the trade mark never should have been on it at all and should now be taken off. I entirely repudiate the idea, that this is legislation in the courts or anything else than the proper administration of the law by affording to the parties that remedy which, in my opinion, the law clearly gives him.\nSTRONG J.\u2014I am of opinion that this appeal should be dismissed for the reasons given by the majority of the judges in the Court of Appeal.\nFOURNIER J. concurred in the judgment of the majority of the court dismissing the appeal.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014I would allow this appeal for the reasons given by Burton J., dissenting, in the court below.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014The plaintiff, in his statement of claim, alleges that he is a miller engaged in the manufacture of flour at the town of Ingersoll, in the county of Oxford, and that some time prior to the month of October, 1884, he had perfected a certain brand of roller process flour at his mills, which he named \u201cgold leaf\u201d and that in order to secure the said brand of flour, so designated, from being imitated by others, and to give notice that the designation, \u201cgold leaf,\u201d as applied to this particular brand of flour was his sole property, he, upon the 19th of December, 1884, procured to be registered in the Department of Agriculture, at Ottawa, the said specific trade mark, to be applied to the sale of flour, which trade mark consists of the words \u201cGold leaf,\u201d surrounded by the numbers 196, within a circle and, underneath the said designation, the word \u201cflour\u201d and the registrant\u2019s name, the whole surrounded by the words \u201cIngersoll Roller Mills, Ontario, Canada.\u201d That, since the 3rd of December, 1884, the defendants, who are commission merchants, residing and carrying on business at the town of Galt, in the county of Waterloo, have branded their flour of an inferior quality with a mark similar to the trade mark of the plaintiff, and have sold the same as purporting to be the \u201cgold leaf\u201d of the plaintiff, and have thereby caused the plaintiff great loss. That the flour of the plaintiff has acquired a good reputation all over the Dominion of Canada and is in great demand, and there is a large sale therefor, and that the defendant, well knowing this to be the case, and with the object and intent of selling flour of an inferior brand and less value as the flour of the plaintiff, have branded their flour with a mark similar to that of the plaintiff, and that the similarity of the said marks enables the defendants to deceive and mislead the public by selling their said flour as the flour of the plaintiff, and that the defendants do, in fact, fraudulently put their flour in the market as the flour of the plaintiff, to his great prejudice. That the plaintiff has suffered damage by the defendants.\n1st. Destroying the sale of the plaintiff\u2019s said flour.\n2nd. Destroying the character of the said flour and deteriorating its value in the eyes of flour dealers, who, prior to this time, had dealt in \u201cGold leaf,\u201d and by loss of market; that from the infringement of the said trade mark and from the facts before stated, the plaintiff has suffered great loss and the plaintiff claimed $3,000 damages and prayed that the defendants may be restrained by injunction from using said trade mark, and from selling the said flour of the plaintiff and from so branding or marking the same so as to enable others to deceive the public.\nThe defence of the defendants to this complaint is, in short substance that the words \u201cGold leaf\u201d used in the label registered by the plaintiff, were words well known in the flour trade, and in common use by traders other than the plaintiff, and that the same was not capable of registration by the plaintiff and that the plaintiff falsely stated that the same was a new and original word or design of his own in order to obtain registration of the same, and the defendants denied that they had infringed any rights, if any were acquired by the plaintiff by such registration as in the statement of claim is alleged.\nThe learned judge before whom the case was tried has found as a fact, and the evidence abundantly supports his finding, that the term \u201cGold leaf\u201d was a common brand for a superior class of flour made by what is called a \u201cpatent process\u201d or \u201croller process,\u201d well known by and in use in the trade for some years prior to and at the time that the plaintiff registered his label. The practice appears to be for millers, and dealers in flour upon commission also, to keep different brands of the same quality of flour. That which is manufactured by \u201cpatent\u201d or \u201croller\u201d process, is known to some purchasers both at home and abroad as \u201cRuby,\u201d by others as \u201cEgmont,\u201d by others as \u201cNyphos\u201d and by others as \u201cGold leaf,\u201d and when a purchaser orders one or other of these brands, it is put on the flour by the miller from whom it is bought or by the commission merchant through whom it is ordered, if ordered through a commission merchant, and the brand simply designates, and is known as designating, only the quality of the flour, and as made by \u201cpatent\u201d or \u201croller\u201d process, and not at all that the flour is the manufacture of any particular mill or miller. In the autumn of 1883 the plaintiff altered his mills into \u201croller\u201d mills, and then he procured one Alderdyce to cut for him a \u201cGold leaf\u201d brand, but what if anything other than these words was on the brand then cut by Alderdyce does not appear, for that brand has not been produced and this brand, whatever was upon it, appears to have been the only brand with the words \u201cGold leaf\u201d upon it which the plaintiff used from the 10th December, 1883, until he registered the label which has been produced upon the 19th December, 1884; but during that same period he sold to and through the defendants the same quality of flour under the brands \u201cRuby,\u201d \u201cNyphos\u201d and \u201cEgmont,\u201d and in the month of June, 1884, he sold to them for the first time the same quality of flour with the brand \u201cGold leaf\u201d upon it. In the month of October, 1884, the defendants procured for themselves a brand with the words \u201cGold leaf\u201d upon it. This brand the defendants had cut with the intent of making some arrangement with the plaintiff as to dealing with him and that the defendants\u2019 said brand should be put upon all flour bought from the plaintiff by or through the defendants, but no arrangement having been come to, the defendants kept the brand, together with others which they had, and it is their use of this brand which is relied upon by the plaintiff as an infringement of what the plaintiff calls his trade mark.\nFrom the above facts, which the evidence disclosed, it is apparent that every one of the material allegations, upon which the plaintiff in his statement of claim rests his case, was disproved. The term \u201cGold leaf\u201d was not first introduced into use by the plaintiff as a brand of flour, nor did the term by itself ever indicate, nor was it supposed to indicate, that flour so branded was manufactured by the plaintiff or at his mills. On the contrary, when the plaintiff first converted his mills into \u201croller\u201d mills and first manufactured flour by what is known in the trade as roller mill or patent process, the term was well known and in use as a brand designating a particular quality of flour manufactured by what was known in the trade as \u201cpatent process\u201d or \u201croller mill process\u201d wherever or by whomsoever the same should be manufactured; the term had no connection whatever with any particular person or mills.\nSuch being the purpose for which the brand was in use when the plaintiff registered his label, he had not acquired, and could not have claimed, any property in the term \u201cGold leaf\u201d as a brand for flour. What constitutes, therefore, his property in the label registered by him as his trade mark is that part only of the label which indicates that flour having upon it the well known brand \u201cGold leaf\u201d (which designates quality only) was manufactured by the plaintiff at his mills\u2014namely, the words \u201cIngersoll Roller Mills, Ont., Can.\u201d and \u201cWm. Partlo\u201d\u2014and it is apparent that flour having upon it the label in use by the defendants bears no indication or representation whatever that flour so branded was manufactured by the plaintiff, and the use of it, therefore, by the defendants can give to the plaintiff no cause of action or ground of complaint whatever. The right which a manufacturer has in his trade mark is the exclusive right to use it for the purpose of indicating where and by whom or at what manufactory the article to which it is attached was manufactured. A man may mark goods of his own manufacture either by his name or the initials of his name, or by using for the purpose any symbol or emblem, however unmeaning it may be in itself, and, if such symbol comes, by use, to be recognized in the trade as the mark of the goods of a particular person, no other person has a right to stamp his goods of a like description with a mark so resembling the mark of the former as to be likely thereby to induce incautious purchasers to believe that the goods were the manufacture of the former; but no person can acquire property in any marks, names, letters or symbols, which are known in the trade as designating quality merely, wholly irrespective of the goods to which they are affixed being the manufacture or stock-in-trade of any particular person. All manufacturers of the same description of goods have equal right to use such marks, names, &c., as are known in the trade as designating quality, and each in such case can only acquire property in some name or mark used by him in connection with such indicia of quality, as aforesaid, as will indicate that the particular article of the designated quality is of his manufacture; and if an article originally manufactured by a particular person comes to be known in the trade by the name of such person, not as expressing the maker of the particular specimen, but as describing the nature of the article by whomsoever made, every person has a right to manufacture the article bearing such name and to sell it by that name. This was one of the canons laid down by Lord Kingsdown in the American Leather Cloth Company case[19]. So, likewise, no property can be acquired by any person in an English word, which is expressive of quality merely, stamped upon goods of his manufacture; this was the case of Raggett v. Findlater[20], in which it was held that a person could acquire no property or trade mark in the words \u201cnourishing\u201d stout or \u201cnourishing\u201d London stout, but that words added showing the name of the dealer in the article and the words, \u201canalysed and reported on by Dr. Hassall\u201d were words in which the party originally using them on the stout sold by him might acquire property as his trade mark. But a foreign word or a word in a dead language not known to people in general, because it is not understood, may become the trade mark of the person who first uses it upon a particular article sold by him; this was the case of McAndrew v. Bassett[21]; so in Wotherspoon v. Currie[22], where the plaintiff had first applied the word \u201cGlenfield\u201d to starch, and under that name had introduced into the market starch manufactured by him, which, under that name, had acquired celebrity in the trade, it was held that he had thereby acquired a property in the word \u201cGlenfield\u201d as applied to starch. Upon the same principle the court proceeded in Braham v. Bustard[23], with regard to the \u201cExcelsior White Soft Soap,\u201d and in Ford v. Foster[24], with regard to the \u201cEureka\u201d shirts. All these cases are commented upon, and the principle upon which they proceeded explained by Malins, V.C. in Raggett v. Findlater20.\nIn Seixo v. Provezende[25], the principle upon which relief is granted as for infringement by one of the trade mark of another is stated to be that one trader cannot offer his goods for sale representing them to be the manufacture of a rival trader. If what is relied upon as the trade mark by the complainant is a word or mark two questions arise:\u20141st. Whether the word or mark is known in the trade as specially designating the goods to which it is affixed to be the manufacture or property of the complainant; and 2nd. Whether the mark or word as used by the defendant is so similar to that used by the complainant as to be likely to induce incautious purchasers to believe that the goods offered for sale by the defendant are the manufacture or property of the complainant.\nIn Cocks v. Chandler[26], although the first manufacturer of a sauce which came to be known in the trade as \u201cReading sauce\u201d had not acquired any property in the word \u201cReading,\u201d and could not restrain another person from selling sauce manufactured by him under that name, yet it was held that the first manufacturer had acquired property in the word \u201coriginal\u201d prefixed to the words \u201cReading sauce.\u201d\nIn Lee v. Haley[27], where the plaintiff had established his place of business on Pall Mall for selling coal where he had for many years carried on the business under the name of the \u201cGuinea Coal Company\u201d and the defendant many years afterwards opened a place of business upon Pall Mall also where he offered coal for sale under the name of the \u201cPall Mall Guinea Coal Company\u201d it was held, although the plaintiff had not and could not have acquired any property in the words \u201cGuinea Coal Company\u201d as constituting his trade mark, because those words were known in the trade to designate a particular quality of coal sold at a guinea per ton, and there were a number of companies calling themselves \u201cGuinea Coal Companies,\u201d that the defendant should be restrained from using the name \u201cPall Mall Guinea Coal Company\u201d on Pall Mall because it manifestly appeared on the evidence that the defendant\u2019s object in transferring his business from where he had before carried it on to Pall Mall and in opening an office there was to obtain possession of the custom or a part of the custom which the plaintiff had established there by having had his place of business there for many years.\nThe relief appears to have been granted in that case not for any infringement of a trade mark but for actual fraud in the defendant offering his goods for sale and selling them under circumstances calculated to induce and which had induced persons accustomed and intending to deal with the plaintiff to believe that they were in point of fact dealing with him.\nSo no property can be acquired in the letters X,XX. or XXX. applied to beer as a trade mark for these letters are known to be used in the trade as designating merely the strength of the beer to which they are affixed, wholly irrespective of the person by whom the beer has been manufactured. So neither can property be acquired in the use of a crown or horseshoe or any marks or words in connection with manufactures in iron which are used in the iron trade to designate a particular description or quality of the manufacture in iron on which they are stamped, but the names or initial letters of the name of a firm which manufactures or deals in the article, in connection with any symbol designating the description or quality of the iron used in the manufacture of the article, will constitute good trade marks, as they will also when used in connection with the letters X., &c., on beer.\nSo far as the letters, symbols or words claimed are descriptive of quality they cannot be trade marks\u2014no property can be acquired therein,\u2014but when they are connected with the initials of the firm or the name of the works where the article is manufactured the whole combination constitutes one trade mark. In re Barrows Trade Marks[28].\nNow, the evidence establishes that at the time the plaintiff registered his label, the words \u201cGold leaf\u201d used on flour never did indicate that the flour upon which they were stamped, was manufactured by the plaintiff. They indicated merely that the flour was of a particular quality manufactured by what was known as \u201cpatent process\u201d or \u201croller mill process,\u201d by whomsoever manufactured; they gave no indication whatever as to the particular mills where, or as to the person by whom, it had been manufactured. They were, therefore, words in which the plaintiff could not have, and has not, acquired any property whatever, unless he has acquired it under and by force of the provisions of the Dominion Statute, 42 Vic. c. 22. Accordingly, it has been contended that, although these words \u201cGold leaf\u201d were in common use as designating merely a particular description or quality of flour, the effect of the act is to have enabled the plaintiff by becoming the first to register a label having those words upon it to take them out of the common use to which they had been applied\u2014to divest them of the meaning and character which, by such common use, they had acquired, and to make them his special property and, thereafter, to represent that the flour on which they are stamped is manufactured by him alone.\nThe argument in support of this singular contention is this\u2014the statute, as is contended, gives to every person who first registers any mark as his trade mark a right to the exclusive use thereof, whether such mark was or not, prior to the registration thereof, capable of being recognized in law as a trade mark.\nThe effect of this contention, if sound, would be that any brewer who should first register a label with his name upon it in connection with the letters X.,XX.,XXX. would thereby acquire exclusive right to use those letters upon beer. The argument is sought to be supported by a reference to the Imperial Statute 38-39 Vic. c. 91, the 3rd section of which enacts that:\nThe registration of a person as first proprietor of a trade mark shall be prim\u00e2 facie evidence of his right to the exclusive use of such trade mark, and shall, after the expiration of five years from the date of such registration, be conclusive evidence of his right to the exclusive use of such trade mark, subject to the provisions of this Act as to its connexion with the goodwill of a business.\nand the contention upon this point is that as our statute provides (as is contended that it does in its 8th section) that immediately upon registration the person registering shall have an exclusive right to the use of the mark or label as registered by him to designate articles manufactured or sold by him without any delay of five years as is provided in the English act, and as there is in our act no clause similar to the 5th section of the English act which provides for rectification of the registry in the event of an entry upon it of a mark, &c., which could not in law be recognized as a trade mark, and in which therefore the person registering had not acquired any property, the result is that no relief can be given to any person except a person claiming a right to register as his own trade mark a mark or symbol which had been taken by another and already registered as his, and that in this latter case the party claiming to be the true owner of the trade mark registered by another can obtain relief only in the manner pointed out in the 15th section by petition to the Minister of Agriculture.\nIf this contention be sound there is no mode by which any relief can be obtained in a case where one trader should succeed in getting upon the registry as his trade mark a word, letter, or symbol in common use in the trade for the purpose of designating the nature, description or quality of an article upon which it is stamped, and in which word, letter or symbol, the principles of law established by decisions have laid down that no trader can acquire property as his trade mark. This, in fine, is the contention that to an action brought for infringement of any mark which has been registered as a trade mark, no defence whatever which calls in question the validity of the registrant\u2019s right to the exclusive use of it can be entertained, whatever may be the law upon that point as applied to the English act, in which ample provision is made sufficient for the rectification of every case of erroneous registration. The fact that like ample provision is not made in our act would rather seem to require that the court should hold that redress can be obtained in the form of defence to an action for infringement, rather than that the statute had rendered remediless a grievous wrong. There is no case, however, in which it has been adjudged in England that the procedure provided by the English statute is the only mode in which the registrant\u2019s title to the mark as registered by him can be disputed, and that it can not be disputed by way of defence to an action for alleged infringement. The only authority bearing upon the point would seem to lead rather to the conclusion, that in a case where a mark gets upon the registry as a trade mark which cannot, in accordance with the established principles of decided cases, be recognized as a trade mark a defendant in an action for alleged infringement of such a registered mark may call in question the registrant\u2019s title to the exclusive use of it as his property.\nSir George Jessel, M.R. in Palmer\u2019s trade mark case[29] quotes with approbation the observations of Sebastian and Bryce, text writers upon the subject of trade marks and their registration, as follows:\u2014\nSebastian says:\u2014\nThe registration as a trade mark of a name of this description (which could not be a trade mark) will sometimes complicate the question, as such registration is to be prim\u00e2 facie evidence, and after five years\u2019 registration conclusive evidence, of the right of the registered owner to the exclusive use of such trade mark, but this enactment does not preclude a defence on the ground that the name so registered is in fact no trade mark and was registered or is continued on the register by error.\nSo Mr. Bryce says:\nAfter the expiry of five years the right of the registered proprietor becomes absolute and cannot be disputed by a defendant. But it is apprehended that after, no less than before, the expiry of the five years, the right of the registered proprietor may be contested on any ground going to show that the mark ought never to have been registered at all, for example that it is not a trade mark within the meaning of the Act.\nSo both writers on the subject take the same view and go so far as to think that if a description which is not capable of being a trade mark is registered, a person who sells goods under that description and is sued may defend himself on the ground that it is not a trade mark though it has been five years on the register. That question has not been argued before us and we have not to decide it, but I am not by any means prepared to say that those distinguished writers are wrong, because the Act only says that after five years the person who has registered a trade mark shall be entitled to the trade mark but does not say that the mark as registered shall be deemed to be a trade mark.\nAnd Lindley J. says:\u2014\nI will only add that I have availed myself of the opportunity afforded by the adjournment of the court of looking into some of the cases which have been decided upon similar provisions in other acts which render certificates conclusive. Thus the Companies\u2019 Act, 1862, makes the Registrar\u2019s certificate conclusive of the incorporation of a company, but that has been held to be confined to companies capable of being registered. There are other similar enactments which have received a similar construction. After careful examination of Secs. 3, 5 and 10 of the Trade Marks\u2019 Registration Act, 1875, I am satisfied that a mark which is not a trade mark and which, therefore, ought never to have been registered does not become a trade mark by being on the register for five years.\u201d\nLord Justice Cotton concurred in the judgment of the Master of the Rolls. Such being the opinion of those learned judges I cannot doubt that if the question had come before them in an action they must have decided that the objection taken to the registration of the words \u201cbraided fixed stars\u201d could have been raised by the defendant in such action, for if the statute does not authorise the registration of any name or mark which is not capable of being a good trade mark, it must be only in a trade mark authorised by the statute to be registered that the statute confers on the proprietor thereof the exclusive use. Registration of a word or symbol which is not authorised by the statute to be registered as a trade mark cannot confer upon the registrant thereof a benefit which the statute annexes only to trade marks and the proprietors thereof. Eventually, in 24 Ch. D. 514, it was held that the words \u201cbraided fixed stars\u201d were not words which the statute had authorised to be registered as a trade mark and, for that reason, the registration was ordered to be expunged.\nWhen it appears that the word registered is not capable of being a trade mark and, for that reason, the statute had not authorised it to be registered, being registered in defiance of the authority of the statute, the statute surely cannot be appealed to as annexing to it a property which it only annexes to what it has authorised to be registered\u2014namely, good trade marks; and, therefore, to an action complaining of an illegal use by the defendant of such a word so illegally registered, the defence that the use by the defendant was not illegal because, the word not being one which the statute had authorised to be registered, the statute had annexed no benefit to its registration, must be open.\nThat it is open under our statute is, in my opinion, the reasonable and necessary and, indeed, literal construction of the statute. The language of Lord Selborne in Leonard and Ellis v. Wells[30] with respect to the word \u201cValvoline\u201d is quite applicable to the present case; he there says:\u2014\nSo long as the word \u201cvalvoline\u201d is not used in such a manner as to represent that the article sold under that name is manufactured by the plaintiffs or by persons identified in business with the plaintiffs, it seems to me that the use of it cannot be restrained.\nSo, likewise, is the language of Fry L.J. in the same case; he says at p. 305:\u2014\nThen, upon the application for an injunction, the real question is this: \u2018Are the defendants selling their manufacture as and for the manufacture of the plaintiffs?\u2019 Now if the word \u201cValvoline\u201d had come to mean that the article so designated was manufactured by the plaintiffs they, prim\u00e2 facie, would have been entitled to an injunction.\nAs, however, the defendants were using the term not as meaning an oil made by the plaintiffs, but a particular kind of oil, it was held that they could not be restrained from using the word but were at liberty to manufacture that kind of oil, and to sell it under that name. So, likewise, the language of Lord Justice Cotton, in Edwards v. Dennis[31], is exceedingly appropriate to the present case, where he says\u2014\nA trade mark is a mark used to distinguish the goods of the person who uses it, and the act appears to contemplate a user of the particular mark contemporaneously with, if not before, registration.\nAnd again:\u2014\nThe person with whom the act is dealing is a person who would have been entitled under the old law to bring an action for infringement of his trade mark, that is to say, a trade mark actually used by him.\nConstruing now the Dominion statute, 42 Vic. c. 22, by the right of the principles established by these decisions, we find by the first section that the register authorised to be kept is of \u201ctrade marks\u201d only; and that it is only a proprietor of a \u201ctrade mark\u201d who is authorised to have his trade mark registered. That section provides the proceedings to be adopted by \u201cthe proprietor of a trade mark\u201d to have it registered. By the 7th section the Minister of Agriculture is authorised only to register the trade mark of a proprietor thereof and by the 8th section it is enacted that for the purposes of the act \u201call marks, names, brands, labels, packages or other business devices which may be adopted for use by any person in his trade for the purpose of distinguishing any manufacture, product or article by him manufactured, &c., &c., shall be considered and known as trade marks and may be registered for the exclusive use of the party registering the same in the manner herein provided.\u201d\nThen by the 17th section it is the \u201cproprietor of a trade mark\u201d who is given an action against any person using his registered trade mark, or any fraudulent imitation thereof, and by the 4th section it is enacted that:\nNo person shall be entitled to institute any proceeding to prevent the infringement of any \u201ctrade mark\u201d until and unless such \u201ctrade mark\u201d is registered in pursuance of this Act.\nWe see, therefore, that the statute expresses, sufficiently clearly as I think, that the only action which the statute authorises to be brought as for an infringement of a trade mark is one which must be brought by the \u201cproprietor of the trade mark\u201d who has registered under the provisions of the statute the \u201ctrademark\u201d of which independently of registration he was the \u201cproprietor,\u201d and that no name, brand, &c., &c., which may not be adopted by a trader for the purpose of distinguishing his goods from the goods of a rival trader, shall be considered to be a trade mark or capable of being registered for the exclusive use of the party registering.\nNow, as the words \u201cGold leaf\u201d stamped on flour was a brand in common use in the trade for the purpose of designating the quality merely of the flour, and the process by which it was manufactured, namely, by \u201croller mill process\u201d or \u201cpatent process,\u201d and not at all for the purpose of distinguishing the manufacture of the plaintiff, or of any miller in particular from the manufacture of any other, that word could not have been adopted by the plaintiff as his special property or trade mark; and it was not a trade mark within the meaning of the statute, and could not be registered for the exclusive use of the person registering, Registration therefore of such word could not vest in the plaintiff a right to the exclusive use of it as if it were a trade mark. The plaintiff\u2019s contention, that by registering the word he could take it out of its common use and make it his own special property, (to use the language of Sir George Jessel In re Hyde\u2019s trade mark[32], applied to somewhat similar facts), is not the law. The defendants in the present case do not dispute the plaintiff\u2019s right to have adopted as his trade mark, and to have registered as such in connection with the words \u201cGold leaf\u201d (as descriptive of quality), the words on his label, which are adequate to distinguish flour of his manufacture of the known description, or quality of \u201cGold leaf\u201d from that of all other manufacturers, namely, \u201cIngersoll Roller Mills, Ont., Can.,\u201d and \u201cWm. Partlo.\u201d On the contrary, this is what the defendants contend is precisely what he has done, and as appears by his application for registry, wherein he says, in effect, that the words \u201cGold leaf\u201d designate \u201ca particular brand of flour denoting the quality thereof,\u201d not that they are used to distinguish the manufacture of the plaintiff from that of other manufacturers of flour of the same description and quality. The evidence, however, shows that the defendants have not, upon any flour sold by them, ever used any part of these words which the plaintiff has used on his label as distinguishing his manufacture from the manufac- ture of other persons, and that in point of fact they never have sold any flour under circumstances which could induce any persons to suppose that they were purchasing the manufacture of the plaintiff.\nThe appeal, therefore, in my opinion, must be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellant: Hegler & Jackson.\nSolicitors for respondents: Ball & Ball.\n[1] 14 Ont.

P., passed on the 28th April, 1881, acquired the said lot of land No. 11, of the said St. Charles concession, as proprietors, subject however to all of the leases above mentioned.\nThe prayer of the declaration was the usual one in actions of bornage praying to have the boundaries of all of the said properties established and the bornes planted.\nThe defendants declared that they were ready to bound in accordance with the rights acquired by title and possession of themselves and their auteurs; and by consent of all the parties, three surveyors were appointed by the court, each of whom made a separate report. By the judgment of the Superior Court at Beauce the plan and report of the surveyor Legendre were adopted.\nThe reports, plans and evidence are referred to at length in the judgments hereinafter given.\nD. McCarthy Q. C., and Gibson Q. C., appeared on behalf of the appellants: and Pentland Q. C., and Fitzpatrick, on behalf of the respondents.\nThe points of argument relied on and cases cited by counsel are referred to in the judgments.\nSIR W. J. RITCHIE C.J.\u2014As the majority of the court think that this appeal should be dismissed (the surveyors appointed by the court having all differed in their reports and the courts having adopted Legendre's report) I am not able to say that the judgments of the courts below are so clearly wrong as to justify me in reversing them.\nSTRONG J. -The evidence establishes that Boissoneau and Poulin deliberately adopted Proulx's lines and survey as shown by the photographed plan (found amongst Proulx's papers after Legendre's survey was made but duly put in proof) and that Legendre, not having this plan before him, after ascertaining the lines of Proulx's survey as well as he could by the testimony of witnesses, made his plan which the Court of Appeal have homologated upon what he assumed and found from evidence to be Proulx's lines but which. when Proulx's plan was afterwards discovered, were found to give the appellants rather more than they were entitled to according to Proulx's survey, and so to prejudice the respondents to a small extent of which, however, they do not complain. Therefore as the \" auteurs \" of both the parties, the appellants and the respondents i.e. Boissoneau the appellants' \"auteur\" and Poulin the respondents' \"auteur,\" adopted these lines which Legendre's plan establishes and according to which Poulin, with the express assent of Boissoneau, sold to the respondents or their \" auteurs; \" and inasmuch as the acqu\u00e9reurs from Poulin bought on the faith of this plan of Proulx's and have worked mines made improvements and expended large sums of money, all on the strength and faith of the assurance and representation of Boissoneau that he acquiesced in and would be bound by Proulx's survey it is out of the question to say that the appellants can now be per-mitted to return on what their predecessor in title Boissoneau agreed to, and question the accuracy of the survey he deliberately adopted. They are met by what in English law is technically called an estoppel and cannot now be heard to repudiate Boissoneau's acts and agreements. There is no technical difficulty in the way of adopting this view of the case for Proulx's plan was a sufficient commencement of proof and the fact of the possession could of course be proved by testimony. For these reasons I am of opinion that the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench homologating Legendre's survey was entirely right and should be affirmed with costs.\nFournier J.\u2014Par leur action en cette cause les appelants ont demand\u00e9 le bornage judiciaire des immeubles d\u00e9crits dans leur d\u00e9claration, appartenant respectivements aux parties en cette cause. Les d\u00e9fendeurs, pr\u00e9sents intim\u00e9s, ont r\u00e9pondu \u00e0 cette demande par une d\u00e9claration invoquant un jugement rendu par l'honorable juge Angers, entre les parties en cette cause, lesquelles \u00e9taient aussi les parties dans une demande d'injonction ayant pour but de contraindre les intim\u00e9s \u00e0 cesser d'exploiter comme terrain minier le lopin de terre \u00e0 raison duquel s'\u00e9l\u00e8ve la principale difficult\u00e9 au sujet du bornage des immeubles en question. Dans cette d\u00e9claration ils out invoqu\u00e9 un bornage par les auteurs des appelants ant\u00e9rieur au jugement de l'ho-norabee juge Angers, sur lequel ils fondent une all\u00e9gation de chose jug\u00e9e, d\u00e9clarant en outre que sans renoncer \u00e0 leurs droits acquis en vertu de ce jugement, ils sont encore pr\u00eats comme ils l'ont toujours \u00e9t\u00e9, \u00e0 borner suivant la loi.\nLes parties d\u00e9rivent d'un auteur commun, Joseph Poulin, leurs titres aux propri\u00e9t\u00e9s dont le bornage est demand\u00e9 et qui sont d\u00e9crites comme suit dans le Special Case, sign\u00e9 par les deux parties ([2]).\nApr\u00e8s la production de la d\u00e9claration des intim\u00e9s, les appelants firent une motion pour r\u00e9f\u00e9rer la cause \u00e0 des arpenteurs experts, sur laquelle le jugement suivant fut prononc\u00e9:\nIn the presence of the said parties, or in their absence after due notification to them given in the manner required by this court, to draw the boundary line of separation and division between the contiguous lands of the plaintiffs and defendants mentioned and described in the title deeds of the parties cited in their declaration in this cause, and fyled in this cause by the plaintiffs: the said surveyor or surveyors to have communication of the record in this cause especially of all deeds fyled, and also of the titles herewith fyled, being deed of lease passed before Ls. Blanchet, N. P., on the twelfth of October, eighteen hundred and seventy-six, from Joseph Poulin to Edward Sands.\nR\u00e9siliation of said deed before same Notary, passed on the seventeenth day of March, eighteen hundred and seventy-nine, and deed of lease passed before same Notary, on the eleventh day of February, eighteen hundred and seventy-nine, from Joseph Poulin to James Forgie, with power also to examine witnesses if required to establish any pretention of the parties which may be made at the time of the survey, the said surveyor or surveyors to prepare a plan of the locality and properties aforesaid, showing the respective pretentions of the parties and indicating the localities of the said boundaries and division lines between all the said properties according to the titles of the said parties, the said surveyor or surveyors to produce and fyle the said plan with a report or reports thereon, and of the proceedings by them taken in the preparation of the said I 3lan.\nMM. Sewell, Legendre et Ross, arpenteurs de profession, ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 nomm\u00e9s pour proc\u00e9der \u00e0 l'ex\u00e9cution de ce jugement interlocutoire, et n'ayant pu s'entendre sur un rapport commun, firent des rapports s\u00e9par\u00e9s, dans lesquels ils en sont arriv\u00e9s \u00e0 des conclusions contradictoires Ce r\u00e9sultat \u00e9tait in\u00e9vitable car chacun d'eux a pris un point de vue diff\u00e9rent de l'autre, suivant l'interpr\u00e9tation qu'il a donn\u00e9e \u00e0 l'acte du 27 juin 1876, sur lequel repose toute la difficult\u00e9. La description du terrain baill\u00e9 par cet acte est donn\u00e9e plus haut sous le num\u00e9ro 1. Il est borne par le nord-ouest au terrain de Ned Sands par le nord-est au bout des dits deux arpents en suivant la course d'une certaine veine de quartz; par le sud-est \u00e0 la terre de Georges Veilleux, et par le sud-ouest au bailleur. Il est ensuite donn\u00e9 \u00e0 l'acqu\u00e9reur la facult\u00e9 de changer la course des lignes en ces termes: \" pourra cependant, le dit acqu\u00e9reur changer la course des lignes et bornes du dit lopin de terre, sans en augmenter l'\u00e9tendue ou superficie, en suivant dans ce cas la course ou ligne de la dite veine de quartz qu'il peut y avoir, et se rencontrer en cet endroit apr\u00e8s que lui le dit bailleur aura prospect\u00e9 le dit lopin de terre sus-baill\u00e9.\" Comme on le voit la ligne par le nord-ouest doit diviser le terrain en question de celui de Ned Sands, et courir deux arpents pour rejoindre au nord-est la ligne de division entre le bailleur et Georges Veilleux son voisin propri\u00e9taire du No. 10 et par le sud-ouest au bailleur. N'\u00e9tait la facult\u00e9 accord\u00e9e comme On vient de le voir, de changer les lignes en suivant la course d'une certaine veine de quartz ii ne pourrait y avoir de difficult\u00e9 \u00e0 localiser et borner le terrain en question.\nQuelle peut \u00eatre la v\u00e9ritable signification \u00e0 donner \u00e0 l'option ainsi accord\u00e9e? Peut-elle, comme le pr\u00e9tendent les appelants, \u00eatre exerc\u00e9e en tout temps et quand bon leur semble, et une fois exerc\u00e9e, peuvent-ils encore changer les lignes et bornes pour suivre la veine de quartz \u00e0 mesure qu'ils la d\u00e9couvrent en poursuivant leurs travaux souterrains. Ou bien ne devait-elle pas suivant la pr\u00e9tention des intim\u00e9s, \u00eatre exerc\u00e9e une fois pour toutes et les lignes demeurer ensuite fix\u00e9es et d\u00e9termin\u00e9es ? La limite \u00e0 l'exercice de cette facult\u00e9 me para\u00eet avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9termin\u00e9e par la convention m\u00eame qui impose an preneur l'obligation de faire son option \u00e2pres que lui le dit preneur aura prospect\u00e9 le dit lopin de terre sus-oaill\u00e9.\nLe preneur et ses associ\u00e9s out pris possession du terrain en question et y out travaill\u00e9 \u00e0 l'exploitation de l'or pendant plusieurs ann\u00e9es, jusqu'\u00e0 ce qu'ils aient vendu aux pr\u00e9sents appelants. Leur possession, sans trouble a d\u00e9termina les limites du terrain en question, qui plus tard ont \u00e9t\u00e9 fix\u00e9es d'une mani\u00e8re plus certaine par l'arpenteur Proulx. C'est cette op\u00e9ration que les intimes ont invoqu\u00e9 dans leur d\u00e9claration en r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 l'action, comme un bornage ant\u00e9rieur, en se d\u00e9clarant toutefois pr\u00eat \u00e0 borner de nouveau, mais suivant la possession telle qu'elle avait alors \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9termin\u00e9e Il est clair que cette op\u00e9ration o\u00f9 toutes les parties int\u00e9ress\u00e9es n'\u00e9taient pas pr\u00e9sentes on repr\u00e9sent\u00e9es, ne peut emp\u00eacher le bornage judiciaire, mais elle peut \u00eatre invoqu\u00e9e comme preuve de la possession des auteurs des appelants et servir \u00e0 fixer les bornes et limites de leur terrain suivant la possession qu'en out en leurs auteurs, Louis St Onge et ses associ\u00e9s, maintenant repr\u00e9sent\u00e9s par les appelants.\nLa pi\u00e8ce No 5 du dossier est un plan de l'op\u00e9ration de l'arpenteur Proulx pour fixer les lignes des terrains en question. Il n'y a pas eu de proc\u00e8s-verbal de l\u2019op\u00e9ration du moins ii n'en a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 produit, mais l'op\u00e9ration parait avoir donn\u00e9 pleine satisfaction aux seules parties int\u00e9ress\u00e9es \u00e0 cette \u00e9poque, le bailleur Poulin et le preneur Louis St-Onge, comme on va le voir par leurs t\u00e9moignages, approuvant positivement l'op\u00e9ration d\u00e9 l'arpenteur Proulx.\nLe principal int\u00e9ress\u00e9, Louis St-Onge, dit:\nLe morceau de terrain en question n'\u00e9tait pas divis\u00e9, alors M. Lock-wood a fait diviser ce terrain apr\u00e8s que je l'ai achet\u00e9. Quand cette ligne a \u00e9t\u00e9 tir\u00e9e par M. Lockwood je l'ai accept\u00e9e comme notre borne; j'ai accept\u00e9 cette ligne telle quelle \u00e9tait, a tout risque, parce crue je croyais qu'on \u00e9tait alors sur la course de l'or\nQuoiqu'il ne puisse dire la date \u00e0 laquelle cette ligne a \u00e9t\u00e9 trac\u00e9e, il salt que c'est apr\u00e8s son acquisition, et que d'apr\u00e8s leurs op\u00e9rations ils se croyaient sur la course de l'or. Cette date est fix\u00e9e au 14 novembre 1876, dans le plan de Proulx, un peu plus de quatre mois apr\u00e8s la date du bail du 27 juin 1876. Il ajoute:\nQuand Lockwood a tire sa ligne, ii y a plant\u00e9 des piquets tout le long de notre terrain\nA la question suivante:\nY a-t-il eu un bornage entre vous et Poulin ?\nIl r\u00e9pond comme suit '.\nR\u00e9ponse.\u2014Non, mais le bornage a \u00e9t\u00e9 tel comme ceci: On s'est arrang\u00e9 avec M. Lockwood pour le droit de miner et de travailler la grandeur qu'on avait chez Poulin, et c'est l\u00e0 que M. Lockwood a fait tirer la ligne, et c'est l\u00e0 qu'on a compris que la ligne \u00e9tait tir\u00e9e entre Poulin et nous autres. En tirant la ligne avec Lockwood, on comprenait qu'on prenait seulement notre terrain. Quand je dis qu'on comprenait je veux dire que moi et mes associ\u00e9s et Lockwood, nous comprenions que c'\u00e9tait l\u00e0 notre ligne. Poulin n'est pas intervenu dans cette ligne, mais il savait qu'on la tirait.\nPour bien comprendre toute la valeur de ce t\u00e9moignage, il ne faut pas perdre de vue le r\u00f4le important de M. Lockwood dans cet arrangement au sujet de la; ligne. Il \u00e9tait alors le g\u00e9rant de la compagnie des mines d'or De Lery. Cette compagnie comme on sait, avait acquis les droits aux mines d'or, appartenant au Seigneurs de Lery, en vertu d'une patente de la Couronne. Ce droit fut longtemps contest\u00e9 par les propri\u00e9taires du sol r\u00e9clamant pour eux le droit aux mines d'or qui se trouvaient dans leurs propri\u00e9t\u00e9s. Il n'\u00e9tait pas encore reconnu \u00e0 cette \u00e9poque, parce que les tribunaux n'avaient pas encore d\u00e9cid\u00e9 la question de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 des mines en faveur de la compagnie. C'est ce qui explique l'arrangement avec M. Lockwood, repr\u00e9sentant de la compagnie pour le droit de miner et travailler la grandeur qu'on avait caliez Poulin. Sans un arrangement \u00e0 cet effet St. Onge et ses associ\u00e9s ne pouvaient travailler sur leur propre terrain. Cet arrangement fut fait avec le propri\u00e9taire en titre, Louis St. Onge, et \u00e2pres la ligne ainsi tir\u00e9e lui et ses associ\u00e9s ont travaill\u00e9 et poss\u00e9d\u00e9 leur terrain sans trouble comme il le dit:\nApr\u00e8s que la ligne de Lockwood a \u00e9t\u00e9 tir\u00e9e je sais que Poulin en a eu connaissance, mais je ne me rappelle pas s'il l'a accept\u00e9e formellement, toujours est-il qu'on a travaill\u00e9 notre terrain et nous n'avons pas \u00e9t\u00e9 troubles par personne.\nLa seule personne int\u00e9ress\u00e9e \u00e0 se plaindre de cette op\u00e9ration aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 le bailleur Joseph Poulin, proprio-Catie d'un terrain voisin; mais loin d'en manifester aucun m\u00e9contentement ii s'est au contraire d\u00e9clar\u00e9 satisfait, comme ii le dit dans son t\u00e9moignage.\nJ'ai vu la ligne tir\u00e9e par Proulx, l'arpenteur, apr\u00e8s qu'elle l'a \u00e9t\u00e9, et je n'\u00e9tais pas pr\u00e9sent dans le temps qu'elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 tir\u00e9e. Je ne sais pus s'il y a en un proc\u00e9s-verbal, je n'en ai pas sign\u00e9, dans le temps j'ai vu la ligne tir\u00e9e par Proulx et j'en ai \u00e9t\u00e9 content.\nSt. Onge travaillait sur le terrain en question dans ce temps-l\u00e0 et ii ne m'a jamais parl\u00e9 que la ligne n'\u00e9tait pas bonne, c'est eux-m\u00eames qui l'ont pris. Je Peux vous montrer \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s la ligne sud-ouest, l\u00e0 o\u00f9 on rencontre la terre de Veilleux. Ces deux t\u00e9moignages positifs \u00e9tablissent incontestablement deux faits de la plus haute importance. 10. la ligne tir\u00e9e par l'arpenteur Proulx, en suivant une course oblique de la ligne de Sands \u00e0 celle de Veilleux, au lieu d'une ligne \u00e0 angle droit entre ces deux points indiqu\u00e9s, \u00e0 laquelle les seuls int\u00e9ress\u00e9s, St. Onge et Poulin out donn\u00e9 une adh\u00e9sion formelle; 20. le fait de la possession et de l'exploitation. Ainsi, c'est non seulement apr\u00e8s avoir \" prospect\u00e9,\" mais alp\u00e9s avoir fait constater les lignes de son terrain par Proulx, que Louis St. Onge en a pris possession et l'a exploit\u00e9 avec ses associ\u00e9s, pendant plus de quatre ans avant de le vendre aux appelants. Il n'\u00e9tait pas possible de donner une preuve plus positive et plus certaine de l'exercice du droit r\u00e9serv\u00e9 de changer les lignes.\nLes appelants out vainement essay\u00e9 d'\u00e9branler cette position en se fondant sur le t\u00e9moignage d'Amable Coupai, un des membres de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 St-Onge, qui dit avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent au bornage et d\u00e9clare qu'il n'a jamais consid\u00e9r\u00e9 cette ligne de Lockwood comme ligne de leur terrain et qu'ils l'ont d\u00e9pass\u00e9e par place. S'il \u00e9tait pr\u00e9sent, comme il le dit, il ne parait pas avoir fait alors aucune objection du moins Louis St. Onge le propri\u00e9taire en titre et le seul autoris\u00e9 \u00e0 consentir \u00e0 l'op\u00e9ration n'en fait aucune mention. Coupal dit encore qu'on se disputait parce qu'on ne voulait pas faire borner par Lockwood. Il a, sans doute Pu avoir quelque h\u00e9sitation en voyant l'intervention de Lockwood, repr\u00e9sentant de la compagnie, \u00e0 qui appartenait la mine d'or; mais St. Onge, le propri\u00e9taire, n'en a pas eu, car on a vu dans son t\u00e9moignage que cc bornage avait \u00e9t\u00e9 le sujet d'un arrangement qui lui assurait de la part de l'agent de la compagnie De Lery le droit d'exploiter l'or. Toutefois Coupal confirme la preuve de l'acceptation de ce bornage en disant: \" On a accept\u00e9e \" le bornage de Lockwood, mais pour ne pas d\u00e9ranger \"notre contrat.\" Ce motif fait voir que d\u00e9j\u00e0 on s'en tenait \u00e0 la possession qu'on avait prise d'apr\u00e8s le contrat, et que la crainte exprim\u00e9e, si toutefois elle l'a \u00e9t\u00e9 alors, par Coupal \u00e9tait vaine, puisque l'op\u00e9ration de bornage de Proulx n'a fait que les confirmer dans leur possession conforme au contrat et qu'ils l'ont ainsi continu\u00e9e \"jusqu'\u00e0 ce qu'ils aient vendu aux appelants. Cette possession a dur\u00e9 depuis la date de leur acquisition, 27 juin 1876, jusqu'\u00e0 la date de leurs ventes respectives aux appelants, en septembre 1880.\nEn se d\u00e9clarant pr\u00eats \u00e0 borner suivant la loi, comme ils l'ont fait par leur r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 l'action, les intim\u00e9s n'ont pas dit autre chose qu'ils borneraient d'apr\u00e8s leurs titres, leur possession et celle de leurs auteurs.\nC'est la signification des expressions dont ils se sont servis. Si le bornage de Proulx n'a pas l'autorit\u00e9 l\u00e9gale suffisante pour emp\u00eacher un bornage en justice, ii \u00e9tablit du moins avec la preuve de la possession le droit des intim\u00e9s \u00e0 un bornage suivant leur titre et leur possession qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 conforme au plan de Proulx. On ne peut certainement pas les d\u00e9ranger de cette position. C'est cependant la pr\u00e9tention des appelants qui sans tenir aucun compte du bornage, de la possession pendant plusieurs ann\u00e9es, ni de l'option exerc\u00e9e, voudraient faire faire aujourd'hui le bornage comme s'ils avaient encore le droit de changer les lignes. Cette facult\u00e9 n'existant plus le bornage doit \u00eatre fait conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la possession et au titre de leurs auteurs, car la possession doit servir \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer le lieu o\u00f9 il devait \u00eatre plant\u00e9 des bornes. Duranton ([3]). C'est le principe adopt\u00e9 par l'arpenteur Legendre dans le rapport qu'il a fait accompagn\u00e9 d'un plan, montrant les endroits o\u00f9 les immeubles en question doivent \u00eatre born\u00e9s Son rapport est fond\u00e9 sur les t\u00e9moignages cites plus haut, de Louis St. Onge le preneur, et de Joseph Poulin le bailleur.\nEn face de cette preuve il m'a sembl\u00e9 (dit-il) devoir baser mon rapport sur ces donn\u00e9es et travailler avec soin \u00e0 retracer le plus correctement possible les lignes tir\u00e9es par l'arpenteur Proulx.\nCe dernier n'ayant pas plant\u00e9 de bornes permanentes, il n'est pas surprenante que les t\u00e9moins n'aient pas \u00e9t\u00e9 d'accord \u00e0 les retracer exactement, car la face du terrain a \u00e9t\u00e9 bien chang\u00e9e et boulevers\u00e9e depuis ce temps-l\u00e0. Ayant \u00e0 choisir entre les diff\u00e9rentes lignes mentionn\u00e9es par les t\u00e9moins, soit la ligne E. D. indiqu\u00e9e par George Th\u00e9rien et Joseph Poulin, soit la ligne E. B. indiqu\u00e9e par Louis St. Onge, ou la ligne N. E. indiqu\u00e9e par Anthony Miller, il a donn\u00e9 la pr\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 la ligne E. B. indiqu\u00e9e par Louis St. Onge,\nParce que le t\u00e9moin \u00e9tant sur les lieux lors du trac\u00e9 des premieres lignes; et ayant exploit\u00e9 pour des fins mini\u00e8res ce lopin de terre pendant plusieurs ann\u00e9es, il doit \u00eatre plus en \u00e9tat qu'aucun autre t\u00e9moin, qui n'a vu ces lignes qu'en passant, de fixer la place primitive de leur trace.\nJ'ai ensuite tire la ligne I. A. parall\u00e8lement \u00e0 la ligne E. B., donnant ainsi au dit lopin de terre trois quarts d'arpent de front, ce qui d'apr\u00e8s moi r\u00e9pond parfaitement aux limites et mesures mentionn\u00e9es dans le bail et fix\u00e9es par consentement des parties\nCette conclusion est certainement correcte puisqu'elle est conforme non seulement aux mesures et limites mentionn\u00e9es dans le bail du 27 juin 1876, mais parce-qu'elle l'est aussi au plan de Proulx, ou du moins s'en rapproche beaucoup, ainsi qu'\u00e0 la possession de la compagnie St. Onge, auteurs des appelants.\nIl explique ensuite la diff\u00e9rence d'\u00e9tendue du placer (claim) repr\u00e9sent\u00e9 sur son plan par les lettres J K L B, baill\u00e9 aux auteurs de D. W. Brown, par l'acte du IT mars 1879, auquel il donne un arpent quatre-vingt-cinq perches, tandis qu'il est limit\u00e9 par le contrat \u00e0 un arpent, plus ou moins. 11 attribue cette diff\u00e9rence \u00e0 ce que les parties n'ont jamais mesur\u00e9 le terrain en question avant la transaction. L'arpenteur Sewell, partant d'une fausse interpr\u00e9tatation du bail du 27 juin 1876 est arriv\u00e9 \u00e0 une conclusion bien diff\u00e9rente de celle do Legendre, et tout-\u00e0-fait en contradiction avec le titre et les faits prouv\u00e9s. Le titre, comme on l'a vu, donne au lopin en question trois quarts d'arpent de front sur environ deux arpents de profondeur, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire, les deux arpents qui restent \u00e0 partir do la ligne do Sands \u00e0 aller \u00e0 celle do Veilleux. Les lignes do ce lot, sur sa profondeur, sans la r\u00e9serve accord\u00e9e do suivre la veine do quartz, auraient d\u00fb \u00eatre trac\u00e9es en ligne directe do celle do Sands \u00e0 celle de Veilleux. Au lieu do cela, St. Onge en prenant possession ayant exerc\u00e9 son droit d'option do changer les lignes les a fait tirer par Proulx dans une direction diagonale, au lieu d'une ligne \u00e0 angle droit sur celles do Sands et Veilleux, parce qu'il se croyait, comme il le dit dans son t\u00e9moignage dans la direction do l'or.\nMalgr\u00e9 l'exercice bien prouv\u00e9 do cette option, Sewell se fondant plut\u00f4t sur des travaux souterrains post\u00e9rieurs quo sur la possession do St. Onge, a, sous pr\u00e9texte de suivre la veine d'or, trace une ligne partant, il est vrai, du memo point A., sur la ligne de Sands, adopt\u00e9 par les trois arpenteurs, et lui fait suivre une course l\u00e9g\u00e8rement diagonale qui se prolonge au del\u00e0 do la rivi\u00e8re Gilbert, \u00e0 une distance d'au del\u00e0 de quatre arpents. Il est vrai qu'il arrive l\u00e0 aussi \u00e0 toucher la ligne do Veilleux. Il aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 tout aussi raisonnable do conduire cette ligne jusqu'\u00e0 l'extr\u00e9mit\u00e9 de la terre do Veilleux, o\u00f9 elle aurait encore pu toucher la ligne lat\u00e9rale qui la s\u00e9pare du No 11 Le titre no fait aucune mention do la rivi\u00e8re Gilbert dans sa d\u00e9signation du lot ii donne an contraire des lignes bien clairement indiqu\u00e9es celle do Sands d'o\u00f9 ii faut \"partir pour arriver \u00e0 celle do Veilleux, avec l'option do changer la direction sans toutefois augmenter l'\u00e9tendue en superficie du terrain conc\u00e9d\u00e9. Il est vrai qu'avec l'option accord\u00e9e on ne peut pas se d\u00e9partir des lignes directes entre Sands et Veilleux, pour adopter une ligne oblique sans donner an lot plus de deux arpents d'une ligne \u00e0 l'autre de Sands \u00e0 Veilleux. Mais outre que ce changement a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait lors de l'arpentage de Proulx, avec le consentement on du moins l'approbation de tous les int\u00e9ress\u00e9s, s'il \u00e9tait \u00e0 faire aujourd'hui ne faudrait-il pas le faire conform\u00e9ment au titre c'est-\u00e0-dire, sans augmenter l'\u00e9tendue en superficie. L'op\u00e9ration de Sewell a pour effet de donner au lot en question quatre arpents et 58 perches, an lieu de trois quarts de front sur deux de profondeur, on une superficie d'un arpent et demi. Ce r\u00e9sultat d\u00e9montre \u00e0 l'\u00e9vidence l'absurdit\u00e9 du rapport de Sewell.\nPour changer les lignes adopt\u00e9es lors de l'arpentage de Proulx, on ne peut pas dans l'int\u00e9r\u00eat des appelants pr\u00e9tendre que St. Onge s'est tromp\u00e9 sur la direction de la veine d'or. On a vu, an contraire, par la preuve ci-dessus cit\u00e9e que ce choix a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9ment. St. Onge dit \u00e0 ce sujet:\nQuand la ligne a \u00e9t\u00e9 tir\u00e9e par M. Lockwood je l'ai accept\u00e9e comme notre borne, j'ai accept\u00e9 la ligne telle qu'elle \u00e9tait \u00e0 tout risque, parce que je croyais qu'on \u00e9tait alors sur la course de l'or Notre intention \u00e9tait de travailler \u00e0 percer des puits (shafts) pour avoir l'or d'alluvion. Ce n'\u00e9tait pas notre intention d'acheter une veine de quartz.\nCoupai, l'un des associ\u00e9s, dit:\nC'\u00e9tait notre intention d'acheter le terrain entre la ligne de Sands et la ligne de Veilleux, on a pris trois quarts d'arpents, plus ou moins, joignant d'une ligne \u00e0 l'autre. Notre intention \u00e9tait d'acheter l'or d'alluvion qui se trouverait sur le morceau de terre achet\u00e9\nD'apr\u00e8s cela il est \u00e9vident qu'il n'y a pas eu d'erreur dans le choix qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait des lignes de Proulx,\u2014mais lors m\u00eame qu'il y aurait en erreur de calcul de leur part, en exploitant l'or d'alluvion de pr\u00e9f\u00e9re nce \u00e0 la veine de quartz, cela n'emp\u00eache pas que leur choix a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait en connaissance de cause puisqu'ils disent tons que leur objet en achetant n'\u00e9tait pas d'exploiter une veine de quartz. Leur choix a eu l'effet non seulement de les lier aux lignes qu'ils ont adopt\u00e9es et d'apr\u00e8s lesquelles ils ont poss\u00e9d\u00e9, mais ii a \u00e9galement l'effet de lier les appelants, qui ne peuvent r\u00e9clamer plus de droits que leurs auteurs.\nOn aurait tort de consid\u00e9rer comme lignes \u00e9tablies par une convention verbale celles qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 trac\u00e9es par Proulx. Elles sont, an contraire, bas\u00e9es sur le bail du 27 juin 1876 et trac\u00e9es sp\u00e9cialement pour localiser le terrain baill\u00e9 \u00e9et c'est en ex\u00e9cution de la convention au sujet du pouvoir de changer les lignes et bornes que ces lignes ont \u00e9t\u00e9 trac\u00e9es diagonalement, parcequ'on croyait, en les adoptant, se trouver dans ha direction de ha veine d'or. Se serais fort enclin \u00e0 adopter le plan de Proulx, mais comme celui de Legendre s'en approche beaucoup et que, d'ailleurs, il donne au terrain en question les lignes modifi\u00e9es suivant l'option r\u00e9serv\u00e9e et l'\u00e9tendue mentionn\u00e9e dans le bail, j'en viens \u00e0 l'opinion avec la majorit\u00e9 de cette cour d'adopter le rapport de Legendre.\nLes parties poss\u00e8dent d'autres terrain dont le bornage est aussi demand\u00e9 mais leur location d\u00e9pendant de celle du terrain ci-dessus baille par l'acte du 27 juin 1876, Legendre leur a aussi assign\u00e9 leurs limites et bornes d'apr\u00e8s les titres des parties, \u00e0 l'exception du lot comprenant partie du lit de ha rivi\u00e8re Gilbert, dont il a omis d'indiquer les bornes. A l'argument, cette omission a \u00e9t\u00e9 signal\u00e9e et invoqu\u00e9e comme un moyen de faire rejeter son rapport. Cette omission a \u00e9t\u00e9 expliqu\u00e9e par le conseil des intim\u00e9s qui a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'il ne s'\u00e9tait \u00e9lev\u00e9 aucune difficult\u00e9 \u00e0 propos des autres lots et qu'il n'y en avait positivement aucune par rapport au lot ainsi omis. Le conseil des appelants en est convenu. L'arpenteur qui sera nomm\u00e9 pour planter les bornes conform\u00e9ment au rapport approuv\u00e9, pourra si les parties sont encore d'accord lors du r\u00e8glement de la minute du jugement recevoir instruction de placer aussi les bornes de ce lot.\nEn cons\u00e9quence de ce qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de je suis d'avis que le rapport de l'arpenteur Legendre doit \u00eatre homologu\u00e9 et l'appel renvoy\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens,\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014This was an action en bornage, by which the plaintiffs, now appellants, seek to have the boundaries of their property, which is contiguous to that of the defendants, now respondents, ascertained and determined.\nThe d\u00e9tendant by their plea declared that they were ready to bound in accordance with the rights acquired by title and possession of themselves and their auteurs; and by consent of all the parties, three surveyors were appointed by the court, each of whom made a separate report. By the judgment of the Superior Court the plan and report of the surveyor Legendre, which are in entire accord with the pretensions of the defendants, were adopted.\nThis judgment was confirmed in. appeal.\nThe facts are as follows:\nOne Joseph Poulin, being proprietor and in possession as such of lot 2, Concession St. Charles. Seigniory of Rigaud-Vaudreuil, which is supposed to contain three arpents in front by twenty-six arpents in depth, by deed before Blanchet, N. P. 12th October 1976 leased to one Edward Sands a portion of the said farm described in the said deed as follows:\nUn lopin de terre d'un arpent de front sur un arpent de profondeur, enclave dans la terre du bailleur,\nand whereof the said Sands was at the time in possession. On the 27th June, 1816, by deed before Blanchet, N. P., Poulin leased to Boissoneau (plaintiffs' now appellants' auteur) another portion of the said farm described in the deed as follows ([4]). and finally on the 11th March, 1879, by deed before Blanchet, N.P., defendants' (now respondents') auteurs] leased from the said Poulin another portion of the said farm described in their deed as follows ([5]).\nThere are different other deeds alleged in plaintiffs' declaration, and produced in the record, which show that the parties, plaintiffs and defendants, subsequently acquired other portions of the same lot for mining purposes, but the controversy turns specially upon the interpretation of the above cited deeds.\nThe respondents contend that if the language of the description of the land intended to be conveyed admits of two different constructions, the one making the quantity conveyed agree with the quantity mentioned in the deed, and the other making the quantity altogether different, the former construction must prevail. Herrick v. Sixby ([6]).\nWhat is the plaintiffs' (now appellants') mining claim and what are its bounds ?\nThe primary intention of the deed, and also Mr. William Sear's understanding of it, was that their claim was three-quarters of an arpent by two arpents, extending from Sands' claim on the north to Greorge Veilleux's or the division line between lots 10 and 11 on the south. it is well to remember that Mr. Smart was at one time the plaintiff's manager, and also their chief witness in this case.\nThis is shown by the fact that the whole lot was three arpents wide. Sands' claim covered one arpent and plaintiffs' had the balance adjoining Sands' and extending to Veilleux.\nNow where does plaintiffs lot begin ?\nEvidently at Sands' boundary line, the deed so states. The action of plaintiffs and their predecessors confirm this\u2014they worked up to Sands' lot. Chapman, a witness, says \" Sands' shaft was on a line between Sands' Company and St. Onge. St. Onge worked close to us viz: up to the drift made for the dividing line.\" Whether this drift was on the exact line of one arpent distant from the division line between lots 11 and 12 is of minor importance. This drift and the line are near enough for the purpose of this trial\u2014 Sands' claim as worked, was fully one arpent from the bank of the river\nNow according to the lease under which plaintiffs claim, they could run from Sands' claim two arpents, either directly across lot 11 South to lot 10 George Veilleux, or they could change the direction according to the lead but in no event could they extend two arpents in length or the distance from Sands' lot directly across to lot No. 10.\nHave the plaintiffs or their predecessors made a location of their claim in accordance with the terms of their deed which is as follows:\u2014\nPourra cependant le dit acqu\u00e9reur changer la courses des lignes et bornes du dit lopin de terme\u2014sans en augmenter l'\u00e9tendue ou superficie, etc., etc., apr\u00e8s que le bailleur aura prospect\u00e9 le dit lopin de terre ?\nSt. Onge, appellants auteur did so\u2014he so told George Th\u00e9rien, and showed him the pickets as put down by his surveyor, and told him that his upper line viz:. the one to the east from the river was along the line of Forgie & Co. and three-quarters of an arpent wide from the line. This conforms with the plan of Legendre.\nSt. Onge also informed Joseph Poulin of the same fact. Poulin asked them if they did not want to buy the land now in dispute viz: between their land and the river and between the canal on the north and division line between lots 10 and 11 on the south and they said \"no,\" and, further, they said to Poulin \"if you find a chance to sell, then sell, perhaps they will set up a wheel and that will serve us,\" viz: drain the water and assist us so much. That was before the present plaintiff had purchased.\nLouis and John St. Onge pointed out to Thomas Richards their location bounded on the east by the Forgie and Company line, and having a width of three-quarters of an arpent, the westerly line running close to their wheel shaft (McArthur's shaft No. 2 on plaintiffs' plan and D on defendants' plan). Mr. Richards says he thinks Mr. Smart was then present Mr. Smart does not deny this.\nThis Louis St. Onge held the title, and was manager after they formed a company. The evidence fixes the fact that the plaintiffs' lot was then definitely located. I think the courts below were right in adopting Legendre's plan and I would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nThe parties admitted at the hearing that Legendre's report was incomplete, as it did not include the born-, age of the other lots described as No. 3 in the special case. The necessary order to cover this omission is to go with the judgment, and the surveyor should be ordered also to put bornes between the parties' said lots if the parties agree where these bornes should be. The parties will see that this order is duly and correctly entered when the minutes are settled. If they do not agree as to the exact locality where these bornes should be then the judgment to stand as it is in the Superior Court.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014In the month of June 1876, one Poulin was seized of concession lot No. 11 in the St. Charles Division of the Seigniory of Rigaud-Vaudreuil. This lot was in the shape of a right angled parallelogram of about three arpents in width and twenty-six arpents in depth. The northerly and southerly limits or side lines of the lot cross a river known as the River Gilbert which traverses the whole width of the lot in an oblique devious course from the northerly to the southerly side line of the lot which latter line constitutes the boundary line between the said lot No 11 and lot No. 10 in the same concession then the property of one Veilleux. Through the lot No. 11 a vein of quartz containing gold passed or was supposed to pass from the northerly to the southerly side line of the lot, but in what precise course, as it was altogether some distance under the surface, was unknown. It was supposed, however, to be situate within the area of a square arpent of land measured off the northern extremity of the lot, the north-west angle of such arpent being at a point distant about one arpent from the north-easterly side of the River Gilbert as it crosses the northerly side line of the said lot. Being so seized the said Poulin verbally agreed to let to one Sands the said arpent, and on the 12th October, 1876, executed a lease demising the same to him for the term of three years computed from the 24th day of June, 1876 by the following description:\nA piece of land having one arpent of frontage by one arpent of depth enclosed in the land of the lessor in the concession St. Charles in the parish of St. Francis, in the Seigniory of Rigaud-Vaudreuil, the said piece of land to be taken at about one arpent distant from the north-east side of the River Gilbert as it intersects and crosses said land, and is bounded on the north-west by George Ferrier, and on all other sides by the lessor.\nThe George Ferrier here mentioned was then the proprietor of, or in possession of, lot No. 12 in the said con-cession which lot therefore constituted what is called the north-west boundary of the piece of the adjoining lot No. 11 demised to Sands. The piece of land thus demised to Sands was one square arpent situate upon, and at the northern extremity of, the said lot No. 11, the northerly boundary line of which arpent was the northerly side of the said lot No. 11, and the north westerly angle of which arpent was at a point in the said northerly side line of lot 11, distant \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s un arpent from the intersection of such side line with the north-easterly side of the river Gilbert and the southerly limit or boundary of this arpent demised to Sands was distant from the said northerly side line of lot No. 11 precisely one arpent or 180 French feet, measured on a line drawn at right angles therewith, and such southerly limit was parallel with both side lines of said lot No. 11, thus leaving on the said lot No. 11, between Sands' southern line and the side line between the said lot No. 11 and Veilleux's land on lot No. 10 in the same concession, environ deux arpents de profondeur.\nAbout the same time that the verbal agreement was made between Poulin and Sands for the demise to the latter of the said arpent, Poulin and one St. Onge entered into an agreement for a lease from the former to the latter, for the period of ten years, of a portion of the same gold bearing land to be enclosed within lines of three-fourths of an arpent in length, measured upon the southerly boundary line of Sands' arpent as above described and on the line of Veilleux' land on lot No. 10 that is to say at the line between said lots 11 and 10 and extending from Sands' said line to that of Veilleux, across that portion of lot No. 11, of environ deux arpents de profondeur lying between Sands' line and that of Veilleux. St. Onge the lessee as to this point says:\nQuand j'al achet\u00e9 le terrain en question mon intention \u00e9tait d'acheter la terre entre le terrain de Sands et celui de Veilleux, sur trois quarts d'arpent. Pans le premier temps, c'\u00e9tait notre intention d'acheter toute la largeur du lot num\u00e9ro onze sur trois quarts d'arpents mais Sands ayant pris un arpent nous axons pris les deux arpents, ce que nous comprenons la terre avait trois arpents, et Sands en agent Un arpent il en restait deux pour nous.\nPoulin the lessor upon the same point says: Mon intention quand j'ai vendu \u00e0 St. Onge, \u00e9tait de lui vendre un lopin de terre de trois quarts d''argents mesur\u00e9s sur les lignes de Sands et de Veilleux et qui traverserait d'une ligne \u00e0 Vautre.\nThe intention of both the lessor and the lessee in the contract made by them for the lease plainly was that Poulin should demise and that St. Onge should acquire a piece of land having its base or front of three-fourths of an arpent, or 135 French feet in length, measured on Sands' southerly line and its rear line of like length measured on Veilleux's line and extending across the remaining width of lot No. 11 of environ deux arpents lying between Sands' said line and that of Veilleux's on lot No. 10. Such a piece of land would contain an area of 1\u00bd arpents more or less accordingly as the precise distance in a direct line drawn at right angles with the base on Sands' line should be more or less than two arpents or 360 French feet. The intention and agreement of the parties as above expressed was reduced into writing in a lease bearing date the 27th June, 1876, whereby Poulin leased to St. Onge for a term of ten years to be computed from the said 27th of June a piece of the said lot No. ii described as follows ([7])\nThis is the only piece of land described as being leased thereby to which any lines and boundaries are assigned and it conforms precisely (if such an inartistic, inaccurate, and loose description can be said to be pr\u00e9cise) with what both the lessor and the lessee declare was their intention, namely, that the piece of land intended by the former to be let, and by the latter to be acquired, was a piece of land to be comprised within a regular figure constructed on a base line of three-fourths of an arpent or 135 French feet in length measured on the southerly side of Sands' arpent as hereinbefore described and having its opposite or rear line of like length, measured on Veilleux's line or the boundary line between lots 11 and 10 and extending from such front or base line to such rear line across the two arpents or thereabouts lying between Sands' line and that of Veilleux. The natural meaning and plain intent of the parties and of the language of the lease to give effect to such intent, as it appears to me, was that the figure comprising the piece of land as above described should be a quadrilateral figure the side lines of which drawn across the said t two arpents or thereabouts\" should be drawn in a direct line from either extremity of the base line to the opposite extremities of the rear line, and as these base and rear lines were prescribed to be equal and were in fact parallel, the side lines uniting their extremities must of necessity be equal and parallel. The result must therefore needs be that whatever might be the angles formed by such side lines with the base whether right angles or how ever obtuse or acute any of them should be the area of the figure would be precisely the same, namely 1\u00bd arpents. If the vein of gold should be found to proceed into the space of \" two arpents or thereabouts \" between Sands' line and that of Veilleux on a course at right angles with the base of three-fourths of an arpent measured on Sands' line and should fall short of reaching Veilleux's land and then disappear wholly, still the side lines must needs be continued to Veilleux's line on the original course of a perpendicular with the base; so, likewise, at whatever angle with the base the vein of gold should cross the base, and however acute therefore or obtuse the north-east and north west angles of the demised piece might be, the side lines forming such angles at either extremity of the base must be continued on the same course to Veilleux's land to locate the rear line of three-fourths of an arpent in length on Veilleux's line, although the vein of gold should happen to fall short of reaching that line. What the person who drew the description appears to have had in view was to prescribe a mode by which the four corners of the piece of land intended to be demised should be located on the ground. He describes the piece of land as \"born\u00e9e par la nord-ouest an terrain d\u00e9j\u00e0 vendu par le vendeur dans la m\u00eame terre \u00e0 Sands.\" By reference to the plans now produced we find that in point of fact Sands' arpent bounded the piece intended to be demised to St. Onge upon the north; the southern boundary line of Sands' arpent was intended to be the northern boundary line of the piece demised to St. Onge and in this line of necessity, must be found both the north-west and the north-east angles of the piece intended to be demised to St. Onge but where in particular within the limits of this line they are to be found the draftsman does not say. If the point where the south-western angle of Sands' arpent was should be adopted as the point where the north western angle of St. Onge's piece should be formed it would follow that the north-east angle of St. Onge's piece must be at a point precisely three-fourths of an arpent or 135 French feet distant from such north-west angle measured in an easterly direction on Sands' line. So, if the south-easterly angle of Sands' arpent should be adopted as the point where the north-easterly angle of St. Onge's piece should he found, it would necessarily follow that the north-westerly angle of St. Onge's piece must be at a point precisely, the 135 French feet distant from such northeasterly angle measured in a westerly direction upon the said southerly line of Sands' arpent, or both the north-westerly and north-easterly angles of St. Onge's piece might be formed at any two points distant from each other the prescribed distance of 135 French feet on Sands' southerly line between the south-westerly and south-easterly angles of Sands' arpent, as above described. The draftsman, however, indicates only the line within the length of which both the northeasterly and north-westerly angles of St. Onges piece must be formed, the intention most probably having been that as the site of the vein of gold was unknown St. Onge was left at liberty to locate his northern boundary line of 135 French feet in length wherever he pleased, upon, and within, the prescribed length of Sands' southern boundary line of one arpent or 180 French feet. The draftsman proceeds with his description thus\u2014\" par le nord-est au bout des dits deux arpents.\" What was meant by these words \" au bout des dits deux arpents \" as here used it is difficult to understand; the only \"deux arpents'' coming under the designation \" les dits deux arpents \" are l les deux arpents de profondeur\" of the demised piece, and as the front or base line of three-fourths of an arpent in extent is beyond all doubt to be found within the southern boundary line of the arpent let to Sands, and as the description goes on to show that the other extremity of the demised piece is on Vielleux's line, it is clear that \" les deux arpents de profondeur\" must refer to the space between the southern boundary line of Sands' arpent and Veilleux's line between lots No. 11 and 10. Again as the north-east angle of the demised piece equally as its north-west angle must be at either extremity of the same front or base line the words \" en suivant la course d'une certaine veine de quartz\" can not be read as indicating the course to be followed from the north-western extremity of the front or base line to the north-eastern extremity of the same line following such a course from the north-western extremity of the base wherever it may have been located by St. Onge within Sands' southern line would never as appears by the plans produced, lead to the north eastern extremity, but would lead in a quite different and, indeed, an opposite direction, namely, to Veilleux's line. It is obvious, therefore, as it appears to me, that the words \" bout des dits deux arpents \" which is said to bound the demised piece on the north-east, must be the extremity of the base or front line of the demised piece within Sands' line, thus establishing that these words as here used, can have no meaning attached to them unless they be construed as referring to that extremity or \" bout des deux arpents \" which is coincident with Sands' line and that \" les deux arpents de profondeur \" of the demised piece must be the space between that line and Veilleux's land on lot 10.\nHaving thus the base or frontline of the demised piece determined so far as to be \"wherever it should be selected and located by St. Onge within the 180 French feet prescribed as the length of Sands' line, how are the lines to be drawn which will forVm the south-eastern and south-western angles of the demised piece ?\nHaving determined the north-eastern extremity of the front or base line, it is necessary that a course should be given in order to determine the point on Veilleux's line which should be the south-eastern extremity of the rear line of the demised piece Here and here only, as it appears to me, can the words \" en suivant la course d'une certaine veine de quartz \" be introduced, and read so as to give any appropriate and sensible application to them. Having determined the north-eastern extremity of the demised piece the description proceeds to define its south-eastern extremity thus: \" En suivant la course d'une certaine veine de quartz par le sud-est \u00e0 la terre de George Veilleux.\" Thus, by drawing (parallel with the vein of quartz as it proceeds from the base line in the direction of Veilleux's land) a straight line from the north-eastern extremity of the base to the land of Veilleux, on lot 10 we get the south-easterly angle of the demised piece, extending thus three-fourths of an arpent in width across \" les dits deux arpents de profondeur,\" at whatever angle the vein of quartz may be found to intersect the base. Having thus got the south-easterly angle, the south-westerly angle of the demised piece is readily obtained, either by measuring from the south-easterly angle so obtained 135 French feet in a westerly direction along Veilleux's line, or by drawing, from the north-westerly extremity of the base or front line, a line in like manner parallel with the vein of quartz as it intersects the base, and therefore parallel with the easterly side line already drawn, a straight line until we reach lot 10 or Veilleux's land. \"We shall thus have the precise piece intended to be demised \" de trois quarts d'arpent de front sur environ deux arpents de profondeur.\" The superficial contents or area of which piece of land so determined will be one arpent and one half, and this is the only way in which a definite area can be given to the piece of land intended to be demised as above described. It is clear from the terms of the demise that the piece of land as described should have certain lines and bounds or limits, and that it should contain a definite area, and that such area should be that which would be comprised within a regular figure \u201cde trois quarts d'arpent de front sur environ deux arpents de profondeur'' or one arpent and a half. The description as given was, no doubt, based upon the assumption that the gold, lead, or vein of quartz, would continue through h les deux arpents de profondeur \" upon the same course that it should be found to cross the base or front upon Sands' line; and this, as it appears, is made more clear from the subsequent provision in the lease which seems to have been designed to meet the possible contingency of its being found not to be so. The privilege was thereby granted to the lessee, if he should think fit to exercise it after prospecting the piece of land above described and leased, of substituting for that piece a different portion of the same lot No. 11, and such as the lessee should himself select within the terms of the provision, which contained a peremptory condition that the substituted piece should not be of greater superficial area than the piece of land as above described that is to say than 1\u00bd arpents. The provision prescribes the manner in which this change may be made as well as sets limits to it, in the words following:\u2014\nPourra cependant le dit acqu\u00e9reur changer la course des lignes et bornes da dit lopin de terre sans en augmenter l'\u00e9tendue ou superficie, en suivant dans ce cas, la course ou ligne de la dite veine de quartz qu'i peut y avoir et se rencontrer en cet endroit apr\u00e8s que lui le dit preneur aura prospect\u00e9 le dit lopin de terre sus-baill\u00e9.\nThis last sentence plainly shows that the piece as before described was the piece intended to be leased unless and until the lessee, under the privilege contained in the above provision, should designate by precise boundaries the piece of land if any which he should select in substitution for the piece described as leased. The right of exercising this privilege which was given to the lessee under the above provision would seem to have been conferred upon him personally, and to have been intended to have been exercised by him within a reasonable time. It never could have been intended that he might exercise it at any time he pleased during the term created by the lease thus keeping the lessor in doubt during all that time as to the land remaining to him over which he had disposing power. Now in point of fact the lessee never did, nor did his assigns, assuming them to have had the power, at any time exercise this privilege, and it is impossible that it could be exercised after the expiration of the term.\nOn the 11th February, 1879, the same Poulin demised to Greorge Forgie for the term of three years to commence and be computed from the first day of May, which should be in the year 1881, a piece of the same lot No. 11 having:\nTrois arpents et demi plus ou moins de front sur une ligne oblique au travers ou largeur de la dite terre (No. 11),\nand bounded as follows:\nPar le nord-Ouest au terrain de \"William P. Iockwood par le sud-est \u00e0 la terre de George Veilleux, par le sud-ouest au terrain de la compagne St. Onge et par le nord est au terrain ci-apr\u00e8s d\u00e9sign\u00e9 et lou\u00e9.\nThe site of the line to be drawn from the north-westerly extremity of the piece of land as above described to its south-westerly extremity is all that, in so far as this lease is concerned, is necessary to be determined.\nNow the \"William P. Lockwood in the above description mentioned whose land is said to bound the demised piece on the north-west had no land upon lot No. 11 except the northerly half of the square arpent demised to Sands and this he only had in virtue of some arrangement made between him and Sands the nature of which has been suggested but not proved; it is not, however claimed to have been nor could it have been more extensive than the interest of Sands himself. This piece of land as above demised to Forgie had its north-western extremity abutting on the north-easterly side line of Sands' arpent, and its northerly boundary line of \" un demi-arpent de profondeur \" must have been the line between said lots 11 and 12 and its westerly side line must have extended from such last mentioned line along the easterly side line of Sands' arpent to the south-east angle of that arpent and must have thence followed and have been coincident with the easterly side line of the piece demised to St. Onge, to the point on the line between lots Nos 11 and 10 where the south-easterly angle of the piece demised to St. Onge as described in his lease was situate. A reference to the description of the piece designated as c ci-apr\u00e8s d\u00e9sign\u00e9 et lou\u00e9 \" and which is said to bound on the north-east the piece first demised, places this beyond all doubt, although that description is confused by the introduction of the other words \" parlie au terrain de Wiliiam P. Lockwood,\" who had no land at the point indicated, that is to say abutting on the north-east side of the piece firstly demised. This piece c ci-apr\u00e8s design\u00e9 et lou\u00e9\" is also stated to be part of the same lot No. 11, and to have a front of the same extent as that of the piece firstly demised, namely\nTrois arpents et demi plus ou moins do front sur une ligne oblique au travers ou largeur de la dite terre, sur un arpent de profondeur.\nAnd bounded as follows *\npar le nord-ouest partie au terrain du dit William P. Lockwood et partie \u00e0 celui de George Terrain; par le nord-est au Bailleur, par le sud-est \u00e0 George Veilleux, et par le sud-ouest au terrain sous lou\u00e9.\"\nNow as Lockwood had no land in the vicinity other than the northerly half of the square arpent demised to Sands the introduction of the words \" partie au terrain de William P. Lockwood \" in this description appears to be an error of the draftsman but the words \" et partie \u00e0 celui de George Terrain\" who owned lot No. 12, show that the northerly boundary line of the piece above described must be on the line of Sands' northerly boundary line continued that is to say, the line between lots Nos. 11 and 12; and as the front line of both of the pieces demised to Forgie measured in an oblique direction across lot No. 11 to lot No 10 are designated as of the same length namely \" trois (3) arpents et demi plus ou moins\" it is obvious that the northerly boundary line of both of the demised pieces equally as the southerly were intended to be on the same lines respectively, that is to say, the northerly on the line between lots 11 and 12 and the south\u00e9rly on the line between lots 11 and 10; the piece, therefore, as first above demised to Forgie must have its westerly boundary line coincident with the easterly boundary lines of the square arpent demised to Sands and of the piece demised to St. Onge.\nOn the 15th of March 1879 Poulin demised to Henry Powers and Archibald McDonald for a term of fifteen years to commence upon, and to be computed from the 24th day of June then next a piece of the same lot No. 11 by the following description:\nToute cette partie de terrain comprise entre les claims et placers de William P. Lockwood, James Forgie, Louis St. Onge, et cie et le c\u00f4t\u00e9 sud-ouest do la rivi\u00e8re Gilbert le tout enclave dans la terre du Bailleur connue et d\u00e9sign\u00e9 par le num\u00e9ro onze de la concession St Charles en la dite paroisse de St. Fran\u00e7ois. Contenant la dite partie de terrain deux arpents de terre en superficie plus on moins sans garantie de mesure precise et born\u00e9 comme suit-savoir '. par le nord-ouest au dit William P. Lockwood\u2014par le nord-est an James Forgie et Cie par le sud-est au dit Louis St. Onge et Cie et par le sud-ouest au c\u00f4t\u00e9 sud-ouest de la dite rivi\u00e8re Gilbert.\"\nIt is to be observed that this lease provided that the term thereby granted in the piece of land therein described was not to commence until the 24th day of June then next when the lease of the square ardent demised to Sands (the north half of which was the only land in which William P. Lockwood had any interest) would expire by effluxion of time. It is apparent also that the piece intended was bounded on the north-east by the piece demised to James Forgie by the lease of the 11th February, 1879, and firstly therein described, (which piece of land, as already shown, abutted on the north-easterly boundary line of the arpent demised to Sands) and on the south-west was bounded by the land demised to St. Onge, that is to say by the southerly line of the arpent demised to Sands which constituted the northerly boundary line of the piece demised to St. Onge. Now the piece of land thus extending from Forgie's line to the river Gilbert and bounded on its south-eastern extremity by the piece demised to St. Onge, that is to say by the line between the pieces demised to Sands and. to St. Onge, and extending along that line continued to the river Gilbert, would contain just d deux arpents plus ou moins \"\u2014the quantity of land expressed to be demised by the lease, and consisting of the arpent let to Sands, (whose term would expire before the new term, expressed in the lease to commence on the 24th of June, should commence) and the arpent or thereabouts lying between it and the river Gilbert and this piece would be well described as lying between James Forgie's land and the river Gilbert and having its south-easterly boundary line abutting on the land demised to St. Onge, and this appears to me to have been the piece intended by the description in the lease, which is con-fused by the reference to the name of William P. Lockwood, who would have no interest in any land there situate on the 24th June when the term granted by this lease of the 15th March, 1879, would commence. Upon the 17th day of March, 1879 Poulin demised to the same Henry Powers and Archibald McDonald for a term of fifteen years to commence upon and to be computed from, the said 17th March, another piece of the said lot No\nBorn\u00e9 comme suit savoir par le sud-est \u00e0 la ligne de division entre la terre du dit bailleur et celle de George Veilleux; par le sud-ouest, au c\u00f4t\u00e9 sud-ouest de la rivi\u00e8re Gilbert et par le nord-ouest et le nord-est au canal\u2014claim ou placer, de la compagnie St. Onge.\nThis piece of land is declared in the lease to contain un arpent de terre en superficies, plus ou moins.\nOn the 21th March 1879 Poulin demised to the same Henry Powers and Archibald McDonald for a term of fifteen years, to commence upon and to be computed from, the said 29th of March, another piece of the same lot No. 11\u2014namely, all that part of the river Gilbert lying in front \"du claim ou placer de William, P. Lockwood.\" Although William P. Lockwood did not possess any c claim ou placer \" on the said lot No. 11 bordering on the river Gilbert, or in fact any part of the said lot No. 11, except the north half of the square arpent demised to Sands in which he appears to have some interest through, and only through, Sands, who, by notarial deed, duly executed upon the 17th March 1879 surrendered his lease to Poulin, and annulled the term thereby granted there can be no doubt that the portion of land covered with the waters of the river Gilbert, demised by the lease of the 29th March, 1879, was that part which may have been said to have been in front of, though not contiguous to, the north half of the arpent demised to Sands, which was the only land there situate in which Lockwood had any interest.\nIn the month of August, 1880, Poulin, by a notarial deed, duly executed, sold and conveyed all the said lot No 11 and all his estate and interest therein unto Louis St. Onge and others in the said deed named, who were then the only persons interested in and possessed of the term granted by the said lease bearing date the 27th June 1876, and who, upon the execution of the said deed of sale became seized of the said lot subject only to the said leases executed by .Poulin to James Forgie, and to the said Brown and McDonald for the several and respective terms granted of the lands respectively described in the said respective leases bearing date the 11th of February and the 15th, 17th and 29th days of March, 1879, and the said grantees in that deed of sale mentioned, in the month of April, 1881, by like notarial deed duly executed, sold and conveyed the said lot No. 11 and all their estate right, title and interest therein, to the above appellants, subject only to the said last mentioned leases and the terms thereby granted.\nUpon the 1st day of May, 1884, the term granted to the said James Forgie by the lease of the 11thi February, 1879, expired by defluxion of time, and the above appellants thereupon became absolutely seised of the lands so demised to the said James Forgie.\nNow, the present appellants, being so seized and entitled, instituted an action en bornage against the above respondents, who then \"were, and still are possessed of the terms granted by the said several leases, bearing date the 15th, 17th and 29th days of March, 1879, executed as aforesaid by Poulin, for the purpose of having established the boundaries between the lands in the said respective leases comprised, and the other lands of the appellants situate upon the said lot No. 11. In this action en bornage the above respondents admitted that no boundaries had by law been established between them and the now appellants, and that it is the interest of both parties to have the boundaries established between the said properties; and thereupon it was ordered and adjudged by the judgment of the court in the said action that the boundary line of separation and division between the contiguous lands of the plaintiffs and defendants, mentioned and described in the title deeds of the parties cited in their declaration in the cause and filed by the plaintiffs, should be drawn by a surveyor or by surveyors chosen by the parties, or in default to be named by the court, and that the said surveyor or surveyors should have communication of the record in the cause, especially of all deeds filed and also of the titles therewith filed, being deed of lease passed before Louis Blanchet N.P., on the 12th day of October, 1876, from Joseph Poulin to Edward Sands r\u00e9siliation of the said deed before the same notary passed on the 17th day of March, 1879, and deed of lease passed before the same notary on the 11th day of February, 1879, from Joseph Poulin to James Forgie with power also to examine witnesses if required ed to establish any pretension of the parties which may be made at the time of the survey; the said surveyor or surveyors to prepare a plan of the locality and properties aforesaid showing the respective pretensions of the parties, and indicating the localities of the said boundaries and division lines between all the said properties according to the titles of the said parties; the said surveyor or surveyors to produce and file the said plan, with a report or reports thereon, and of the proceedings by them taken in the preparation of the said plan. In accordance with this judgment the plaintiffs nominated as their surveyor one Alexander Sewell, the defendants nominated as their surveyor one Alphonse Le Grendre, and these so nominated selected one Robert J. Ross as a third surveyor, and these three so appointed were ordered to proceed with the survey as above directed and to report to the court.\nInasmuch as the plaintiffs are seised of the whole of the lot No. 11, whereof Poulin was formerly seized, and subject now only to the leases of the 15th, 17th and 29th March 1879 under which the defendants claim the only lines which are material to be determined are, first, the line referred to in the lease of the 17th of March as bounding the piece of land thereby described on the north-west and the north-east \u201c un canal claim, ou placer de la compagnie St. Onge \" or, in other words where is the site of the line which, under the description in the lease of the 27th June 1876 constituted the westerly or south-westerly, whichever it may be called, side line of the piece thereby demised to St Onge for as to the site of the canal there is no dispute; secondly, where is the site of the westerly or south-westerly boundary line of the piece firstly demised to James Forgie by the lease of the 15th March, 1879, at its north-westerly extremity contiguous to the arpent demised to Sands as described in the lease of the 12th. October, 1876. This line as I have already hereinbefore shown, is identical with the easterly or north-easterly boundary line of the arpent demised to Sands; and thirdly, the site of the piece of the river Gilbert demised by the lease of the 29th March, as to which however the parties are all agreed.\nNow Sewell, one of the surveyors appointed to establish the aforesaid boundaries, made a report and plan showing the piece of land which, in his opinion, was that which was comprised in the lease of 27th June, 1876, which, if adopted, would not only not leave one arpent but would leave no land at all to pass under the description in the lease of the 17th March 1879 from Poulin to Brook and McDonald. The mode adopted by Sewell for determining this to be the piece of land which in his opinion was described in the lease of the 27th, June, 1876, was as follows:\nAll three of the surveyors concurred, first in determining the course taken by the vein of gold as it passed through the lot No. 11, and they laid it down on a map; then from a point \u201c A \" designated on the plan accompanying his report and which was agreed to by all the parties as being and was taken to be the north-westerly angle of the piece demised by the lease of the 27th June, and as corresponding with the south-westerly angle of Sands' arpent, Sewell let fall a perpendicular upon the vein of gold as laid down on the map as proceeding from Sands' line; this perpendicular he continued across the vein of gold until he reached a point distant on the perpendicular precisely one hundred and thirty-five French feet, or three-fourths of an arpent from the point \u201c A;\" through the point so reached he drew, from a point assumed but not established to be the south-east angle of the arpent demised to Sands a line in a southerly or south-westerly direction for the distance of about 500 English feet to a point on the map designated by the figure \" 5,\" and from thence he drew another line in a direction still more west of south for the distance of about 450 English feet until he reached Veilleux's line or the line between lots 11 and 10 at a point designated on the map by the figure \" 4;\" then from the point \" A \" he drew a line parallel with the line first drawn for the distance of about 387 English feet from the point \" A \" to a point designated on the map by the the figure \"1,\" and from thence he drew a line parallel with the line from \" 5 \" to \" 4, \u201c and distant from it on a perpendicular to it 185 French feet until he reached the river Gilbert at a point designated on the map by the figure \" 2,\" and from this last mentioned point he drew a line across the river Gilbert to a point on Veilleux's line about 340 English feet distant in a southerly and easterly direction from the point designated by the figure \" 4.\" The piece of land comprised within the above lines contained 4 arpents 58 perches.\nAs an alternative proposal in case the above piece should not be accepted by the court as conformable with the lease of the 27th June, Sewell suggested the continuation of the line as above drawn from \u201c A \" to the figure 1 until such line so continued should reach Veilleux's line, at a point designated on the map by the letter \" W . \" His only object for the suggestion of this line appears to have been in order to provide 90 perches to supply the piece described in the lease of the 17th of March as \"un arpent plus ou moins.\" The surveyor Ross has approved of this line. Now, it is very clear, as it appears to me, for the reasons given when I defined the lines and boundaries of the piece demised by the lease of the 27th June 1876 in the manner that the terms of that lease, in my judgment, required them to be laid down, that neither of the pieces as suggested by Sewell can be adopted as that demised by the lease of the said 27th of June or as at all conformable with the description contained in that lease, although the line alternatively suggested when slightly altered may prove to be the line proper to be adopted as the boundary line of the piece demised to St. Onge on its westerly or south-westerly side,\u2014that is to say, from the point \" A \" to Veilleux's line and identical with the line of such westerly or south-westerly boundary ascertained and determined in comformity with the description in the lease, interpreted, as in my judgment it should be as hereinbefore explained, assuming the point \" A \" to be the north-west angle of the piece demised to St. Onge, as it is now admitted to be by the parties hereto. Both of the pieces as suggested by Sewell are much in excess of the quantity assigned by the lease of the 27th June to the piece therein described and that portion of the lease, which required the 135 French feet constituting the front and rear of the demised piece to be measured on the respective lines of Sands and of Veilleux, has been wholly disregarded. There can therefore I think, be no doubt that the court below adjudged rightly in rejecting the report of Sewell as wholly erroneous.\nThe surveyor LeGendre has furnished a separate report and plan wherein he has adopted a wholly different piece of land as that which, in his opinion, is to be regarded as the piece comprised in the lease of the 27th June, 1876.\nIn arriving at this conclusion he does not seem to have thought it necessary to comply with the direction of the court to define the boundaries according to the titles of the parties as appearing on the deeds filed in the action. He does not seem to have exercised his own judgment in laying down the boundaries of the piece of land demised by the lease of the 27th June, 1876, which was the governing instrument in accordance with the description as contained in that deed. He did not start upon the front or base line as given by that deed controlled by the lease of the 12th October 1876 defining the piece let to Sands. On the contrary, he set out by trying to find a line which appears to have been run in October or November, 1876, by one Proulx not for the lessor and the lessee or either of them but for Lockwood, who claimed some interest in the gold which might be found on the said lot No. 11; and being unable to find that line accurately or by any traces or indices upon the ground he substituted another for it upon vague and unsatisfactory evidence, and this he assumes to be the line run by Proulx and he undertook to make it the front or base line of the piece he has described, wholly disregarding the description given by the lease. He in fact constituted himself a court to take evidence and thereupon to adjudicate and determine as a matter of fact and law that the lessee of that lease by adoption of the line run by Proulx had estopped himself and his assigns from now contending that such line was erioneous, and does not correctly lay down the boundary line of the land demised by the lease of 27th June 1876 which adjoins the piece demised to Brown and McDonald by the lease of 17th March 1879.\nApart from the objection that LeGendre had no power in this manner to affect the rights of the parties and to usurp the functions of the court and vary its judgment, the evidence upon which he proceeded was of the loosest possible character and utterly insufficient to work the estoppel which is asserted and relied upon Neither Proulx or St. Onge could with any degree of justice be now heard to give evidence which, if it should prevail to make the terms of the lease of the 27th June, 1876, yield to a verbal agreement for a conventional line would enable them to detract the former from the express terms of his deed of sale to St Onge and others of August, 1880, and the latter from the terms of their deed of sale to the \"plaintiffs of April, 1881 whereby the whole estate of Poulin and his vendees respectively became vested in the plaintiffs, subject only to the rights of Poulin's lessees, as expressed in their respective leases.\nSt. Onge indeed, in the evidence which he gave, admits that whatever recognition he gave to Proulx's line was based upon the assumption and belief that it was correctly run on the course of the vein of gold, an assumption and belief which proves to have been utterly erroneous if the vein of gold runs through the lot on the course which LeGendre and the other surveyors employed to lay down the boundaries under the order of the court agree that it does; and it is well established that such a recognition of a line, upon the assumption and belief that it has been run correctly, will never estop a party from showing the true line.\nBut in truth however much Poulin and St. Onge may now desire to detract from the title sold and conveyed to the plaintiffs, it sufficiently appears, by acts and conduct which admit of no doubt that neither St. Onge or his assigns ever did adopt the line as run by Proulx as their true boundary line, for during the whole existence of the lease of the 27th June 1876 and ever since it became merged in the fee, they always have carried on and still do carry on their works, which are of very considerable extent and nature far outside of the line run by Proulx, and upon land which has ever been and still is in their actual possession. Now it is well established that the principle upon which the validity of a verbal agreement for a conventional line rests is that it has always been acted upon by both parties, and that possession has always since been held in accordance with the agreement. No question arises here as to what length of occupation of land, in accordance with a verbal agreement as to a boundary line between contiguous properties, and what acquiescence in such boundary line, is necessary to be established in order to estop the parties from showing that the line is not the true one. In Mooney v. McIntosh in this court ([8]) several cases in our own courts and in those of the United States upon that point were reviewed, all of which recognized the principle that acquiescence for some length of time in a possession of land, held in accordance with the conventional line, is absolutely essential to be shown in order to raise the estoppel. In the present case it clearly appears that possession has never at all been held in accordance with Proulx's line; it, therefore, could not now be established, unless it be the true line according to the description contained in the lease of the 27th June 1876.\nWhen Poulin executed the lease of the 17th of March, 1879, it is plain that he believed himself to possess only one arpent between St. Onge's line under the lease of 27th June, 1873, and the St. Onge canal and the river Gilbert, and this is all that the lessees of that lease expected or contracted to acquire. The lease calls it one arpent more or less. Now, if Proulx's line should be adopted there would he little short of three arpents; if LeGrendre's survey should be adopted there would be more than two arpents; whereas, if the line should be drawn from the point \" A,\" in the manner in which I have above stated that, in my opinion, it should be drawn to comply with the terms of the lease of the 27th June, 1876, and the intention of the parties thereto, there would be something over the one arpent, and so the intention and expectations of the parties to the lease of the 17th March, 1879, would be realized.\nAfter LeGrendre had prepared his report a diagram of the lines run by Proulx was found. By this diagram it appeared that in November, 1876, when he ran the lines, Sands' arpent was treated as being, as I have held it should be, a square arpent having its southerly ' boundary line parallel with the line between lots 11 and 12, which constituted its northerly boundary, and distant from that line precisely 180 French feet, measured upon a perpendicular to it.\nThis southerly line of Sands' arpent is made the northerly or front line of the St. Onge piece, which, however, by some great mistake, is made to extend along and beyond the whole length of the 180 French feet constituting the line of Sands' arpent, instead of being limited to 135 French feet, or three-fourths of that arpent. It is said, however, and not disputed, that the point which Proulx treated as the south-west angle of Sands' arpent and the north west angle of the St. Onge piece is about 70 feet further from the river Gilbert, measured on such southerly line of Sands' arpent, than is the point \"A\" on the surveyor's plans, and the point from which Proulx is said to be shown by his diagram to have proceeded is accordingly shown on the surveyor's plans furnished to the court upon the argument; so that it appears that LeGendre's plan is not at all in accordance with Proulx's line, although it must be admitted that it is more favorable to the plaintiffs than would that of Proulx's be, but both of them cut off from the plaintiffs and would have the effect of depriving them of almost the whole of their extensive works. Now, this difference between the line run by Proulx (which is shown on the surveyor's plan, furnished to the court, by a black dotted line) and the line run by LeGendre as for Proulx's line, serves to illustrate the absurdity and disregard of all principle which would be involved in the adoption of LeGendre's line, which neither agrees with Proulx's line nor is in conformity with that designated by the lease.\nProulx's line, so far from having been adopted and acted upon had no marks whatever upon the ground by which it could he traced by LeGendre; it could. not, it is said, and not questioned, have been drawn from the same point as that from which LeGrendre drew the line which he drew for it.\nPossession never had been held in accordance with Proulx's line. Now, assuming it to have had any validity as a conventional line, the clear duty of LeGrendre when he failed to find it was to run his line in accordance with the requirements of the lease. The difficulty which he experienced in discovering the line whose only validity, if it had any, was as a conventional line was fatal to its adoption, and he had no authority whatever to run a new line in substitution for the one he was unable to find.\nTo adopt LeGrendre's report, instead of affirming a verbal agreement acted upon by the parties, and confirming them in a possession which has followed, and has always been held in accordance with, such agreement would have the effect of transferring now for the first time into the possession of the respondents a considerable portion of land covered with the extensive underground works of the plaintiffs, of which piece of land and of the works thereon they have always held exclusive possession; instead, m fact, of establishing a line in accordance with the title of the parties as expressed in their title deeds and as ordered by the court, there would be established a line inconsistent with and in defiance of those deeds. The court below has therefore, in my opinion, erred in homologating that report.\n1 As all parties are agreed that the point \"A\" on the surveyors' plans furnished with their reports is the north-west angle of the piece demised to St. Onge by the lease of the 27th June 1876 the true line to be run from that point to the line between lots 11 and 10 according to the lease will, in my opinion, be a line drawn parallel with the gold vein as shown on the surveyors' plans from \" H \" to \" I \" and continued in a straight line to the lot No. 10. The portion of that line which shall extend from its intersection with the canal St. Onge to lot No. 10 will be the true boundary of the piece demised by the lease of the 17th Mareh,1879.\n2. The true boundaries of the piece of lands demised by the lease of the 15th March, 1879 are: First, the easterly line of Sands' square arpent which constitutes the westerly boundary line at the northerly extremity of the piece first demised to James Forgie by the lease of the 11th of February, 1879; Secondly, the line between lots 11 and 12 from the north-east angle of Sands said arpent to the river Gilbert. Thirdly, .A. line drawn parallel with the line between said lots 11 and 12 from the south east angle of Sands' said arpent (which is a point distant from the said northeast angle 180 French feet, measured upon a perpendicular to the line between lots 11 and 12) and continued to the southwest side of the river Gilbert; the piece demised by the lease of the 15th March, 1879, is the piece lying between these lines.\n3. As to the piece demised by the lease of the 29th March, 1879, there is no difference; that piece is so much of the land covered with the waters of the river Gilbert as lies in front of the northerly half of the piece as lastly described\u2014that is to say, in front also of the northerly half of the square arpent demised to Sands, which is the only piece of land upon said lot No. 11, in which it appears that William P. Lockwood can be said to have had any interest.\nThe appeal, in my opinion, should be allowed, and the case should be remitted to the court below, with directions to have the boundaries established as herein above stated. Each party should, I think, bear their own costs of this appeal.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellants: Gibsone & Aylwin.\nSolicitors for respondent Richards: Caron, Pentland & Stuart.\nSolicitor for respondents Brown, et al: C.

Ritchie C.J. and Strong, Taschereau, Gwynne and Patterson JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW BRUNSWICK.\nInsolvent Bank\u2014Assets\u2014R. S. C. c. 120\u2014Prerogative of crown\u2014Deposit by insurance company\u2014Priority of note holders.\nThe prerogatives of the crown exist in British Colonies to the same extent as in the United Kingdom. The Queen v. The Bank of Nova Scotia (11 Can. S.C.R. 1) followed.\nThe Queen is the head of the Constitutional Government of Canada, and in matters affecting the Dominion at large Her prerogatives are exercised by the Dominion Government.\nThe crown prerogatives can only be taken away by express statutory enactment. Therefore Her Majesty's right to payment in full of a claim against the assets of an insolvent bank in priority to all other creditors is not interfered with by the provision of the Bank Act (R.S.C. c. 120, s. 79) giving note holders a first lien on such assets, the crown not being named in such enactment. Gwynne and Patterson JJ. contra.\nHeld, per Gwynne J., that under legislation of the old Province of Canada, left unrepealed by the B. N. A. Act, no such prerogative could be claimed in the Provinces of Ontario and Quebec; the court would not, therefore, be justified in holding that such a right attached, under the B. N. A. Act, in one Province of Canada which does not exist in them all.\nAn insurance company, in order to deposit $50,000 with the Minister of Finance and receive a license to do business in Canada according to the provisions of the Insurance Act (R.S.C. c. 124), deposited the money in a bank and forwarded the deposit receipt to the Minister. The money in the bank drew interest which, by arrangement, was received by the company. The bank having failed the government claimed payment in full of this money as money deposited by the crown. Held, reversing the judgment of the court below, Strong J. dissenting, that it was not the money of the crown but was held by the Finance Minister, in trust for the company; it was not, therefore, subject to the prerogative of payment in full in priority to other creditors.\nAppeal from a decision of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick[1] allowing an appeal from a pro form\u00e2 judgment of the Chief Justice in favor of the liquidators of the Maritime Bank.\nThe Maritime Bank having become insolvent a claim was made by the Dominion Government for payment in priority to other creditors of two sums on deposit, one amount being placed in the bank by the Receiver General to his own credit and subject to his order, the other having been deposited under the following circumstances.\nThe Dominion Safety Fund Life Association, a life insurance society doing business in St John, N.B., on the assessment plan, was obliged to deposit $50,000 with the Minister of Finance for a license. $45,000 of this amount was deposited by the association in the Maritime Bank and a deposit receipt forwarded to the Minister, This receipt stated that the amount was payable to the Minister of Finance in trust for the association. The balance of the $50,000 being deposited the receipt was accepted as a deposit of the $45,000, and a license issued to the company which was renewed from year to year. The bank failed in September, 1887, and a demand was afterwards made upon the association for securities to replace the $45,000. Up to 1888 the name of the association was among the companies mentioned in the yearly returns published in the \"Canada Gazette\" as licensed to do business.\nThe Government filed a claim against the liquidators of the bank for the two amounts and two questions were raised and contested before the New Brunswick courts, namely, 1. Is the Dominion Government entitled by virtue of the royal prerogative to claim payment of money due from the bank in priority to other creditors? 2. Was the said sum of $45,000 the money of the Government and subject to the prerogative right, or was it the money of the association?\nThe Supreme Court of New Brunswick decided that the crown was entitled to priority of payment in respect to both sums. The liquidators appealed from such decision to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nA. A. Stockton and C. A. Palmer for the appellants.\nIt is not necessary for the crown to be expressly named in order to take away the royal prerogative. If the intention is evident from irresistible inference it is sufficient. Chitty on Prerogatives[2]; In re Henley[3]; The Mayor, &c., of Weymouth v. Nugent[4].\nIt is submitted that there is such irresistible inference in this case. Interpretation Act, R.S.C. c. 1, s. 7; Bank Act R.S.C. c. 120, s. 79.\nAs to the second question we claim that the money was never deposited with the crown, but if it was it was still the money of the company and the crown holds it only as a bailee.\nIn the cases relied on by the crown and in the judgment of the court below there was no question that the money belonged to the crown. Ex parte Usher[5] is an authority in support of our contention.\nWeldon Q.C. and Barker Q.C. for the respondent. The effect of the appellants' contention is to put the crown in a worse position under the Bank Act than under the Winding-up Act although not expressly named in either. The crown has always represented to the policy holders that this money is held for their benefit and cannot now be heard to say that they never had it.\nThe following authorities were referred to: The King v. Bennett[6]; Salkeld v. Abbott[7]; Citizens Insurance Co. v. Parsons[8]; The Queen v. Patton[9]; Wildes v. The Attorney General[10]; In re Smith[11]; The Queen v. Daly[12].\nSir W. J. RITCHIE C.J.\u2014The Maritime Bank of the Dominion of Canada, previous to March 7, 1887 carried on business as bankers at the city of St. John, under the Bank Act. Having become insolvent they, on that day, stopped payment and ceased to do business, and proceedings were afterwards taken for winding up the Bank's affairs under the provisions of \"The Winding-up Act.\" At the time of the bank's failure they had on deposit to the credit of the Receiver General of Canada two sums of money: one of $15,197.57 and the other of $45,000. The first sum represented public moneys of the Government of Canada, deposited in the bank and lying there to the credit of the Receiver General and subject to his order. The other sum of $45,000 was deposited in the bank by the Dominion Safety Fund Life Association to the credit of the Minister of Finance.\nAs to the sum of $15,197.57 this was unquestionably a crown debt as to which I think the claim of the crown to priority must prevail. In Bacon's Abr.[13] it is said\nWhere a statute is general and thereby any prerogative, right, title or interest is divested or taken from the King, in such case the King shall not be bound unless the statute is made by express words to extend to him.\nThis has been repeatedly recognised and adopted as a correct exposition of the law; and the Interpretation Act[14] emphasises this principle by enacting[15]\nThat no provision or enactment in any act shall affect in any manner or way whatsoever the rights of Her Majesty, her heirs or successors, unless it is expressly stated therein that Her Majesty shall be bound thereby.\nIt is, to my mind, abundantly clear, therefore, that the prerogatives of the crown cannot be affected except by clear, legislative enactment, and it is equally clear that the prerogative of the crown runs in the Colonies to the same extent as in England.\nBut it is said this priority right of the crown to be preferred before other creditors is taken away by the Bank Act, which by section 79 enacts that\nThe payment of the notes issued by the bank and intended for circulation, then outstanding, shall be the first charge upon the assets of the bank in case of its insolvency.\nBut not a word is said indicating an intention to interfere with or take away the rights of the crown. The first charge here referred to is, in my opinion, the first charge as between the ordinary creditors of the bank, but subject where the crown is a creditor to the prerogative rights of Her Majesty, and the section must be read as if the words \"save and except the prerogative rights of the crown\" had been added, but which were, in fact, wholly unnecessary, as the crown not being named expressly or by implication the law saved and excepted those rights.\nIn the case of In re Oriental Bank Corporation[16] Chitty J. says:\nIt is settled law that on the construction of the Companies Act, 1862, the Crown is not bound, the Crown not being named and there being no necessary implication arising from the Act itself by which the Crown's prerogative is affected or taken away. That is the short statement of the decision of the Court of Appeal in the case of In re Henley & Co.[17].\nNo distinction was drawn in the argument, and very properly so, between the rights and prerogatives of the crown in respect of imperial rights and the rights of the crown with regard to the Colonies. I entirely agree with the court below that the crown is not bound either by the Bank or Winding-up Act, and therefore, with respect to the sum of $15,197.57, being public monies of the Government of Canada deposited in the bank and, therefore, unquestionably a debt due to the crown, Her Majesty's claim to priority over the note holders and other creditors of the bank in equal degree must prevail, and as regards this amount the appeal must be dismissed.\nThe second sum of $45,000, for which the court below held the crown was entitled to the like priority, raises a very different and much more difficult question.\nIt cannot be denied that whoever receives money of the crown becomes the immediate debtor of the crown, but it appears to me that the real question in this case in reference to this sum of $45,000 is: Was this money received by the bank as the money of the crown or did it ever cease to be the money of the association? In other words: Did it ever become a crown debt so as to be entitled to priority?\nThe Insurance Act provides that no person shall accept any risk or issue any policy in Canada without first obtaining a license from the Minister of Finance and Receiver General. By the 5th section the license is to expire on the 31st March in each year and shall be renewable from year to year. By section 6 the Minister, as soon as the company has deposited in his hands the securities hereinafter mentioned, and otherwise conformed to the requirements of the act, shall issue such license.\nSec. 7. Every company carrying on the business of life insurance * * * shall before the issue of such license deposit with the Minister in such securities as are hereinafter mentioned the sum of $50,000. *\nSec. 8. Such deposits may be made in securities of the Dominion of Canada, or in securities of any of the provinces of Canada and by any company incorporated in the United Kingdom in securities of the United Kingdom; and by any company incorporated in the United States in securities of the United States; the value to be estimated at the market value at the time deposited,\nSub-sec. 2. If any other securities are offered they may be accepted at such valuation and on such conditions as the Treasury Board directs.\n3. If the market value of any of the securities deposited declines below that at which they were deposited the Minister may notify the company to make a further deposit so that the market value of all the securities deposited shall be equal to the amount required by the Act to be deposited, and on failure to make such further deposit within 60 days after being called upon so to do the Minister may withdraw its license.\n4. A company may deposit any further sums of money or securities beyond the sum required to be deposited; such further sums or securities shall be held and dealt with according to the provisions of the Act in respect to the original deposit and as if part thereof, and shall not be withdrawn unless with the sanction of the Governor in Council on report of the Treasury Board.\nAnd sections 10, 11 and 33 very clearly show that the securities or moneys after such deposit remain the assets of the company.\nThe deposit is in these words:\nThe Maritime Bank of the Dominion of Canada.\n$45,000. Saint John, N.B., 27th January, 1882.\nThe Dominion Safety Fund Life Association, of Saint John, New Brunswick, have deposited in this bank the sum of forty-five thousand dollars, payable to the order of the honorable the Minister of Finance of the Dominion of Canada, in trust for the Dominion Safety Fund Life Association, of Saint John, N.B., on the return of this certificate properly endorsed.\n(Sg.) A. S. Murray, (Sg.) Alf. Ray,\nAccountant Cashier. It is very clear that this $45,000 forms no part of the revenues of the crown, nor is it a part of the public moneys of Canada, nor did it become such by the deposit by the association, but was, and is, an asset of and belonging to the association by the terms of the statute. This deposit was not received on behalf of the public, but for and on behalf of the company and those who dealt with it. The crown never became interested in nor responsible for the deposit of the association; the money was the private property of the company, and was, in fact, only deposited with the Minister of Finance for safe custody for the benefit of the company to enable it to do business throughout Canada, and in case of insolvency for the benefit of those dealing with the company, and cannot, that I can perceive, stand in any other or better position than bonds deposited under the statute or the other assets of the association. The deposit in this case thus continued to be part of the assets of the company; upon such deposit being made the company was enabled to transact business throughout the Dominion of Canada, and such deposit was to be held not for the use and benefit of the crown, but for distribution among the creditors of the company in the event of its insolvency, but never was, and never was intended, in any way, to belong to or be the property of the crown. Therefore, I cannot at all agree with Mr. Justice Tuck, \"that from the evidence it is clear this $45,000 was paid into the bank as crown money.\" On the contrary, from the evidence read in the light of the statute I think it is abundantly clear that it was paid in as part of the assets of the company, and that notwithstanding the deposit it was held by the Finance Minister as an asset of the company and in trust for the association; in fact, the deposit certificate distinctly shows such to have been the case. I have carefully examined all the cases which have been cited, and cannot discover that they establish this to be a crown debt entitled to priority in winding up the affairs of the bank; The case of Rex v. Wrangham[18] was decided on the ground that he who receives money of the crown (in that case duties) becomes the immediate debtor of the crown.\nIn re West London Commercial Bank[19], there was no dispute that the bank knew from time to time that moneys were paid in by debtors to the crown, and that moneys so paid in were crown moneys.\nPer Chitty J.:\nThe law, I take it, is now quite settled, and the case is covered by the authorities referred to: Rex v. Wrangham[20], Rex v. Ward[21], and Regina v. Adams[22]. In Rex v. Wrangham Lord Lyndhurst laid it down that whoever receives money of the Crown becomes an immediate debtor of the Crown.\nIn re Arthur Heavens Smith[23] was the case of a recognizance. The recognizance was to the crown direct and was held clearly a crown debt in law, and I do not see how it could be held otherwise, for a recognizance is clearly the acknowledgment of a debt owing to the crown and is a debt of record; it matters not what the condition may be, it is a crown debt in every sense of the word, to which, unquestionably, the prerogative of the crown to claim priority for its debts before all other creditors clearly extends, and in the case just cited Lord Coleridge C. J. says:\nI think this is clearly a Crown debt of law.\nReg. v. Bayly[24] was likewise on a recognizance.\nWhen the bank failed and the security became impaired the Minister of Finance called for a further deposit and refused to renew the certificate; this he certainly had a perfect right to do. What then was the position of the parties? Why, if the company wished to continue doing business throughout the Dominion it should have given a deposit satisfactory to the Finance Minister and obtained a new certificate. Instead of that the president of the association on February 14th, 1888, writes:\u2014\nOn return of the $45,000 cash deposited with the Receiver General the association will comply with the request of the treasury hoard and make a deposit in bonds, &c.\nBut we have seen there never was any cash deposited with the Receiver General; the cash was deposited by the association in the bank payable to the order of the Finance Minister in trust for the association. It seems to me that the proper answer of the association would have been not \"on return of the $45,000 cash,\" but \"on return of the certificate of deposit\" the association will, &c. What right had the association to ask a return of the $45,000 cash or anything other than what they had deposited with the Finance Minister? If they got this back what more could they require? The crown merely held it for what it was worth, and when the security became depreciated the association was bound to make it good. What right had it to ask to have it made good through the instrumentality of the crown at the expense of the other creditors of the bank? It will be noticed that this receipt does not make the amount deposited payable to the crown, but to the order of the Minister of Finance in trust for the Dominion Safety Fund Life Association. If this amount was the property of the association, and continued from and after its deposit an asset of the association, when and by what operation of law did it become a crown debt entitled to priority? And if an asset of the company, I can see no reason why it should be protected by the prerogative of the crown. It was deposited to serve the ends of the company, and why should the mere depositing of it as an asset of the company give it a preference to which it would not be otherwise entitled to? I do not think it by any means clear, as the learned Chief Justice suggests, that \"if it became necessary to take any proceedings to recover the money from the bank, such proceedings would necessarily be taken in the name of the Queen,\" or that, \"in other words, the funds having been deposited in the bank by the Minister of Finance, it became a debt due by the bank to the crown.\" The receipt shows, as we have seen, that the funds were not deposited by the Finance Minister, but by the Dominion Safety Fund Life Association, and made payable by the association to the order of the Finance Minister in trust for the association. I can see no reason why, if it had been necessary to recover this money from the bank, it might not have been done in the name of the Finance Minister, the statutory trustee. When the bank failed and the company received notice to make the security good, had the association done so the certificate, properly endorsed, would have been returned, and all the company would have had to do would be to make their claim on the bank, and their position would have been the same as the other creditors of the bank, and this is the position in which I think they should now stand.\nTherefore, in my opinion, this appeal should be allowed; but as the appeal has partially failed and been partially allowed there will be no costs.\nSTRONG J.\u2014The facts of this case sufficiently appear from the statements contained in the judgments delivered in the court below and in this court upon the present appeal, and I need not repeat them.\nAs regards the general question of the right of the crown, claiming in the administration of assets under bankruptcy, insolvency or winding-up proceedings in respect of a simple contract debt to priority over other simple contract creditors, I have already stated my opinion in a judgment delivered in the case of The Bank of Nova Scotia v. The Queen[25], and as I adhere to that judgment it will be sufficient for me to refer to it for the reasons and authorities upon which the conclusion now arrived at is founded. I have heard nothing in the argument of this appeal in any way impeaching the authority of the three late cases of The Oriental Bank Corporation[26], Re Henley[27], Re Bateman[28], upon which my opinion in the case of The Bank of Nova Scotia v. The Queen (1) was based, and no new argument against the general right of the crown to priority has been put forward in the present case. The argument founded upon the enactment which now forms sec. 79 of the Banking Act was urged in the former case, and although it is not noticed in my judgment was then duly considered. It then appeared to me that the section in question did not take away or in any way interfere with the common law right of the crown to priority, and after further consideration I still retain that opinion. This 79th section is in these words:\nThe payment of the notes issued by the bank and intended for circulation, then outstanding, shall be the first charge upon the assets of the bank in case of its insolvency.\nIt is to be observed that this section does not give the holders of notes any charge upon the property or assets of the bank ab initio, but only a first charge \"in case of its insolvency.\" In the administration of assets whether in bankruptcy, insolvency or winding-up proceedings, as also in the case of the administration of the estate of a deceased debtor, all debts form a charge upon the assets according to their priorities. This section is, therefore, only equivalent to a declaration that the note holders should be entitled to priority of payment out of the assets, if indeed it is as strong as an expressed declaration to that effect would have been. Then, for the reasons and upon the authorities stated by me in my former judgment before referred to, it seems clear that such an expressed declaration, the crown not being named, would have been insufficient to have taken away the right of the crown to be paid in priority to all other simple contract creditors.\nI am therefore of opinion that in respect of the sum of $15,197.57, the money of the crown deposited in the bank by the Finance Minister, this appeal is wholly unfounded.\nIf the foregoing conclusion is correct I fail to see that the crown is not also entitled to priority in respect to the $45,000. It appears from the evidence that this amount was deposited by the Dominion Safety Fund Life Association, a Life Insurance Company coming within the provisions of the Consolidated Insurance Act, 1877 (40 Vic. ch 42), to the credit of the Receiver General or Minister of Finance, as a deposit to meet the requirements of sections 5 and 6 of the act referred to, and that a deposit receipt in favor of the Minister of Finance was signed by the cashier and forwarded to the proper officers at Ottawa. It further appears that such deposit was accepted by the proper officers of the crown as a sufficient deposit entitling the company to a license pursuant to the terms of the act in question.\nThe crown could at any time after the acceptance of the deposit to its credit, according to the tenor of the receipt, have demanded payment from the bank of the sum deposited, and the bank could not have discharged itself by any payment other than the one in the hands of the crown. The Insurance Company had, therefore, no right to call for payment, and all privity between itself and the bank was at an end so soon as the deposit was accepted by the Finance Minister. This being clearly so it would appear to me that this sum of 145,000, although in a sense a trust fund to be held and administered by the crown, was nevertheless a debt due by the bank to the crown which was, as between itself and the bank, the sole creditor. There was, it is true, an ultimate trust of the sum deposited in favor of the Insurance Company, but there were primary trusts in favor of policy holders, whose rights the crown was bound to protect and whom it could not properly protect unless it was entitled to the absolute possession or control and disposition of the fund. In a general and popular sense the crown may be said to be a trustee of all public moneys which come to its hands to be applied to public uses, but still it is entitled to priority of payment over other creditors when it seeks to recover money which, when received, would be applicable to public uses. In the present case although the crown would not, if it had called upon the bank for actual payment of this deposit fund into the hands of its own officer, the Finance Minister, have been a trustee of it for the general public, yet it would still be a trustee, not for ascertained persons but for a portion and an indeterminate portion of the general public, namely, for those persons who might, in case of the insolvency of the Insurance Company, prove to be holders of policies at the date of the insolvency.\nThere does not appear, therefore, to be grounds for any legal distinction in respect of the right of priority between the debt due to the crown by the bank in the present case, and any ordinary debt due to the crown unaffected by any color of trust, statutory or otherwise, except such as is always incidental to public monies held by the crown.\nThese considerations, and others pointed out in the learned judgments delivered in the court below, have convinced me that this $45,000 constitutes a debt on simple contract\u2014for money had and received\u2014due by the bank to the crown for which the latter has been properly held entitled to its prerogative priority of payment. Indeed, it would seem from the authorities referred to by the learned judges in the court below, and especially from the case of Re Smith[29], that whereever a legal right of action to receive money is vested in the crown the crown is entitled to be paid such debt in priority to other creditors of equal degree irrespective altogether of the ultimate destination of the money, and that it makes no difference that the money when recovered will be for the use and benefit of a subject.\nFor these reasons I also concur in the judment appealed from as to the amount of $45,000.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014As to the $45,000 I would allow this appeal on the ground that these monies do not belong to the crown.\nFirst.\u2014The Insurance Act requires the deposit to be made in securities of a particular description. The Minister of Finance has no authority to take part of the amount in money.\nSecondly.\u2014The license granted to an insurance company, under ch. 124 R. S. C., is not a license by the crown but a license by the Minister of Finance; and the deposits required by the act are also made into the hands of the Minister of Finance, as persona designata. They are not deposited with the crown as crown monies. This very sum was not deposited to the credit of the crown. They do not and cannot form part of the consolidated revenue of the country. This very contestation fully demonstrates it. In whose interest is it carried on? Clearly in the interest of the insurance company alone. The crown has no interest whatever in the result of the case. I agree for these reasons and those given by my brother Patterson that the appeal should be allowed on this ground.\nAs to the item of $15,000 I agree that this appeal should be dismissed for the reasons given by His Lordship the Chief Justice. The crown is not mentioned in the Banking Act consequently, under the Interpretation Act, the prerogative right of priority remains unaffected thereby.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014As to the deposit receipt for $45,000 issued by the Maritime Bank of the Dominion of Canada of the date of the 27th January, 1882, I am of opinion that it is not open to the construction that it constituted a debt due to the Dominion Government. The monies represented by that deposit receipt continued, in my opinion, to be the property of the Dominion Safety Fund Life Association, remaining in the bank at the risk of the association for the benefit of the policy holders of the association under the provisions of the Act respecting insurance, and by the Dominion Bank Act, 43 Vic. Ch. 22 sec. 4, passed on the 7th May, 1880, all deposits held by any bank of the nature of that under consideration are required to be entered in the monthly returns of liabilities required to be made by all banks to the Dominion Government under a distinct heading from that directed for deposits of Government monies, namely, under the heading of\nDeposits held as security for the execution of Dominion Government Contracts and \"for Insurance Companies.\" In the reasoning of my brother Patterson upon this point, in the judgment which will be read by him, I concur.\nAs to the sum of $15,197.57 of the public monies of the Dominion of Canada, deposited in the bank to the credit of the Receiver General of Canada, I am of opinion that the clause of the Dominion Bank Act, which enacts that payment of the notes issued by a bank and intended for circulation shall be the first charge upon the assets of the bank in case of its insolvency, necessarily excludes all claim of the Dominion Government by way of preference to have a debt due to that Government paid before payment of the notes of the Bank in circulation, even if, but for such enactment, the Dominion Government would have had a preferable claim over the other creditors of the insolvent bank which it could enforce in Her Majesty's name in virtue of Her royal prerogative, upon the assumption that a debt due to the Dominion Government is, without any statutory enactment, a debt due to Her Majesty.\nBy the Bank Act, 34 Vic. ch. 5, passed on the 14th April, 1871, it was enacted, among other things, that the amount of notes intended for circulation issued by a bank and outstanding at any time should never exceed the amount of its unimpaired paid-up capital, and that if any paid-up capital should be lost the loss should be supplied by calls upon all subscribed capital not then paid up, and that such loss should be mentioned in the then next monthly report required by the act to be made to the Government, and moreover, that whenever the capital of any bank should be impaired by loss all net profits should be applied to make good such loss. The act required monthly returns to be made to the Government by the bank signed by the president or vice-president, and by the manager, cashier or other chief officer of the bank at its chief seat of business, exhibiting the condition of the bank on the last judicial day of the preceding month in a prescribed form, showing all the liabilities and assets of the bank, in which returns under the head of \"liabilities,\" the amount of \"notes in circulation\" is prescribed to be the first item. The act also enacted that the bank should always hold, as nearly as might be practicable, one-half of its cash reserves in Dominion notes, and that the proportion of such reserves held in Dominion notes should never be less than one-third thereof, and further, that no division of profits, either by way of dividends or bonus, or both combined, or in any other way, exceeding the rate of eight per centum per annum, should be paid by the bank unless, after paying the same, it should have a rest or reserved fund equal to at least 20 per cent. of the paid-up capital, deducting all bad and doubtful debts before calculating the amount of such rest.\nNow, the Maritime Bank of the Dominion of Canada was incorporated by the Dominion Act 35 Vic. ch. 58, passed on the 14th June, 1872, and was, thereby, expressly made subject to all the provisions of the above act, 34 Vic. ch. 5. It was also, by the Dominion Acts 43 Vic. ch. 22, and 46 Vic. ch. 20, subjected to all the provisions of the former of these last mentioned acts as amended by the latter, by which it was, among other things, enacted that certified lists of the shareholders (or of the principal partners if the bank be en commandite), with their additions and residences, and the number of shares they respectively hold, and the par value of the said shares, should be transmitted every year to the Minister of Finance before the day appointed for the opening of the session of parliament, to be by him laid before parliament within fifteen days after the opening of the session, and that any bank neglecting to transmit to the Minister of Finance such lists within the time limited thereby should incur and pay a penalty of fifty dollars for each and every day during which such neglect should continue; and further, that if it should appear by any monthly statement to be made by the bank under the section of the Bank Act (34 Vic. ch. 5, and the Act 43 Vic. ch. 22,) that the amount of notes in circulation during the month to which such statement should relate exceeded the amount authorized by the Bank Act such bank should incur and pay certain pecuniary penalties therein mentioned proportionate to the amount by which the notes in circulation should in any month exceed the authorized amount; and further, that any bank holding at any time a less amount of cash reserves in Dominion notes than is prescribed by the Bank Act, as amended by 43 Vic. ch. 22, should incur and pay a penalty of two hundred and fifty dollars for each and every time that such contravention should occur, but that nothing in the act should be construed to prevent any contravention of the Bank Act, (34 Vic. ch. 5) or of any act amending it, from being punished as a misdemeanor, or by forfeiture of its charter, if without the act it would be so punishable. By this act, 43 Vic. ch. 22, as amended by 46 Vic. ch. 20 and consolidated now in ch. 120 of the Revised Statutes of Canada, it was further enacted that the monthly returns should be made to the Government in a prescribed form, showing all and singular the several liabilities of the bank (under which heading the first item is \"notes in circulation\") and all the assets of the bank of every description with a preciseness and particularity calculated to enable the Government to see the first appearance of approaching insolvency and to interfere with its authority in the interest of the public to prevent the insolvency taking place; and it enacts in express terms that in case insolvency should take place payment of the notes issued by a bank should be the first charges upon the assets of the bank.\nThe true construction of this enactment, in my opinion, is that all notes issued by a bank for circulation upon the instant of their being issued have, for the purpose of securing their free circulation, this quality attached to them as an inseparable condition to their being issued at all, that they are in reality as well as in name a first charge upon all the assets of the bank in case of insolvency until all the notes so issued shall be paid and redeemed by the bank, and that to the necessary exclusion of any right of preference, if any there be, which the Dominion Government could claim to have any debt due to it first paid. I cannot doubt that the monthly returns required to be made by the bank to the Dominion Government were so required, and the quality of being a first charge upon all the assets of the bank in case of insolvency was attached to the notes, for the express purpose of securing a free circulation of the notes and of inspiring the public with a perfect confidence in their value and that they should in case of insolvency be redeemed and paid in preference to all other claims of all other descriptions whatever they might be. That the Dominion Government should now have the right to invoke a royal prerogative to enable them to recover a debt due to themselves first as having a preference over the holders of the notes issued by this bank now in insolvency would, as it appears to me, be little short of a fraud upon the note holders and upon the act of parliament upon the faith of which the notes obtained circulation.\nI am of opinion, therefore, for the above reasons, that such a right is necessarily excluded by the terms of the bank acts even if, in the absence of the clause which makes the notes issued by a bank a first charge upon its assets in the case of insolvency, the Dominion Government would have the right to invoke the royal prerogative to have all debts due to them paid first.\nThis view seems also to me to be supported by section 103 of the Winding-up Act, 49 Vic. ch. 129, which imposes upon the liquidators of an insolvent bank the obligation, as the first duty they have to discharge, to ascertain as nearly as possible the amount of the notes of the bank actually outstanding in circulation, and to reserve until the expiration of two years at least after the date of the winding-up order, or until the last dividend if that is not made until after the expiration of said two years, dividends upon such parts of such amount reserved in respect of which claims should not have been made in the liquidation, at the expiration of which time, and not until then, the amount reserved in respect of outstanding notes and for which no claim should then have been made, becomes applicable to other purposes of the liquidation. I am, however, of opinion that the recognition of such a right in the Dominion Government as the exercise by it of the particular prerogative relied upon is not warranted by the letter or spirit of the British North America Act. By the special ordinance of the old Province of Lower Canada, passed in 1840, 4 Vic. ch. 30, consolidated in ch. 37 of the Consolidated Statutes of Lower Canada, all preferential lien of the crown upon any lands and tenements situate within the limits of the said province, whether arising out of any deed, judgment, recognizance, judicial act or proceeding, or any instrument or document, and every privileged right, claim, or charge from whatever cause resulting whereby any real estate in Lower Canada should be affected or charged, was wholly done away with, save only such preference as the crown in like manner as all other persons should obtain by priority of registration under the provisions of the act; and upon the 1st August, 1866, the Civil Code of Lower Canada became law in virtue of 29 Vic. ch. 41. By art. 1994 of this code it was enacted as follows:\u2014\nArt. 1994, C. C.\u2014The claims which carry a privilege upon movable property are the following, and when several of them come together, they take precedence in the following order, and according to the rules hereinafter declared, unless some special law derogates therefrom.\n1. Law costs and all expenses incurred in the interest of the mass of the creditors.\n2. Tithes.\n3. The claim of the vendor.\n4. The claims of creditors who have aright of pledge or of retention.\n5. Funeral expenses.\n6. The expenses of the last illness.\n7. Municipal taxes.\n8. The claim of the lessor.\n9. Servants wages and sums due for supplies of provisions.\n10. The claims of the Crown against persons accountable for its monies.\nThe privileges specified under numbers 5, 6, 7, 9 and 10 extend to all the moveable property of the debtor, the others are special and affect only some particular objects.\nThis article is entered in the code as having been the old law of the Province of Lower Canada, not as new law; at the time, therefore, of the passing of the B.N.A. Act, which is the sole constitutional charter of the Dominion of Canada, there did not exist, nor did there ever exist within that part of the late Province of Canada formerly constituting the Province of Lower Canada, any preferential right in the crown to have such a claim as that of the Dominion of Canada now under consideration paid in priority to the claims of any other creditor of an insolvent debtor, and to this effect is the judgment in The Exchange Bank v. The Queen[30].\nBy an act of the Parliament of the late Province of Canada passed in 1851, 14 & 15 Vic. ch. 9, all preferential lien of the crown upon lands of its debtors, situate in that part of the late Province of Canada formerly constituting the Province of Upper Canada, was abolished, save only such preference as should be obtianed by priority of registration under the provisions for that purpose contained in the act. And by another act of the Parliament of the Province of Canada passed in 1866, 29 & 30 Vic. ch. 43, intituled \"An act to amend the law of Upper Canada relating to crown debtors,\" after reciting among other things that it was desirable that all bonds or covenants made, and debts due by, a subject to the crown should be placed on the same footing as if they were made or due from a subject to a subject, it was enacted:\u20141. That no bond, covenant, or other security thereafter to be made or entered into by any person to Her Majesty, her heirs or successors, or to any person on behalf of, or in trust for, Her Majesty, her heirs or successors, should bind the real or personal property of such person so making or entering into such bond, covenant or other security, to any further, other or greater extent than if such bond, covenant or other security had been made or entered into between subject and subject of Her Majesty, and\n2nd. That the real and personal property of any debtor to Her Majesty, her heirs or successors, for any debt thereafter contracted should be bound only to the same extent and in the same manner as the real and personal property of any debtor where a debt is due from any subject of Her Majesty.\nAt the time, then, of the passing of the B. N. A. Act Her Majesty had not, in virtue of her royal prerogative, any preferential claim for payment of the debts due to the crown in Upper Canada, in priority to the claims against the same debtor of any of Her Majesty's subjects, all of whom were placed on the same footing with the crown in respect of the debts due to them respectively; and in that part of the Province of Canada formerly constituting the Province of Lower Canada no prerogative right existed to have payment made of ordinary crown debts in priority to the claims of other creditors of the same debtor, nor any right save only the limited statutory right vested in the crown in virtue of the law as it is expressed in Art. 1994 of the Civil Code, against persons accountable to the crown for its monies\u2014that is to say, as explained in the Exchange Bank v. The Queen[31], against persons employed in the collection of the revenue and bound to account for the monies collected by them and not to apply them to their own use.\nNow, the B. N. A. Act has not repealed or annulled the above provisions of the statute law of the late Province of Canada. There is nothing in that act which can be construed as having, either expressly or by implication, any reference to any prerogative right being vested in or exercisable by the Dominion Government enabling it to recover and enforce payment of debts due to it in priority of the claims of, and debts due to, other creditors of the same debtor. It is clear, therefore, that the Dominion Government is not invested with, and has not, any right in virtue of Her Majesty's royal prerogative, or otherwise, to have a debt due to it paid in priority of debts due by the same debtor to other creditors where such debt accrued due to, the Dominion Government within either of those provinces of the Dominion of Canada which formerly constituted the Province of Canada. Now, the fact that the debt of $15,197.57 due to the Dominion Government by the Maritime Bank of the Dominion of Canada arises by reason of a deposit made in the bank at its place of business in St. John, in the Province of New Brunswick, can, in my opinion, make no difference. The chief seat of business of the bank, it is true, is declared by the act of incorporation to be the said city of St. John, but the bank has its corporate existence, and the power to transact banking business, in every Province of the Dominion. It has no limited existence, if that would make any difference. The debt due by the bank to the Dominion Government is as much due at the seat of Government of the Dominion at Ottawa, where no such prerogative as that relied upon exists, as it is due at the chief seat of business of the bank. The prerogative right of claiming priority in payment of debts due to the Dominion Government must, in my opinion, exist throughout the whole of the Dominion, if it exist at all. There is nothing in the letter of the British North America Act which warrants the contention, nor are we, in my opinion, required by the spirit of the act to hold, nor should we be justified in holding, that the Dominion Government can invoke and exercise the royal perogative relied upon to enable it to recover deposits made by it in a banking institution at its place of business in one of the provinces of the Dominion when it could not invoke or exercise the like prerogative in respect of deposits made in the same bank at its places of business in others of the provinces. But that the royal prerogative insisted upon can be invoked and exercised by the Dominion Government is rested upon a claim of right, which is relied upon as above, and dehors, the constitutional charter of the Dominion of Canada, namely, that all monies due to the Dominion Government are debts due to Her Majesty, and that the royal prerogative relied upon attaches at common law in respect of all debts due to Her Majesty. Now, I do not at all question the authority of in re Bateman's Trusts[32], or any like case, but I must say that, in my opinion, we make a very great mistake if we treat the Dominion of Canada, constituted as it is, as a mere colony. The aspirations of the founders of the scheme of confederation will, I fear, prove to be a mere delusion if the constitution given to the Dominion has not elevated it to a condition much more exalted than, and different from, the condition of a colony, which is a term that, in my opinion, never should be used as designative of the Dominion of Canada.\nHowever, the question now before us simply is, whether such incongruity exists in the B. N. A. Act, which is the constitutional charter of the Dominion, as that the Dominion Government can invoke and exercise what, as regards the circumstances and conditions of this Dominion, may be said to be a most unjust and obnoxious privilege in one of the provinces of the Dominion which it cannot exercise in all the others. In view of the fact that at the time of the passing of the B. N. A. Act the particular prerogative right insisted upon did not exist in the late Province of Canada, and in view of the fact that there is no provision in the act annexing the right to the constitution of the Dominion, and of the fact that the prerogative does not under, or since the passing of the B. N. A. Act exist in those parts of the Dominion consisting of the Provinces of Quebec and Ontario, and lastly, in view of the fact that there is nothing in the act requiring or justifying the conclusion that such an incongruity exists in the constitutional charter of the Dominion as that the Dominion Government should have a right to invoke and exercise a royal prerogative in one of its provinces which it could not exercise in all the others, the necessary implication, in my opinion, arises that the Dominion Government has no right to invoke or exercise the particular prerogative relied upon in any part of the Dominion. By so holding we shall be acting more in harmony with the ideas prevailing at the present day\u2014with the spirit of the age\u2014and, in my opinion, with the letter and spirit of the constitutional charter of the Dominion. The Dominion Parliament itself, by an act passed in its very first session, 31 Vic. ch. 37, intituled, \"An Act respecting the security to be given by officers of Canada,\" seems to have entertained the opinion in conformity with the opinion of the Parliament of the late Province of Canada as expressed in the statutes of that province above referred to, that the Dominion Government should not have the privilege insisted upon in any part of the Dominion, even in the case of the persons who alone are those who are designated in art. 1994, C. C., as accountable to the Government for its revenue collected by them.\nBy this act, which was passed for the purpose of requiring every person appointed upon or after the 1st day of July, 1867, to any civil office or employment of public trust, or concerned in the collection, receipt, disbursement, or expenditure of any public money under the Government of Canada, to give bonds executed by themselves with such sureties for the due performances of the trusts reposed in them, and for the due accounting for the public money entrusted to them respectively, it was expressly provided that no such bond or security, given under the act, to Her Majesty, her heirs and successors, should constitute any other or greater lien or claim upon the lands or tenements, goods or chattels of such person than if such bond had been given to one of Her Majesty's subjects. Debts accrued by bonds given by persons employed in the collection and receipt of the public funds of the Dominion being thus placed on the same footing as debts secured by bonds executed by a subject to a subject, the Dominion Government cannot, in my opinion, consistently with the spirit of the act, claim priority in respect of an ordinary debt accrued due by deposit in a bank to secure which no bond is taken or required. For all the above reasons I am of opinion that the appeal should be allowed and with costs.\nPATTERSON J.\u2014The general rule of English law which gives the crown, when claiming as a creditor, priority over other creditors of equal degree is not questioned on this appeal, nor is it contended that there is anything in the Winding-up Act of the Dominion[33] to restrict the operation of that rule in the distribution of the assets of an insolvent corporation.\nThere may be practical force in the suggestion that the law would be more in consonance with the real life and spirit of the time if the public in the aggregate, nominally represented by the crown, and the public as individuals, were made to stand in this particular on the same footing. I understand it to be so in the Province of Quebec[34], and it may perhaps be so in Ontario under the legislation of the old Province of Canada[35]. But the general rule, to the extent to which it was in question before this court in The Queen v. The Bank of Nova Scotia[36], does not strike me as being, since that decision, open to controversy in this court. The important questions in this appeal did not arise in that case.\nThe first is whether, in the winding-up of one of the incorporated banks to which the Bank Act[37] applies, the notes of the bank are a first charge on the assets as against the crown as well as against the other creditors. This question affects both the claims of $15,000 and $45,000. The second question affects only the $4,5000 claim, and it is whether that is properly a crown debt. The solution will depend on a consideration of the Insurance Act (1).\nBoth questions have been answered in the court below in favor of the crown, the arguments for that view being presented in able judgments by the learned Chief Justice and Mr. Justice Tuck.\nIt is impossible to deny the force of the views presented by those learned judges. I have hesitated a long time before venturing to differ from them, and I do not now adopt a different conclusion without some lingering distrust of its soundness, particularly with regard to the second point.\nOn the first point the controversy mainly centres on section 79, which declares that the payment of the notes issued by the bank and intended for circulation, then outstanding, shall be the first charge upon the assets of the bank in case of its insolvency. On one side it is asserted, and on the other it is denied, that this provision binds the crown which is nowhere named in the statute.\nMy first impression was that the negative proposition was unanswerable. The clause struck me as dealing with the general assets of the bank, and creating a preference, in relation to those assets, in favor of one class of creditors, namely, the note holders, and depriving the crown of its common law priority. On further reflection, however, I do not think that the correct way of looking at this statute.\nI think the search, which in ordinary cases we institute for the purpose of discovering whether the crown is indicated, either in terms or by necessary implication, tends in this instance to lead us away from the real question. The proper inquiry I consider to be: What are the assets of the bank with which the section deals? The answer, in my view, is that they owe their existence to this statute. They represent the capital which is subscribed under regulations beginning with section 5, governed by rules laid down with detail and minuteness running through the following sections down to section 23, and required to be periodically accounted for to the stockholders and to the Government in elaborate returns which are made public. There are various provisions touching the acquisition and holding of property either by direct purchases or by taking it in the first place as security for loans or debis\u2014see sections 45 to 60. There are many other departments of the business of the bank dealt with in various sections; and we have the issue of notes and regulations touching them in sections 40 to 44, the first provision being a limitation of the amount by reference to the unimpaired paid up capital. The whole of these enactments are but parts of the one system in which the affairs of the bank, including the notes issued and the capital paid up into whatever form of assets it becomes converted, are inextricably mingled together.\nThe charge created by section 79 thus differs essentially from a burden imposed on property which had previously been free from it. It is in principle not unlike the pledge of a railway enterprise for the security of bondholders. That very usual security may or may not be effected through the medium of a formal mortgage, but it derives its efficacy from special legislation.\nThe crown may retain its common law priority in the distribution of the assets of this bank, but it is a priority in respect of such assets as remain after the notes are paid, or, as it were, in respect of the value of the equity of redemption after satisfying the charge.\nThis view finds full scope and a reasonable effect for the statute without trenching upon the rights of the crown, while it avoids the injustice that would be suffered if the inducement offered by the statute, to take the notes of a bank by the security of a first charge on the assets in the event of the insolvency of the bank, turned out to be delusive and unreal whenever the crown happened to be a creditor of the bank.\nNow let us turn to the Insurance Act.\nBefore an insurance company can obtain a license, securities must be deposited with the Minister of Finance and Receiver General, to the value of at least $50,000[38].\nAll such deposits may be by public securities[39].\nOther securities may be accepted as a deposit[40].\nIf the market value of any of the securities deposited falls below that at which they were deposited the company must make a further equivalent deposit, or lose its license[41].\nSo far, it will be observed that the only securities authorised are of the class of marketable securities. Not a word of handing money to the minister, nor is money mentioned except in connection with a power given to a licensed company[42] (not a company applying for a license), to\ndeposit in the hands of the minister any further sum of money or securities beyond the sum herein required to be deposited.\nThe deposits are always reckoned among the assets of the company. They are several times so referred to in sections 9 and 10.\nSection 11 provides that So long as any company's deposit is unimpaired, and the conditions of this act are satisfied, and no notice of any final judgment against the company, or order made in that behalf for the winding-up of the company or the distribution of its assets, is served upon the minister, the interest upon the securities forming the deposit shall be handed over to the company as it becomes due.\nIn a later part of the statute[43] provision is made for the release of the securities, or their application in indemnifying policy holders, when a company ceases, either voluntarily or by withdrawal of its license, to do business.\nThe Dominion Safety Fund Life Association applied for a license in January, 1882.\nThe president of the company inquired by letter to the superintendent of insurance concerning the securities to be deposited, and was told, amongst other things, that\na deposit receipt in some bank to the credit of the Receiver General in trust for the company is accepted (subject to the approval of the treasury board) as a temporary deposit. In this case the company makes its own arrangement with the bank as to the interest to be allowed, and the Receiver General instructs the bank to pay the interest to the company as it falls due.\nThe company then arranged with the Maritime Bank for a credit on the books of the bank of $45,000, and obtained the following deposit receipt which was transmitted to the Receiver General's department, and now forms the foundation of the claim for priority.\nNumber 22,161. Certificate of Deposit. Payable on demand. The Maritime Bank of the Dominion of Canada.\n$45,000. St. John, N.B., 27th January, 1882.\nThe Dominion Safety Fund Life Association, of St. John, New Brunswick, have deposited in this bank the sum of forty-five thousand dollars, payable to the order of the Honourable the Minister of Finance of the Dominion of Canada, in trust for the Dominion Safety Fund Life Association, of Saint John, N.B., on the return of this certificate properly endorsed.\nA. S. Murray, Alf. Ray,\nAccountant. Cashier. The effect as well as the intention, of this transaction was that the security given and accepted was the credit of the bank, as it might have been the credit of a Municipality or of the Dominion or a provincial government if bonds or public securities had been deposited. There was no intention to hand over money to the Receiver General, nor was what was done equivalent to handing over money. The terms of the Insurance Act, to which I have referred, do not permit the deposit of money under the circumstances, while the rule that the securities must be kept up to their original value applies alike to all kinds of security given on application for license, a deposit receipt as well as a municipal bond. I see no more power under the Insurance Act in the Receiver General to handle the money now than there was in 1882 when the receipt was given. It has not become necessary to realise the security in order to pay off or reinsure any risks of the company, and I do not know that even in that case the realisation is to be by the minister.\nThe security having become depreciated by the failure of the bank it was the duty of the company to replace it by good security. The statute required that, and it was called for by the Treasury Board in January, 1888.\nIn connection with this part of our subject I may notice what seems to me a fallacious application of an indisputable proposition into which the learned Chief Justice in the court below appears to have inadvertently fallen. I refer to the following passage from his judgment:\nAn objection was taken that as the Insurance Act required the deposit to be made in securities of a particular description, the Minister of Finance had no authority to take part of the amount in money. Admitting that such may be the construction of section 5, I do not see what right the bank has to raise the objection after admitting the receipt of $45,000 from the Minister of Finance. If the minister exceeded his authority, that will not authorise the bank to keep the money. Whether the deposit was in public securities or in money, the bank in which the deposit was made cannot raise the objection that the minister had no right to take anything but securities.\nThe fallacy is in treating the objection as one raised by the bank against the existence of the debt. The debt is not disputed. The contest is on the part of the creditors, and is over the competition between this debt and the other debts of the bank.\nA more important consideration is suggested by some observations of Mr. Justice Tuck, which I quote from his judgment:\u2014\nHere, in order to protect the public who effect insurance with the company, the statute requires that a deposit should be made with the Government. Suppose the company failed to-morrow, would not the policy-holders have a right to call upon the Government to make good their losses to the extent of fifty thousand dollars? Undoubtedly they would. As trustee the Government is responsible, and it would be no answer to say \"your money was lost by the failure of the Maritime Bank.\" To such an answer the reply would be at once made, if the money was deposited in bank, it became a crown debt, and a first charge upon the assets of the company.\nI see no reason to doubt that if money were received by the government and lost the government would be answerable for it, just as the learned judge here assumes. It may not be safe to say ex cathedr\u00e2 that it would be so, because the question is not before us for decision, but the logical connection between the acceptance of money and responsibility for its safety unavoidably crops up. The crown is responsible, I understand the learned judge to argue, therefore the crown must have priority. The converse proposition is the crown has priority because the money belongs to the crown, therefore the crown is responsible to the company and its policy-holders for the money. The conclusion may or may not be irresistible in either case, but it is evident that to accede to the present contention for the crown would be to open up a question of considerable gravity. The responsibility of the government for more than the safe custody of the securities is certainly not contemplated by the Insurance Act, and it would probably be a matter of pardonable surprise to find that it was extended by the effect of taking a deposit receipt so as to be a guarantee of the solvency of the bank which the company found it convenient to deal with.\nIt must further be noticed that the contention for the crown, when it treats the transaction as in effect a deposit of money by the crown with the bank, goes beyond the evidence\u2014not merely beyond the evidence that no money was handled either by the government or by the company, but beyond what the deposit receipt imports.\nThat document states that the money has been deposited in the bank by the company, payable to the order of the minister in trust for the company. That trust must be within the terms of the Insurance Act. The minister cannot represent the crown outside of the authority conferred by the act, and nothing in the act empowers him to convert this security into cash.\nI think that the proper conclusion is that this debt is not a debt for which priority can be claimed on the part of the crown, and that on both questions the appeal should be allowed.\nAppeal dismissed as to the sum of $15,197.57 and allowed as to the sum of $45,000.00 without costs to either party.\nSolicitor for appellants: C.

[Henry J. was present at the argument but died before judgment was delivered.] [This case the reporters were unable to publish when decided.]\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF QUEENSS BENCH FOR LOWER CANADA (APPEAL SIDE).\nRailway Companies Carriers of Passengers\u2014Breaking of rail\u2014Injury to passengers\u2014Latent defects\u2014Arts. 1053, 1673. 1675, C.C (P.Q.)\nHeld, reversing the judgments of the Superior Court and Court of Queen\u2019s Bench for Lower Canada (appeal side), that where the breaking of a rail is shown to be due to the severity of the climate, and the suddenly great variation of the degrees of temperature and not to any want of care or skill upon the part of the railway company in the selection, testing, laying and use of such rail, the company is not liable in damages to a passenger injured by the derailment of a train through the breaking of such rail.\nFournier J. dissented, and was of opinion that the accident was caused by a latent defect in the rail, and that a railway company is responsible under the Civil Code, for injuries resulting from such a defect. APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada (appeal side) ([1]) confirming the judgment of the Superior Court ([2]) by which the appellants were condemned to pay four hundred dollars damages for injuries resulting to the respondent caused by the derailment of a train on the appellants' railway through the breaking of a rail.\nIn January 1884 the respondent was a passenger on a regular passager train of the Canadian Pacific Railway running between Ottawa and Montreal, and when the train was approaching Calumet Station the train through the breaking of a rail was wrecked and the respondent was seriously injured.\nThe action was for damages in consequence of the injuries received by the respondent through the appellants' fault and negligence. The appellants pleaded that the accident was caused by the breaking of a rail, which formed part of a consignment of steel rails of the best procurable description, purchased from competent manufacturers by the Government of the Province of Quebec which was, at the time of the purchase, the proprietor of the line of railway; that the rails were made specially for the purposes for which they were required, in accordance with specifications made by a skilled engineer then in the employ of the Government who was specially entrusted with the preparing of the specifications; that all due skill and care were used by the agents of the Government in the selection, inspection and testing of the whole of the consignment of rails: that at the time of the accident the roadway and rails were in good order and condition: that in accordance with the practice of railway companies generally the same had always been kept under regular and careful supervision, and proper and careful examination had been made of the roadway and rails immediately previous to the accident; that the rail in question appeared to be strong enough for the purpose for which it was required, and that its breaking was unavoidable, and was due to no defect either in the manufacture, purchase, or use of the rails: and that the accident in question was not caused by any want of care or diligence on the part of the appellants.\nAt the trial it was proved that on the days preceding the accident the weather had been very cold but that the day on which the accident happened there had been a sudden change of temperature and it was much warmer; that the insufficiency of the rail was not manifested by any exterior sign, and that it presented all the appearances of good manufacture having formed part of a consignment of rails ordered by the Quebec Government Railways and had been accepted and used by the Company after the ordinary tests and it was also proved that the portion of the road in question had been inspected carefully previous to the accident; and that in fact Muldoon, the section-foreman had passed over the very spot where the accident occurred twenty minutes before, and found the rails and roadbed in perfect order.\nThe broken rail, although examined by two or three employees of the company immediately after the accident, was not produced at the trial.\nH. Abbott Q. C. for the appellants;\nThe principal question which arises on this appeal is whether or not a railway company is responsible for damages caused to a passenger through the breaking of a rail without fault on its part, and this question depends upon the interpretation to be placed upon articles 1053 and 1675 of the Civil Code. We contend that the appellants, as carriers of passengers, are only liable for damages caused by their fault or neglect, while the respondent, whose contention was maintained by the judgment of the courts below, contends that they are absolutely liable, at all events under the latter article, unless they prove that the damage was caused by a fortuitous event or irresistible force. In other words, that railway companies are responsible as carriers of passengers in the same degree that they are responsible as carriers of goods.\nThe evidence conclusively shows that the accident has been the result of a sudden change in the temperature and that there has been no fault or negligente shown against the appellants.\nWe submit therefore on behalf of the appellants that not only is there no fault or negligence shown against them but, on the contrary, it is affirmatively proved that there was none and that in fact every possible care and skill was used in the manufacture, selection, testing and laying of these rails, and all possible care and diligence in their inspection. That under such circumstances the company was not liable see the following authorities: Bedarride des chemins de fer ([3]); Sourdat, Be la Responsabilit\u00e9 ([4]); Readhead v. Midland Railway Co. ([5]); Wright v. Midland Railway. Co. ([6]); Stokes v. Eastern Counties Railway Co. ([7]); Christie v. Griggs ([8]); Taylor on Evidence ([9]): Quarez chemin du Nord ([10]); Huston v. Grand Trunk Railway ([11]); Dalloz ([12]).\nA. Dorion for the respondent:\nI admit the law of England is contrary to the decision of the courts below but this case must be decided by the civil law of the province of Quebec. Under our civil law careers of passengers are virtually insurers of life except if the accident is caused by fortuitous event or irresistible force as provided in art. 1675 C. C. All the French cases decided and the opinion of French authors warrant the conclusion I contend for, that the liability is the same whether for carriage of goods or passengers.\nThe following cases and authorities were cited and relied on: Chemin de fer du midi v. Chambr\u00e8rent ([13]); Veuve Raymond v. Burnet ([14]); Demolombe ([15]); Grand Trunk Railway Co. v. Megan ([16]).\nThe case in Dallozz 82-2-163 cited by appelants is not applicable; the author in a note says the law on this point in France is regulated by another law.\nBut even if the liability should depend upon the question of fact whether there has or has not been negligence on the part of the company, I contend that the prima facie evidence of negligence by the fact of the accident having occurred has not been satisfactorily rebutted. In this case the rail was not produced at the trial and it was impossible to ascertain whether it had or had not any defect which ordinary skill, care or foresight could have detected. Under art. 1053 C. C. the respondent is entitled to succeed.\nSIR W. J. RITCHIE C.J.\u2014In this case it seems to me that the utmost care and skill were exercised which prudent men are accustomed to use under similar circumstances. The road was examined by a proper person from time to time and within twenty minutes of the time of the accident, and found tobe in good order, and more than this I do not think the law exacts from careers of passengers for hire. I think this was a pure accident against which the railway could not have provided and a risk incident to the mode of travel which passengers take.\nIn Readhead v. Midland Railway Co. ([17]) it was distinctly decided that the defendants were not liable for an accident owing to a latent defect in the tire not attributable to any fault on the part of the manufacturer and which could not be detected previously to the breaking, and that there was no contract either of general warranty or insurance (such as in the case of a common carrier of goods) or of limited warranty or insurance (as to the vehicle being sufficient) entered into by the carriers of passengers, and that the contract of such a carrier, and the obligation undertaken by him, are to take due care including in that term the use of skill and foresight) to carry passengers safely. I do not at all wish to be understood as impugning the position that in. every contract for the conveyance of passengers by rail there is an implied undertaking for the safe condition of the road as well as the vehicle so far as the carrier can insure it by the utmost care and diligence. The servants of the company must 'examine it and make sure that the rails are in good order and properly secured. But no recovery is allowed for damage done by a defective rail or rotten bridge where negligence is not proved. In McPadden v. New York Central Railway Co. ([18]) reversing the decision of the general term of the Supreme Court, ([19]) Earl C. said:\nThere is a certain amount of risk incident to railroad travel, which the traveler knowingly assumes; and public policy is fully satisfied when railroad companies are held to the most rigid responsibility for the utmost care and vigilance for the safely of travelers.\nIf, therefore, the jury had found that the rail was broken by the eastward bound train, it would still have been a case of mere accident, caused without any want of proper care and vigilance on the part of the defendant and the defendant would not have been liable. Lott Ch. C.\nIt was shown by undisputed evidence, of witnesses competent to judge, that the rail in question was, previous to its being broken, a sound rail of the usual and a good size and of good, sound and solid iron, and that the breaks were new and perfectly,' bright, and no fracture or crack was discovered in the pieces that were broken off, that the end of the rail made a good joint, was perfect, not battered down, and in good order, that the char was good, that the ties were good, sufficiently thick to support the rail, that there was a sufficient number of them, that they were sufficiently close together to give a good bearing for the rail, that the road was well ballasted with gravel around the ties\nThis accident occurred early on the morning of the 5th day of January, 1864, about half a mile west of Brockport, and it was shown that the morning was very cold, that good and perfectly sound rails will break in cold weather when the track is in perfect order and it was testified, by several witnesses having experience as engines on railroads, that they knew of no way of preventing it.\nThe night watchman on that section of the road testified, that he had, on the morning of the accident, left the depot at the Brockport station and went west about three o'clock, that a train followed him west about four o'clock that he went three miles west and came back over the place of the accident a little before six o'clock; that he went over the track, carrying a lamp with him, to see if everything was clear and to see if any rails were broken or misplaced; that he walked in the middle of the track, looking at both tracks, examined the rails and found the track all right.\n* * * * *\nNo testimony was introduced to contradict or impeach the evidence to which I referred, and after the testimony was given, the case states that thereupon the counsel for the defendant moved for a nonsuit.\nLeonard C.:\u2014\nThere was no defect in the iron of the track in the case under consideration. There was no dispute on this point. The iron was good and no crack or flaw appeared. The break was caused by the exceeding cold weather. This was the result of a vis major, against which no prudence could have guarded.\n* * * * *\nIn the present case no defect existed, or if it did exist for a few minutes no human diligence or foresight could have discovered or prevented it. An impossibility is not demanded by the law. * * *\nThe carrier is not liable for an injury to a passenger by the action of the elements where no care or foresight, skill or science, could have guarded against the accident which occasioned it. And in Pittsburg, &c., Railway Co. v. Thompson ([20]). Chief Justice Lawrence delivered the opinion of the court as follows:\nThe instruction, in its strict sense, is open to this objection, the true rule being, as said by this court Tuller v. Talbott ([21]), that the carrier shall do all that human care, vigilance and foresight can reasonably do, consistently with the mode of conveyance and the practical operation of the road. A company cannot be required, for the sake of making travel upon their road absolutely free from peril, to incur a degree of expense which would render the operation of the road impracticable. It would be unreasonable, for example, to hold that a road bed should be laid with ties of iron or cut stone, because in that way the danger arising from wooden ties subject to decay would be avoided but on the other hand, it is by no means unreasonable to hold that although a railway company may use ties of wood, such ties shall be absolutely sound and road-worthy.\nHeazle v. Indianapolis, &c., Railway Co. ([22]).\nMr. Justice Scott, delivering the opinion of the court, said:\nOn the night of the 20th February, 1872, the passengers cars on defendant's road were thrown from the track at a point a short distance from east of Mahomet station, by which plaintiff was severely injured. The accident was caused by a broken rail.\nThe proof is the track was in good repair. No negligence in this regard is shown. On the contrary, it is proven the track inspector or walker had just been over the road. It was found to be all in order and the track safe, so far as anything could be discovered,\nAlthough plaintiff has suffered very great injury we see no ground on which to base a recovery. It was through no fault of defendant, or its agents or servants. They omitted no duty imposed upon them by law, or by a due regard for the safety of passengers. Everything connected with the train was in good order, and it was managed by skilful and prudent operatives. The track had been constructed with skill and care, and, in the opinion of a competent engineer, the road was as safe as it could reasonably be constructed. It was patrolled at frequent intervals, by a careful inspector, and found to be in orders, with no defects discoverable. The injury to plaintiff must, therefore, be attributed, if not to his own want of cite for his personal safety, to one of those accidents that sometimes occur in extremely cold weather which no engineering, however skilful, and no management, however observant, could foresee or guard against.\nIngalls v. Bills & others ([23]).\nHubbard J. says:\nThe result to which we have arrived from the examination of the case before us is this; that careers of passengers for hire are bound to use the utmost care and diligence in the providing of safe, sufficient Ritchie C.J and suitable coaches, harnesses, horses and coachman, in order to prevent those injuries which human care and foresight can guard against; and that if an accident happens from a defect in the coach, which might have been discovered and remedied upon the most careful and thorough examination of the coach, such accident must be ascribed to negligence for which the owner is liable in case of injury to a passenger happening by reason of such accident. On the other hand, where the accident arises from a hidden and internal defect which a careful and through examination would not disclose, and which could not be guarded against by the exercise of a sound judgment and the most vigilant oversight, then the proprietor is not liable for the injury, but the misfortune must be borne by the sufferer, as one of that class of injuries for which the law can afford no redress in the form of a pecuniary recompense.\nNegligence is the ground of liability on the part of a carrier of passengers. In the breaking of this rail by the action of frost or a changing temperature I can discover no want of the utmost care and attention by the exercise of which the accident could have been avoided.\nThe court of first instance found \"that this breaking of the rail appeared to have been caused by the sudden change of the temperature, the days preceding the accident being very cold, and the day of the accident being more soft (doux)\" and the evidence amply supports that finding. To hold, as the court below did, that the defendants could and ought to foresee this change of temperature and were bound to procure rails sufficient to resist the action of the climate, is to require the defendants to do what it is clear is practically impossible. No doubt if an accident happens to a passenger in a carriage on a line of railway either by the carriage breaking down or running off the rails, that is prim face evidence from which the jury may infer negligence on the part of the railway company and must be rebutted by evidence on the part of the defendants On this point see Pollock C. B. in the case of Dawson v. Manchester, &c. Railway Co. ([24]). To exact all that plaintiff\u2019s counsel claims should have been done in this case would simply make railway transportation impracticable. Assuming the rule does require that the highest degree of practical care and diligence consistent with the mode of transportation should be used, was it not shown in this case that such was adopted? For as said by C. J. Cockbunn in Pymv. Great Northern Railway Co ([25]): \"Railway Companies are not insurers of the passenger's lives. They are only bound to use care and caution which may be reasonably expected by reasonable men.\"\nIn conclusion, on the facts and the law of this case I will merely add: Was not the accident occasioned not by a latent defect in the railway, that no care or skill on the part of the defendants could detect, but by reason of atmospheric changes which could not be foreseen, and against which no care or skill on the part of the railway could provide? The carrier of passengers is not an insurer and there was no contract of general warranty or insurance as in the case of a common carrier of roods.\nFor these reasons I am of opinion the appeal should be allowed.\nSTRONG J.\u2014I am of the same opinion. It is clear that there was no proof of negligence. The judgment of the court below proceeded upon the ground that the responsibility of railway companies as carriers of passengers is, under the law of the Province of Quebec co-extensive with their liability as carriers of goods, which, subject to certain well-known exceptions, makes them liable as insurers of property entrusted to them for carriage. In other words the Court of Queen's Bench applies to the carriage of passengers the liability of common carriers of goods under article 1675 C. C. I do not think that article applies to passengers at all; it is confined to the carriage of goods. The liability of carriers of passengers for hire depends entirely, in my opinion, on article 1053 O. C., and therefore proof of negligence is required as in the English law. This appears to be the modern French law also. The arr\u00eat reported in Dalloz in 83, 2, 164, shews that the article of the French Code 1784 corresponding to article 1675 C. C, Quebec, does not apply to carriers of passengers, but that the responsibility of a railway company in such cases depends upon the general law embodied in article 1382 C. N. corresponding ta article 1053 C. C. of the Province of Quebec. The law of England is now the same, though it does not seem to have been finally so settled until the decision of Readhead v. The Midland Railway Company. ([26]) That case was carried to appeal, ([27]) and the decision of the Exchequer Chamber distinctly settled the law as it now stands viz: that as carriers of passengers, railway companies are only responsible for negligence or breach of duty. The only authority which throws the least shadow of doubt upon the point is the decision of the Privy Council in an appeal from Upper Canada. ([28]). Some of the language there used seems to imply that there is liability apart from negligence, and that a railway company is to some extent to be considered a guarantor to passengers carried by it of the safety Of its roadway, rolling stock and appliances used in their transportation. But the language of the judgment does not clearly show that it was intended so to decide, and the decision can be supported on other grounds and is probably to be referred to the rule of evidence relating to the onus probandi; but be this as it may the later authorities are so clear that there can be no doubt now that the case of Readhead v. Tue Midland Railway Company ([29]) contains a correct exposition of the law, and it has been followed without question. In a case in the New York Court of Appeals, McFadden v. The New York Central ([30]) the faces of which resembled those of the present case the court held the law to he precisely the same as in England. The case of Meier v. The Pennsylvania Railroad Company, ([31]) where the decision was to the same effect, may also be mentioned There being no evidence to show, or from which it could be .inferred, that the accident in this case was the result of any want of care upon the part of the defendant company I am of opinion that we must reverse the decision of the Court of Queen's Bench and allow the appeal.\nFournier, J. \u2014L'appelante all\u00e8gue qu'elle a agi avec toute la diligence et le soin possibles et que l'accident dont a souffert li intim\u00e9 n'est arrive que par suite de la rupture d'un rail caqu\u00e9e par un vice cache.\nL'honorable juge Mathieu, dont le jugement a \u00e9t\u00e9' confirm\u00e9 en appel, s'est appuy'e, pour la d'excision de cette cause, sur le principe incontestable du droit fran\u00e7ais qui, encela, est conforme au n\u00f4tre, que les compagnies de chemins de fer sont responsables des vices de leur mat\u00e9riel, qu'elles le connaissent ou non.\nApres avoir plaide que l'accident '\u00e9tait d\u00fb \u00e0 un vice cach\u00e9 qui avait caus\u00e9 la rupture du rail, l'appelante a essay'e de changer sa position en faisant motion (art. 320 C.P. C.) pour faire co\u00efncider sa defenee avec les faits prouv'es, en retranchant son admission que l'accident '\u00e9tait d\u00fb \u00e0 un vice cach'e, et en invoquant comme excuse le changement subit de temp\u00e9rature et son effet sur les rails.\nQuelle que soit la cause de la rupture du rail, la Fournier J compagnie appelante est responsable de la suffisance de son mat\u00e9riel, \u00e0 moins qu'elle ne prouve que l'accident est arrive par cas fortuit ou force majeure.\nL'article du code qui r\u00e8gle la responsabilit\u00e9 des voituriers n'est pas l'article 1053, mais bien l'article 1675. Le premier est d'une application g\u00e9n\u00e9rale \u00e0 quiconque cause du dommage par sa faute, soit par son fait, soit par imprudence, n\u00e9gligence on autrement Le second ne s'applique qu'aux voituriers qui ne sont exempts de responsabilit\u00e9 que par le cas fortuit et la for\u00e9e majeure.\nNul doute que dans les cas qui s'\u00e9l\u00e8vent an sujet de l'article 1053, c'est \u00e0 la partie qui se plaint \u00e0 prouver la faute on n\u00e9gligence ou inhabilit\u00e9 de celui qui a cause le dommage. Ii en est autrement pour les voituriers et c'est l'article 1675 dont la Cour du Banc de la Reine a fait application dans le cas actuel. Cet article .se lit comme suit :\n\"Ils sont,\" dit cet article, \" responsables de la perte et des avaries des choses qui leur sont confi\u00e9es, \u00e0 moins qu\u2019 lls ne prouvent que la perte ou les avaries ont \u00e9t\u00e9' caus\u00e9es par cas fortuit on force majeure, ou proviennent des d\u00e9fauts de la chose m\u00eame.\"\nL'appelante a pr\u00e9tendu que cet article ne s'applique pas aux passagers, et que son effet doit \u00eatre restreint an transport des marchandises. Mais cette pr\u00e9tention est insoutenable en pr\u00e9sence de l'article 1673, d\u00e9clarant que :\nIls sont tenus de recevoir et transporter, aux temps marqu\u00e9s danses avis publics, toute personne qui demande passage, si le transport des voyageurs fait partie de leur trafic accoutum\u00e9, \u00e0 moins que dans l'un on l'autre cas il n'y ait cause raisonnable et suffisance de refus. L'article 1676, concernant les avis des voituriers, limitant leur responsabilit\u00e9, fait aussi voir que toute la section JII sur les voituriers applique aussi bien aux personnes qu'aux marchandises. La responsabilit\u00e9 des voituriers est done d\u00e8finie par cette section, et la preuve de n\u00e9gligence pour les rendee responsables n'est pas n\u00e9cessaire :\nIls r\u00e9pondent de la perte, \u00e1 moins qu'ils ne prouvent qu'elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 caus\u00e9e par cas fortuit ou force majeure.\nLe 28 f\u00e9vrier 1865, un train partant de Paris pour la Belgique a \u00e9prouv\u00e9 un grave accident. Le bandage d'une roue s'\u00e9tant rompu, puis les cha\u00eenes qui reliaient aux autres wagons le wagon tra\u00een\u00e9 sur la voie se sont bris\u00e9es au bout d'un certain temps amenant la dislocation du train en deux parties et un d\u00e9raillement Quint fait appeler La compagnie du Nord devant le tribunal de la Seine, C\u00f4tel\u00e9, Legislatinn des chemins de fer. ([32])\nQuatre voyageurs blessent out form\u00e9 des demandes en dommages et int\u00e9r\u00eats. Quatre jugements rendus contre eux et la compagnie ont \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9form\u00e9s sur leur appel par la Cour Imp\u00e9riale de Paris.\nEn premi\u00e8re instance il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 jug\u00e9 que l'accident n'\u00e9tait pas le r\u00e9sultat d'une faute quelconque dont la compagnie du chemin de fer du Nord devait \u00eatre tenue responsable. Deux faits ont \u00e9t\u00e9 discut\u00e9s: la rupture du bandage d'une roue, et l'absence d'une corde de communication qui doit r\u00e9unir la voituee de queue avec le sifflet de la machine.\nLe principe d'o\u00f9 partait le tribunal consistait \u00e0 admettre que les demandeurs avaient \u00e0 \u00e9tablir une faute de la compagnie pour la rendee responsable.\nIi v avait une d\u00e9fectuosit\u00e9 dans la fabrication du fer de ce bandasse; mais il \u00e9tait certain que cette d\u00e9fection site n\u2019\u00e9tait pas visible ext\u00e9rieurement, ce qui excluait le reproche possible d'un d\u00e9faut d'attention et de pr\u00e9caution lors de la ruption et dans l'emploi de ce mat\u00e9riel.\nIl ne fut attach\u00e9 aucune importance \u00e0 l'absence de la corde de communication. En r\u00e9sultat, l'accident ne pouvait \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 que comme un cas divorce majeure, dont la compagne n'\u00e9tait pas responsable.\nSur l'appel, la cour a compl\u00e8tement change le point de depart de l'application des faits de la cause.\nEn principe, suivant elle, le voiturier r\u00e9pond de l'avarie des choses \u00e0 lui confi\u00e9es, \u00e0 moins qu'elles ne prouvent qu'elles ne sont arriv\u00e9es par cas fortuit ou force majeure. Ce principe, dit la cour, s'applique \u00e0 plus forte raison au transport de personnes et prote'ge la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 des voyageurs. Mais c'est \u00e0 la compagnie qu'incombe l'obligation de prouver les faits qui la d\u00e9charge rait de sa responsabilit\u00e9.\nMaintenant le d\u00e9raillement du 18 f\u00e9vrier a \u00e9t\u00e9 caus\u00e9 par la rupture du bandage d'une roue; et cette rupture a \u00e9t\u00e9 occasionn\u00e9e par une d\u00e9fectuosit\u00e9 dans la fabrication du fer de ce bandage. Or ii r\u00e9sulte des documents produits par la compagnie que les spires dont ce bandage \u00e9tait form\u00e9 n'avait Pas int\u00e9rieurement toute l'adh\u00e9rence n\u00e9cessaire, que leur soudure n'\u00e9tait qu'\u00e0 La surface et masquait le vice int\u00e9rieur de la pi\u00e9ce; l'accident a donc eu pour cause un vice du mat\u00e9riel dont le voiturier devenait responsable. En effet, bien que cette d\u00e9fectuosit\u00e9 ne fat manifest\u00e9e par aucun signe exterieur, bien que le bandage, pr\u00e9seutant toutes les apparences d'une bonne fabrication, e\u00fbt \u00e9t\u00e9 re\u00e7u \u00e0 la suite des \u00e9preuves d'usage; les circonstances ne constituent ni cas fortuit ni cas de force majeure: c'est un simple vice du mat\u00e9riel \u00e0 la charge du voiturier L'absence du cordeau reliant la derni\u00e8re voiture \u00e0 la machine fut consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme une importante infraction an r\u00e8glement. Ii a en cons\u00e9quence \u00e9t\u00e9 jug\u00e9 crue la compagnie \u00e9tait responsable envers les appelants, non seulement de la confection viceuuse de son appareil, mais, en outre d'une faute r\u00e9sultant de l'inobservation du r\u00e9gIement. Voici les motifs qu'invoquatt la cour de Paris dans son arr\u00eat du 27 novembre 1866 :\nConsid\u00e9rant que le voiturier r\u00e9pond de l'avarie des choses a lui confi\u00e9es, \u00e0 moins qu'il ne prouee qu'elles ont \u00e9t\u00e9 avari\u00e9es par cas fortuit ou force majeure;\nConsid\u00e9rant que ce principe s'applique \u00e0 plus for\u00e9e raison au tran.port des personnes et prot\u00e8ge la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 des voyageurs; qu'ainsi dans l'esp\u00e8ce le voyageur bless\u00e9 n'est pas tenu de prouver la faute de la compagnie du chemin de fer: que c'est au contraire \u00e0 la compagnie qu'incomb\u00e9e l'obligation de prouver les faits qui la d\u00e9chargent de sa responsabilit\u00e9.\nTous les consid\u00e9rants de ce jugement sont cites au long dans le rapport de cette cause au 14\u00e8me volume de la Revue l\u00e9gale, dans les notes, p. 151.\nAinsi qu'on le volt, le principe de la responsabilit\u00e9 des voituriers, d'apr\u00e8s l'article du code Napoleon n\u00b0 1784 correspondant \u00e0 l'article 1675 de notre code rend les voituriers responsables de l'avarie ou de la perte des objets qu'ils lls transportent, \u00e0 moins qu'ils ne prouvent le cas fortut't ou la force majeure; ce principe s'applique au transport des marchandises tout aussi bien qu\u2019 aux personnes, si le transport des voyageurs fait partie de leur trafic accoutum\u00e9, comme dit l'article 1673. L'appelante fait \u00e9videmment ce trafic et le principe dolt s'appliquer \u00e0 elle pour le transport des personnes.\nL'appelante, comme on l'a vu plus haut, a essay\u00e9 de modifier son admission au sujet du vice cache du rail et cherch\u00e9 a prouver que le rail qui avait cause l'accident s'\u00e9tait rompu \u00e0 raison du changement de temp\u00e9rature.\nFeu l'honorable Sir A. A. Dorion, juge en chef fait an sujet de cette preuve les observations suivantes: Les t\u00e9moins de la compagnie disent qu'il avait fait tr\u00e8s froid quelques jours avant l'accident, mais que le jour de l'accident la temperature \u00e9tait plus douce, et ils attribuent \u00e0 ce changement la rupture du rail. Si c'est l\u00e0 la cause de l'accident, il est \u00e9vident que le rail avait d\u00fb \u00eatre cass\u00e9 depuis plusieurs jours, puisque le fer se casse en se refroidissant et non en s'\u00e9chauffant, et la compagnie a commis une n\u00e9gligence en ne rempla\u00e7ant pas de suite ce rail. Si ce n'est pas la gel\u00e9e qui a fait casser ce rail, c'est qu'il \u00e9tait d\u00e9fectueux, et la compagnie \u00e9tait \u00e9galement en faute.\nL'honorable juge en chef a consid\u00e9r\u00e9 cette preuve comme insuffisante pour \u00e9tablir qu'il y avait eu force majeure. Car si c'est le froid qui a caus\u00e9 l'accident, ilets \u00e9vident, d'apr\u00e8s lui, que le rail avait d\u00fb \u00eatre cass\u00e9 depuis quelques jours, et que la compagnie avait commis une n\u00e9gligence en ne rempla\u00e7ant pas ce rail. Cette n\u00e9gligence la rend responsable.\nAu sujet de la force majeure.\u2014\nLa loi, dit Laurent, ([33]) ne d\u00e9finit pas la force majeure, ni le cas fortuit. De l\u00e0 les difficult\u00e9s dans l'application du principe. La jurisprudence s'en tient \u00e0 la d\u00e9finition des lois Romaines: un \u00e9v\u00e9nement que l'on ne peut pr\u00e9voir et auquel on ne saurait r\u00e9sister, quand m\u00eame il. serait pr\u00e9vu. Ii nous semble que mieux vaut s'en rapporter a la prudence du juge. L'article 1147 lui donne une r\u00e8gle, c'est que le d\u00e9biteur n'est d\u00e9charg\u00e9 de la responsabilit\u00e9 qui lui incombe que s'il justifie que l'inex\u00e9cution de l'obligation provient d'une cause \u00e9trang\u00e8re qui ne peut lui \u00eatre imput\u00e9e. Tout d\u00e9pend donc du point de savoir si l'\u00e9v\u00e9nement all\u00e9gu\u00e9 par le d\u00e9biteur a ou n'a pas eu pour effet de d\u00e9truire l'imputabilit\u00e9, ce qui est une question de fait. La jurisprudence se montre tr\u00e8s s\u00e9v\u00e8re dans l'appr\u00e9ciation des faits.\nLa preuve ne constate pas qu'il ait fait un froid excessif la veille ni dans la nuit pr\u00e9c\u00e9dente. Le jour de l'accident le temps s'\u00e9tat consid\u00e9rablement adouci. L'inspecteur de section Mulon pr\u00e9tend avoir inspect\u00e9 les rails vingt minutes avant l'accident et ils \u00e9taient en bon ordre. Bien que le temps Catit doux alors, ce n'est done pas le froid qui a cause l'accident, mais-plut\u00f4t la qualit\u00e9 cassante du fer de cette esp\u00e8ce de rails. Mulon dit que les rails E. V. sont plus cassants que: les autres especes. La compagnie serait alors responsible de la d\u00e9fectnosit\u00e9 de son materiel.\nIl n'y a pas eu une preuve compl\u00e8te de l'inspection des rails, et ceux qui ont donn\u00e9 lieu \u00e0 l'accident en question n'ont jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 produits. Il \u00e9tait du plus simple devoir de la compagnie d'appeler la partie int\u00e9ress\u00e9e \u00e0 un examen contradictoire de ces rails. Au lieu de cela, elle a pr\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9, dans son int\u00e9r\u00eat, sans doute, d'en faire faire un examen ex parte par ses employ \u00e9s, dont elle a tir\u00e9 un t\u00e9moignage qui, toutefois, ne la justifie pas de l'inex\u00e9cntion de son obligation. La preuve n'a nullement \u00e9tabli le cas de force majeure. L'accident, au contraire, est d\u00fb \u00e0 l'insnfiisance du materiel de la compagnie et elle doit en porter la responsabilit\u00e9. Cette cause doit \u00eatre d\u00e9cid\u00e9e non d'apr\u00e8s le droit anglais, mais d'apr\u00e8s notre droit qui en diff\u00e8re sons ce rapport.\nJe snis d'avis de confirmer le ingement de la Cour du Banc de la Reine.\nGWYNNE, J.\u2014I am of opinion that this appeal must be allowed. The accident which has unfortunnately caused so much damage to the plaintiff appears to have been due rather to the severity of our climate and the :sudden and great variations in the. degrees of temperature in winter than to any want of care upon the part of the defendants.\nThe damage to the rail which caused the train to Ieave the track cannot upon the evidence be said to have been something which the defendants should have foreseen, and their not having foreseen and provided against it cannot be imputed to them as negligence; the evidence failed to shew any negligence in the defendants and in the absence of negligence the action cannot be sustained.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellants: Abbotts & Campbell.\nSolicitors for respondent: Geoffrion, Rinfret & Dorion.\n[1] M.
