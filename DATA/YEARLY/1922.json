S. [1911-12] c. 3, ss. 309 to 319. APPEAL from the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta[1], affirming the judgment of Stuart J. at the trial [2] and maintaining the respondent's action.\nThe respondent, a subject of the Empire of Austria-Hungary residing at Fiume, then within that empire, was in 1914, the registered owner of land in the municipality appellant; and, at the time the European war supervened, she was indebted for the 1914 taxes. Under the \"Rural Municipality Act\", the treasurer is required to prepare a statement known as \"the tax enforcement return\" containing the names and addresses of persons indebted for taxes. Application is then made to a judge for the appointment of a time and place for the holding of a court of confirmation of the return, notice of which must be sent by registered mail to each person interested at the post office address shewn by said return or by the records of the registry office for the land registration district, In this case, the notice was mailed to the respondent by registered letter addressed to Fiume, Austria-Hungary, which was her address as shewn in such records. The tax enforcement return was confirmed by the judge, no appearance having been entered on behalf of the respondent; and, after the statutory delay, the land was forfeited to the appellant and afterwards sold by it to a third party. Just before the sale a New York attorney advised the treasurer of the appellant that a sister of the respondent desired to pay the taxes and redeem the land, but the answer was that it was too late. The assessment roll was produced and, upon its face, non-resident owners were apparently assessed at higher figure than residents. After the above-mentioned sale the respondent, through her attorneys, offered to pay the taxes due, and, upon refusal, registered a caveat The respondent, in her action, attacked the appellant's taxation as being based on a discriminatory and fraudulent assessment and also alleged that the required formalities for the forfeiture of the land were not carried out.\nEng. Lafleur K.C. and Woods K.C. for the appellant.\nNewell K.C. for the respondent.\nThe Supreme Court of Canada dismissed the appeal with costs. MR. JUSTICE IDINGTON held that, upon the evidence and according to the roll produced at the trial, the assessment was fraudulent as showing discrimination between the valuation placed on the lands of resident and non-resident owners respectively; and he held, also, that the appellant, on which the onus rested, did not prove sufficiently the fulfilment of the statutory provisions as to the notices to be given in the newspapers and to the parties interested. But he did not agree with the principle that \"the war had so \"precluded the possibility of respondent receiving notice \"that therefore the alleged notice was of no avail.\"\nMR. JUSTICE DUFF was of opinion that \"so long as the title remains in the municipality, there was a right of redemption vested in the taxpayer,\" and he held also, that, owing to irregularities in the proceedings under the statute no title had passed to the purchasers, who \"not having acquired any vested interest in the lands (were) not entitled\" to any claim as against the respondent.\nMR. JUSTICE MIGNAULT, with whom Mr. Justice Anglin and Mr. Justice Cassels concurred, held that, as \"the proceedings for the confirmation of a tax enforcement return are undoubtedly judicial proceedings\" leading up to the forfeiture of the lands of the tax debtor, notification to her under the statute was \"a condition precedent to the jurisdiction of the judge to confirm the tax enforcement return\"; that since that condition could not be performed, i.e. because \"notice could not be sent to the interested party on account of the war\", the judge was without jurisdiction when he confirmed the return.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\n[1] [1920] 1 W.W.

The company subdivided the land into townsite lots and registered a plan thereof. Thereupon the Crown, under the \"Land Act\" R.S.B.C. (1911) c. 129, became entitled to a conveyance of one\u2014quarter of the lots in the subdivision, which was duly made. In a suit by the respondent for payment under the mortgage and guarantee, an allegation in defence, sustained on the facts by the trial judge and the Court of Appeal, was that in his conveyance the respondent fraudulently misstated the price to be $75 an acre whereas the amount to be actually received by him was $50 an acre, the balance being payable by him to a member of the syndicate, a fact unknown to his co-purchasers. The respondent, having settled with two of the other members of the syndicate, the two remaining members defended the action, and, by counter claim, sought rescission of the contract of sale. The principal answer made to this claim was that restitution of the land was impracticable. The legislature of British Columbia passed an Act, retrospective in its application (\"Land Act Amendment Act\" [B.C.] 1921\u20142nd session, c. 24), enabling the provincial government, on cancellation of the subdivision plan, to reconvey lands transferred to it, as stated above, to the persons in whom the remainder of the lands covered by the plan of subdivision are vested.\nThe trial judge dismissed the action unconditionally and held the appellants entitled to rescission conditionally upon their being able to re-convey the lands as they stood before the sale to the syndicate; but he put upon the respondent the burden of procuring cancellation of the plan of subdivision of the lands and reconveyance by the provincial government of the lots transferred to it. The Court of Appeal held that, restitution of the land being impracticable, rescission could not be had; but that the appellants were entitled to recover damages for deceit, based on the difference between the real and fictitious price, viz. $25 per acre, which damages should be set off against the mortgage moneys due respondent. On appeal the Supreme Court of Canada (Idington J. dissenting), held that the judgment of the trial judge for conditional rescission should be restored with the modification that the burden of procuring cancellation of the plan of subdivision and reconveyance of the lots transferred to the provincial government should rest on the appellants, the respondent, however, being required to deposit with the Registrar of the Supreme Court of British Columbia his consent as mortgagee to such cancellation and reconveyance: Lindsay Petroleum Co. v. Hurd[2] followed.\nShould restitution, without any default of the respondent, be found impracticable, the judgment of the Court of Appeal, awarding damages for deceit, should not be disturbed.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nEug.

[1914] c. 40 s. 5 (1).\nIn 1882 the County of Lincoln owned the Queenston and Grimsby Road as county property but not as a \u201cCounty road\u201d. In that year the Township of Grimsby in said county was divided into the municipalities of North and South Grimsby and the Act making the partition provided that South Grimsby should not be liable to pay any part of the cost of maintaining this road which was wholly in North Grimsby. In 1917 the county, as authorized by the Highways Improvement Act, passed a by-law for the assumption of main roads in order to form a system of county highways the Q. and G. Road being included. South Grimsby, being called upon to pay its share of the cost, brought action for a declaration that it was not liable for such payment so far as it related to the said road. Held, reversing the Judgment of the Appellate Division (48 Ont. L.R. 211) that by the adoption of this system the character of the Q. and G. Road and the nature of the control over its maintenance was entirely changed and the exemption granted to South Grimsby in 1882 in respect to it no longer existed.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario[1] reversing the judgment at the trial [2]in favour of the defendants.\nThe question for decision on the appeal is whether or not the exemption of the respondent from payment of rates for maintenance of the Queenston and Grimsby Road, granted by 45 Vict. c. 33 sec. 8, continued after the road became part of a system of county highways under the provisions of the Highways Improvement Act. The substance of the legislation and the municipal proceedings in respect to the road are given in the head-note.\nLynch-Staunton K.C. and Marquis for the appellants.\nMcBrayne K.C. for the respondent.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE\u2014For the reasons stated by my brother Anglin I am of the opinion that this appeal must be allowed with costs and the judgment of the trial judge dismissing the action restored.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014The question raised herein is whether or not \u201cThe Highway Improvement Act\u201d of Ontario, c. 40 R.S.O., 1914, can be effectively executed as provided therein in counties where prior equities have been created between municipalities in relation to any part of the roads system adopted in execution of the provisions of the said enactment. The powers given by said Act to county councils begin by the enactment contained in section 4 thereof which reads as follows:\u2014\n4.\u2014(1) The council of any county may by by-law adopt a plan for the improvement of highways throughout the county by assuming highways in any municipality in the county in order to form or extend a system of county highways, designating the highways to be assumed and improved and intended to form or be added to such system; and in case it is impracticable to benefit all the townships in any county equitably by a system of county highways such plan may provide for compensation to any township which by reason of the location of such highways or of the unequal distribution of the expenditure thereon may not benefit proportionately by a grant of such specific amount or annual sum or both to be expended in the improvement of the highways of such township as when so expended will make such plan equitable for the whole county.\nThe appellant County of Lincoln adopted by its by-law no. 600 the said system covering a road mileage of one hundred and fifty-seven miles, or more, in all.\nThis by-law was passed by the council 3rd February, 1917, and that clearly by the consent of over two-thirds of the members of council, and hence under section 11 of the Act did not need to be submitted to the electors; and, as admitted by counsel at the trial, was assented to by the Minister of Public Works on the 26th March, 1917, which I presume means or implies the assent of the Lieutenant Governor in Council required by section 12 of the Act as preliminary to the right to receive the provincial aid proffered as an inducement to adopt such a system of county highways.\nIndeed the plan adopted by the by-law to carry out the system under the provisions of the Act was the result of co-operation between the Department of Public Works, represented by its Minister and officials, of whom its chief engineer took the most active part, and the members of the council and some of the township councillors. Every effort seems to have been made to satisfy if possible all the municipalities and when entire satisfaction could not be produced that at least the scheme should be so equitable as to comply with the fundamental principle of the enactment.\nOf course there will often be in any such case some one who cannot be satisfied unless getting more than he, or those he represents, is entitled to.\nAs part of the means of averting such an emergency the respondent was allotted five or six miles of new road more than it was entitled to under the plan and system in order to remove any ground of complaint such as now raised herein.\nThe above quoted section 4 of the Act is almost literally identical with that in the Act when first passed in 1907, but amendments had been made in almost every session intervening between that and 1917 to render the Act more clearly what it was designed to produce, i.e., good roads of a kind hitherto unknown in the rural districts of the province, or indeed in many urban; and to bring home to everyone the great expense involved, far exceeding anything hitherto attempted, and thereby to justify the provincial authorities in offering millions for the promotion of the accomplishment of such an object.\nI thus bring matters of common knowledge, as well as the many provisions of the Act, in accord with same line of thought, to bear upon the question of the interpretation and construction of the Act, for the reason, which I most respectfully submit, that the appellate court below seems to have overlooked such considerations, as if irrelevant, and adopted the idea that the projected system was, or had something in it which must be considered as rendering it, entirely subjective to what had gone before, instead of being, as I deem it, an entirely new conception and enterprise founded thereon, designed to supersede, so far as applied, all else in the way of road making, and to finance the doing thereof, and fix or determine the obligations which would ensue, upon the adoption of the system by any municipal county council, imposing only one obligation and that was that it must be equitable.\nThe primary judges of what was to be found equitable were the two-thirds majority of the county council or the majority of the electors for the county entitled to vote on such a subject followed by the majority of the county council.\nThe antecedent relations of any municipality to another, springing out of impotent attempts to maintain a road in efficiency, was obviously to be forever discarded, when, where and so far as nothing new substituted therefor so long as no injustice suffered thereby.\nI have read the evidence to see how the matter was dealt with by those considering the new system and the means of adopting it and am pleased to find that it seems to have been approached in a proper spirit.\nNotwithstanding all that, instead of at once appealing to the court to restrain the carrying out of the said by-law and to quash it, if in fact founded upon something which had substantially discarded the equitable treatment enjoined by the section which I quote above, and is the key to all else therein, the respondent acquired most substantial benefits from the adoption of the system and refrained from taking such steps until after the appellant had incurred very heavy responsibilities and brought forward one year after another by-laws imposing the proper rates to meet such liabilities and only then, on the 19th of December, 1919, brings this action, having evidently meantime awaited the building of the new road within its own bounds as determined by the judgment of the county council to be an equitable basis for wiping out the past.\nIt is not often we meet with so unjust a demand deliberately made on the part of a municipal authority however much some of them may occasionally be wanting in due care.\nThe respondent rests upon the statute (of 1882) 45 Vict. c. 33 which created it, and which as between it and its junior North Grimsby in separating them, provided as follows:\u2014\nSec.8. From and after the last Monday of December, one thousand eight hundred and eighty-two, any rate, tax, liability or expenditure whatsoever, which, but for the passing of this Act, would have been assessable, ratable and taxable against the said original Township of Grimsby in respect or on account of the road known as the Queenston and Grimsby Road, shall be assessed, rated and taxed against the said Township of North Grimsby, and shall be borne and paid by the said Township of North Grimsby solely, and the said Township of South Grimsby shall not thereafter be liable or be rated, assessed or taxed therefor.\nThis section only deals with\nany rate, tax, liability or expenditure whatsoever which but for the passing of this Act would have been assessable, ratable and taxable against the said original Township of Grimsby etc.,\nclearly covering only that arising out of some obligation statutory or otherwise existent antecedent to the day next after the date named for no rate could be imposed upon something which had ceased to exist or, I submit, was conceivably possible by those legislating.\nYet the first Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario in effect holds that this provision is in force in relation to the matters involved herein under the new legislation enacted a quarter of a century later and in the absence of obligation of any kind ever having bound Grimsby as such, and declares as follows:\u2014 1. This Court doth declare that the said Municipal Corporation of the Township of South Grimsby is not liable for any portion of the levy made on it by the Municipal Corporation of the County of Lincoln under by-law number 605 of the said Municipal Corporation of the County of Lincoln in so far as the said levy is made in respect of the Queenston and Grimsby road and doth adjudge the same accordingly.\n2. And this Court doth further declare that the levy made by the said Municipal Corporation of the County of Lincoln against the Municipal Corporation of the Township of South Grimsby is, in so far as the said levy is made in respect of the Queenston and Grimsby road, illegal and void.\n3. And this Court doth further declare that the said Municipal Corporation of the Township of South Grimsby shall not be assessed, rated or taxed by the said Municipal Corporation of the County of Lincoln for any portion of the cost of improvements of the Queenston and Grimsby road under the provisions of by-law number 600 of the said Municipal Corporation of the County of Lincoln and doth adjudge the same accordingly.\n4. And this Court doth further declare that the Municipal Corporation of the Township of North Grimsby is liable to the Municipal Corporation of the County of Lincoln for all assessments, taxes or rates in respect of the said Queenstons and Grimsby road under the said by-law number 600 which have already been imposed or levied by the said Municipal Corporation of the County of Lincoln on the said Municipal Corporation of the Township of South Grimsby in respect of the said road and doth adjudge the same accordingly.\n5. And this Court doth further declare that all assessments, taxes or rates which but for the statute 45 Victoria, chapter 33, Ontario, would be leviable against the said Municipal Corporation of the Township of South Grimsby by the Municipal Corporation of the County of Lincoln in respect of the Queenston and Grimsby road shall be levied against the Municipal Corporation of the Township of North Grimsby and doth adjudge the same accordingly.\n6. And this Court doth further order and adjudge that the said Municipal Corporation of the County of Lincoln be and it is hereby perpetually restrained from assessing, levying or seeking to collect from the Municipal Corporation of the Township of South Grimsby any assessment, rate or tax in respect of the Queenston and Grimsby road under the provisions of said by-law number 600 of the said Municipal Corporation of the County of Lincoln.\nTo appreciate the rather sweeping character of the foregoing I must observe that the Queenston and Grimsby road in question extends from the western frontier of the County of Lincoln to Queenston on the Niagara River, and by no means in a straight line. By reason of the crooks and turns therein it may be thirty to thirty-five miles in length.\nThe length thereof through North Grimsby alone leaving out Grimsby Village, is, according to the scale given in the plan filed in evidence herein, not more than seven and a half miles.\nThe county appellant in order to carry out this new system and provide the necessary financial means of doing so, if considered as a county scheme, had no power save the levying upon the entire assessable property within its usual jurisdiction, and that (save in cases specially provided for in the way of exemption from the operation of this new system of which the respondent herein was not) was by the annual assessments made upon the whole ratable property, based upon the equalized assessment of each municipality for any year in question.\nThe only exceptional case of that kind under the new system was the case provided for in section 26 of the \u201cHighway Improvement Act\u201d which in the case therein provided for, enabled the county council, with the approval of the Minister of Public Works, to omit from assessment any township or townships through which the road did not pass, or it might assess any township through which the road did pass for a larger or smaller amount in order to equitably assess the costs on the council of any county in which a system of roads is established under said Act, or might, upon the application of a township council and with the approval of the Minister, levy a special rate upon the township for the construction, improvement or maintenance of the road within such township.\nHerein is the only remedy given for the respondent if it supposed it was entitled to any special privilege under the Act. Yet it made no move in that direction and I submit should not now by the means invoked herein obtain indirectly what it might have obtained directly if the county council was treating it inequitably. And a special means having thus been given it the courts have no power to step in and interfere on its behalf for substantially that which is referred to another tribunal.\nThe opportunity was open to it on the consideration of the by-law number 600.\nThe Township of North Grimsby brought the case from its point of view directly under the notice of the minister and evidently he was advised it had nothing to fear on that score.\nThe by-law number 605, mentioned in the first of the above quoted declarations of the appellate court below, was a by-law to raise $50,000 by way of loan for the purposes of construction.\nIt recited by-law number 600 and its adoption under the Highway Improvement Act and that by section 15 thereof and amendments thereto any county taking advantage of the said Act might pass by-laws to raise money on debentures payable in not more than thirty years as provided by the Municipal Act not exceeding three per centum of the equalized assessment of the county, and that by sub-section 1 of section 4, c. 16, 5 Geo. V.,\nmoney raised by the issue of debentures for road construction under authority of this Act shall be applied solely for that purpose, and shall not be used in paying any part of the current or other expenditure of the corporation, or for road repair or maintenance.\nI respectfully submit that such an expenditure of money cannot fall within the purview or meaning of said section 8, above quoted and relied upon by the court below. Whatever the words in section 8 of the Act of 1882 may mean we are given the history of the road and its repair or maintenance was thenceforth all that the parties concerned in such legislation possibly had in view.\nThat item clearly was also excluded from the scope and purpose of this by-law No. 605 specifically dealt with by above judgment of the appellate court and the later county by-laws passed to raise further moneys for purposes of construction under the adoption of the new system.\nIn the first place all that said section 8 of the enactment of 1882 ever had relation to, was the seven or eight miles of the Queenston and Grimsby Road which fell within the bounds of North Grimsby and in no sense as to the remainder of a road under the same name.\nAnd in the next place by-laws nos. 600, 605, and 620, related only to construction which related to or may have related to any part of the new system. And if purely construction in any case what was meant? Clearly not the mere repair of any part of the highway constructed after another fashion.\nThe parties hereto have not enlightened us as to the actual facts had in view at each step in the history of all that was in question herein, as they might usefully have done.\nIf, as I surmise, applying general knowledge to the whole of this new system, then the development between the passing of the Act in 1882, and the use since then of other motive powers to transportation, rendered the abandonment of such road making as had existed up to said date a necessity.\nTo speak of repair thereof had become an absurdity. Such repairs might be made as would answer an indictment and any other means of enforcing the obligation in contemplation by the parties concerned. The development of the automobile and its use for travel or heavy traffic plainly demanded the construction of another kind of road than previously contemplated in 1882 and which obviously would surpass in its cost anything within the ambit of the obligation named in said Act.\nTo speak of the new construction needed and that which had existed as identically the same or the obligation resting upon any one to repair the old as identical with the new obligation to be undertaken to meet the modern requirements of traffic is, I most respectfully submit, quite untenable.\nThe tenure of the soil on which repair might be done or construction of something else needed, might remain the same, but, by the way, had not even that changed?\nAre we to shut our eyes to the realities, and use but a name as a guide? I submit not.\nSuppose transportation advanced a step further and its needs required the appropriation of the old road allowance to the radials to such an extent as to render the roadway useless for anything else and an Act of the legislature so approved and encouraged the county council that the radial practically occupied the same space and provided for the county assuming that new burden of building and running it, how would that little bit of an Act, such as section 8, look like as if still binding? Could it be pretended to have an operative effect such as applied by the Appellate Division to this scheme.\nI put this extreme illustration, though perhaps it will not look so extreme thirty years hence, if some dreams are realized. From the present outlook it is not so extreme as if someone in 1882 had predicted all that has happened by reason of the automobile; and sought to assign that as within the contemplation of those concerned as it clearly never was.\nI submit we must have regard not only to all that has arisen but also all that had fallen into decay and the need for something new and read the legislation bringing with it a new system and a new road in light thereof, and then there is no difficulty in holding that it has superseded the enactment of 1882 so far as relates to giving vitality and efficacy to all that is involved in allowing this appeal and maintaining the judgment of the learned trial judge herein.\nApart from all that, what right have we to assume that expenditure of the $80,000 and still larger sums under later by-laws was not properly made on the remaining part of the Queenston and Grimsby Road, yet the judgment appealed from stands as a barrier to collect such debentures.\nNor do I see any means directed by the judgment appealed from to be taken to separate the expenditures on the Queenston and Grimsby Road from all else in respect of the entire system in relation to which the assessment is made so far as down to and including 1918 is concerned under the heading of good roads debentures.\nI repeat that the enactment relied upon for the said judgment in appeal related evidently to that part of that Queenston and Grimsby Road lying within the original Township of Grimsby.\nThe greater part of that road, so named, lies between Grimsby and the frontier town of Queenston, and forms part of the system as well as that within said original Grimsby township, and, I imagine, even whether looked at in accord with or despite the reasoning of the judgment appealed from, should furnish grounds for assessment and levying of rates as to the other three-fourths of that road. Yet the express terms of the formal judgment appealed from stands as a barrier in the way of doing so and casts the burden to be borne by South Grimsby on North Grimsby.\nThe formal judgment well illustrates the dangers of taking a mere name as a guide instead of the actual realities contained in the legislative enactments of recent years descriptive of another creation known under the designation of a system and in relation to which there is no prohibition by statute or otherwise to which the name Queenston and Grimsby can be properly applied as a whole, though for the purposes of obeying the new legislation and identifying and tracing that which in a small part it comprehends, the name Queenston and Grimsby may have to be used.\nI submit, most respectfully, that such names may be used without transgressing section 8 of 46 Victoria, c. 33.\nAnd when we are dealing with the adoption of a system which in this instance is to cover one hundred and fifty-seven or more miles of road, of which at the utmost the mere name Queenston and Grimsby Road could only cover a fifth and at the true measure of its significance, if any at all, a twentieth part of the scheme or system as a whole.\nAnd why should the mere name be so extensively applied? And again, when any significance it could have is reduced to such proportions, how can the old Act be invoked?\nThe truth seems to be, I repeat, that the new system or scheme was intentionally designed to supersede the old and ignore all therein so long as no actual injustice done of which, I repeat, the majority of the county council were to be primary judges. The only proper remedy against their transgression thereof was an appeal to the Minister of Public Works or a motion to quash which never was made.\nThe by-law is now unassailable. The scheme provided by the Act in question is not part of the Municipal Act and must be viewed in same light as if it had been entrusted to some other authority named by the Act and so carried out with all its consequences regardless of the Act of 1882 which had no relevancy to such a new enterprise.\nAnd yet this declaration of right is maintained in face of the further fact that under the Provincial Highway Act of 1917, passed two months or so after the adoption by appellants of the new system, the road in question had been adopted by the province 15th August, 1918, or a year before this action brought. That legislation seems to have superseded entirely any such mere municipal theories of obligation as raised herein.\nAny one who recalls the many phases through which the question of roads and building thereof has proceeded, from provincial back to provincial, should realize that there is no difficulty in finding that this new scheme or system is not to be determined by mere ordinary legislation, but by the salient fact that the appellant was a mere agent or trustee of the Government to act in clear supersession of all that had preceded it.\nMuch was said in argument relative to the bargaining with respondent through its then reeve and his authority on behalf of his council which tends to confusion of thought for in fact no such bargain can be relied upon further than as a means of realizing whether or not all due means were taken to enable the county council to determine whether what was proposed and done answered the equitable treatment required by the Act in adopting the new system. In concluding, however, it seems clear that section 8 upon which so much reliance has been placed never was more than a precautionary measure having relation to the plan then observed between the county, then owner of the Queenston and Grimsby Road, and some of the municipalities through which it passed, for its maintenance. That was a more temporary expedient at its best and might have been abandoned at any time by those concerned.\nThe county, however, was, in 1885, by section 24 of the Municipal Amendment Act of that year, which reads as follows:\n24. Section 565 of the said Act is hereby amended by adding thereto the following sub\u2011section:\n(7) For abandoning or otherwise disposing of the whole or any portion of a toll road owned by a county, whether situated wholly within the county or partly within the county and partly within an adjoining county or counties, and on the passing of any such by-law the clerk shall forthwith forward a certified copy thereof to the local municipality or municipalities through or along which any portion of said abandoned road shall run or border upon,\nenabled to abandon the whole road.\nThat amendment was again amended by the section 566 of the Municipal Act in the Revised Statutes of Ontario of 1887, adding a proviso requiring the approval of the Lieutenant Governor in Council.\nAnd that in turn amended in 1890 by the Municipal Amendment Act of that year, as follows:\u2014\n32. Sub-section 7 of section 566 of the said Act is amended by inserting after the word \u201ctoll\u201d in the second line thereof, the words \u201cor any other\u201d.\nAgain that was amended in 1893 so as to require the assent of the municipalities affected.\nClearly the municipalities through which the road ran were alone supposed to be affected. Again by 3 & 4 Geo. V., c. 448, now appearing in the Revised Statutes of Ontario, 1914, c. 192, sec. 448, it was again amended as follows:\u2014\n448.\u2014(1) The council of any county may by by-law abandon the whole or any part of a toll road owned by the corporation of the county or of any other road owned by it, whether the road is situate wholly within the county or partly within it and partly within an adjoining county.\n(2) Forthwith after the passing of the by-law the clerk shall transmit by registered post to the clerk of every local municipality through or along or on the border of which the road runs a copy of the by-law certified under his hand and the seal of the corporation to be a true copy.\n(3) The by-law shall not take effect unless or until it is approved by the Municipal Board, nor shall it take effect as to the part of the road lying within or along or on the border of a local municipality whose council does not by by-law consent to the by-law.\n(4) From and after the taking effect of the by-law the council of a municipality within which any part of the road so abandoned lies shall have jurisdiction over that part of it which lies within the municipality, and where any part of a road so abandoned lies between or on the border of two or more local municipalities the councils of such municipalities shall have joint jurisdiction over that part of it.\n(5) Nothing in this section shall extend or apply to a bridge which under the provisions of this Act is to be maintained wholly or partly by the corporation of the county.\nWhat occurs to me reading these many amendments as part of the story is how the respondent seems to have been completely ignored and the meaning it seeks to attach to section 8 never occurred to anybody concerned in this legislation.\nDuring the early period there was absolutely nothing but the will of the County of Lincoln appellant that need be observed.\nIn later years some regard was had to the possibility of how such abandonment might affect the general public.\nOn such a tenuous thread, in the last analysis, does the contention of respondent and the judgment appealed from now hang; that is, the non-observance by the county of its powers of abandonment in a due and orderly manner before proceeding to adopt the new system. I have no hesitation in repeating my opinion that such like threads were all swept away and respectfully submit that they should not be considered as any obstacle in the way of the will of the legislature enacting the legislation giving effect to the new system and that of the Lieutenant Governor in Council approving of what has been done in the issue of the debentures now questioned herein.\nBy no means do I wish to ignore the force of the argument of the appellants\u2019 counsel that the respondent should be held estopped by its course of conduct from asserting its present pretensions.\nI have thought it wiser to present my argument in the way of a close adherence to the basic principle of the equitable considerations which the enactment renders imperative.\nThe principle upon which estoppel rests may be but another mode of expressing the same idea. And I incline to think the estoppel argument may well answer the right to have at this stage any such declaratory judgment as appealed from.\nAnd I may add that so far as relates to by-law no. 605 and others passed for raising money for construction, very drastic remedies were given by the enactment of 5 Geo. V, c. 16, sec. 4.\nThe appeal should be allowed with costs here and in the Appellate Division and the judgment of the trial judge restored.\nDUFF J.\u2014I do not dissent from the opinion of the majority. Not without a great deal of doubt, on the whole I think the preferable view is that the situation created by the Highway Act of 1914 and the responsibilities arising under that Act are not within the contemplation of the special Act of 1882; and that liability in respect of the rates in question is not within the classes of liabilities dealt with by section 8 of the last named enactment.\nANGLIN J.\u2014I am, with very great respect, of the opinion that this appeal should be allowed and the judgment of the learned trial judge dismissing the action restored.\nThe rates in question are imposed by the County of Lincoln for the reconstruction of the highway, formerly known as the Queenston and Grimsby Macadamized Road, as part of \u201ca system of county highways\u201d created and provided for by a by-law of the county municipality duly enacted and ratified under the Highway Improvement Act R.S.O. [1914] c. 40. They are rates imposed under the authority of s. 15 of that Act and are not, as I think, rates, taxes, liabilities or expenditures contemplated by, or within the purview of, the exemption in favour of the respondent township conferred by section 8 of 45 V., c. 33. The road dealt with by that exemption provision was not \u201ca county road\u201d in the ordinary sense of that term as used in the Municipal Act, but a road which belonged to the County of Lincoln. Its history is detailed in Lincoln v St Catharines [3]. So long as it remained such a road to be kept up by the county council like other property owned by the county, the exemption provision of 45 Vict., c. 33 applied to all expenditure for its construction, renewal or upkeep. But when the County Council determined that it should become part of a system of highways under the Highway Improvement Act and enacted the requisite by-law its character was entirely changed. It became subject to the regulations of the Public Works Department with respect to the construction and repair of highways (sec. 6) under the supervision of an engineer or other competent person as county road superintendent (s. 7). Liability to contribute to the cost of its reconstruction and upkeep as a highway under that system must be determined by the provisions of that Act. As put by the learned Chief Justice of Ontario in Village of Merritton v. County of Lincoln[4].\nthe liability to contribute to the cost of the improvement of the road under the Highway Improvement Act is, in my view, a very different one from that with which the special Act deals: it is not a liability in connection with the assumption of the road as a \u201ccounty work,\u201d but a liability arising out of the provisions of the Highway Improvement Act, by reason of the road being made a part of a system of county roads for which that Act provides.\nSection 15 of the Highway Improvement Act authorizes a county to pass by-laws to raise by debentures the sums necessary to meet the expenditures on highways under the Act not exceeding two per centum of the equalized assessment of the county, or to provide the money out of county funds or by an annual county rate in the manner authorized by the Municipal Act.\nThis section clearly authorizes the imposition of a rate to meet the debentures or an annual county rate to be imposed upon all the ratable property in the county, and is, I think, in no way in conflict with the special Act, for these expenditures are not a liability or expenditure connected with the assumption of the road by the appellant, but an entirely different liability or expenditure, incurred for the purposes of the Highway Improvement Act.\nWith profound respect, the distinction which the Appellate Division Court suggests between the case now before us and the Merritton Case4 seems to me to be more apparent than real. The learned Chief Justice says: I am of the opinion that this case is not governed by Merritton v. Lincoln5 and that the principle of that case is not applicable.\nIn that case, the liability from which certain municipalities were relieved was\n\u201cany liability or expenditure connected with the assumption by the Corporation of the County of Lincoln of the Queenston and Grimsby Road as a county road\u201d and the ratio decidendi was that the liability under the Highway Improvement Act was not a liability connected with the assumption of the road as a county road but a different liability arising out of the provisions of that Act.\nWhat by the statute relieving the appellant it was relieved from was:\n\u201cany rate, tax, liability or expenditure whatsoever which but for the passing of this Act would have been assessable, ratable and taxable against the township of Grimsby in respect, or on account of the road known as The Queenston and Grimsby Road.\u201d\nThis language is of the most comprehensive character and not as in the Act under consideration in Merritton v. Lincoln[5] limited to liability connected with the assumption of the road as a county road.\nBut in the Merritton judgment I find this passage:\nIt may be assumed for the purpose of the case at bar, that the special Act relieved the exempted municipalities not only from the cost of acquiring the road but also from the expenditure for its upkeep, but it does not follow from that that they are relieved from the expenditure to be made upon it because it is made part of the good roads system of the county and, in my opinion, they are not relieved from it.\nWhen the exempting statute in question in the Merritton Case5 26 V. c. 13 is examined we find in the preamble that maintenance of the Queenston and Grimsby Road was one of the things against which relief was sought by the local municipalities then petitioning and that the legislature deemed it expedient to grant the prayer of the petition. It would therefore seem to have been quite properly assumed by the Appellate Divisional Court in the Merritton Case5 that the exemption granted extended to the expenditure for the upkeep of the road as part of that connected with (that is resulting from) its assumption. I agree in the conclusion reached in the Merritton Case5 and think the learned trial judge in the present case was justified in applying the principle of that decision, as he did, and that his judgment, therefore, should not have been interfered with.\nMoreover, under section 26 of the Highway Improvement Act, provision is made in the case of the assumption by the County Council of a main or leading road, such as the Queenston and Grimsby Road was, as a county road for the total or partial exemption, with the approval of the Minister, from assessment for the cost of such road of any township which is not served by it equally with the other municipalities in the county. By section 12 approval of the by-law establishing the county system of highways by the Lieutenant Governor-in-Council is required and provision is made for hearing any dissatisfied township council. If South Grimsby thought itself equitably entitled to have the exemption provided for by 45 V. c. 33, extended to its liability for the reconstruction and upkeep of what had been the Queenston & Grimsby Road after it was made part of the county system of highways, its recourse was to ask the county council for relief under section 26 of the statute and, if refused, to apply to the Lieutenant Governor-in-Council to withhold his approval of the by-law establishing the system until the county council should have made what the Lieutenant Governor-in-Council should deem a fair and equitable provision in its favour under section 26. Not having taken that course, it cannot in my opinion now successfully invoke section 8 of the 45 Vict. c. 33 as entitling it to refuse to pay its proportionate share of the cost of construction and upkeep of the county system of highways under the Highway Improvement Act. It appears from the evidence, however, that the exemption of South Grimsby provided for by the statute of 1882 was brought to the attention of the county council when it was considering the by-law for the formation of a system of county highways and was considered by it to entitle the Township of South Grimsby to specially favourable treatment in regard to the mileage of highways to be brought under the system so as to make the plan and the distribution of expenditure under it equitable in regard to that township as contemplated by section 4, rather than to an exemption, total or partial, from assessment under section 26, which, so far as the evidence discloses, was not claimed on its behalf. I am not at all satisfied that South Grimsby was entitled to ask for \u201ccompensation\u201d under the provisions of subsection 1 of section 4 of the Highway Improvement Act. It did not fail to \u201cbenefit proportionately\u201d either \u201cby reason of the location of (the) highways\u201d to be taken into the system or \u201cof the unequal distribution of the expenditure thereon\u201d\u2014which are the only grounds of claim for equitable compensation mentioned in the section. The county council, however, seems to have been disposed to treat South Grimsby with absolute fairness and accordingly included in the \u201csystem of county highways,\u201d by way of making such \u201ccompensation\u201d to it, five miles of highway in excess of the proportion to which it would have been entitled, with the result that it has benefited by the provincial contribution of 40% of the cost of constructing such additional five miles of highway provided for by the statute (5 Geo. V. c. 16, s. 5) and by the amounts assessed therefor on the other municipalities. MIGNAULT J.\u2014The question to be decided in this case is whether the respondent can set up, against a by-law and a levy made by the appellant under the Highway Improvement Act (R.S.O. c 40) an exemption from taxation in respect of the Queenston and Grimsby Road granted in 1882 to the respondent.\nThe statute giving this exemption is 45 Vict., ch. 33 (Ontario), which divided the Township of Grimsby into two municipalities, respectively called North Grimsby and South Grimsby. Inasmuch as the Queenston and Grimsby Road crosses the northern portion of the Township of Grimsby only, section 8 of this statute provided as follows:\nFrom and after the said last Monday of December, one thousand eight hundred and eighty-two, any rate, tax, liability or expenditure whatsoever, which, but for the passing of this Act, would have been assessable, ratable and taxable against the said original Township of Grimsby, in respect or on account of the road known as the Queenston and Grimsby Road, shall be assessed, rated and taxed against the said Township of North Grimsby, and shall be borne and paid by the said Township of North Grimsby solely, and the said Township of South Grimsby shall not thereafter be liable or be rated, assessed or taxed therefor.\nIn 1907, the Ontario Legislature adopted an Act for the improvement of public highways, called the Highway Improvement Act, which, as subsequently amended, is now chapter 40 of the Revised Statutes of 1914. Section 4 of this statute (I quote from the revision) empowers the council of any county to adopt by by-law a plan for the improvement of highways throughout the county by assuming highways in any municipality in the county in order to form or extend a system of county highways. And in case it is impracticable to benefit all the townships in any county equitably by a system of county highways, such plan may provide for compensation to any township, which by reason of the location of such highways or of unequal distribution of the expenditure thereon may not benefit proportionately, by a grant of such specific amount or annual sum to be expended in the improvement of the highways of such township as will make the plan adopted equitable for the whole county.\nThe statute provides for the carrying out of the purposes of the legislature, the improvement of public highways, and gives the county council power to issue debentures or to raise money by an annual county rate in the manner authorized by the Municipal Act. Section 26 contains a provision somewhat on the fines of the latter portion of section 4 empowering the county council, with the approval of the Minister of Public Works, to omit from assessment any township through which the road assumed as a county road does not pass, or to assess the townships through which it does pass, for a larger or smaller amount, in order to equitably assess the cost.\nAs I have stated, the question now is whether as against the scheme authorized, by R.S.O. chapter 40, and liability for assessment thereunder, the Township of South Grimsby can claim the benefit of the exemption from taxation for the Queenston and Grimsby Road enacted in 1882.\nIt is explained that this road is part of the public highway from Hamilton to the Niagara River, and the improvement of a highway of this character would naturally come under such a scheme of improvement as chapter 40 establishes. The history of the Queenston and Grimsby Road may be found in the report of the case of County of Lincoln v. City of St. Catharines[6]. It was originally constructed by the provincial government and subsequently taken over by a joint stock road company from which the county council purchased it in 1860. In The Queen v. Corporation of Louth[7], it was decided that the county corporation held this road, not as a county road belonging to the county within the meaning of the statute, but as the assignee of the road company. Some of the local municipalities in the county of Lincoln through which the road did not pass obtained legislation relieving them from any liability for expenditure connected with its assumption by the county as a county road and charging therewith, among other municipalities, the Township of Grimsby. When the latter township was divided in 1882 by the statute above referred to, South Grimsby was exempted from any rate, tax, liability or expenditure whatsoever, which, but for the passing of the statute, would have been assessable, ratable and taxable against the original Township of Grimsby in respect or on account of the Queenston and Grimsby Road, and it was declared that North Grimsby alone should bear this liability.\nIn Village of Merritton v. County of Lincoln[8] the Highway Improvement Act (R.S.C. ch. 40) was considered, and the Appellate Divisional Court held that assuming the statute 26 Vict. ch. 13 (one of the Acts relieving some local municipalities from liability or expenditure in connection with the assumption by the County of Lincoln of the Queenston and Grimsby Road as a county road), relieved the exempted municipalities from the expenditure for the upkeep of this road, they were not thereby exempted from liability for the expenditure to be made upon it in consequence of it being made part of the good roads system of the county. This decision gave to the Highway Improvement Act full effect, irrespective of the exemption from taxation of certain local municipalities by special statutes, such as the one relied on by the township of South Grimsby in the present case.\nAlthough the statute 26 Vict. ch. 13, considered in the Merritton Case[9] is not in identically the same terms as section 8 of 45 Vict. ch. 33, still its general effect is similar, so that the reasons given by the Appellate Divisional Court in that case should also apply here. But looking at the two statutes only, the Highway Improvement Act and the special Act relied on by South Grimsby, my opinion is that the exemption clause of the latter would not stand in the way of the County of Lincoln in proceeding under the former statute.\nThe decision in the English Court of Appeal in Sion College v. London Corporation[10], seems to me in point. There the appellants relied on a statute of George III providing that certain lands in the City of London reclaimed from the River Thames, should vest in the adjoining owners \u201cfree from all taxes and assessments whatsoever\u201d. The City of London Sewers Act, 1848, subsequently authorized the collection of a consolidated rate, some of the objects to which this rate was to be applied being of a kind for which rates were made at the time of the passing of the Act of George III, the others being new. It was held that the exemption applied only to then existing taxes and assessments or others substituted for them, and that the consolidated rate, although it included some purposes for which rates were made when the exemption was created, was substantially a new assessment, and was therefore not within the exemption.\nI would allow the appeal with costs here and in the Appellate Division and restore the judgment of the learned trial judge.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the Appellants, County of Lincoln: Marquis & Pepler.\nSolicitor for the Appellant, North Grimsby: G.B.

V, the Criminal Code, for leave to appeal from the judgment of the Court of King's Bench, appeal side, whereby the above named George Janouski has been granted a new trial, and the ground taken is that said judgment conflicts with the judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia in the case of Rex v. Davis[1] where a new trial was refused notwithstanding that the appellant had been tried, against his will, jointly with another accused party.\nI am, after a perusal of the several notes of judgment herein and a comparison thereof with the several notes of judgment in the Davis Case1 unable to recognize any such conflict between the judgment herein and that in the Davis Case1 as to furnish a basis upon which I could properly rest such an order as applied for.\nThe result to the respective prisoner in each case is quite different, and so were the relevant facts and circumstances which the respective courts had to consider and pass upon quite different.\nThe court in the Davis Case1 was able to say in the light of the said facts and circumstances to be considered that there was no miscarriage of justice; but in this case the court unanimously came to the conclusion that as the result of a joint trial there had been a miscarriage of justice.\nIn neither case were the reasons assigned such as to lead to the unanimous conclusion that a separate trial where several accused were jointly indicted could be claimed as of right. I think that the conflict had in view in the amendment, clearly must be one of law and not any one of the accidental results of litigation from a different set of facts and circumstances. The object thereby sought is to render the administration of the criminal law as uniform as possible.\nI agree fully in the desirability of our doing what we can to bring about such result.\nTo give leave to appeal herein would not promote such an object but on the contrary, I fear, tend to confusion.\nI doubt if the denial or granting of a separate trial to one jointly indicted which rests on the exercise of sound discretion can ever become the subject of leave to appeal under the amendment in question.\nHaving formed an opinion adverse to the application herein, I felt it advisable to consult such of my colleagues as available and may say that a sufficient number to constitute a majority of the court agree in the result reached, though in no way responsible for the foregoing reasons which I assign for refusing the order allowing appeal.

Instead of instituting extradition proceedings, the detective obtained the arrest of the appellant under a warrant of deportation, as an undesirable, issued by the U. S. Imigration authorities. On being brought before two emigration officers and informed that he would be deported, the appellant declared that he was \"as good as dead\". The officers asked: \"Why?\"; and the appellant then answered by making certain admissions as to his presence at the lumber camp at the time of the murder. At the trial, the two officers gave evidence as to these statements by the accused.\nHeld that the evidence was admissible, as the statements made by the accused were \"voluntary\" within the rule laid down in the case of Ibrahim v The King ([1914] A.C. 599), Mignault J dubitante.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King's Bench, appeal side, Province of Quebec, upholding the conviction of the appellant and dismissing the application made by him for a new trial on a stated case. The material facts of the case and the questions in issue are fully stated in the above head-note and in the judgments now reported.\nAlleyn Taschereau K.C. for the appellant.\nLucien Cannon K.C. for the respondent.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014This is an appeal from the Court of King's Bench of the Province of Quebec, which by a majority upheld the conviction of the appellant Prosko, or \"Big Mike\" as he was generally called, on the charge of the murder of a man in one of the lumber camps of Quebec. Prosko had been tried jointly with another man named Janousky before Chief Justice Sir Fran\u00e7ois Lemieux and a jury. Both were found guilty by the jury; but on appeal to the Court of King's Bench, the conviction against Janousky was unanimously quashed and a new trial granted to him, while the conviction against the appellant Prosko was by a majority of that court upheld, the Chief Justice Lamothe and Greenshields J. dissenting.\nThe reasons of the court for quashing the conviction against Janousky substantially were that certain statements, admissions or confessions made to the police officers of the city of Detroit by Prosko when he was in custody there, as to his own and Janousky's connection with the. murder for which they were being jointly tried were inadmissible as against Janousky, and calculated to prejudice his receiving a fair and impartial trial, and this notwithstanding that the trial judge in charging the jury had fully and explicitly told them they were not to consider or give any weight to these alleged admissions or statements or confessions, as they were called, of Prosko as against his co-prisoner Janousky.\nThe court was unanimous on this point of granting a new trial to Janousky but a majority, as I have stated, held, and in my opinion, properly that these statements, admissions or confessions of Prosko were admissible against himself in the circumstances and under the conditions in which they were made, and that they would not interfere, in Prosko's case, with the judicial discretion exercised by the trial judge in refusing to grant the application of counsel for a separate trial of each of the prisoners.\nThe questions reserved for the consideration of the Court of King's Bench were as follows:\u2014\n(1) Was there error in refusing a separate trial to the accused?\n(2) Was there error in admitting the testimony of the two witnesses Heig and Mitte, as to certain statements or so-called admissions made by one of the accused, Prosko?\n(a) as to the accused Prosko?\n(b) as to the other accused Janousky?\n(c) seeing the admissions made by Prosko were so made in the absence of Janousky, were the instructions of the trial judge to the jury that statements made by one of the prisoners did not make evidence against the other, sufficient?\n(3) Was there error in admitting the testimony of the witness Roussin with respect to certain statements made by Prosko either before or after his arrest?\n(4) Was there error in permitting the Crown to produce before and exhibit to the jury as exhibits certain objects which were found in the possession of one or other of the accused on or in the premises occupied by one or other of them?\nSo far as Janousky is concerned, the questions are finally disposed of and we need not concern ourselves with them. As to the other accused, Prosko, question (3) was abandoned at the hearing before us, leaving the three questions to be considered by us on this appeal:\u2014 (1) the refusal of a separate trial to him;\n(2) the admission in evidence of the statements or confessions sworn to by Heig and Mitte as having been made to them by Prosko; and\n(3) the production as exhibits of clothing and other articles such as a mask, a false moustache and an electric torch, said to have been found in a valise or parcel in Prosko's room in his boarding house in Montreal. With regard to the first of these questions, I have no difficulty in declining to interfere with the judicial discretion exercised by the trial judge in refusing to grant the application for such separate trial for Prosko. It is true the app\u00fccation was made twice; once, when the trial began and, afterwards, when it was proposed to put in Heig and Mitte's evidence respecting Prosko's statements or confessions (so-called) to them. But I am quite unable to find any possible prejudice which could arise to Prosko from this refusal. There might be and in fact the Court of King's Bench held it to be quite possible that a joint trial coupled with the admission of such evidence, notwithstanding the judge's charge to the jury that they were not to consider or give any weight to these alleged admissions or statements of Prosko as against his co-prisoner, might prejudice Janousky, and that it was impossible to say what effect they might have had on the minds of the jurymen. But as regards Prosko, admitting for the moment the admissibility of such evidence, I cannot find any possible prejudice which its admission would cause to him.\nThen as to the admissibility of this evidence as against Prosko, I think the statement of Lord Sumner, when delivering the reasons for the conclusions of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, in the case of Ibrahim v. The King[1] correctly states the rule in that regard: It has long been established as a positive rule of English criminal law that no statement by an accused is admissible in evidence against him unless it is shewn by the prosecution to have been a voluntary statement, in the sense that it has not been obtained from him either by fear of prejudice or hope of advantage exercised or held out by a person in authority. The principle is as old as Lord Hale.\nSee also The King v Colpus[2]; The King v. Voisin[3];Rex v. Cook[4].\nI have read the evidence of each of these witnesses Heig and Mitte most carefully. I concede that they were persons in authority having at the time Prosko in their custody with the intention of bringing him before the United States Immigration Board to be examined whether or not he was an undesirable immigrant to the United States, and with a view to his deportation being ordered if he was found undesirable.\nI fail to find the slightest evidence that Prosko's statements or confessions were induced or obtained from him either\nby fear of prejudice or hope of advantage exercized or held out\nby either Mitte or Heig to him. On the contrary I conclude that Prosko's statements were absolutely voluntary ones. After having been told by these witnesses in Detroit that they were going to take up his case with the United States Immigration officials and have him deported to Canada, Prosko replied:\u2014 \"I am as good as dead if you send me over there.\" The officers in reply to this naturally asked \"Why\"? Whereupon Prosko proceeded to give his statement as given in evidence by these two witnesses. (It must be remembered that the time when he made these statements or confessions was before he was brought before the Immigration Board, and that later, when he was brought before that Board he repeated under oath, as Heig and Mitte say in evidence, the statement he had already made to them. The Immigration Board on hearing his statement or confession made the necessary order for his deportation). Under these circumstances I feel bound to answer the second question in the negative.\nAs regards the third question to be considered by us on this appeal, I feel bound to say that I cannot see any reason why the crown, having by its officer, Roussin, visited the boarding house in Montreal of Prosko, and having there been shown the rooms said to have been occupied by Prosko and one Yvasko, should not have produced the articles found there and put them in as exhibits. If the crown produced any of these articles found in this room of Prosko's it was bound, in my opinion, to produce all articles found there.\nI do not attach any great importance to the production of these articles. They consisted in part of an electric flashlight, a false moustache, several photos of Prosko, a cap and other articles.\nThe question of their being improperly admitted as exhibits was not strongly pressed at bar, and even if they were improperly given in evidence as exhibits, which I do not at all concede, I cannot think it possible that \"any substantial wrong or miscarriage\" was thereby occasioned on the trial as regards Prosko.\nUnless there was in our opinion such substantial wrong or miscarriage occasioned, we are forbidden by sec. 1019 of the Criminal Code to set aside the conviction or direct a new trial.\nUnder all these circumstances and on my findings with respect to the questions submitted to us, I am of the opinion that the appeal must be dismissed. Idington J.\u2014Four men entered, during the night of the 27th July, 1918, a lumber camp in the Province of Quebec, for the purpose of robbing the men therein, and, in the course of such pursuit, shot and killed one of the men there.\nTwo of the said four were convicted of the murder and were executed in July, 1920.\nThereafter the appellant and another named Janousky were placed on trial in Quebec. In their defence they were represented by the same counsel who asked the court to direct that they be tried separately, but this privilege was denied them.\nThe trial resulted in the conviction of both. Thereupon a stated case was directed by the Court of King's Bench and, upon the hearing thereof, a new trial was granted Janousky but, by a majority of the court, denied the appellant.\nThe learned Chief Justice and Mr. Justice Green-shields dissented from the said denial of a new trial to the appellant. Hence this appeal here based on some of the grounds taken in such dissent.\nThe first question so raised is as follows:\n(1) Was there error in refusing a separate trial to the accused.?\nThe Court of King's Bench having unanimoulsy arrived at the conclusion that as to Janousky there was error, we have nothing to say as to that aspect of the case except to make clear the reason for so distinguishing.\nThere were many statements made by appellant which the trial court admitted in evidence against him, and in some of these he had referred to Janousky, under his nickname of \"little George,\" in such a way as to implicate him. There was a possibility of the jury having been impressed thereby to the detriment of Janousky and, in that result, to have confused that and somewhat similar incidents in other features of the case as presented by the entire evidence, nothwithstanding the clear and express direction of the learned trial judge to the jury to apply the evidence in such a way as to avoid such possible error.\nThere was no such counterpart in the evidence against Janousky alone as would tend to the confusion thereof with the case made against the appellant alone.\nIn the broad salient features of the case demonstrating the actual perpetration of the crime there was nothing to confuse. It is merely when the evidence of the identification of the accused, or either of them, came to be considered by the jury that there was a possibility of undesirable confusion of thought.\nWhatever may have been possible in that regard relevant to Janousky, and to his detriment, I cannot see how appellant was likely to have suffered the like from anything in the evidence directed to Janousky's part, if any, in the matter in question.\nCounsel for appellant, indeed did not point to anything specific in that regard but seemed to rest upon and press the possibility of appellant having been able to call Janousky as a witness on his behalf if a separate trial had been granted.\nThere is nothing specific in way of fact presented to support this contention.\nNor, so far as I can see, was such a pretension presented to the learned trial judge.\nI cannot see any good ground for the allowance of this appeal by way of answering this question in the affirmative. The next question raised herein is as to the admissibility of the evidence of Heig and Mitte who swear that appellant, after having been presented with the decision of the authorities in Detroit that he was to be deported back to Canada as an undesirable citizen, said \"I am as good as dead\" which naturally evoked the question \"how is that\"? and he proceeded to to tell a story which, as I read its introduction, was not improperly induced within the meaning of the rule in that regard as set forth by Lord Sumner in the case cited to us, as follows:\u2014\nIt has long been established as a positive rule of English Criminal law, that no statement by an accused is admissible in evidence against him unless it is shown by the prosecution to have been a voluntary statement, in the sense that it has not been obtained from him either by fear of prejudice or hope of advantage exercised or held out by a person in authority. The principle is as old as Lord Hale.\nI refer to the case of Ibrahim v. The King,[5] at foot of page 609 and top of 610. The dictum from which I quote was approved in the later case of The King v. Voisin[6].\nAs pointed out in argument the said case was decided on other grounds and the ruling only an incident, but nevertheless, this is a fair presentation of the rule invoked by the dissenting judges in the Court of King's Bench.\nIt is the inducement exercised by the officers in charge that is to be guarded against and not the accidental circumstances of an arrest and the bearing thereof on the mind of one accused that has to be guarded against.\nAnd the evidence of each of these witnesses is introduced by a distant categorical denial of having exercised any of these practices which would bring the evidence given within the rule against its admission. I think, therefore, the learned trial judge's ruling was right and that the question raised anent same must be answered in the negative.\nThen as to Roussin's evidence the appellant was distinctly warned by him upon his arrest that anything he said would be used against him and hence no ground for the contention set up.\nIn truth it seems to have been assumed in argument here as hopeless to argue, if held that the evidence of the American detectives of statements made by accused, without express warning, was admissible, then Roussin's story in what he tells, so far as it was substantially the same as had been told by the said detectives, could not be rejected.\nI am decidedly of the opinion that both were admissible.\nThe only other question upon which counsel for appellant rested his appeal was the fourth question of the stated case, which reads as follows:\nWas there error in permitting the Crown to produce before and exhibit to the jury as exhibirs certain objects which were found in the possession of one or other of the accused on or in the premises occupied by one or other of them?\nI, with great respect, find it difficult to treat such a question seriously. Some of the articles found were not worthy of serious consideration by the jury, but the false moustache and flashlight, for example, were important items well worthy of consideration in a case such as this dependent to so great an extent as it was upon circumstantial evidence.\nThat which was incapable of being fitted into the chain of circumstances to be relied upon, of course, would be discarded by the jury to whom we must attribute common sense. It became the duty of the crown officer to present the suit-case contents as found and let the jury determine what was relevant and what was not. And then not leave the impression that accused was so intent in pursuit of easy money that he could think of nothing else, and hence carried only false moustaches, flashlights or glass cutters.\nThe question should be answered, as it was by the majority of the court below, in the negative.\nThe appeal herein should be dismissed.\nAnglin J.\u2014The material facts are sufficiently stated in the judgments delivered in the Court of King's Bench. Of the three questions argued before us only one in my opinion called for consideration, viz., whether certain statements alleged to have been made by the appellant to two American detectives (Heig and Mitte) were admissible in evidence against him. To both the other grounds of appeal s. 1019 Cr. G. appeared to me to afford a sufficient answer. But, having regard to the importance attached to the statements made to Heig and Mitte by the learned Chief Justice in charging the jury, the question of their admissibility cannot be thus disposed of.\nMy only reason for withholding concurrence in the judgment dismissing the appeal was that, owing to pressure of other work of the court, I had not had an opportunity of satisfying myself by a study of the record that the Crown had discharged the burden, which undoubtedly rested upon it, of establishing that the statements made by the appellant to Heig and Mitte were voluntary statements, in the sense that they had not been obtained from him by fear of prejudice or hope of advantage exercised or held out by a person in authority. Ibrahim v. The King[7]; The Queen v. Thompson[8]; The King v. Colpus[9]; The King v. Voisin[10].\nThe two detectives were persons in authority; the accused was in my opinion in the same plight as if in custody in extradition proceedings under a warrant charging him with murder. No warning whatever was given to him. While these facts do not in themselves suffice to exclude the admissions, as Duff J. appears to have held in The King v. Kay[11], they are undoubtedly circumstances which require that the evidence tendered to establish their voluntary character should be closely scrutinized. Rex v. Rodney[12].\nIf I should have reached the conclusion that the burden on the prosection of establishing the voluntary character of the alleged admissions had not been discharged, the proper result would have been to order not the discharge of the appellant (s. 1018 (d) Cr. C.), but his remand for a new trial (s. 1018 (b) Cr. C.) Since the majority of the court was clearly of the opinion that the impugned evidence was properly received and the appeal therefore failed, I did not feel justified in delaying the judgment and shortening the time available for consideration of the case by the Executive, merely to complete my own study of the evidence, especially in view of the fact that the case must in any event go before the Minister of Justice, who may, if he should entertain any doubt of the propriety of the conviction, grant the appellant the only relief to which he would in my opinion in any event have been entitled. (S. 1022 Cr. C.) For these reasons, while not dissenting, I refrained from concurring in the judgment affirming the conviction.\nSince the delivery of judgment, however, I have had an opportunity of considering the material evidence and I think I should state that I now see no reason to differ from the conclusion reached by the majority of the Court that the evidence in question was admissible. At all events the discretion exercised by the learned trial judge in receiving it could not properly have been interfered with. The King v. Voisin[13].\nBrodeur J.\u2014Trois questions nous sont soumises.\nLa premi\u00e9re est de savoir si l'accus\u00e9 Prosko avait eu raison de demander un proc\u00e8s s\u00e9par\u00e9 de son co-accus\u00e9 Janousky.\nLe pr\u00e9sident du tribunal a refus\u00e9 cette demande et les deux accus\u00e9s ont subi leur proc\u00e8s en m\u00eame temps et ont \u00e9t\u00e9 trouv\u00e9s coupables de meurtre.\nLa Cour du Banc du Roi a decid\u00e9 que Janousky avait eu raison de demander un proc\u00e8s s\u00e9par\u00e9 parce que des aveux faits par son complice Prosko ont pu lui causer un tort r\u00e9el et ont pu amener sa condamna-tion. La Cour du Banc du Roi a \u00e9t\u00e9 d'opinion que Prosko n'avait souffert aucun pr\u00e9judice d'avoir subi son proc\u00e8s en m\u00eame temps que son complice. Un nouveau proc\u00e8s s\u00e9par\u00e9 a donc \u00e9t\u00e9 accord\u00e9 \u00e0 Janousky, mais a \u00e9t\u00e9 refus\u00e9 \u00e0 Prosko.\nCe dernier appelle de cette d\u00e9cision.\nLa preuve au proc\u00e8s a \u00e9t\u00e9 en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral commune aux deux accus\u00e9s. Ils ont \u00e9t\u00e9 vus tous les deux pr\u00e8s de la sc\u00e9ne du meurtre, avant et apr\u00e8s. On a trouv\u00e9 \u00e0 leurs r\u00e9sidences respectives des effete dont se servent d'ordinaire ceux qui font du vol leur principale occupation. Dans le cas de Prosko, cette preuve de circonstances a \u00e9t\u00e9 fortifi\u00e9e par des aveux qu'il a faits avant et apr\u00e8s son arrestation pour meurtre.\nIl est bien \u00e9vident que ces admissions de Prosko pouvaient lui nuire consid\u00e9rablement; mais ces aveux pouvaient \u00eatre prouv\u00e9s, que Prosko e\u00fbt \u00e9t\u00e9 mis seul en accusation ou qu'il l'e\u00fbt \u00e9t\u00e9 avee son complice. Alors un proc\u00e8s s\u00e9par\u00e9 ne lui aurait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 plus favorable sur ce point. Il y a bien les effets trouv\u00e9s chez Janousky dont la mention au proc\u00e8s de Prosko aurait pu lui porter pr\u00e9judice. Mais on en a trouv\u00e9 des semblables chez lui. Alors il me semble que cette preuve quant aux effets trouv\u00e9s chez Janousky ne peut pas \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme ayant cause un tort r\u00e9el \u00e0 Prosko. L'article 1019 du code criminel couvre le cas. Je dirais donc que le pr\u00e9sident du tribunal n'a pas fait d'erreur en refusant d'accorder \u00e0 Prosko un proc\u00e8s s\u00e9par\u00e9.\nLa deuxi\u00e8me question qui nous est soumise porte sur des aveux qui auraient \u00e9t\u00e9 faits par Prosko aux t\u00e9moins Heig et Mitte.\nLe d\u00e9tective Roussin, qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 charg\u00e9 de retrouver les auteurs du meurtre, avait appris que Prosko pouvait \u00eatre l'un des meurtriers et, un an environ apr\u00e8s que le crime e\u00fbt \u00e9t\u00e9 commis, il l'a retrac\u00e9 \u00e0 D\u00e9troit, dans les Etats-Unis. Il s'est alors abouch\u00e9 avec deux d\u00e9tectives de cette derni\u00e8re ville, Heig et Mitte, et ils ont d\u00e9cid\u00e9, pour \u00e9viter les frais d'un proc\u00e8s en extradition, que Prosko serait amen\u00e9 devant les autorit\u00e9s de l\u2019immigration, qui, si elles trouvaient que Prosko n'\u00e9tait pas un citoyen d\u00e9sirable, pourraient le d\u00e9porter des Etats-Unis au Canada. On l'arr\u00eate pour violation des lois d'immigration. On lui dit qu'il va \u00eatre d\u00e9port\u00e9 au Canada, et alors il d\u00e9clare en pr\u00e9sence de Heigh et Mitte qu'il ne veut pas retourner au Canada; et il ajoute:\" I am as good as dead\". Les d\u00e9tectives lui demandent pourquoi, et alors il raconte qu'il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 dans un camp avec certains hommes qui avaient alors commis un meurtre. Ces d\u00e9larations ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faites volontairement, sans aucune menace et sans aucune sollicitation.\nLes decisions r\u00e9centes en Angleterre sont \u00e0 l'effet que des d\u00e9clarations faites comme dans le cas actuel doivent \u00eatre re\u00e7ues par les tribunaux. Ibrahim v. The King[14]; The King v. Colpus,[15]; The King v. Voisin,[16]. Il est \u00e0 remarquer que ces d\u00e9clarations de Prosko ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faites avant qu'il ne f\u00fbt arr\u00eat\u00e8 pour meurtre. Je suis d'opinion que la cour n'a pas fait d'erreur en recevant les t\u00e9moignages de Heig et Mitte.\nLa troisi\u00e8me question est de savoir si les effets trouv\u00e9s dans les chambres des deux accus\u00e9s pouvaient \u00eatre produits comme exhibits dans la cause.\nCes effets ont \u00e9t\u00e9 produits comme \u00e9l\u00e9ments d'accusa-tion. Il est de r\u00e9gie, surtout dans le cas de meurtre, de produire devant la cour les effets dont l'accus\u00e9 aurait pu se servir pour commettre le crime dont il est accus\u00e9. On peut aussi produire des articles qui peuvent servir \u00e0 l'identifier.\nIl para\u00eet certain dans cette cause que le vol a \u00e9t\u00e9 le mobile du crime. Alors je ne vois pas pour ma part d'objection \u00e0 ce que l'on produise devant la cour des articles qui sont g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement utilis\u00e9s par les voleurs et que l'on trouve en la possession des accus\u00e9s. Il est possible que certains de ces articles n'ont pas d\u00fb servir \u00e0 la commission du crime. Mais cette circonstance ne serait pas suffisante pour constituer dans le cas de Prosko un d\u00e9ni de justice ou un tort grave. Je r\u00e9pondrai donc n\u00e9gativement \u00e0 cette troisi\u00e8me question.\nEn cons\u00e9quence l'appel doit \u00eatre renvoy\u00e9.\nMignault J.\u2014The only question raised by this appeal which appeared to me at the hearing to have any substance was whether the evidence of some statements made by Prosko at Detroit to the American detectives Heig and Mitte should have been allowed.\nWhen these statements were made Prosko was under arrest by virtue of a warrant issued by the United States Immigration authorities, as an undesirable, which warrant was served on him by one Roussin, a Canadian detective, who was seeking to bring him to trial in Canada on a murder charge, and instead of instituting extradition proceedings, it was considered better to have Prosko deported as an un-dersirable when he would of course be arrested on the murder charge. Roussin brought Prosko before the Immigration authorities in Detroit, and when informed by them that he would be deported, Prosko told them that he was as good as dead. Heig and Mitte then questioned him and it was under these circumstances that he made the statements which were given in evidence.\nI have serious doubts whether this evidence should have been allowed. The American detectives were persons in authority and Prosko's exclamation when told that he would be deported shows that he understood that his deportation was sought in order to have him brought to trial in Canada on the charge of murder. He evidently made the statements he did with the hope to escape deportation and his consequent arrest for murder, and the American detectives were persons in authority. It is true that he subsequently made similar admissions in Canada to Roussin, but the learned trial judge insisted in his charge on the evidence of Heig and Mitte as corroborating that of Roussin which otherwise the jury might have hesitated to accept as sufficient, so the introduction of this evidence may have caused a substantial wrong to the appellant. A majority of the court is, however, of the opinion, that the evidence of Heig and Mitte was admissible, so that Prosko's appeal cannot succeed. Under these circumstances I have not entered a formal dissent, but I cannot do otherwise than express my serious doubts as to the admissibility of this evidence.\nAppeal dismissed.\n[1] [1914] A.C. 599 at p. 609.\n[2] [1917] 1 K.B. 574;\n[3] [1918] 1 K.B. 531:\n[4] [1918] 34 Times L.

Brown (Plaintiff) Respondent.\n1921: November. 21; 1922: February. 7.\nPresent: Sir Louis Davies C.J. and Idington, Duff, Anglin and Brodeur JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF KING'S BENCH, APPEAL SIDE, PROVINCE OF QUEBEC.\nInjunction\u2014Offensive odors and fumes\u2014Residential neighbourhood\u2014 Proper remedy\u2014 Damages\u2014 Municipal control\u2014Enforcement of injunction\u2014Arts. 541, 957, 968, 971 C. C. P.\u2014Arts. 5639 (14) and 5688 R. S. Q. (1909)\u2014Art. 5991 R. S. Q. (1888)\u201441 V.c. 14, s. 12.\nNauseous and offensive odors and fumes emitted by a pulp mill to the detriment of a neighbouring property, causing to its occupants intolerable inconvenience and rendering it, at times, uninhabitable, are a proper subject of restraint; and, in such a case, the courts are not restricted to awarding relief by way of damages but may grant a perpetual injunction to restrain the manufacturer from continuation or repetition of the nuisance.\nAlthough the entire neighbouring population is affected by such nuisance and the municipal authorities have not thought proper to interfere on its behalf, even if the respondent is the only person objecting he is entitled to maintain a demand for injunction, if the injury suffered by him is sufficiently distinct in character from that common to the inhabitants at large.\nPer Davies C.J. and Anglin and Brodeur JJ.\u2014When such an injunction is granted \"under the pains and penalties provided by law\", it is susceptible of enforcement under the provisions of Article 971 C.C.P. which gives power to the courts to punish for contempt by way of fine or imprisonment.\nPer Davies C.J. and Anglin J.\u2014The jurisdiction and practice of the Quebec courts in regard to the remedy of injunction would seem to resemble the jurisdiction and practice of English courts rather than of the courts of France. Lombard v. Varennes (Q.R. 32 K. B. 164) considered.\nJudgment of the Court of King's Bench (Q.R. 31 K.B. 507) affirmed. APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King's Bench, Appeal side, Province of Quebec[1], affirming the judgment of the trial court and maintaining the respondent's action.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions at issue are fully stated in the judgments now reported.\nD. L. McCarthy K.C., J. L. Perron K.C. and A. W. P. Buchanan K.C., for the appellant. If the odours complained of constitute a nuisance, it is a public and not a private nuisance, and consequently respondent is not entitled to an injunction: Soltau v. de Held[2]; Benjamin v. Storr[3]; Bourdon v. B\u00e9nard[4]; Sen\u00e9cal v. Edison Electric Co.[5]; B\u00e9lair v. La Ville de Maison-neuve[6]; Bird v. Merchants Telephone Co.[7]; Adami v. City of Montreal[8].\nAdjacent proprietors are obliged to suffer the reasonable inconveniences which result from neighbourhood; Laurent, Droit civil fran\u00e7ais, vol. 6 p. 195; Macarel, Ateliers Dangereux, p. 16; Sirey, 1864-257 note: Crawford v. Protestant Hospital for the Insane[9]; Carpentier v. La Ville de Maisonneuve[10]; Robins v. Dominion Coal Co.[11]; Cusson v. Galibert[12]; Bricault v. Masson[13]; Black v. Canadian Copper Co.[14].\nIn determining whether a lawful trade amounts to a nuisance, the court will consider the customs of the people, the characteristics of their business, the common uses of property and the particular circumstances of the place: St Helens Smelting Co. v. Tipping[15]; Hole v. Barlow[16]; Sturges v. Bridgman[17]; Drysdale v. Dugas[18].\nPrivate convenience must yield to public necessity; Revue Etrang\u00e8re et Fran\u00e7aise de Legislation, 1843, pp. 425, 427, 428, 435, 438; Mass\u00e9, Droit Commercial, vol. 2, p. 115, No. 889; High on Injunctions, 4th ed., pp. 707, 752; Claude v. Weir[19].\nThe courts will not interfere as against a trade on the mere ground of personal discomfort and inconvenience of a private individual: Garrett on Nuisances p. 172; St Helens Smelting Co. v. Tipping15; Spelling on Injunctions, ss. 394, 411, 417, 428; High on Injunctions, 4th ed. p. 716.\nThe courts will not destroy an industry when compensation ought to be awarded: Black v. Canadian Copper Co.[20]; Ware v. Regent's Canal Co.[21].\nAim\u00e9 Geoffrion K.C. and G. H. Montgomery K.C. for the respondent:\u2014There is an obligation on the part of every owner to use his property in such a way as not to interfere with the enjoyment of other property by neighbours: Arts. 406, 1053, 1065, 1066 C.C.; Car-pentier v.

Montgomery K.C. for the respondent\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014For the reasons stated by my brother Anglin, I am of the opinion that this appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nIdington J.\u2014The respondent as the owner of property acquired some years before the appellant, in conducting its business as the manufacturers of pulp and paper, had ventured upon methods complained of herein, and had built thereon for himself an expensive home and surrounded it with everything to make that home comfortable and enjoyable.\nSuch a venture was prompted no doubt by the sentimental reasons that the property had been the home of his father and ancestors for a hundred years or more and was suitable for a summer residence.\nNo matter, however, what his reasons were, as a matter of law he was entitled to reside there in comfort when and as he saw fit.\nThe appellant for mere commercial reasons, disregarding the rights of respondent and all others, saw fit to introduce, in the conduct of its business, a process in the use of sulphate which produced malodorous fumes which polluted the air, which the respondent was as owner for himself and his family and guests fully entitled to enjoy in said home and on said property, to such an extent as to render them all exceedingly uncomfortable. The learned trial judge granted a perpetual injunction restraining the appellant from the use of such material in such a way as to produce such results.\nUpon appeal to the Court of King's Bench in Quebec that court maintained said judgment and dismissed the appeal, the learned Chief Justice and Mr. Justice Guerin dissenting.[33]\nI cannot agree with the entire reasoning of those so dissenting.\nI agree with the learned Chief Justice when he seems to recognize that in principle the relevant law of England and Quebec are hardly distinguishable, but with great respect, I cannot follow his reasoning, much less that of his learned colleague, Mr. Justice Guerin, when attempting to give reasons which do not agree yet seem to me each to fall far short of protecting efficiently the rights of such an owner of property as appellant.\nThe discomforts arising from the operation of a business such as a railway duly authorized by law must be endured. The discomforts arising from the mass of impurities that city smoke produces must also, often being long established conditions of such life, be endured.\nThe legislative provisions made in France far in advance of anything we have in Canada dealing directly or indirectly with such a problem as presented herein and the opinion of commentators in light thereof and largely founded upon such light, cannot help us.\nNor, I submit, can the very minor modifications thereof, relegating to the municipal authorities the power to prohibit, be held as at all effective. I cannot see why the power of a municipality to act, but which yet fails to act, can at all interfere with the rights of an owner to enjoy his property in the full sense thereof.\nThe municipality is not given and, I respectfully submit, should not be given power to take away unless upon due compensation the rights of the owner to enjoy his property which carries with it pure air, light and pure water.\nThe argument, that because the exercise by appellant of powers it arrogates to itself but are non-existent in law, may conduce to the prosperity of the little town or village in which the appellants' works are situated, seems to have led to a mass of irrelevant evidence being adduced, and as a result thereof the confusion of thought that produces the remarkable conclusion that because the prosperity of said town or village would be enhanced by the use of the new process therefore the respondent has no rights upon which to rest his rights of property.\nI cannot assent to any such mode of reasoning or that there exists in law any such basis for taking from any man his property and all or any part of what is implied therein.\nYet upon some such possible basis the mass of evidence before us seems to have been presented.\nThe invasion of rights incidental to the ownership of property, or the confiscation thereof, may suit the grasping tendencies of some and incidentally the needs or desires of the majority in any community benefiting thereby; yet such a basis or principle of action should be stoutly resisted by our courts, in answer to any such like demands or assertions of social right unless and until due compensation made by due process of law. Progress may be legislatively made in that direction by many means offering due compensation to the owners, but we must abide by the fundamental law as we find it until changed.\nAnd I cannot find that in France or Quebec any such legal theory as that argument rests upon has any foundation.\nIn looking up authorities upon the question of injunction, such as this, I find in Kerr's Law of Injunctions, 4th edition, at middle of page 155 and following, what I think expresses the right of the owner to an injunction such as in question.\nThe history of that mode of remedy might require a volume, which I have no intention of writing, but to the curious I would commend the perusal of Story on Equity Jurisprudence, section 865 and following sections, as instructive of how in all probability the history of Quebec law, as also English equity jurisprudence, had its origin in regard to the assertion of a remedy by way of injunction.\nIt is a most beneficial remedy and should not be weakened or emaciated merely because of preference of its development in one jurisdiction over that of another.\nI was, indeed, in considering this case and trying to find the relevant law, somewhat struck with a remark of V.C. Sir W. Page Wood, in the beginning of his judgment in the case of Dent v. Auction Mart Co.[34] and other cases, that though the doctrine invoked had been established by Lord Eldon in Attorney General v. Nichol,[35] and never had been departed from, that it was remarkable how few instances had occurred until ten or twelve years before 1866, when he was speaking, and within that short period how the number had increased. The wave, if I may so speak of progress, in way of applying any legal doctrine thus varies very much, but I must be permitted to think that the courts should be tenacious in the way of abiding by such a beneficient remedy as that by way of injunction.\nThe case of The Directors of St. Helen's Smelting Co. v. Tipping, in the House of Lords,[36] is one of the landmarks, as it were in the modern English law on the subject, and the case of Crossley & Sons, Ltd. v. Lightowler,[37] and cases cited therein, and the more recent case of Shelfer v. City of London Electric Lighting Co.[38] may be found instructive as to the later development.\nI have not heard or read in factums presented here anything cited in conflict with the principles therein proceeded upon.\nMany early cases, and even late cases, can be found if one fails to take the principle of law involved as his guide rather than many decisions going off on special grounds which seem to conflict with said leading authorities.\nThe subject is a very wide one and in many phases of its historical development do we find much that may not be worth considering because of the peculiar facts involved.\nAnd, I respectfully submit, that as long as we keep in view the essential merits of the remedy in the way of protecting the rights of property and preventing them from being invaded by mere autocratic assertions of what will be more conducive to the prosperity of the local community by disregarding such rights, we will not go far astray in taking as our guide the reasoning of any jurisprudence which recognizes the identical aim of protecting people in their rights of property when employing their remedy of perpetual injunction.\nI think this appeal should be dismissed with costs. Nevertheless whilst strongly holding that, in cases such as this, the remedy by way of damages being inefficient and hence a basis for a perpetual injunction, yet, inasmuch as there may ere long be discovered by science or mechanical device, or both combined, a means of using sulphates in the process of manufacturing such as in question herein, there should have perhaps been expressed in the formal judgment a reservation entitling the appellant to apply to the court below for relief in such event, if meantime it has observed the injunction.\nLet us hope that such an inducement may lead to resorting to science in a way that is not obvious in the evidence to which we were referred in argument.\nDuff J.\u2014The respondent has established that the enjoyment of his property as a dwelling house is prejudicially affected in a substantial degree and in a degree which entitles him to invoke the protection of the court against the injurious consequences of the manufacturing operations of the appellant company who are clearly chargeable as for a quasi-delit within Art. 1053 of the Civil Code.\nThe substantial question for consideration is whether or not the respondent is entitled to the injunction which has been awarded him. There appear to be good reasons for thinking that the discontinuance of the appellant company's operations would result in material loss and inconvenience to their employees and their families who would probably be obliged to leave the locality in which they live at present in order to find means of livelihood elsewhere. But I am not satisfied that this will be the necessary result of the relief granted to the respondent. Indeed my conclusion, after a perusal of the whole evidence, is that the cessation of the appellant company's operations would be neither the necessary nor the probable result of that relief.\nI am far from accepting the contention put forward on behalf of the respondent that considerations touching the effect of granting the injunction upon the residents of the neighbourhood and indeed upon the interests of the appellant company itself are not considerations properly to be taken into account in deciding the question whether or not the remedy by injunction should be accorded the plaintiff under the law of Quebec. The court in granting that remedy exercises a judicial discretion not, that is to say, an arbitrary choice or a choice based upon the personal views of the judge, but a discretion regulated in accordance with judicial principles as illustrated by the practice of the courts in giving and withholding the remedy. An injunction will not be granted where, having regard to all the circumstances, to grant it would be unjust; and the disparity between the advantage to the plaintiff to be gained by the granting of that remedy and the inconvenience and disadvantage which the defendant and others would suffer in consequence thereof may be a sufficient ground for refusing it. Where the injury to the plaintiff's legal rights is small and is capable of being estimated in money, and can be adequately compensated by a money payment, and where on the other hand the restraining or mandatory order of the court, if made, would bear oppressively upon the defendant and upon innocent persons, then although the plaintiff has suffered and is suffering an injury in his legal rights the court may find and properly find in these circumstances a reason for declining to interfere by exercising its powers in personam. This is not, as was suggested in argument, equivalent to subjecting the plaintiff to a process of expropriation, it is merely applying the limitations and restrictions which the law imposes in relation to the pursuit of this particular form of remedy in order to prevent it becoming an instrument of injustice and oppression.\nThese last mentioned considerations, however, are not those which govern the disposition of the present appeal, the respondent's injury is substantial, is continuing, and there is no satisfactory ground for thinking that any kind of disproportionate injury to the appellant company or to others will ensue from putting into execution the remedy granted by the court below.\nAnglin J.\u2014My impression at the close of the argument was that the findings of the learned trial judge,\u2014 affirmed in appeal,\u2014that the odours and gases emitted from the defendant's sulphate plant were so extremely offensive to the senses that they \"caused sensible discomfort and annoyance'' to the plaintiff and his family, diminished the comfort and value of the plaintiff's property and \"materially interfered with the ordinary comfort of existence in the plaintiff's said home\"; and that\nthe plaintiff cannot be adequately compensated in damages for the deprivation of the useful enjoyment of his property by the nuisance created and maintained by the said defendant\u2014\nwere well warranted. Subsequent consideration of the evidence has only served to convert that impression into a firm conviction. To these findings, moreover, I would add another. The evidence has also satisfied me that sulphate soda pulp can readily be purchased by the defendants, or, if they should prefer to take that course, can be made by them at some other place,\u2014 for instance at or near to their pulpwood limits\u2014 where its production will be innocuous. The manufacture of sulphate pulp at Windsor Mills is not at all essential to the defendants' continuing to produce there the classes and grades of paper for the making of which they now use such pulp prepared by a process in which sulphate of soda, salt or nitrate cake is an important ingredient.\nAs Mr. Justice Flynn points out, it is common ground that science has been unable to indicate any means whereby the emanation and diffusion of these highly objectionable gases and odours in the manufacture of sulphate pulp can be obviated.\nThe proposition that the existence of the state of affairs so found by the trial judge implies an invasion by the defendants of the plaintiff's right of enjoyment of his property, likely to be persistent, far in excess of anything justifiable under les droits de voisinage, and amounting to an actionable wrong entitling him to relief in a court of law and justice scarcely calls for the citation of authority. But, if authority be required, it may be found in abundance in the able judgment delivered by Mr. Justice Flynn and in the factum and memorandum of authorities filed by the respondent.\nThe power to grant an injunction is broad. Arts. 957, 968, C.P.C. I cannot think that, under such circumstances as the evidence here discloses, the court is restricted to giving such inadequate and unsatisfactory relief as the awarding of damages. Baudry-Lacantinerie, Des Biens, Nos. 215-225, notably 224; 2 Aubry et Rau (5 ed.) p. 305. See too Wood v. Conway[39]; Adams v. Ursell[40]. Subject, therefore, to consideration of the several objections to that course taken in the dissenting opinions of the Chief Justice of Quebec and Mr. Justice Guerin, I should be disposed to agree with the learned judges who composed the majority of the Court of King's Bench (Flynn, Tellier and Howard JJ.) that the injunction granted in the Superior Court should be upheld.\nThree difficulties are suggested by the learned Chief Justice: (1) The nuisance created is public and the right to suppress it belongs to the municipal authority under the R.S.Q. Arts. 5639 (14) and 5683 and not to the courts at the instance of a private property owner affected thereby: (2) It is in the interest of the great majority of the inhabitants of Windsor Mills that the operations of the defendant should not be interfered with; balance of convenience therefore requires that the injunction should be dissolved: (3) The injunction sought is not susceptible of enforcement without personal constraint of the defendants' officials.\nMr. Justice Guerin's view is that the injunction is\ntoo radical and too heroic a remedy under the circumstances,\nviz. the impossibility of operating the sulphate process without emitting the odors and gases complained of, and the non-interference of the municipal authorities\u2014 and that damages would be the appropriate legal remedy.\nThe nuisance caused by the defendants no doubt affects the entire neighbouring population and other persons who have occasion to come within the sphere of its annoyance. But the injury to the plaintiff's property is different in kind from the inconvenience suffered by the inhabitants at large\u2014most of whom, moreover, are so dependent upon the operation of the defendants' mills for their support that they are quite prepared to submit to some personal annoyance rather than jeopardize their means of livelihood. The inaction of the municipal authorities is no doubt ascribable to similar influences. By the nuisance of which he complains the plaintiff's property is practically rendered uninhabitable and useless for the purposes for which he holds it. In my opinion he suffers an injury sufficiently distinct in character from that common to the inhabitants at large to warrant his maintaining this action. Adami v. City of Montreal[41]; Barth\u00e9l\u00e9my c. S\u00e9n\u00e8s[42]; Derosne c. Puzin et al[43]; Polsue & Alfieri, Ltd. v Rushmer[44]; Francklyn v. Peoples Heat & Light Co.[45]; Joyce on Nuisances s. 14. The fact that the making of soda-sulphate pulp at Windsor Mills is not essential to the manufacture of the products which the defendant's mills turn out is an answer to the objection based on balance of convenience\u2014if indeed mere balance of convenience would be a sufficient ground under the civil law of Quebec for refusing to enjoin the use of a process which necessarily entails an unjustifiable invasion of the plaintiff's legal right to the enjoyment of his property. Art. 1065 C.C.; Fuz. Herman, Code Annot\u00e9, Art. 544, Nos. 3 & 39; ibid. Arts. 1382-3, Nos. 105, 109, 244 bis; 16 Laurent, No. 199; 24 Demolombe, Nos. 503-5; D\u00e9carie et vir v. Lyall & Sons.[46]. I am of the opinion that the power of the Quebec Courts to punish for contempt (Art. 971 C.P.C.) affords a means of enforcing their orders which sufficiently answers the suggestion that the injunction granted cannot be executed and is therefore obnoxious to Art. 541 C.P.C. In France while the court will enjoin the defendant from doing that which he is under obligation not to do, it has not the means of enforcement of the order available under English law and in Quebec by process of punishment for contempt (Art. 971 C.P.C.; See Art. 1033m. added to old Code of Procedure by 41 V. c. 14 s. 12; Art. 5991, R.S.Q. 1888). In France, the court can award damages in advance for refusal to obey, either in a lump sum or toties quoties, but not as a means of constraint or of indirect compulsion. D. 82, 2, 81; S. 1897. 2. 9, 12; 3 Garsonnet, Proc\u00e9dure, No. 528; 24 Demolombe No. 491; Baudry-Lacantinerie, Des Biens No. 224, n. 3. France has no provision similar to Art. 971 C.C.P. and the Art. 1142 C.N. is more restrictive than the initial clause of Art. 1065 C.C. Whatever they may have been theretofore, since the changes made in 1878, by 41 V. c. 14, the jurisdiction and practice of the Quebec courts in regard to the remedy of injunction would seem to resemble the jurisdiction and practice of English courts rather than of the courts of France. Wills v. Central Ry. Co.[47]. I cannot assent to the third holding in Lombard v. Varennes[48] as indicated in the head note. The arm of injunction would fail in one of its most useful applications if it should, on this ground, be held not to be available in a case such as that at bar. I am, with respect, satisfied that this objection rests on a mistaken conception of Art. 541 C.P.C. Nor is it possible to maintain that damages will afford an adequate remedy to the plaintiff. If he were confined to this method of redress he would, in effect, be forced to submit to partial expropriation of his property, as Mr. Justice Tellier suggests, without statutory authority for such an exercise of eminent domain.\nNo delay was established such as might debar the plaintiff from a right to relief. Francklyn v People's Heat & Light Co.[49]\nIn my opinion the difficulties suggested to granting the plaintiff's prayer for an injunction are more imaginary than real. I should be sorry indeed to think that this branch of the jurisdiction of the courts of Quebec is as restricted as counsel for the defendants contends.\nTo confine the operation of the injunction to the periods of the year during which the plaintiff, his family or friends occupy the residence at Windsor Mills seems to be scarcely practicable. But there is no reason why liberty should not be reserved to the defendants to apply to be relieved from the inhibition if they can satisfy the Court that owing to scientific discovery sulphate pulp can and will be manufactured by them without interference with the plaintiff's right to the enjoyment of his property.\nI would dismiss the appeal.\nBrodeur J.\u2014Cette cause nous am\u00e8ne \u00e0 consid\u00e9rer les limites dans lesquelles se trouve circonscrit l'exercice du droit de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 pour l'int\u00e9r\u00eat r\u00e9ciproque des fonds voisins. L'appelante est une compagnie manufacturi\u00e8re qui fabrique du papier et dont les usines constituent l'industrie la plus importante de la ville de Windsor Mills qui est une ville d'environ deux mille \u00e2mes.\nLe demandeur-intim\u00e9 est propri\u00e9taire d'une superbe maison de campagne dans le voisinage de ces usines. C'est une propri\u00e9t\u00e9 qui depuis plusieurs g\u00e9n\u00e9rations appartient \u00e0 sa famille et qu'il a embellie depuis qu'il s'en est port\u00e9 acqu\u00e9reur en 1905. Il se pourvoit en dommages contre la compagnie appellante parce que l'une des usines de cette derni\u00e8re transmet des odeurs f\u00e9tides dont l'effet est de rendre inhabitable \u00e0 certains temps sa maison et ses d\u00e9pendances, et il demande \u00e0 ce qu'il soit interdit \u00e0 la compagnie de se servir, dans sa fabrication, du sulfate de soda qui cause ces odeurs f\u00e9tides.\nA l'\u00e9poque o\u00f9 le demandeur a achet\u00e9 cet \u00e9tablissement, la compagnie appellante, la Canada Paper Company, exploitait ses fabriques, mais cette exploitation ne causait aucun inconv\u00e9nient; on s'y servait alors de mat\u00e9riaux et de produits chimiques qui n'avaient pas le d\u00e9savantage d'incommoder les voisins. Dans ces derni\u00e8res ann\u00e9es, pour des raisons qui ne sont pas bien clairement d\u00e9termin\u00e9es, la Canada Paper Company a jug\u00e9 \u00e0 propos de faire usage de sulfate de soda et d'autres produits chimiques qui, sous certaines conditions climat\u00e9riques, incommodaient gravement les voisins et notamment le demandeur Brown par leurs \u00e9vaporations d\u00e9sagr\u00e9ables et insalubres.\nMonsieur Brown en a alors caus\u00e9 avec les autorit\u00e9s de la compagnie, a eu la promesse qu'on rem\u00e9dierait \u00e0 ce qu'il consid\u00e9rait \u00eatre un exercice abusif de propri\u00e9t\u00e9; mais malgr\u00e9 ces entrevues et ces promesses rien de tangible n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 accompli de sorte qu'il s'est vu dans l'obligation de recourir aux tribunaux. Il a eu gain de cause en Cour Sup\u00e9rieure et en Cour de Banc du Roi. Les tribunaux inf\u00e9rieurs cependant ne lui ont pas accord\u00e9 de dommages, mais ils ont formellement ordonn\u00e9 \u00e0 la compagnie de cesser de faire usage des produits chimiques qui causaient ces odeurs.\nQuelles sont les cons\u00e9quences de cet abus au point de vu l\u00e9gal?\nIl ne peut pas y avoir de doute, vu les faits prouv\u00e9s dans la cause, que ces odeurs \u00e9taient absolument insupportables et qu'elles constituaient de la part de la compagnie un exercice abusif de sa propri\u00e9t\u00e9 au d\u00e9triment de ses voisins et notamment du demandeur. Tous les juges sont unanimes sur ce point.\nFournel, dans son Trait\u00e9 du voisinage, 4\u00e8me \u00e9dition, p. 336, dit:\u2014\nUne des premi\u00e8res lois du voisinage est de ne laisser au dehors aucune odeur qui soit de nature \u00e0 infecter Fair et \u00e0 compromettre la sant\u00e9 de ceux qui le respirent.\nIl nous cite un \u00e9dit de Fran\u00e7ois 1er en date du mois de novembre 1539 qui faisait les d\u00e9fenses les plus rigoureuses contre les causes d'infection. Cet \u00e9dit est devenu en force dans la province de Qu\u00e9bec lorsque les lois g\u00e9n\u00e9rales du royaume de France y ont \u00e9t\u00e9 introduites en 1663.\nFournel nous cite \u00e9galement (loc. cit. p. 337) le cas du nomm\u00e9 Collin Gosselin qui au 15\u00e8me si\u00e8cle veut \u00e9tablir un atelier de potier de terre. Les voisins ne tard\u00e8rent pas \u00e0 ressentir l'inconv\u00e9nient d'un pareil voisinage par l'infection qui r\u00e9sultait et obtinrent du Ch\u00e2telet la cessation des op\u00e9rations.\nEn 1661, une ordonnance a \u00e9t\u00e9 rendue au m\u00eame effet contre certains habitants de la Villette qui se servaient de certains abattis de boucheries pour fumer leurs terres. Les lois modernes fran\u00e7aises ont donn\u00e9 \u00e0 l'administration certains pouvoirs qui naturellement n'ont pas force de loi ici. Je crains cependant que cette l\u00e9gislation moderne ait donn\u00e9 lieu \u00e0 une certaine confusion dans la consid\u00e9ration de cette cause.\nLa loi g\u00e9n\u00e9rale des villes donne bien aux conseils municipaux le pouvoir de l\u00e9gif\u00e9rer contre les nuisances cr\u00e9\u00e9es par l'industrie et de r\u00e9glementer l'endroit, la construction et l'usage des \u00e9tablissements insalubres: (art. 5639-5683 S.R.P.Q.)\nDans notre cas, la ville de Windsor Mills n'a pas jug\u00e9 \u00e0 propos de faire aucun r\u00e8glement au sujet des usines en question. Mais cette absence de r\u00e9glementation ne saurait \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme une approbation d'une nuisance.\nLa l\u00e9gislature pouvait donner aux corporations municipales le pouvoir de faire des r\u00e8glements qui seraient contraires \u00e0 la loi g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de la province (Tiedman, par. 146). Mais aussi longtemps que cette corporation municipale n'exerce pas ce pouvoir, la loi g\u00e9n\u00e9rale s'applique \u00e0 tous les habitants de cette municipalit\u00e9. En France, au contraire, il faut un permis de l'autorit\u00e9 administrative pour \u00e9tablir certaines industries dans un endroit quelconque. Et si le permis est accord\u00e9, alors tous les voisins sont tenus de respecter la d\u00e9cision de l'autorit\u00e9 administrative. C'est cette diff\u00e9rence dans la l\u00e9gislation des deux pays qui a donn\u00e9 lieu \u00e0 la confusion dont j'ai parl\u00e9. Ici, du moment qu'il n'y a pas de r\u00e9glementation municipale, toute industrie peut s'\u00e9tablir dans un endroit quelconque, mais pourvu cependant que les lois g\u00e9n\u00e9rales du voisinage soient rigoureusement suivies et pourvu que cette manufacture ne transmette pas aux maisons voisines des odeurs f\u00e9tides. (Aubry & Rau, 5\u00e8me \u00e9d. p. 304) Il n'y a pas lieu de faire la distinction dans le cas actuel entre les nuisances d'une nature priv\u00e9e et celles d'une nature publique. On refuse \u00e0 un particulier le droit de poursuivre dans un cas o\u00f9 il tente d'exercer des droits appartenant au public concernant une propri\u00e9t\u00e9 publique. Mais dans le cas o\u00f9 une nuisance affecte non seulement les droits priv\u00e9s d'une seule personne mais d'un grand nombre de citoyens, tous ces citoyens ont le droit de se pourvoir devant les tribunaux pour faire dispara\u00eetre cette nuisance. Ce n'est pas le fait qu'un grand nombre de personnes souffrent qui exclut le droit de l'une d'entre elles de se pourvoir en justice. (Joyce, Law of Nuisances, sec. 14).\nL'honorable juge-en-chef de la Cour du Banc du Roi est d'opinion que le jugement qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 rendu prohibant l'usage de sulfate n'est pas susceptible d'ex\u00e9cution. Comme nous l'avons vu par les citations prises dans Fournel, l'ancien droit francais reconnaissait le droit aux tribunaux de faire mettre fin \u00e0 des op\u00e9rations qui \u00e9taient insalubres. Du moment que cette ordonnance peut \u00eatre faite par un tribunal, alors si elle est viol\u00e9e elle donne lieu aux p\u00e9nalit\u00e9s impos\u00e9es par l'article 971 du code de proc\u00e9dure.\nD'ailleurs les tribunaux dans les actions n\u00e9gatoires et possessoires \u00e9mettent tous les jours des ordonnances ordonnant aux d\u00e9fendeurs de ne plus exercer telle servitude, de cesser de troubler un propri\u00e9taire dans la possession paisible de son h\u00e9ritage.\nPour ces raisons je consid\u00e8re que l'appel doit \u00eatre renvoy\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: White & Buchanan.\nSolicitor for the respondent: W.

Paragraph 3 of article 1 of the treaty states that the subjects of the high contracting parties \"shall in all that relates to the pursuit of their \"industries, callings, professions, and educational studies be placed \"in all respects on the same footing as the subjects of citizens \"of the most favoured nation.\"\nPer Davies C.

REFERENCE by the Governor-General in Council of questions respecting the validity of chapter 49 of the Statutes of British Columbia, 1921, for hearing and consideration pursuant to section 60 of the \"Supreme Court Act\". The questions so submitted are as follows:\u2014\nA report of the committee of the privy council appointed by his excellency the governor-general-in-council, on the 12th november, 1921.\nThe Committee of the Privy Council have had before them a report dated 12th October, 1921, from the Minister of Justice, submitting that the Consul General of Japan, by letter of 4th of May, 1921, addressed to the Minister of Justice, suggested that Your Excellency should exercise the power of disallowance with regard to a statute of British Columbia, assented to April 2nd, 1921, entitled \"An Act to \"Validate and confirm certain Orders-in-Council and \"provisions relating to the employment of persons \"on Crown Property\", being Chapter 49 of the volume of statutes for the current year; the Consul General alleging that the Act is ultra vires.\nIt is enacted by section 2 of this statute that two Orders of the Lieutenant Governor of British Columbia in Council, dated 28th of May, 1902, and 18th, June, 1902, respectively, copies of which are scheduled to the Act, are validated and confirmed, and that they shall for all purposes be deemed to have been valid and effectual from the respective dates of their approval. These Orders in Council were designed to give effect to a resolution of the Legislative Assembly of British Columbia passed on 15th of April, 1902, whereby it was resolved \"that in all contracts, leases and concessions of whatsoever kind entered\" \"into, issued, or made by the government, or on be-\"half of the government, provision be made that no \"Chinese or Japanese shall be employed in connection \"therewith\".\nMoreover, it is enacted by section 3 of the statute in question as follows:\u2014\n\"3. (1) Where in any instrument referred to in the said Orders in Council, or in any instrument of a similar nature to any of those so referred to, issued by any minister or officer of any department of the government of the province, any provision has heretofore been inserted or is hereafter inserted relating to or restricting the employment of Chinese or Japanese, that provision shall be deemed to have been and to be valid and always to have had and to have the force of law according to its tenor.\n(2) Every violation of or failure to observe any such provision on the part of any licensee or other person to whom the instrument is issued or delivered or with whom it is entered into, or who is entitled to any rights under it, whether the violation of failure has heretofore occurred or hereafter occurs, shall be sufficient ground for the cancellation of that instrument, and the Lieutenant Governor in Council may cancel that instrument accordingly\".\nUpon reference to the Attorney General of British Columbia he reports that his government maintains the constitutionality of the Act, and expresses his intention of taking proceedings which would bring the question before the courts.\nAs the validity of this statute depends upon the interpretation of the legislative powers of the province under the \"British North America Act\", and as the time for the disallowance will expire on the 18th of April 1922, one year after the date on which the authenticated copy of the Act was received by the Secretary of State, the Minister states that he considers it desirable that Your Excellency's Government should be advised as to the enacting authority of the province by the Supreme Court of Canada.\nThe Minister accordingly recommends that pursuant to the authority of Section 60 of the \"Supreme Court Act\" the following questions be referred to the Supreme Court of Canada for hearing and consideration, viz:\n1. Had the legislature of British Columbia authority to enact Chapter 49 of its statutes of 1921, entitled \"An Act to validate and confirm certain Orders-in \"Council and provisions relating to the employment \"of persons on crown property\"?\n2. If the said Act be in the opinion of the court ultra vires in part then in what particulars is it ultra vires ?\nThe Committee concur in the foregoing recommendation and submit the same for Your Excellency's approval.\n(Signed) Rodolphe Boudreau.\nClerk of the Privy Council.\nE. L. Newcombe K.C. for the Attorney-General for Canada.\nSir C. H. Tupper, K.C. for the Japanese Association\nCharles Wilson, K.C. for the Shingle Manufacturers' Association of B.C. J. W. de B.Farris K.C., Attorney-General for British Columbia with J. A. Ritchie K.C\nE. L. Newcombe K.C. for the Attorney-General for Canada:\u2014The legislation is wholly ineffective: 1\u00b0 because, by sect. 91 of the B.N.A. Act, it is within the exclusive legislative authority of the Dominion to make laws for the peace, order and good government of Canada with relation to any matter coming within the class of subjects described as \"naturalization and aliens\"; Union Colliery Co. of B.C. v. Bryden[1]; Cunningham v. Tomey Homma[2]; 2\u00b0 because the legislation conflicts with the \"Japanese Treaty Act, 1913\", as the province attempts to discriminate and to place Japanese on a footing less favourable than the subjects or citizens of more favoured nations. There is only one Crown and the Crown cannot by its provincial legislation either directly or indirectly break the treaty engagement.\nSir C. H. Tupper, K.C. for the Japanese Association. The Crown is bound by a treaty to which it is a party; Theodore v. Duncan[3].\nThe provincial legislation has for its purpose the object of depriving the Chinese and Japanese of any opportunity of earning their living in the industrial development of the province.\nCharles Wilson, K.C. for the Shingle Manufacturers' Association of B.C.\nJ. W. de B. Farris K.C., Attorney-General for British Columbia with J. A. Ritchie K.C\u2014The Crown, while unquestionably one, whether in its executive or legislative capacity, has various aspects; but, within the legislative domain allotted to the provinces by the b.n.a. Act, the right of each province to make laws for its purpose is as full and absolute as the right of either the Imperial or Dominion Parliament to make laws for Imperial or Dominion purposes.\nThe interest of a province in its Crown lands and other property is as extensive as the interest of a private person in lands held by him in fee to his own use or in his own personal property; St. Catherine's Milling and Lumber Co. v. The Queen[4]; Smylie v. The Queen[5].\nThe province has the power to legislate as might be deemed best in its interest in regard to the management of its Crown lands of which the province, upon its entry into the Union in 1871, became seized of the \"entire beneficial interest\".\nAn Imperial treaty (except possibly a treaty of peace) or an Act of the Dominion Parliament cannot override an existing law of a self-governing province.\nA treaty made in time of peace does not of itself without statutory authority extend so far as to alter the law either as regards individual rights in property, rights of action or as to personal liberty: The Parlement Belge[6]; Clements, Canadian Constitution, 3rd ed. 136; and if so, such treaty cannot do so in regard to the public rights of a self-governing province.\nThe cases of Union Colliery Co. of B.C. v. Bryden[7], Tomey Homma Case[8] and Quong-Wing v. The King[9] are not applicable; as this provincial legislation does not prohibit any Chinese or Japanese from being employed upon the Crown property, but it establishes only for the province a policy in regard to the management of a provincial property: this legislation being, in effect, a self-denying ordinance, limiting the own freedom of the province in the uses of its own property. The Chief Justice.\u2014In the matter submitted by His Excellency The Governor General in Council for our hearing and consideration respecting the validity of chapter 49 of the statutes of British Columbia, 1921, two questions were asked:\n1. Had the legislature of British Columbia authority to enact chapter 49 of its statutes of 1921, entitled \"An Act to validate and confirm certain orders in council and provisions relating to the employment of persons on crown property?\n2. If the said Act be in the opinion of the court ultra vires in part only, then in what particulars is it ultra vires?\nThe orders in council which are scheduled to the Act in question and are attempted to be validated thereby provide that \"in all contracts, leases and concessions of whatsoever kind entered into, issued or made by the Government, or on behalf of the Government, provision be made that no Chinese or Japanese shall be employed in connection therewith.\" These general words \"contracts, leases and concessions\" are expressly defined in the statute referred to us to include the various instruments specified in the long enumeration contained in the order in council dated 28th June, 1902. Moreover, by the earlier order in council dated 28th May, 1902, set out in the schedule to the Act, \"all tunnel and drain licenses issued by virtue of the powers conferred by section 58 of the 'Mineral Act' and section 48 of the 'Placer Mining Act'\", and \"all leases granted under the provisions of part 7 of the 'Placer Mining Act'\" are to be read subject to the clause or prohibition in question. I am of the opinion that the description \"leases, licenses, contracts and concessions\", embodied in the orders in council attempted to be validated by the said Act is comprehensive enough to comprise substantially all instruments which may be issued by the provincial government in the administration of its assumed powers, except grants of land in fee, and that the object and intention of these orders in council clearly is to deprive the Chinese and Japanese of the opportunities which would otherwise be open to them of employment upon government works carried out by the holders of provincial leases, licenses, contracts or concessions.\nBy section 2 of the statute it is enacted that \"the said orders in council shall, for all purposes, be deemed to be and to have been valid and efficient according to their tenor from the respective dates of their approval.\"\nSection 3 sub-sec. (1) goes further and enacts: \"Where in any instrument referred to in the said orders in council, or in any instrument of a similar nature to any of those referred to, issued by any minister or officer of any department of the government of the province, any provision has heretofore been inserted or is hereafter inserted relating to or restricting the employment of Chinese or Japanese, that provision shall be deemed to have been and to be valid and always to have had and to have the force of law according to its tenor.\"\nIn this manner the legislature attempts to legalize any prohibition or restriction of any employment of Chinese or Japanese upon works of or under the government or its lessees, licensees, or contractees which in the discretion of any minister or departmental officer might be embodied in the instrument. In my opinion this legislation is ultra vires the provincial legislature: (1) because, by section 91 of the \"British North America Act\", 1867, it is within the exclusive legislative authority of the Dominion, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in that Act, to make laws \"for the peace, order and good government of Canada\" with relation to any matters coming within the classes of subjects described in s.s. 25 of s. 91 as \"naturalization and aliens.\"\nThis provision of the \"British North America Act, 1867\", was construed by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council with relation to British Columbia legislation affecting Chinese and Japanese in two appeals to that Board: Union Colliery Co. v Bryden[10] and Cunningham v. Tomey Homma[11].\nI confess it seems somewhat difficult to reconcile on all points the observations made by their Lordships who respectively delivered the judgments of the Judicial Committee in these cases. The interpretation of the Bryden decision given by the Lord Chancellor when delivering judgment of the Board in the Tomey Homma case must be accepted by all courts in Canada. He said page 157. \"That case (the Bryden Case10) depended upon totally different grounds. This Board, dealing with the particular facts of that case, came to the conclusion that the regulations there impeached were not really aimed at the regulation of coal mines at all, but were in truth devised to deprive the Chinese, naturalized or not, of the ordinary rights of the inhabitants of British Columbia, and in effect, to prohibit their continued residence in that province, since it prohibited their earning their living in that province.\" His Lordship then observes \"it is obvious that such a decision can have no relation to the question whether any naturalized person has an inherent right to the suffrage within the province in which he resides\" (which was the question then before the Board).\nI am of the opinion that the legislation now in question is of the character described by Lord Watson in the Bryden case, as not being within the competency of the Province. His Lordship says, page 587. ''Their Lordships see no reason to doubt that by virtue of section 91 s.s. 25, the legislature of the Dominion is invested with exclusive authority in all matters which directly concern the rights, privileges, and disabilities of the class of Chinamen who are resident in the provinces of Canada. They are also of opinion that the whole pith and substance of the enactments of s. 4 of the \"Coal Mines Regulation Act\", in so far as objected to by the appellant company, consists in establishing a statutory prohibition which affects aliens of naturalized subjects, and therefore trenches upon the exclusive authority of the Parliament of Canada.\"\n(2) I am also of the opinion that the legislation in question conflicts with the Japanese Treaty Act, 1913, of the Dominion of Canada (3 & 4 Geo. V, c. 27). By this Act it is declared that the Japanese Treaty of 3rd April, 1911, set forth in the schedule to the Act \"is hereby sanctioned and declared to have the force of law in Canada\", with the exception of two provisions neither of which is pertinent in any way to the question now before us.\nParagraph 3 of Article 1 of the scheduled treaty states that the subjects of the high contracting parties \"shall in all that relates to the pursuit of their industries, callings, professions, and educational studies be placed in all respects on the same footing as the subjects or citizens of the most favoured nation.\"\nThe Parliament of Canada derived the authority for the enactment of the Japanese Treaty from s. 132 of the \"British North America Act, 1867\", which provides that \"the Parliament and Government of Canada shall have all powers necessary or proper for performing the obligations of Canada or any province thereof, as part of the British Empire towards foreign countries, arising under treaties between the Empire and such foreign countries.\"\nThere is no general provincial prohibition or disqualification affecting the citizens of foreign nations other than those of Japan and China in British Columbia, and while the statute now in question is not expressed generally to prohibit or disqualify Japanese and Chinese from all employment, it does provide that \"in all contracts, leases, licences and concessions entered into, issued or made\" by or on behalf of the Crown as represented by the Government of British Columbia, \"no Japanese or Chinese shall be employed in connection therewith\".\nThus the province attempts to discriminate and to put the Japanese on a footing less favourable than that of the subjects of the most favoured nation.\nThis is contrary to the obligations of the treaty and in direct conflict with the Dominion statute which must prevail under the powers conferred by s. 132 of the b.n.a. Act above quoted.\nI cannot doubt that the Japanese if employed upon the works which are by the statute in question prohibited to them would be so employed \"in the pursuit of their industries, callings, professions\". Certainly the words \"industries, callings\", would cover all manual labour, or other labour of a kindred character. Modern dictionaries define industry to include systematized labour or habitual employment, especially human exertion employed for the creation of value, labour.\nThere is only one Crown, although it may act \"by and with the advice and consent of\" the several parliaments or legislatures of the whole of the British Empire. The Crown which \"by and with the consent and advice of the Lords and Commons of the United Kingdom\" enacted the ''British North America Act, 1867\", conferring upon itself acting \"by and with the advice and consent of the Senate and the House of Commons of Canada\" the power to sanction treaty obligations affecting the Dominion of Canada or a province thereof, is the same Crown which became in 1911, a party to the Japanese Treaty, the provisions of which declared that, \"they (the Japanese) shall in all that relates to the pursuit of their industries, callings, professions, educational studies be placed in all respects on the same footing as the subjects or citizens of the most favoured nation.\" It is the same Crown which in 1913, \"by and with the advice and consent of the Senate and the House of Commons of the Dominion of Canada\" in execution of the powers conferred by s. 132 of the b.n.a. Act, 1867, sanctioned the Japanese Treaty and enacted that it should have \"the force of law in Canada\"; and it is the same Crown which in 1921, \"by and with the advice and consent of the legislature of British Columbia\" enacted the statute in question here. If this Act is intra vires it is in absolute conflict with the Treaty and the Dominion statute because it prohibits the employment of Japanese in the pursuit of their ''industries and callings\" in British Columbia on all provincial government works, or on works on land held by leases, licences or concessions authorized by the legislature of British Columbia. Thus the Japanese are placed on a footing less favourable than that of the subjects or citizens of more favoured nations.\nThe Crown was undoubtedly bound by the force of the \"Japanese Treaty Act\" of 1913 to perform within Canada its treaty obligations, and, if so, I cannot understand how it can successfully be contended that the Crown can by force of enactments of a provincial legislature directly or indirectly break its treaty obligations.\nFor these reasons I am of the opinion that the legislature of British Columbia had not the authority necessary to enact chapter 49 of the 1921 statutes of British Columbia.\nAs my answer to the first question is in the negative, any answer to the second question submitted is unnecessary.\nIdington J.\u2014Under section 60 of the \"Supreme Court Act\" we are asked the following questions:\u2014\n1. Had the legislature of British Columbia authority to enact chapter 49 of its statutes of 1921, entitled \"An Act to validate and confirm certain orders in council and provisions relating to the employment of persons on crown property?\n2. If the said Act be in the opinion of the court ultra vires in part only then in what particulars is it ultra vires? The second section of the said Act declares certain orders in council set forth in a schedule to the Act to have been and to be valid and effectual.\nThen section 3 of said Act in question herein reads as follows:\u2014\n\"(1) Where in any instrument referred to in the said orders in council, or any instrument of a similar nature to any of those so referred to, issued by any minister or officer of any department of the government of the province, and provision has heretofore been inserted or is hereafter inserted relating to or restricting the employment of Chinese or Japanese that provision shall be deemed to have been and to be valid and always to have had and to have the force of law according to its tenor.\n(2) Every violation of or failure to observe any such provision on the part of any licensee or other person to whom the instrument is issued or delivered or with whom it is entered into, or who is entitled to any rights under it, whether the violation or failure has heretofore occurred or hereafter occurs, shall be sufficient ground for the cancellation of that instrument, and the Lieutenant Governor in Council may cancel that instrument accordingly.\"\nThe schedule seems to me (save as to one item) to deal entirely with the crown lands, timber, coal and other minerals and mines and water the property of the Crown on behalf of the province of British Columbia.\nThat province was brought into the Canadian confederation by virtue of the 146th section of the B.N.A. Act, 1867, and pursuant to the several addresses therein provided for and by the order in council of the late Queen resting thereon also so provided for. The agreement evidenced thereby appears on pages LXXXV to CVII prefixed to the statutes of Canada for 1872.\nThe terms thereof render operative and effective as to the legislature of British Columbia the like powers enjoyed by the legislatures of the other provinces of Canada under section 92 of the said B.N.A. Act of 1867, and each of them contained in items 5, 10, 13, and 16, are of vital importance herein as are also other provisions of said Act such as section 109, which reads as follows:\u2014\n\"109. All lands, mines, minerals, and royalties belonging to the several provinces of Canada, Nova Scotia, and New Brunswick at the Union, and all sums then due or payable for such lands, mines, minerals, or royalties, shall belong to the several provinces of Ontario, Quebec, Nova Scotia, and New Brunswick in which the same are situate or arise, subject to any trusts existing in respect thereof, and to any interest other than that of the province in the same.\"\nSection 10 of the respective addresses which formed the basis of Union and of the order in council bringing the Union into effect, reads as follows:\u2014\n\"10. The provisions of the \"British North America Act, 1867\", shall (except those parts thereof which are in terms made, or by reasonable intendment may be held to be, specially applicable to and only affect one and not the whole of the provinces now comprising the Dominion, and except so far as the same may be varied by this minute) be applicable to British Columbia in the same way and to the like extent as they apply to the other provinces of the Dominion, and as if the colony of British Columbia had been one of the provinces originally united by the said Act.\" That renders operative section 109 of the B.N.A. Act, 1867, and I submit, rendered all therein specified subject to the jurisdiction of the responsible government of British Columbia which thereby had power to enact such orders in council relative to the administration of all the said properties as the legislature of said province should see fit to support and so long as it so saw fit to support same.\nThe Act now in question of the legislature of British Columbia seems therefore well within the powers so assigned to it.\nThere being numerous acts of the legislature of British Columbia, such as \"The Land Act\"; \"The Forest Act\"; \"The Mines Act\"; and amendments thereto, each and all seeming to be expressly enacted relative to the administration of such crown properties by ministers respectively specified therein, it would not seem to require anything further than the orders in council made in course of such administration to give validity to any licences or contracts relative to the regulations of such properties of the crown.\nMr. Ritchie's argument on behalf of the Attorney General of British Columbia in taking this point seemed to me to suggest quite properly that the Acts now called in question are of minor consequence and that even the veto power if exercised would fall short of reaching the alleged evil complained of herein.\nThe mode of the administration of any of the properties in question seems as much subject to the will of the legislature as that of any private owner to the will of the owner thereof.\nThe conditions of the licences for operating upon same binding the licensees not to employ in doing so Chinese, Japanese or other orientals may be offensive to some minds and may economically speaking be very questionable, but how can it be contended that any private owner might not so stipulate in such a licence or other contract in relation to his own property?\nCounsel for the Minister of Justice and for the company which challenged the right of the government of British Columbia to so stipulate, respectively admitted on argument that the private owner could so stipulate in relation to his own property despite the treaty hereinafter referred to but counsel for the Japanese Association relied upon an American decision laying down the doctrine that it would be against public policy to so contract.\nThe obvious answer is that the legislature in control of the subject matter is the power to create or dictate any such provincial public policy and that must be predominant unless and until the Dominion Parliament acting intra vires declares otherwise.\nThe decision in the case of Union Colliery v. Bryden[12] was presented in argument but not as decisive of the questions raised herein.\nI may point out that it was a general regulation as applicable to a private mine which was in question therein and that the judgment seems to be rested upon item 25 of the 91st section of the B.N.A. Act of 1867\u2014\"Naturalization and Aliens\"\u2014and was followed by the decision in the case of Cunningham v. Tomey Homma[13] where the Lord Chancellor, in giving the judgment of the court above does not, at foot of page 56 and following page, seem to maintain the doctrine in the judgment in the former case to the full extent declared therein and as understood by the courts in British Columbia attempting to abide by it. Hence the judgments of these courts were reversed. I submit that the powers I have referred to above as given the legislature of British Columbia in relation to its control of the properties in question herein are quite as explicit as anything given it in relation to the franchise.\nThe disposition of the question raised in the Colliery Case,[14] however, does not end there, for in the case Quong-Wing v. The King[15] the question of discrimination against a Chinaman, in this instance a naturalized British subject, within the ambit of our Canadian \"Naturalization Act\", was again raised.\nThe majority of this court held that, despite what was held in the Colliery Case14 the legislature of Saskatchewan had the power to discriminate against him, in the same spirit as evident in relation to what is in question herein, and in the way that appears in that case.\nAn application on his behalf to the court above, for leave to appeal from such decision here, was refused.\nAnd that although, as our \"Naturalization Act\" then stood by section 24 thereof, it provided as follows:\u2014\n\"24. An alien to whom a certificate of naturalization is granted shall, within Canada, be entitled to all political and other rights, powers and privileges, and be subject to all obligations to which a natural born British subject is entitled or subject within Canada, with this qualification, that he shall not when within the limits of the foreign state of which he was a subject previously to obtaining his certificate of naturalization, be deemed to be a British subject unless he has ceased to be a subject of that state in pursuance of the laws thereof, or in pursuance of a treaty or convention to that effect.\" The question most urgently pressed in the present case by way of challenging the validity of the Act now in question herein, was the Act of our Dominion Parliament, assented to on the 10th April, 1913, and known as the \"Japanese Treaty Act, 1913\", declaring the treaty to have the force of law in Canada.\nSection 3 of Art. 1 of the said treaty seems to contain all that can be even plausibly relied upon in such a connection. It reads as follows:\u2014\n\"3. They shall in all that relates to the pursuit of their industries, callings, professions and educational studies be placed in all respects on the same footing as the subjects or citizens of the most favoured nation.\"\nCompare the forceful effect of the language used in the \"Naturalization Act\" above quoted and that just quoted from the treaty.\nThe former was turned down in this court and, in the court above, held not worthy of a hearing as against a provincial legislative enactment of the same tenor and purpose as that challenged herein.\nI do not pretend that the aggregate consequences flowing from the Saskatchewan Act would be at all equal to those flowing from the policy of the legislature of British Columbia in doing as it pleased with its own, and complained of herein.\nBut I do pretend that the principle involved in the Saskatchewan Act, relative to a naturalized Chinaman, assured by our \"Naturalization Act\" of his right as such, in the terms above quoted, is of more serious import than anything contained in said section 3 of article 1 of the treaty above mentioned.\nWhen we are asked to strain and positively wreck our constitution as outlined in the B.N.A. Act assuring provinces of such powers as challenged herein, I have no doubt what my answer should be to the questions submitted. I, before doing so, should observe that at one time in the course of the argument and consideration of the matters involved in item \"n\" of the schedule to the Act, which reads as follows:\u2014\"(n) Public works' contracts the terms of which are not prescribed by statute;\" I was inclined to doubt if that article was maintainable.\nOn mature consideration I am, however, unable to discriminate between the rights of a property owner with which I have been dealing and the rights of a government executing a non-statutory contract such as covered by the last quotation.\nHaving considered all the supplemental factums presented in support of the argument at the hearing, I am tempted, with great respect, to suggest that the argument based upon the prerogative of the Crown, and obligations of the Crown, as if one and indivisible throughout the Empire, seems to overlook the many and varying limitations thereof brought in with the recognition of responsible government in Canada, over three-quarters of a century ago.\nEven some forms of treaty must be read as being subject thereto.\nI would, therefore, answer the first question in the affirmative which renders it unnecessary to answer the second.\nI cannot, however, forbear asking what possible difference it can make so long as in these days of public ownership the government of British Columbia could, I submit, act directly and select its own workmen to clear its forests and exclude the Chinese and Japanese so long as public opinion would support them in doing so. Duff J.\u2014The attack upon the provincial statute rests upon two principal grounds, 1st, that it is repugnant to the Dominion Act of 1913 declaring the accession of Canada to the Japanese Treaty and giving to the provisions of that treaty the force of law throughout the Dominion and 2nd, that the provincial legislation considered in itself, abstraction made from the operation of the Dominion Statute of 1913, is without legal force for the reason that it is an enactment \"in pith and substance'' relating to the subject of aliens and naturalized subjects, and on the principle of Bryden's Case[16] is ultra vires.\nTo consider, first, the second of these grounds of attack. The provincial statute professes to attach to the leases, licences, contracts and concessions which are the subject of the scheduled orders in council a condition which contains a stipulation that no Chinese or Japanese shall be employed by any of these classes of licensees, lessees and concessionaires in the exercise of the rights granted and in the case of contracts by any contractor in connection with the public work to which his contract relates; and the condition also contains a provision authorizing the cancellation of the rights of any grantee or contractor who disregards the stipulation. The instruments to which this condition applies are of two classes, 1st, contracts under which the contractor's remuneration would, in the ordinary course, be a payment of money out of the public funds of the province, and 2nd, grants of rights in and in relation to the public property of the province but grants of limited and particular rights only of which a mining lease so called may be taken as typical. A single word of explanation may be convenient at the outset in relation to the water power certificates under the \"Water Clauses Consolidation Act\". These water power certificates were certificates granted to incorporated companies by the Lieutenant Governor in Council on certain specified terms and subject to such further terms as he in his discretion might see fit to exact, conferring a right upon the company receiving the certificate to apply for power purposes water power made available by authority of water records granted under the same Act and giving to the company in addition extensive compulsory powers for the construction, maintenance and operation of its works The precise point to be noted is that in the year 1892 the legislature of British Columbia, following legislation of a similar but much more elaborate character passed in the year 1890 by the Dominion Parliament relating to what was then known as the North West Territories, now the provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan, declared that all unappropriated waters, that is to say, all water in the province not appropriated under statutory authority should be the property of the Crown in the right of the province; so that water power certificates authorizing the diversion and the application of unappropriated water for the purposes of the companies possessing such certificates are in effect conditional grants of special rights over and in relation to a subject which by the statute law of British Columbia is the property of the Crown.\nThe conclusion to which I have come is that the decision of the Lords of the Judicial Committee in Bryden's Case[17] does not in principle extend to provincial legislation attaching to contracts of the kind and to grants of public property of the character to which the statute relates a condition in the terms of that now under consideration.\nIt is most material, I think, first of all to notice the nature and extent of the control exercisable by the legislature of a province over its public assets. The B. N. A. Act provided for the distribution not only of power, legislative and other, between the Dominion and the provinces but for the distribution of responsibilities and assets as well. The responsibilities assumed by the provinces were onerous and extensive; administration of justice, including police, public health, charitable institutions, colonization, including highways, municipal institutions, local works, including intra provincial transport and above all, education. The responsibility in respect of agriculture and immigration was assumed jointly. In the sequel immigration has gradually become almost exclusively a Dominion matter while agriculture has been left very largely to the care of the provinces. The scheme of confederation necessarily involved a division of assets and an allotment of powers of taxation. The division of assets is the subject matter which concerns the sections of the Act numbered, 102 to 126 inclusive. By these sections the whole mass of the duties and revenues over which the provinces possessed the power of appropriation at the time of confederation is divided between the Dominion and the provinces. The sections in which their respective rights are defined being sections 102, 108, 109, 117 and 126.\nTwo characteristics of these provisions have often been judicially noted, 1st, they do not displace the title of the Crown in the public property. What is dealt with is the power of appropriation possessed by the provincial legislature at the time of Confederation (sec. 102); and 2nd, this power of appropriation is treated (secs. 108, 109, 117, 92 (5)) as equivalent to property. The interest of the Dominion as well as that of the provinces in the public property both in that assigned by the sections mentioned and that afterwards acquired as the result of taxation or from other sources of revenue is, as Lord Watson said in Maritime Bank v. Receiver General,[18] this right of appropriation; and as was said again by Lord Watson in the St. Catherines Milling Case,[19] this right of appropriation is equivalent to the entire beneficial interest of the Crown in such property. Ultimately in each case this power of appropriation rests with the Dominion or the provincial legislature as the case may be and that not by virtue alone of any special enactments of secs. 91 and 92 relating to property but in the case of the provinces by force of the provision giving the provinces control over the provincial constitution; and the legal effect of these provisions as Lord Watson said in the St. Catherines Milling Case19 is to exclude from Dominion control any power of appropriation over the subjects assigned to the provinces which are placed under the control of the provincial legislatures. As regards the provinces this control by the legislatures over the proceeds of taxation and over the property assigned to them by the enactments of the B.N.A. Act is essential to the system set up by the B.N.A. Act. Provincial autonomy would be reduced to a simulacrum if the proceeds of provincial taxation were subject to the control of some extra-provincial authority and such proceeds are placed by the provisions referred to on precisely the same footing in respect of the legislative power of appropriation as the existing assets distributed by the Act. The title to all such property is vested in His Majesty but in His Majesty as sovereign head of the province (Maritime Bank's Case[20]); as regards the appropriation and disposal of such property His Majesty acts upon the advice of the provincial legislature and executive. No extra provincial authority is constitutionally competent to give such advice.\nI do not mean to imply that the provinces in exercising their powers of ownership over provincial property may not be subject to restrictions arising out of the provisions of competently enacted Dominion legislation. In re Provincial Fisheries[21] Lord Herschell delivering the judgment of the Judicial Committee pointed out that Dominion legislation might in certain cases, in theory at least, so restrict the exercise of the provincial proprietary rights as virtually to effect confiscation of them.\nBut while that is so Lord Watson pointed out as already mentioned, in St. Catherines Milling Company's Case[22] that the legal effect of the provisions of the Act dealing with the distribution of assets was to exclude the assets assigned to the province from the Dominion power of appropriation save for the purpose mentioned in sec. 117. There is therefore this limit to the effect-of Dominion legislation in this connection. The Dominion has no power to deal with provincial public assets as owner. This is illustrated by the decision in the Fisheries Case,21 in which it was held that notwithstanding the Dominion power of regulation of fisheries the authority remains with the province to settle the conditions upon which rights shall be granted in respect of fisheries vested in the province as owner; and at p. 713 Lord Herschell explicitly says on behalf of the Judicial Committee that an attempt on the part of the Dominion to deal with provincial public property as owner cannot be supported as an exercise of legislative authority under sec. 91.\nThis authority of the province in relation to its public property seems necessarily to involve the exclusive right to fix the conditions upon which public money shall be disbursed and rights in or in respect of provincial public property granted. That seems to be involved in the conception of such authority as equivalent to ownership. True it is that by section 106 and by section 126 it is provided that the duties and revenues over which the Dominion and the provinces are respectively given the power of appropriation shall be appropriated to the public service of the Dominion or of the province as the case may be. What is an appropriation to the public service of the Dominion or to the public service of a province? Is that a question reviewable by a court? Without deciding finally that point it is quite plain that the question whether a given appropriation by the Dominion Parliament or by a provincial legislature is an appropriation for the public service within the meaning of these enactments is a point upon which any court would be slow to pass. I doubt very much if such a question is reviewable judicially.\nThe present reference presents the question (as it was argued by counsel on behalf of the Dominion as well as on behalf of the private interests opposed to the validity of the legislation) as a question depending upon the application of Bryden's Case[23]. Bryden's Case was considered in the later case of Cunningham v. Tomey Homma[24]. There are expressions in the later judgment which appear to throw some doubt upon the earlier decision but I do not think the Judicial Committee in 1903 intended to overrule the central point of the decision of 1899. In the earlier case Lord Watson laid down that the rights and disabilities of aliens constituted a matter exclusively within the legislative jurisdiction of the Parliament of Canada and having come to the conclusion that the legislation in question there did \"in pith and substance\" deal solely with this subject, he held that the legislation was beyond the jurisdiction of the province. According to the interpretation of Bryden's Case23 laid down in 1903 the Coal Mines Legislation had been obnoxious to constitutional restrictions in the sense that in principle it involved an assertion of authority on the part of the province to exclude Chinese aliens and naturalized subjects from all employments and thus by preventing them earning their living to deny them the right of residence within the province. That I think is the pith of the earlier legislation according to the interpretation placed by the later decision upon the judgment in Bryden's Case23\u2014an assertion of authority on the part of the province to exclude Chinese aliens or naturalized subjects from residence in the province. I shall come presently to consider the Act of 1921 from this point of view, but before doing so it is important I think, to observe that the minor premise of the judgments in Bryder\u00ecs Case23 and Tomey Homma's Case24 was that the legislation impeached in Bryden's Case23 was legislation which in substance and effect if not in its very terms it would have been competent to the Dominion to enact in exercise of its power to make laws in relation to aliens and naturalization; but while I do not think an affirmative answer to the question would by any means be necessarily decisive upon the point upon which we have to pass at present it is I think pertinent and worth while to examine the question whether or not the enactment now in question is an enactment which in whole or in part would have been competent to the Dominion under section 91.\nI have already in a general way pointed out the characteristics of the scheduled orders-in-council. They enact that there shall be engrafted upon each instrument of the class mentioned a stipulation against the employment of Chinese and Japanese and the statute provides that a breach of this stipulation will confer upon the government of the province a right of cancellation. Is this an enactment competent to the Dominion under its legislative authority in relation to the subject of aliens? The Judicial Committee in Citizens Ins. Co. v. Parsons[25] and very lately in the judgment delivered by Lord Haldane in the Great West Saddlery Company v. The King[26] has pointed out that the scope of the enactments of ss. 91 and 92 must be determined, and in many cases the question is one of more than a little nicety, by reference to the context furnished by the two sections as a whole. Their Lordships in Tomey Homma's Case[27] had to consider the scope of the legislative authority conferred in respect of the subject of naturalization in its relation to the provincial authority upon the subject of the provincial constitution and they reached the conclusion that if this limitation at all events was imposed upon the Dominion authority that it was not of such scope as to place any restriction upon the provincial power to prescribe the conditions of such privileges as that of the right to exercise the provincial legislative suffrage. It would appear to admit of little doubt that similar considerations apply with perhaps much greater force to the Dominion authority in respect of aliens. An authority to legislate on the subject of aliens (the subjects of the provincial constitution and municipal institutions being assigned to the province) would not seem prima facie to embrace the authority to provide that all aliens should possess the same right to the provincial legislative suffrage as British subjects or the same right to sit in the legislature and to hold seats in the provincial executive or the same right to exercise the municipal franchises or to be members of municipal councils or to be municipal officials or (the exclusive authority to legislate on the subject of provincial officials being allotted to the province) to provide that aliens should possess equal rights with British subjects in respect of employment in the civil service of the provinces. Similar considerations again would appear to me sufficient to establish the exclusion from that authority of the power to require that aliens shall be on the same footing as British subjects in respect of the beneficial enjoyment of appropriations by provincial legislatures from public provincial funds or in respect of grants of interests in provincial property.\nAn attempt on part of the Dominion to enact the Act of 1921 would pass beyond the scope of the authority given by section 91. The restrictions imposed by the scheduled orders-in-council affect, it must be observed, naturalized British subjects and native born British subjects. Clearly the Dominion could not an any ground capable of plausible statement pass a law restricting the right of grantees of interests in provincial property in relation to the employment of native born British subjects; the Tomey Homma Case[28] seems to negative the existence of such an authority in relation to naturalized subjects. The proportion of naturalized and native born British subjects of Japanese and Chinese race to the whole of the population within that category in the province of British Columbia must be considerable. These considerations alone seem to present a formidable difficulty in the way of supporting such legislation as Dominion legislation under its authority in relation to aliens and naturalization.\nBut the Dominion authority must fail, I think, upon a broader ground. For the purpose of explaining that ground more clearly I shall assume that the condition in question affected all aliens and aliens alone. The Dominion authority in respect of aliens it must be taken I think in consequence of the decision in Bryden's Case[29], comprehends the right to define the rights and disabilities of aliens in a general way. But whether it comprehends the right even by general enactment to attach to grantees of rights in provincial property a special disability in relation to the employment of aliens, is, I think, at least gravely questionable; and the difficulty is not diminished when one considers the question in relation to grants of public monies. Assuming aliens to be under no applicable general disability is it truly legislation on the subject of aliens to prohibit the employment of them in circumstances in which they are to be paid out of public funds? To prohibit the provincial government from employing an alien in any circumstances? To place a like prohibition upon municipalities? I am not convinced that an affirmative answer can be given to these questions.\nBut the legislation in question goes a step\u2014and a very long step\u2014beyond this. It professes to attach to contracts entered into with the provincial government, to grants made by the provincial government, a stipulation and a condition the character of which has already been described, making the rights of the contractor or grantee defeasible upon nonperformance of the stipulation. It does not appear to me to admit of doubt that to impose by law such a stipulation and such a condition as part of such instruments would be an attempt on the part of Parliament to intervene in the disposition of the public funds of the province and the control and disposition of the public property of the province as owner; and therefore to transcend the restriction which as already mentioned is plainly laid down upon the activities of the Dominion parliament in exercise of the authority given by sect. 91 of the B.N.A. Act and plainly required by the decisions above mentioned. On this ground alone for the reason above given the irrelevancy of Bryden's Case[30] seems established.\nBut to come to a more particular consideration of Bryden's Case30 and Tomey Homma's Case[31] and the application of the principle of these decisions to the statute of 1921 and the scheduled orders-in-council. The view taken in Bryden's Case30 as explained by Tomey Homma's Case31 of the \"Coal Mines Regulation Act\" was, as I have said, that it involves an assumption on the part of the province to deal with the fundamental rights of aliens and naturalized subjects in a manner and degree not consistent with a recognition of their right of residence in the province. In Bryden's Case[32] it was held that the necessary and indeed the only effect of the prohibition contained in the statute there under consideration was to prevent the class of Chinamen inhabiting British Columbia (aliens and naturalized subjects) from pursuing the occupation of underground coal mining. The statute and orders-in-council now under review have no such effect in fact or in principle. There is no prohibition directly levelled against Chinese and Japanese. There is a stipulation imposed, it is true, ab extra by the law upon instruments of the classes affected enforceable against grantees and concessionaires by the penal sanction of forfeiture which in effect excludes the employment of Chinese and Japanese, whether aliens, naturalized subjects or native born subjects in connection with the exercise of rights or the performance of duties under such instruments, but the stipulation and the condition are strictly limited to the employment of such persons in such circumstances. There is no prohibition affecting a lessee under the \"Placer Mining Act\", for example, or the holder of a certificate under the \"Water Clauses Consolidation Act\" in activities having no connection with the rights given by such instruments, and there is no general prohibition generally affecting any single occupation.\nThe last mentioned point requires perhaps a little elaboration. The orders in council as affecting the lumbering and logging industries, for example, are without operation in all cases in which the right to cut timber is incidental to the ownership of the land and in cases where the right to cut timber is derived through any grant of any character other than licenses and leases of the specific kinds mentioned in the orders-in-council. Without proceeding to further detail it is sufficient to point out that the vast areas of land in different parts of the province granted as subsidies for aid in the construction of railways and the timber on those areas are quite unaffected by anything in these orders-in-council. There is, for example, the great land grant in Vancouver Island embracing about one fifth of the whole area of the island given in aid of the construction of the E. & N. Ry. There is the railway belt stretching from the coast to the eastern boundary line of the province granted to the Dominion under the terms of union, and besides there are the large areas in southern British Columbia given by the legislature in aid of railway construction some thirty years ago. So as to coal mining. The effect of these orders-in-council on the industry of coal mining must be trivial because it has no application except to coal mining in lands in which the title does not remain in the Crown. So again with regard to metalliferous mining. The statute does not affect mining on Crown granted mineral claims except in a very limited degree or in mineral claims worked under the provisions of the \"Mineral Act\" before the issue of a Crown grant; and as regards placer mining it applies only to placer mining leases under the specified provisions and does not affect such mining pursued on placer mining claims. So again with regard to the grants of water rights. The right to divert water for agricultural purposes, for ordinary domestic purposes, for community supply, is not affected by the condition laid down, which affects only power certificates under Part IV of the Act. As regards contracts for public works, the incidence of the order-in-council is no doubt intended to be limited and I think that it is the proper construction of it to contracts with the government where the remuneration of the contractor is derived from the legislative appropriation of public monies. Obviously the legislature has not by the Act of 1921 attempted to deny the Chinese and Japanese the right to dispose of their labour in the province nor has it attempted to prohibit generally the employment of Chinese and Japanese by grantees of rights in the public lands of the province.\nIt should be noted that the provisions of the B.N.A. Act 102 to 126, in so far as they affect the public lands, contemplate not only the raising of revenue but an object at least as important, the distribution of these lands for the purpose of colonization and settlement. As Lord Selborne said in the Attorney General v. Mercer Case[33], the provisions are of a high political nature they are the attribution of Royal territorial rights for the purposes of not only revenue but for the \"purposes of government\" as well.\nIn some of the provinces perhaps the most important responsibility resting upon the legislature was the responsibility of making provision for settlement by a suitable population. This is recognized by the provision of the Act which gives to the provinces (subject to an overriding Dominion authority) the power to make laws in relation to the subject of immigration.\nI find it difficult to affirm that a province in framing its measures for and determining the conditions under which private individuals should be entitled to exploit the territorial resources of the province is passing beyond its sphere in taking steps to encourage settlement by settlers of a class who are likely to become permanently (themselves and their families) residents of the province. I see no reason for thinking that the province of British Columbia in providing, for example, that persons entitled to take advantage of the privileges given by the \"Crown Lands Act\" in relation to pre-emption of the public lands is entering a sphere which does not properly belong to it in enacting that such persons shall be either British subjects or those who have declared their intention to become British subjects.\nThese considerations are not irrelevant because they point to the conclusion that it cannot be affirmed (a condition of the applicability of Bryden's Case[34]) in respect of such legislation as that before us that it has no other effect than its effect upon the unrestricted opportunity which Chinese and Japanese might otherwise enjoy in disposing of their labour. That cannot be affirmed because it is impossible to say that the legislature in imposing such conditions had not in view some object falling within the scope of its political duties in relation to the interests and responsibilities committed to it.\nThe next point which naturally arises for consideration is whether effect should be given to the contention made on behalf of the Dominion that the Dominion statute of 1913 can be sustained as enacted in exercise of the power of the Dominion in relation to aliens. There are grave objections to this contention. One of the provisions of the treaty which is declared to have the force of law is a provision which puts Japanese subjects on the same footing as regards education as British subjects. The subject of education, as already mentioned, is committed to the provincial jurisdiction by s. 93. One of the provisions which, as I have already said, must be regarded as fundamental. I am unable to agree that the authority of the Dominion with regard to the subject of aliens is comprehensive enough to support an enactment in the terms of the treaty clause on this subject and it is impossible, I think, to suppose that parliament in declaring this clause to have force of law was professing to exercise any authority under s. 91. But there is an objection based upon a broader ground. I am unable for the present at all events to agree with the view that the Dominion authority in relation to aliens comprehends the power to give to aliens rights having primacy over the rights of the provinces in relation to grants of public money or grants of interests in public lands. I will not elaborate this point, my reasons will sufficiently appear from what I have already said. I now come to section 132, which is in these terms:\u2014 \"132. The parliament and government of Canada shall have all powers necessary or proper for performing the obligations of Canada or of any province thereof, as part of the British Empire, towards foreign countries arising under treaties between the Empire and such foreign countries.\"\nIt is a condition of the jurisdiction created by this section that there shall be some obligation of Canada or of some province thereof as part of the British Empire towards some foreign country arising under a treaty between the Empire and such foreign country. A treaty is an agreement between states. It is desirable, I think, in order to clear away a certain amount of confusion which appeared to beset the argument to emphasize this point that a treaty is a compact between states and internationally or diplomatically binding upon states. The treaty making power, to use an American phrase, is one of the prerogatives of the Crown under the British constitution That is to say, the Crown, under the British constitution, possesses authority to enter into obligations towards foreign states diplomatically binding and, indirectly, such treaties may obviously very greatly affect the rights of individuals. But it is no part of the prerogative of the Crown by treaty in time of peace to effect directly a change in the law governing the rights of private individuals, nor is it any part of the prerogative of the Crown to grant away, without the consent of parliament, the public monies or to impose a tax or to alter the laws of trade and navigation and it is at least open to the gravest doubt whether the prerogative includes power to control the exercise by a colonial government or legislature of the right of appropriation over public property given by such a statute as the B.N.A. Act. All these require legislation. As regards these matters the supreme legislative authority in the British Empire is, of course, the Parliament of the United Kingdom. Three views are perhaps conceivable as to the scope of the authority arising under s. 132. It might be supposed that it was intended to give jurisdiction only in relation to those matters which are committed to the authority of parliament by section 91 and other provisions of the B.N.A. Act. It might be supposed, on the other hand, to constitute a delegation of the entire authority of the parliament of the United Kingdom, in so far as the execution of such authority might be required for the purpose of giving effect to the treaty obligations of the Empire within Canada or in relation to Canada. On the other hand it may be supposed that a less sweeping authority is conferred by this section; that it is subject to some limitations arising out of co-ordinate provisions of the B.N.A. Act itself. As to the first of these views, it may, I think, be at once rejected upon the ground that otherwise the section would be quite unnecessary. As to the other two; there are certain fundamental terms of the arrangement upon which the B.N.A. Act was founded, and these it is difficult to think it was intended that parliament should have power to disregard in any circumstances. But it is unnecessary to pass upon these points. The authority given by section 132 is an authority to deal with subjects of imperial and national concern as distinguished from matters of strictly Dominion concern only; and I am satisfied it is broad enough to support the legislation in question. The treaty validated by statute of 1913 deals with subjects which are ordinary subject matters of international convention: with precisely the kind of thing which must have been in the contemplation of those who framed this section. The effect of the Act of 1913 is, in my opinion, at least this: that with respect to the right to dispose of their labour, the Japanese are to be in the same position before the law as the subjects of the most favoured nation. Equality in the eye of the law in respect of these matters is what I think the legislation establishes. Does the Act of 1921 in its true construction infringe these rights of Japanese subjects? In my opinion it does. It excludes them from employment in certain definite cases. It is not, I think, material that the province in passing the Act is engaged in administering its own corporate economic affairs. If it goes into effect, it goes into effect (as a law of the province) abrogating rights guaranteed by the treaty. It is thus not only a law passed against the good faith of the treaty but it is, in my opinion, a law repugnant to the treaty and as such I think it cannot prevail. I think, moreover, that the Act of 1921 views Japanese and Chinese as constituting a single group and since it cannot take effect according to its terms that it must be treated as inoperative in toto.\nAnglin J.\u2014The competency of the legislature of British Columbia to pass chapter 49 of its statutes of 1921 is the subject of a reference to this court by His Excellency the Governor General in Council, made under s. 60 of the \"Supreme Court Act\". The statute in question purports to validate certain orders of the provincial executive council providing for the insertion, in leases of Crown lands, Crown licences and other documents, of clauses precluding the employment by Crown lessees and licensees of Chinese and Japanese labour. Its validity is challenged on two distinct grounds: (a) that it impinges on the exclusive jurisdiction of the Dominion Parliament over \"Naturalization and Aliens\" (B.N.A. Act, s. 91 (25); (b) that it derogates from rights assured to the Japanese in Canada by a treaty between H.M. the King and H.M. the Emperor of Japan, \"sanctioned and declared to have the force of law in Canada\" by 3 & 4 Geo. V., (D), c. 27.\nIt seems obvious that, inasmuch as the latter ground of attack concerns only the Japanese, it will, in any event, be necessary to consider the former ground in order to answer the question propounded in so far as it relates to the Chinese, who are also affected by the impugned legislation and the orders in council it purports to confirm. Their Lordships of the Privy Council have frequently intimated that in dealing with matters akin to that now before us, those upon whom the duty of determining them is thrown will be well advised so far as possible to restrict their expressions of opinion to what is essential for the determination of the particular question in hand. Citizens Ins. Co. v. Parsons[35]; Hodge v. The Queen[36]; Attorney General of Manitoba v. Manitoba Licence Holders' Association[37]. It would therefore seem to be desirable that the question as to the effect of the Japanese Treaty and of its sanction by the Canadian parliament should be entered upon only if the impugned legislation should be held not to invade the jurisdiction of the Dominion parliament under s. 91 (25) of the B.N.A. Act. I accordingly take up this latter question.\nIf the British Columbia legislation, when properly appreciated, falls within the legislative jurisdiction conferred on the Dominion Parliament by s. 91 (25), in view of the concluding proviso of s. 91\u2014\"Any matter coming within any of the classes of subjects enumerated in this section shall not be deemed to come within the class of matters of a local and private nature comprised in the enumeration of the classes of subjects by this Act assigned exclusively to the legislatures of the provinces\"\u2014it should not be upheld merely because it may in some aspects be regarded as an exercise of legislative power conferred by one of the subsections of s. 92.\nIn determining the validity of legislation which it is sought to uphold under, and which may ex facie purport to have been passed in the exercise of certain legislative powers conferred by the B.N.A. Act, their Lordships have intimated that the courts should have regard to \"the pith and substance of the enactment\" rather than to its form or to any gloss put upon it (Union Colliery Co. v. Bryden) [38]\u2014that they should ascertain at what the legislation is really aimed and should accordingly determine where legislative jurisdiction to enact it is to be found. Great West Saddlery Co. v. The King[39], Attorney General for Canada v. Attorney General for Alberta[40] and The Board of Commerce Case[41] are recent instances in which their Lordships have so dealt with Canadian statutes.\nTo paraphrase Lord Watson's language in the Bryden Case38 the leading feature of the orders in council dealt with by the legislation in question consists in this\u2014that they have, and can have, no application except to Japanese and Chinamen who are aliens or naturalized subjects, and that they establish no rule or regulation except that these aliens or naturalized subjects shall not work, or be allowed to work, upon, or in the development of, any property leased from the government of British Columbia or in private enterprises which are operated in whole or in part under licences from that government; \"the pith and substance of the enactments\" objected to consists in establishing a prohibition which affects aliens or naturalized subjects in matters that directly concern their rights, privileges and disabilities as such; they therefore trench upon the exclusive authority of the parliament of Canada.\nWhile the judgment in the Bryden Case38 is undoubtedly explained and somewhat restricted in its application by what Lord Chancellor Halsbury said in pronouncing the judgment of the Board in the Tomey Homma Case[42], the authority of the former decision remains unchallenged. The legislation now before us in my opinion much more closely resembles that condemned in the Bryden Case[43] than that upheld in the Tomey Homma Case[44], where a matter of provincial electoral franchise, and therefore of the constitution of the province, was the subject of the legislation, or in the subsequent Quong-Wong Case[45] in this court, where a law for the suppression of a local evil was upheld. Properly appreciated, the orders in council which the British Columbia legislation of 1921 purports to validate are devised to deprive Chinese and Japanese, whether naturalized or not, of the ordinary rights of the inhabitants of British Columbia in regard to employment by lessees and licensees of the Crown and are not really aimed at the regulation and management of Crown properties or Crown rights. I am unable to distinguish the case at bar in principle from the Bryden Case43. If the authority of that decision is to be destroyed, it must be by the Judicial Committee itself and not by this court.\nI would therefore answer the first question on the reference in the negative, which renders an answer to the second unnecessary.\nBrodeur J.\u2014The question we have to consider on this reference is whether the British Columbia legislature has the right to prohibit the employment of Chinese or Japanese on Crown lands or on public works.\nOn the 2nd April 1902 the Legislative Assembly of that province passed a resolution declaring that in all contracts, leases and concessions made by the government, provision should be made that no Chinese or Japanese should be employed in connection with these contracts, leases or concessions. Such a resolution was never embodied before 1921 in any statute of the legislature and was not then part of the law of the land. Further it could not be disallowed by the federal authorities under the powers conferred by sections 55 and 90 of the B.N.A. Act because it was not a statute.\nIn conformity with the said resolution, however, the government of the province passed on the 28th of May 1902 and on the 16th day of June 1902 orders in council carrying into effect the resolution of the Legislative Assembly and since the passing of these orders in council the Government has inserted in its contracts for the construction of provincial public works a provision that no Chinese or Japanese should be employed in connection with such works and has caused it to be inserted as a term of its contracts and leases conferring rights or concessions in respect to the public lands belonging to the province, a provision that no Chinese or Japanese shall be employed about such premises.\nIn 1920 the provincial government of British Columbia referred to the Court of Appeal of that province the question whether the Japanese Treaty of the 3rd of April, 1911, operated as to limit the legislative jurisdiction of the Legislative Assembly.\nThe Court of Appeal unanimously decided that it was not competent to the provincial legislature to insert in these public contracts or leases in respect of public lands a provision that no Japanese shall be employed upon such works or lands.\nIn 1921 the legislature of British Columbia passed the statute ch. 49 by which the two orders in council of the 28th May 1902 and the 18th June 1902 are declared to have been valid and effectual for all purposes. The Consul General of Japan having suggested to the Federal government that this statute of 1921 was ultra vires and that it should be disallowed by His Excellency the Governor General, the Federal Government has referred to the Supreme Court the two following questions:\u2014\n\"1. Had the legislature of British Columbia authority to enact cap. 49 of its statutes of 1921 \"An Act to validate and confirm certain orders in council and provisions relating to the employment of persons on Crown property?\n\"2. If the said Act be in the opinion of the court ultra vires in part then in what particulars is it ultra vires?\"\nThe question of restricting the employment of Chinese and Japanese labour has been for years a subject of discussion in the legislature of British Columbia and of litigation before the Canadian courts and the Privy Council. It has been also the subject of diplomatic relations between the countries interested.\nWe see that as far back as 1890, the legislature of that province passed the \"Coal Mines Regulation Act\" by which it prohibited the Chinamen from employment in underground coal workings. The Privy Council, being called upon to pass judgment on the validity of the Act, declared that the statutory prohibition in question was within the exclusive authority of the Dominion Parliament conferred by section 91, subsection 25 in regard to \"naturalization and aliens\": Union Colliery v. Bryden[47].\nIn 1897, the \"British Columbia Electoral Act\" was passed and provided that no Japanese, whether naturalized or not, should be entitled to vote. The validity of this Act was also brought before the courts, and the Privy Council upheld the validity of the Act and decided that the Dominion parliament, under sec. 91 s.s. 25 B.N.A. Act, had exclusive jurisdiction to determine how the naturalization should be constituted, but that the provincial legislature had the right to determine under sec. 92, s.s. 1 what privileges, as distinguished from necessary consequences, shall be attached to naturalization. Cunningham v. Tomey Homma[48].\nIt was said that in the Tomey Homma Case48 the Judicial Committee \"modified the views of the construction of subsection 25 of section 29 in the Union Collieries decision\". Quong-Wing v. The King[49].\nThis Quong Wing Case49 gives another instance of a legislative enactment against Orientals. It has reference to a prohibition by the legislature of Saskatchewan against the employment of white female labour in places of business kept by Chinamen, and it was decided by this court that such a provision was intra vires of the provincial legislature.\nThe Privy Council refused leave to appeal in this Quong Wing Case49.\nI can, with some difficulty, reconcile these three above decisions. (Clement's Canadian Constitution, 2nd ed. p. 673)\nIt appears to me however that where a province deals with a subject which evidently is within its jurisdiction, as the constitution of its legislative assembly or the making of the civil contract of hire, then it can provide against the Chinese and the Japanese becoming duly qualified electors and employing white girls. But where, under the pretence of dealing with local undertakings, the legislature undertakes to legislate with regard to naturalization or aliens, then it is a legislation which is not within its competence. A provincial legislature cannot discriminate against an alien upon the ground of his lack of British nationality, but a person may nevertheless be under disability, civil or political by reason of racial descent, a disability which he would share with natural born or naturalized British subjects of like extraction. Quong-Wing v. The King[50].\nBy the orders in council which the British Columbia government passed in 1902 and which were confirmed by the Act whose validity is referred to us, the legislature deals with its own crown lands and enacts that a certain class of persons will not be permitted to work on those lands. It is a question of internal management which, according to section 92 s.s. 5 of the B.N.A. Act, is within the competence of the local authority.\nI therefore come to the conclusion that the Legislation at issue, if it were not for the Japanese Treaty to which I will presently refer, would be intra vires. It is certainly intra vires as far as the Chinese are concerned.\nIn 1911, a treaty was made between His Majesty the King and the Emperor of Japan in which it was stipulated that the subjects of the contracting parties \"shall in all that relates to the pursuit of their industries, callings, professions and educational studies be placed in all respects on the same footing as the subjects or citizens of the most favoured nation.''\nThis treaty was sanctioned and declared to have the force of law in Canada by the Canadian parliament in 1913. Now by the B.N.A. Act sec. 132, it is provided that the parliament of Canada shall have all powers necessary for performing the obligations of Canada or of any province towards foreign countries arising under treaties between the British Empire and such foreign countries.\nIf the treaty had not been adhered to by the Dominion parliament, it could be contended with force that a Canadian province was not bound to obey the provisions of this treaty and could discriminate against the Japanese in favour of their foreign subjects. Walker v. Baird[51].\nThe King has the power to make a treaty, but if such a treaty imposes a charge upon the people or changes the law of the land it is somewhat doubtful if private rights can be sacrificed without the sanction of Parliament. The bill of rights having declared illegal the suspending or dispensing with laws without the consent of parliament, the Crown could not in time of peace make a treaty which would restrict the freedom of parliament.\nIn the United States a different rule prevails. Under the United States constitution the making of a treaty becomes at once the law of the whole country and of every state. In our country such a treaty affecting private rights should surely become effective only after proper legislation would have been passed by the Dominion parliament under section 132 B.N.A. Act.\nWe have in the \"Japanese Treaty Act\" of 1913 the legislation which is required to give force of law to that agreement, and it becomes binding for all Canadians and for all the provinces. British Columbia could not under that treaty give to the Japanese a treatment different from the one given to other foreigners.\nI consider the legislation of British Columbia illegal as far as the Japanese are concerned.\nI would then answer the first and second questions referred to us: That the legislature of British Columbia had authority to enact cap. 49 of its statutes of 1921 as far as the Chinese were concerned but that in so far as the Japanese are concerned such statute is ultra vires.\nMignault J.\u2014In answering the questions submitted by this reference, two decisions of the Judicial Committee must be considered: Union Colliery Co. of British Columbia v. Bryden[52], and Cunningham v. Tomey Homma[53].\nThe latter decision somewhat qualified the former, and indicated its scope in the following language:\u2014\n\"This Board, dealing with the particular facts of that case, came to the conclusion that the regulations there impeached were not really aimed at the regulation of coal mines at all, but were in truth devised to deprive the Chinese, naturalized or not, of the ordinary rights of the inhabitants of British Columbia and, in effect, to prohibit their continued residence in that province, since it prohibited their earning their living in that province.\"\nIn my opinion, the purport of the legislation and orders in council referred to in the reference is well described by the above language. So far as it could do so, the government of British Columbia, with the sanction of the legislature, has excluded the Chinese and Japanese, naturalized or not, from the field of industry and the labour market in that province, and has, in effect, prohibited their continued residence and their earning their living in British Columbia. The case comes well within the rule of the Bryden Case[54] as explained in the Tomey Homma Case[55], and therefore the statute and the orders in council are ultra vires.\nDuring the argument, counsel referred us to the Anglo-Japanese Treaty of April 3rd, 1911, sanctioned and declared to be law by the Dominion statute, 3-4 Geo. V. ch. 27, as rendering the impeached provisions void in so far as the Japanese are concerned.\nThis treaty is not mentioned in the reference, and inasmuch as I have come to the conclusion that this legislation is ultra vires under the \"British North America Act\" as construed by the above mentioned decisions, it is unnecessary to consider whether the treaty furnishes a further ground of nullity.\nI would answer \"No\" to the first question of the reference. The second question requires no reply.\nAt the sittings on the 7th February, 1922, the Chief Justice, speaking for the court, said:\u2014\n\"The answer by the court to the first question \"submitted by His Excellency the Governor General \"is in the negative. It is therefore unnecessary to \"answer the second question.

Marchiori (Plaintiff).\n1922: February 7; 1922: March 29.\nPresent: Sir Louis Davies C.J. and Idington, Duff, Anglin, Brodeur and Mignault JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR BRITISH COLUMBIA\nAppeal\u2014Jurisdiction\u2014Action by nominal plaintiff dismissed\u2014Motion asking payment of cost by real plaintiff\u2014\"Judicial proceeding\"\u2014\"Final judgment\"\u2014Equal division of the court on motion to quash\u2014\"Supreme Court Act\", R.S.C. (1906) c. 139, s. 37\u2014\"Supreme Court Act\" as amended by 10 & 11 Geo. V., c. 32.\nIn May, 1920, the plaintiff obtained judgment before the County Court against the defendant for damages caused by an automobile collision but on appeal the action was dismissed. The costs of the trial and appeal having been taxed at $1,165.05, execution against the plaintiff was returned nulla bona. On February 24th, 1921, a motion was made by the respondent for an order that the appellant, on whose behalf, as insurer of the plaintiff, the action had really been prosecuted, should pay the respondent's costs. The judgment granting the motion was affirmed by the Court of Appeal, and on motion to quash an appeal to this court:\nHeld, Idington and Brodeur JJ. dissenting, that, as the action had been begun before the 1st of July, 1920, the right of appeal to this court must be determined upon the provisions of the \"Supreme Court Act\" as they stood before the amendments of 10 & 11 Geo. V., c. 32, which became effective on that date. Per Davies C. J. and Duff and Anglin JJ.\u2014The judgment granting the motion is not susceptible of appeal as a \"final judgment\" under sect. 37 of the \"Supreme Court Act\", R.S.C. (1906), c. 139. Brodeur J. contra.\nAs three of the six judges were of opinion that the court had no jurisdiction, it was considered that a hearing on the merits would be futile and the appeal was dismissed without costs.\nMOTION to quash an appeal from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia which, on equal division of the court, had affirmed the judgment of Grant J. and maintained a motion for an order as stated in the head-note.\nThe plaintiff sued in the County Court for damages to his automobile sustained in a collision with that of the defendant. He recovered judgment in May, 1920, for $597 and costs. On appeal to the Court of Appeal of British Columbia this judgment was reversed, and the action was dismissed with costs. The defendant's costs of the action and appeal were taxed at $1,165.05. Execution against the plaintiff was returned nulla bona. The defendant having ascertained that the action had in fact been brought by the St. Lawrence Underwriters in the name of the plaintiff, whom they had insured, applied in February, 1921, to the County Court judge, upon notice, for an order that his taxed costs should be paid by the St. Lawrence Underwriters. This application was granted and, on appeal, the order of the County Court judge was affirmed, the court being equally divided. The St. Lawrence Underwriters, having obtained leave from the Court of Appeal, appealed to the Supreme Court. The defendant moved to quash the appeal.\nTilley K.C. for the motion.\u2014The motion to the County Court judge was made in the action which was instituted before July, 1920. The amendments to the \"Supreme Court Act\" of that year do not apply.\u2014The Court of Appeal had no jurisdiction to grant leave. The appeal, if any, lies under s. 37 of the former statute. The judgment from which it is sought to appeal is not a \"final judgment\" within the definition in the \"Supreme Court Act\" prior to 1920.\nHeighington contra.\u2014The motion to compel the appellants to pay the defendant's costs was a substantive proceeding. The amendments of 1920 apply and, leave having been obtained, the appeal lies. If not, there is a right of appeal under s. 37 of the former Act. The order of the County Court judge disposes of a substantive right of one of the parties and is therefore a \"final judgment\".\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014In the opinion of a majority of the members of the court, this action having been begun before the first of July, 1920, the right of appeal must be determined upon the provisions of the \"Supreme Court Act\" as they stood before the amendments which became effective on that date. Three of the judges (the Chief Justice, Mr. Justice Duff, and Mr. Justice Anglin) hold the view that, having regard to its incidental nature as a step taken to secure the realization of the judgment for costs rendered against the plaintiff, the application made to the County Court judge for an order that those costs should be paid by the appellants as the real plaintiffs was not a \"judicial proceeding\" within the meaning of that term as used in the definition of \"final judgment\" enacted by 3 & 4 Geo. V., c. 51, s. 1, (Svensson v. Bateman,[1], and that the judgment from which it is sought to appeal is therefore not a \"final judgment\" appealable to this court under s. 37 of the \"Supreme Court Act\" (R.S.C., 1906, c. 139.)\nAs the appeal is to be heard immediately and by the court as now constituted it is obvious that the opinion of three members of the court adverse to its jurisdiction will necessarily be fatal to the appellant's success. It would therefore seem to be futile to hear argument on the merits, which may not be considered by one-half of the court, with whom dismissal of the appeal is a foregone conclusion.\nIt would seem to be the better course that the motion to quash should be refused and the appeal itself now dismissed\u2014both without costs.\nIDINGTON J. (dissenting).\u2014The respondent Fewster was sued in one of the county courts of British Columbia by one Marchiori for damages done to his automobile, and recovered judgment for $597.52 and costs.\nUpon appeal the Court of Appeal reversed the judgment with costs and that judgment was duly deposited with the registrar of the County Court as provided for by one of the rules of court and thereupon the judgment derived its effect from that rule, which reads as follows:\u2014\n21. When the Court of Appeal has pronounced judgment, either party may deposit the same, or an office copy thereof, with the registrar of the County Court, and upon being so deposited such judgment shall be filed and may be enforced as if it had been given by the County Court.\nThereupon an execution was issued by said county court against said Marchiori and duly returned nulla bona by the sheriff. That return was followed by an application by the respondent Fewster to the said court to have the appellant ordered to pay the costs so awarded. The grounds alleged were that the appellant had in fact instigated Marchiori to bring the action. And the learned senior judge of the county court granted said order without giving any reasons.\nThe appellant had never been made a party to the said action, or in any way been served with notice thereof, or relating thereto, until said notice after the judgment and execution and return thereof as aforesaid.\nThe appellant herein appealed from said order to the Court of Appeal and contended there was no jurisdiction in the county court to make such an order.\nThat court, on equal division, dismissed said appeal, the learned Chief Justice and Mr. Justice Galliher being in favour of allowing said appeal and the other learned justices Martin and McPhillips, being in favour of dismissing it.\nSection 161 of the \"County Courts Act,\" R.S.B.C. (1911) c. 53, is as follows:)\n161. All the costs of any action or proceeding in the court not herein otherwise provided for shall be paid by or apportioned between the parties in such manner as the judge shall think fit, and in default of any special direction shall abide by the event of the action, and execution may issue for the recovery of any such costs in like manner as for any debt adjudged in the said court.\nIt is difficult to see how the county court judge could have power to make such an order under said provision, especially as to the costs directed by the Court of Appeal which were specifically awarded by the said court and liability therefor also specifically determined and finally disposed of by virtue of said order and the Rule 21 first above quoted.\nI only refer to this to shew the importance of the questions raised and the reason for that court, though so divided, agreeing to allow and granting an order giving leave to bring an appeal to this court. The power to grant such leave to appeal here was given by section 37 of c. 32 of 10-11 Geo. V., assented to the 16th June, 1920, and radically amending the \"Supreme Court Act,\" and which in the enacting part of the new section 37 and subsec. (a) thereof, reads as follows:\n37. Subject to sections thirty-eight and thirty-nine, an appeal shall lie directly to the Supreme Court from any final judgment of a provincial court, whether of appellate or original jurisdiction, other than the highest court of final resort in the province, pronounced in a judicial proceeding which is not one of those specifically excepted in section thirty-six\u2014\n(a) in any case by leave of the highest court of final resort having jurisdiction in the province in which the proceeding was originally instituted; provided that except in cases in which such highest court of final resort has concurrent jurisdiction with the court from which it is sought to appeal, special leave shall not be granted in any case which is not appealable to such highest court of last resort and which has not been heretofore appealable to the Supreme Court; and,\nThat was brought into force by the following:\u2014\n4. This Act shall come into effect on the first day of July, 1920; but in regard to appeals in proceedings which shall have been begun in the court or before the body having original jurisdiction therein before that day, the Supreme Court shall nervertheless continue to possess and exercise the jurisdiction conferred by the sections herein before repealed.\nThe said proceeding against the appellant was first taken on the 24thFebruary, 1921, was quite independent of the original cause of action and had no relation thereto, but to the allegation that the affidavit and exhibits thereafter referred to set forth as the foundation for the motion.\nIn short it was a substitution for any new action which might have been founded on the facts alleged as to the instigation of what in the final result might have been declared unfounded in law. It was far more such an independent proceeding than is an interpleader issue founded on a judgment and in way of enforcing execution thereof which was declared long ago to be a new proceeding and the resulting judgment therein appealable here. The decision of the Privy Council in the case of Macfarlane v. Leclaire,[2] is presented in Cameron's Supreme Court Practice as the basis of our jurisprudence in that regard.\nI submit that the order in question herein as clearly was as that the beginning of a new collateral proceeding under the Act giving the Court of Appeal power to grant that leave which it has given to come here. Hence I hold the motion to quash such an appeal should not be granted.\nI am unable to understand why the imperative words of the first part of the above quoted section bringing the amending Act into force on 1st July, 1920, are to be discarded when invoked in a case where the proceeding in question clearly began after that date, and clearly had, for reasons already assigned, no legal connection therewith.\nAt all events if that county court proceeding and judgments are to be held as so connected with the order in question as to be reasonably invoked as a barrier to the other parts of the amending Act expressly giving the power to the Supreme Court of Alberta to give such leave as given, then surely the right to appeal still exists within the remaining part of the said section 4.\nI alternatively, therefore, submit that the judgment now appealed from herein, if to be so based on the appeal from the Court of Appeal as arising out of the county court suit, is appealable without leave under the provisions of the \"Supreme Court Act\" providing for appeal here where the jurisdiction was concurrent with that of the British Columbia Supreme Court jurisdiction.\nIf such a jurisdiction existed in any case in any court as to make such an order as in question, certainly it was also in the case here in question within the British Columbia Supreme Court's jurisdiction.\nIt was a power which the judge of the court must be presumed to have exercised not by virtue of anything in way of trying the county court suit, or anything in the way of trying to enforce said judgment therein, as in the case of Svensson v. Bateman,[3] and in exercising such a power he must have been, instead of leaving the parties to try it out, in a new action attempting to enforce or give a remedy for an alleged wrong which might well have been, and more properly, asserted by suing for the amount involved in the Supreme Court of British Columbia.\nI by no means think that this is the correct view of the case presented on the motion to quash, but submit it is logically the alternative to be adopted if the latter part of said section 4 is to override the first, as urged upon us.\nIf the new motion is so bound up, however, with the case as to come within the latter part of the section, then surely an appeal must lie just as in any other like independent issue arising in the case in which the right of appeal is preserved by the latter part of the section.\nIn either of the foregoing alternatives by way of testing the power of the learned judge, I think the appeal should not be quashed, but the motion dismissed and the appeal be heard in due course. DUFF J.\u2014I concur with the Chief Justice.\nANGLIN J.\u2014I concur with the Chief Justice.\nBRODEUR J.\u2014I am of opinion that the judicial proceeding which has given rise to this appeal is not the original action in the county court but the application made by the respondent to have the appellant ordered to pay the costs awarded on the original action. Turcotte v. Dansereau [4]; King v. Dupuis [5]; Lefeuntun v. V\u00e9ronneau [6]; Macfarlane v. Leclaire [7].\nThis application having been made on the 24th of February, 1921, then the right of appeal is to be determined by the amendment to the \"Supreme Court Act\" of 1920 (ch. 32 of 10-11 Geo. V, s. 4). The appellants, under the provisions of the latter amendment, have obtained leave; then this appeal is properly before us and should be heard. This is a final judgment appealable to this court under section 37 of the \"Supreme Court Act.\"\nThe motion to quash should be dismissed.\nBut as we are equally divided on this question of jurisdiction and as it is obvious that the opinion of three members of the court adverse to its jurisdiction will be necessarily fatal to the appellants' success, it would therefore be futile to hear arguments on the merits.\nThe appeal then should be dismissed but without costs. MIGNAULT J.\u2014I concur in the opinion of the Chief Justice that the right of appeal in this case must be determined upon the provisions of the Supreme Court Act before its amendments in 1920.\nInasmuch as three members of the court are of the opinion that the order complained of is not a final judgment within section 37 of the Supreme Court Act, it is obvious that the appeal could not succeed and, without expressing any opinion as to the nature of the judgment, I concur in the dismissal of the appeal without costs.\nMotion dismissed without costs.\nAppeal dismissed without costs.\n[1] [1909[ 42 Can.

P. Lumber Co. was, by order of the court, authorized to borrow from the appellant bank a certain sum which should be a first charge on the whole assets of the company and the order provided for a sale of those assets in default of repayment. Such default having occurred, the bank sold the property to the Investment company appellant by public auction, the conduct of the sale being in the hands of the bank's solicitor under the supervision of the court. Owing to this solicitor being under the impression that a certain parcel of land did not belong to the Lumber Company, it was omitted from the particulars of sale. The solicitor for the receiver and the bank approved the particulars in the belief that they covered the omitted parcel and the purchasers bought under the same erroneous belief. One condition of the sale provided that \"any error of description * * * shall not annul the sale nor shall any compensation be allowed in respect thereof.\" There was evidence that the omitted parcel had a very substantial value but no evidence was adduced that a greater price might have been obtained for the assets, if the omitted parcel had been included. Upon the discovery of the mistake, the appellants applied for an order by the court that the receiver execute and deliver to the purchaser a conveyance of the said parcel omitted in the particulars of the sale; this application was resisted by the respondent acting as trustee for the bondholders of the Lumber Company. Held that the appellants' application should not be granted; and that, although the purchaser may have been entitled to rescission of the sale on the ground of mistake, the order prayed for should not be granted, as the appellants had failed to shew anything which would raise an equity against the bondholders such as might have enabled the court to direct that the deficiency in the land should be made good by the receiver at the bondholders' expense.\nJudgment of the Court of Appeal ([1921] 3 W.W.R. 209) affirmed.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia [1], reversing the judgment of Morrison J. and dismissing an application by the appellants for an order as above stated.\nIn an action brought on behalf of bondholders a receiver and manager of the assets of the Canadian Pacific Lumber Company was appointed by order of the Supreme Court of British Columbia and was authorized to borrow from the Dominion Bank a sum not exceeding $310,000, which should become a first charge on the assets of the company. The order provided for a sale of the assets of the company to satisfy the bank's charge in the event of default in re-payment on the date specified. Such default having occurred, a sale of the company's assets took place under the supervision of the court, whose officer approved the advertisement, conditions and particulars of sale. The conduct of the sale was in the hands of the bank's solicitor. The purchasers were the London and Canadian Investment Company, co\u2014appellants with the bank. Owing to the bank's solicitor being under the impression that a certain parcel of land did not belong to the Lumber Company, it was omitted from the particulars of sale. The solicitor for the receiver, who was aware that the omitted parcel belonged to the Lumber Company, approved the particulars in the belief that they covered the omitted parcel; and the purchasers at the sale bought under the same erroneous belief. For the omitted parcel it is said on behalf of the bondholders that $75,000 can now be obtained, and their trustee resists an application made on behalf of the bank and the purchasers that the receiver should be directed to execute a conveyance of this parcel to the purchasers. The bondholders do not appear to have participated in the sale or to have been in any way responsible for the omission of the parcel in question from the particulars or for the mistaken impression of the purchasers that it had been included in the sale.\nMr. Justice Morrison made the order asked for by the bank and the purchasers; but, on appeal by the trustee for the bondholders, the Court of Appeal set this order aside and dismissed the application, Martin J.A. dissenting. The applicants now seek the restoration of Mr. Justice Morrison's order.\nGreer K.C. and Shepley for the appellants.\nF. Congdon K.C. for the respondent.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014For the reasons stated by my brother Anglin, with which I fully concur, I would dismiss this appeal with costs.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014The attempt to include in the sale a parcel of land which is alleged by the receiver to have a very considerable value and which was not only deliberately omitted from the particulars but also by no fair reading of the advertisement could be supposed to have been offered for sale is rather surprising. The motion made about six months after the vesting order of the court carrying out the result of the sale as it actually took place, to have that additional property given the purchaser is something for which I venture to think no precedent can be found, and especially so in face of the conditions of sale, amongst which was the following:\u2014\n12.\u2014The description of the property in the particulars is believed and shall be deemed to be correct, but if any error of description as to quantity or measurements or otherwise be found therein, it shall not annul the sale, nor shall any compensation be allowed in respect thereof.\nThere was much said in argument here about the intention of the parties concerned to sell the properties of the company in question and it was argued as if that had been advertised, which it was not.\nI cannot see that the advertisement suggested any such thing or could convey to the minds of any bidders that such was the intention especially in face of such a condition of sale as I quote above.\nThe party who was the successful bidder indeed took the trouble to go to the solicitor in charge of the sale to learn from him if the intention was to sell the entire properties of the company and was answered affirmatively that such was the intention.\nThe solicitor was quite honest in giving such a reply for he laboured then, no doubt as he had in framing the advertisement, under a mistake of fact, relative to some expropriation proceeding which had been taken at one time but later abandoned.\nThe fault, so far as I can see, if any, was on the part of the bidder whose bid was successful, but who does not seem to have taken any pains to enlighten another bidder, or any one at the sale, of the mistake in the advertisement. I do not think such a bidder, or his principals, should profit by any such a course of dealing, or try to shift on to an innocent solicitor the entire burden of blame for what happened.\nIf the bidder imagined he was getting this property now in question he should have warned both the solicitor and others of the mistake which was being made.\nAnd if he did not, then neither he nor his principal has any right to gather to themselves the property in question.\nThe case of In re Thellusson[2] so much pressed upon us by counsel for appellant, if read aright, I submit, requires the dictum cited therefrom to be applied in this case conversely to his client instead of to the receiver; and the decision therein indicates that the receiver herein pursued the right course when after learning of the mistake as happened, instead of yielding, as he might have done, to please others at the expense of the parties whose rights it was his duty to guard.\nIn light of the consideration I have given the evidence and the argument presented the foregoing is all I need add to the reasons of Mr. Justice Galliher, speaking for the majority of the court below, in which, subject thereto, I agree.\nI am of the opinion that this appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDUFF J.\u2014It does not admit of doubt, I think, that the Supreme Court of British Columbia possessed authority to set aside the sale in question in this appeal; and that on a proper application by the purchaser he would, with the consent of the bank, have been relieved from his purchase on the ground that in the circumstances disclosed a refusal to do so would not have been consistent with fair dealing. But the present application for an order rectifying the deed raises considerations of a different order.\nThe plaintiffs in the bondholder's action in whose application the receiver was appointed were entitled to insist upon the terms of the order of the 20th July 1917 (under which the advances were made and by which the charge was created securing those advances) being observed; and that the sale should be proceeded by a proper public notice of the nature of the property offered. They were entitled to require that this term of the order framed for their protection should be carried out. The notice actually given was not intended to indicate the particular property in question as one of the parcels offered and it is hardly argued that it did so. It seems to follow that in the absence of some conduct on the part of the respondents precluding them from insisting upon their rights under the order the appellant is not entitled either technically, or as a matter of substantial justice, to have this parcel conveyed to him.\nIt is conceivable of course that evidence might have been offered shewing that the selling price could not have been affected by the fact of the parcel in question not being nominated in the advertisement as one of the subjects of the sale. If this were demonstrated and the opposition of the respondents shown to be merely vexatious a different question would have arisen. There is no such evidence nor are there any facts in proof giving rise to an equity precluding the respondents from insisting upon the protection which the order provides for.\nThe appeal must be dismissed with costs. ANGLIN J.\u2014The appellants have clearly made out a case of mistake on the part of both vendor and purchasers. They may even have established that the receiver was in some measure responsible for that mistake. They have not shewn, however, that a greater price might not have been obtained for the assets of the Lumber Company, had the omitted parcel of land been included in the particulars of sale. That that parcel had a very substantial value admits of no doubt on the material before us. It may well be that the purchasers would have been entitled to rescission on the ground of mistake had they sought that relief. But they appear not to have desired rescission\u2014possibly because they feared that on a re-sale they might not secure such an advantageous purchase. However that may be, what the appellants seek is rectification of their mistake. That can be effected only at the expense of the bondholders, represented by the respondent Marshall. The appellants have utterly failed to shew anything which raises an equity against the bondholders such as might have enabled the court to direct that the deficiency in the land which the purchasers believed they were acquiring should be made good by the receiver at the bondholders' expense.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nBRODEUR J.\u2014This is a bondholder's action brought by the respondents under a deed of trust and mortgage made in 1911 in their favour against the Canadian Pacific Lumber Company. A receiver was appointed. The company went into liquidation and, by order of the court, in 1917, the receiver was empowered to borrow money from the Dominion Bank, the appellant, for the purpose of carrying on business; and it was provided in the order of the court that the receiver should issue certificates which were constituted a first charge upon the whole of the property and assets of the company and that in default of repayment the bank should be at liberty to sell the whole property at public auction.\nThe loan was made by the bank, certificates were issued. The loan not having been repaid, the property was offered for sale by public auction in one lot. Conditions and particulars of sale were prepared by the solicitors of the receiver and of the Dominion Bank. In the particulars of sale, however, lot 14 was not included because the solicitor for the bank then acting for the government had taken certain expropriation proceedings of this lot some years ago. Being under the impression that this lot was no more the property of the liquidated company and not being aware that these expropriation proceedings had been later on abandoned by the government, he failed to insert this lot, no. 14, in the particulars of sale amongst the assets to be sold.\nThis omission having been discovered after the date at which the sale was made to the London and Canadian Investment Company, a motion was made to the court for an order directing the receiver to convey the said lot 14 to the purchaser. This order was granted by the Supreme Court but was refused by the Court of Appeal.\nThere is no doubt that there was an intention on the part of the solicitor who drafted the particulars of the sale to include all the properties belonging to the liquidated company. But as he was under the impression that this lot did no more form part of the assets, it was not included. We have no means to find out whether the lot in question would have produced a larger price or not. The only evidence we have with regard to its value is that it is considerable.\nIt may be also, as is asserted by the manager of the purchasing company, that he was under the impression when he made his bid that he was purchasing the property in dispute, but we do not know whether the other interested persons had the same impression. It is a question of error and mistake; and it seems to me that the particulars of the sale are conclusive as to what properties were offered for sale.\nThe deed might be set aside for error; but I do not think it would be within the power and the duty of the court to give the to purchaser the lot which was not included in these particulars.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nMIGNAULT J.\u2014I concur with Mr. Justice Anglin.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants, The Dominion Bank: Tiffin & Alexander.\nSolicitors for the appellant, The London & Canadian Investment Company: Wilson, Whealler & Symes.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Davis & Company.\n[1] [1921] 3 W.W.R. 209 sub nom.

The document handed to the respondent was at the outset called \"this ticket\"; the words \"subject to the following conditions\" were found in the tenth line of a paragraph of small type; there was no heading such as \"conditions\"; the seventh paragraph stipulated that \"the company * * * (was) not * * * liable for * * * \"injury to the passenger * * * arising from the * * * \"negligence of the company's servants * * * or from other \"cause of whatsoever nature\"; at the end of a series of eleven distinct conditions, occupying sixty-six lines of small type closely printed, were the following words: \"I hereby agree to all the provisions of \"the above contract\"; and then blank spaces were provided for signatures by the purchaser and a witness. The ticket sold had been destroyed by the appellants, but the jury found that the respondent had not put her signature to it. The respondent also denied knowledge of any conditions relating to the terms of the contract of carriage. The respondent, in debarking from the steamer, was injured and sought damages from the appellant. The above facts having been proved at the trial, the jury found that the respondent knew there was printing on the ticket, but did not know that the printing contained conditions limiting appellant's liability and that the appellant did not do what was reasonably sufficient to give her notice of the conditions; and they found a verdict for her. Held, Davies C.J. dissenting, that there was evidence upon which the jury could properly find as they did and that judgment was properly entered for the respondent upon the findings. Richardson, Spence & Co. v. Rowntree ([1894] A.C. 217) discussed; Cooke v. T. Wilson, Sons & Co. (85 L.J.K.B. 888) distinguished.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia, affirming the judgment of Macdonald J. with a jury and maintaining the respondent's action.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions in issue are fully stated in the above head-note and in the judgments now reported.\nAlfred Bull, for the appellant.\u2014The words \"negligence of the company's servants\" include any act for which the appellants could be liable in law, as the company could only act through a servant. Ferguson v. Wilson.[1].\nThe general words \"or from any other cause of whatsoever nature\" should not be construed ejusdem generis with the particular words preceding them. Larsen v. Sylvester [2].\nThere was no evidence to support the jury's findings that the respondent did not know that her ticket contained conditions respecting exemption of liability and that the appellant company did not do what was reasonably sufficient to give the respondent notice of such conditions: Hood v. Anchor Line[3]; Cooke v. T. Wilson Sons & Co.[4]; Grand Trunk Railway Co. v. Robinson[5]; Sherlock v. The Grand Trunk Railway Co.[6]; Acton v. Castle Mail Packets Co.[7]. Geo. F. Henderson K.C. for the respondent.\u2014The mere handing of a ticket containing conditions, with nothing on the ticket to draw attention to its contents, does not constitute what is reasonably sufficient to give the passenger notice of such conditions: Henderson v. Stevenson[8]; Richardson, Spence & Co. v. Rowntree[9]; Clarke v. West Ham Corporation[10].\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014(dissenting)\u2014I find myself, after weighing fully the able argument at bar of Mr. Bull for the appellant and, after considering carefully the cases cited by him in support of the appeal, strongly of the opinion that the appeal should be allowed.\nThe Court of Appeal decided against the now appellant on the ground\nthat the fair inference that the jury found by their answers that there was negligence on the part of the company itself, apart from the negligence of its servants, and that it caused the accident or contributed to it.\nI have no doubt whatever that this ground for sustaining the judgment against the company cannot be upheld and on this point I find myself in full accord with the rest of my colleagues.\nThe main question, however, argued fully at bar and on which Mr. Bull relied was that the negative answers of the jury to questions 8 and 9, whether the plaintiff knew that her ticket contained conditions limiting the liability of the defendant company (8), and whether the company did what was reasonably sufficient to give the plaintiff notice of such conditions (9), were contrary to the evidence and must be set aside. In my opinion the appeal turns upon the answers of the jury to question (9), namely, whether the company did what was reasonably sufficient to give the plaintiff notice of such conditions.\nThe jury found also that the plaintiff did not sign the ticket covering her passage from Prince Rupert to Stewart in British Columbia, and while I should be otherwise personally inclined to hold the contrary, I am not disposed on this point to interfere with this finding of the jury and will deal with the case on the ground I have before mentioned and on the assumption that the ticket was not signed.\nI think it clear from all the decided cases cited to us, which I have carefully read and considered, that no arbitrary or definite rule can be or has been laid down governing the question whether the ticket-holder must be held to have known the conditions, if any, on the ticket he purchased. It is purely a question of fact in each case and the findings of the jury will not be interfered with on the fact unless found to be clearly contrary to the evidence.\nMuch depends upon the question whether the purchaser of a ticket was an ignorant and illiterate person unaccustomed to travel, in which case a heavy onus would be cast upon a company of bringing to his or her notice the limitations of their liability as a carrier of passengers, or, on the contrary, whether the purchaser of the ticket was a person of education, intelligence and experience, in which case on having the ticket put in front of him he ought to have seen that he had what he had applied for, namely a passenger contract, and having seen that ought to have seen that he was entitled to a berth, if that was included, subject to the conditions on the ticket, and having seen that ought to have seen all the rest. Of course if the ticket handed the passenger was folded up, or enclosed in an envelope, it would, or might, under the facts of the case, limit his duty of seeing the conditions of his contract. Indeed there are many other facts and circumstances which the authorities mention which might dispense with or qualify his strictly conforming to that duty.\nBut in the absence of any such facts and circumstances as in the case before us, it does seem to me clear from the authorities that an educated and intelligent person accustomed to travel and looking after herself as the plaintiff in this case undoubtedly was, must, on purchasing a ticket as the plaintiff did in this case, with conditions on its face limiting the company's liability for her carriage, be held bound to have known what these conditions were.\nThe facts were that the plaintiff's journey was in reality from Seattle to Stewart, but was broken at Prince Rupert, and she indentified Exhibit 3 (the form of ticket issued by the company) as similar to that which she had purchased in Seattle covering her passage to Prince Rupert, which ticket she admits she signed. She was unable to say definitely that she did not sign the ticket which she afterwards purchased in Prince Rupert covering her passage to Stewart, but having signed the ticket in Seattle it must follow that she knew not only that the ticket contained conditions, but, moreover, the effect of such conditions and having admitted the similarity of the two it follows that she must have known, whether she signed it or not, that the ticket in question contained conditions. The plaintiff was a woman of education and itelligence; her husband was a lawyer and for some years police magistrate of Nanaimo; she had travelled considerably, and during the war travelled from British Columbia to Nairobi, Africa, and back, by herself, and formed a habit of looking at her transportation tickets to ascertain that her destination was correctly stated; she probably did so in respect of her ticket to Stewart; she knew that tickets of that nature usually contained conditions as to loss of baggage; there was no rush, no crowd at the wicket, when she bought her ticket a day or two before the sailing date; she at the same time arranged about her cabin. All this she stated in cross examination and there is no conflict of evidence as to the facts on which the appellant relies.\nNow the ticket given the plaintiff was an exact counterpart of Exhibit 3, which was put in evidence, and which we had the opportunity of examining carefully. It is a long piece of greenish coloured paper, about 10 inches long and two inches broad headed thus:\nGRAND TRUNK PACIFIC COAST S.S. CO. LTD.\nFORM 32.\nPRINCE RUPERT, B.C.\nTO\nDESTINATION NAMED ON FINAL COUPON\nIt is agreed that this ticket is good only when officially stamped, dated and presented with coupons attached for one first class passage * * *subject to the following conditions:\nthen follow the eleven conditions, no. 7 of which contains the limitations of the company's liability relied on. But that was not all. The coupons attached state in large print the place of departure, leaving blanks for the place of destination to be written in, the date and the number of the stateroom, and what is more important, printed in clear type on its face\nincluding meals and berth when officially stamped and dated, and on conditions named in the contract.\nSo that we have this \"large plain piece of paper put before a lady of intelligence\" who is going to be a first class passenger on board of this ship, stating not only in its opening sentence,\nit is agreed that this ticket is good only when officially stamped, dated and presented with coupons attached for one first class continuous passage * * *subject to the following conditions,\nbut having the same notice printed in clear easily read type on the coupon itself \"on conditions named in the contract.\"\nTo lay it down as law that under these proved facts and circumstances the ticket purchaser, a woman of intelligence and education, who had travelled extensively, could by simply not reading, or saying she had not read, her ticket contract and did not know its conditions, avoid the effect of those conditions and recover damages for injuries she sustained during the voyage arising from the negligence of the defendant company's servants, from which the ticket contract plainly exempted them from liability is, in my humble opinion, contrary to the decisions of the highest courts of law in England which by the very terms of the contract were to govern in this case.\nI think it a dangerous rule to lay down and under the facts of the present case I must decline being a party to it.\nThe cases on which I rely and which I have carefully read, especially that of Cooke v. Wilson & Co.[11], confirm me in my opinion. This case is singularly alike in its facts and almost on all fours with the present appeal. I am quite unable to distinguish it in any material way from the case we are considering.\nThe other cases are Hood v. Anchor Line[12] in which Lord Haldane delivering the judgment of the Judicial Committee said:\nWhen he accepted a document that told him on its face that it contained conditions on which alone he would be permitted to make the journey across the Atlantic aboard steamer, and then proceeded on that journey, I think he must be treated according to the standards of ordinary life applicable to those who make arrangements under analogous circumstances and be held as bound by the document as clearly as if he had signed it.\nAnd Richardson, Spence & Co. v. Rowntree[13] where a distinction is drawn between a ticket handed to a steerage passenger, a class of people as said by Lord Ashbourne\nof the humblest description, many of whom have little education and some of whom have none.\nand such a ticket not folded up handed to a passenger of intelligence and education such as the plaintiff herein.\nUnder all the circumstances, I conclude that on the question of reasonable notice having been given to the plaintiff, the answer must be in the affirmative.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014This action was brought by the respondent to recover damages suffered by her for which it seems quite clear the appellant would be liable unless protected by the terms alleged to be conditions in the contract for transportation from Prince Rupert to Stewart.\nThe alleged conditions were printed in small type and numbering eleven in all, without any notice calling attention thereto. The appellant evidently had adopted a system of requiring the passenger to sign these conditions and having the signature witnessed as the only means of bringing home to the mind of any intending passenger the terms upon which he or she should be carried.\nThe usual test of whether or not the carrying company had done all that was reasonably sufficient to give the intending passenger notice of the conditions upon which he or she was to be carried, as exemplified in the cases cited to us cannot be applied to this case for they are non-existent.\nNeither notice of the ticket being subject to the conditions thereon printed, or usual warning of any kind, appears in this case to have been adopted.\nThe appellant must therefor rely upon proof of the signature of the respondent which is expressly negatived by the finding of the jury, as is also knowledge of the conditions.\nThe further question was put by the learned trial judge to the jury, and answered in the negative:\u2014\n9. If not, did the defendant company do what was reasonably sufficient to give the plaintiff notice of such conditions? A. No.\nThe jury, I think, were, under such facts and circumstances as in evidence, fully entitled to take that view. Possibly I might not have reached such a conclusion, but I cannot say they had no evidence entitling them to so find.\nThe evidence of the respondent's intelligence on the subject of travel and its attendant conditions was not, to my mind, according to her evidence, of the extensive character counsel seemed to urge, if we apply common sense to what she says. Holding as I do that this case is quite distinguishable from the cases of Cooke v. Wilson[14]; Hood v. Anchor Line Ltd.[15] and many others, I am of the opinion that the appellant should not succeed in face of the findings of the jury as applied to this peculiar case, and, therefore, have not considered fully the ground proceeded upon by the Court of Appeal.\nIf that is not sound reasoning then on the facts in evidence it ought to be made the law that a steamship company should not be permitted to turn out or invite passengers to land on such a dock as the one in question, (publicly claimed by its owner, as it seems to have been, to be in a dilapidated condition) without taking due care.\nI think the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDUFF J.\u2014I concur with Mr. Justice Anglin.\nANGLIN J.\u2014The plaintiff in debarking, by invitation of the defendants, from their steamer, on which she was a passenger, on a wharf admittedly in a highly dangerous state of disrepair, was seriously injured. The immediate cause of her injury was stepping into a hole, which she failed to see at the end of the gangway, and slightly to the right, while endeavouring to avoid stepping into another hole to the left. The jury found\u2014and their finding is not open to serious question indeed it was scarcely challenged\u2014that there was negligence dans locum injurioe on the part of the defendants in permitting the plaintiff to land on a wharf known to be dangerous. The duty of a carrier of passengers to provide a reasonably safe place for them to debark admits of no dispute. It is part of the obligation ordinarily undertaken in the contract of carriage. The defendants seek to escape liability by invoking an exemption stipulated in the terms of the special contract upon which they allege the plaintiff travelled. In answer to this defence, the plaintuff urges (a) that the defendants cannot raise it because they failed to give the public notice of the conditions excluding their liability prescribed by s. 962 of the \"Canada Shipping Act\" (R.S.C. 1906, c. 113); (b) that upon their true construction these conditions, if binding upon the plaintiff, do not cover the negligence complained of; (c) that the plaintiff was not bound by the conditions, because she was unaware of them and adequate means had not been taken by the defendants to bring them to her attention.\n(a) This reply to the defence was not pleaded, nor, so far as appears, raised at the trial. The question of public notice was not threshed out. Assuming that s. 962 of the \"Canada Shipping Act\" bears the construction put upon it by counsel for the plaintiff, which is at least debatable, the defendants would probably have reasonable ground to complain if it were now held to preclude them from invoking the conditions on which they rely.\n(b) The Court of Appeal held that the negligence found was that of the plaintiff company itself as distinguished from that of its servants and that upon its true construction the exemption from liability stipulated by the terms printed on the ticket issued to the plaintiff is confined to negligence attributable to the defendants' servants. With great respect, I gravely question the soundness of the view taken on both points. I incline to think that the failure to select for the placing of the gangway a part of the wharf on which a landing could be made with reasonable safety, if such a spot existed, or, if not, to take other adequate precuations to ensure the plaintiff's landing safely was fault ascribable to the company's servants charged with the management of the debarkation of passengers. Upon the construction of the relieving condition itself, while negligence of servants is no doubt specified, the exemption is also in respect of\ninjury to the passenger * * * through any other cause of whatsoever nature.\nIn view of the context there would seem to be difficulty in applying the ejusdem generis rule of construction to these comprehensive words so as to give them the restricted effect for which the plaintiff contends.\n(c) But the jury also found that, while the plaintiff knew there was writing or printing on her ticket, she did not know that it contained conditions limiting the defendant's liability and that they had failed to do what was reasonably sufficient to give her notice of these conditions. On this branch of the case the question to be considered is whether these findings are so clearly against the evidence that they should be set aside as perverse.\nAs to the finding of ignorance in fact there can be no doubt. The plaintiff expressly denied knowledge, and there is nothing to warrant rejecting her testimony accepted by the jury.\nAs to the other finding, the jury explicitly found that the plaintiff had not signed the ticket, as the form used contemplated (places being indicated upon it for signatures of the purchaser and of a witness) and the company's agent deposed was the practice. The plaintiff's recollection was that she did not sign\u2014was not asked to do so. The selling agent had no recollection on the point. It would be quite impossible to disturb the finding that the ticket had not been signed. There is no suggestion that the plaintiff's attention was drawn to the conditions in any other way than by handing her the ticket itself when she bought and paid for it. She deposed that although she knew there was printed matter upon the ticket, she had not read it beyond noting that her destination was correctly written in on the attached coupon. She knew from a former experience that conditions limiting liability in respect of luggage were sometimes imposed, but nothing as to conditions in respect of personal injuries. This idiosyncracy, however, having been unknown to the defendant's ticket agent need not be further considered here, Marriott v. Yeoward[16]. Can it be said upon these facts that the finding of the jury that what took place was not reasonably sufficient to give the plaintiff notice of the conditions was so clearly perverse that we should set it aside, make a finding to the contrary and direct judgment for the defendants?\nThe case at bar closely resembles the leading case of Richardson, Spence & Co. v. Rowntree[17]. There, as here, the plaintiff was a woman, though probably of a less intelligent class; she was a steerage passenger. The restrictive conditions were printed in small type on the face of the ticket, and without anything, such as the word \"NOTICE\" in large type, featured in Hood v. Anchor Line[18], to draw attention to them. The only other possibly distinguishing feature in the Rowntree Case[19] is that the ticket was handed to the passenger folded up Here we are not informed whether the ticket was open or folded up, or enclosed in an envelope, when handed to the plaintiff. From its length and their common knowledge of what is customary the jury not improbably inferred that it was folded up and possibly also that it was placed in an envelope. The judgment of the Court of Appeal in Rowntree's Case[20], refusing to set aside the jury's findings, that the plaintiff did not know that the ticket contained conditions relating to the terms of the contract of carriage and that the defendants had not done what was reasonably sufficient to give the plaintiff notice of the conditions, and upholding the judgment entered on them for the plaintiff, was affirmed by the House of Lords without calling upon counsel for the respondent. Their Lordships declined to hold that upon such facts the plaintiff was bound as a matter of law by the conditions. The questions whether the passenger knew of the conditions limiting liability and, if not, whether the means taken to bring them to her attention had been reasonably sufficient, were held to be proper in such a case for submission to the jury. This case was much relied on by counsel for the plaintiff.\nCounsel for the defendants on the other hand contended that the case at bar is indistinguishable from the later case of Cooke v. T. Wilson Sons & Co. Ltd.[21] in which the Court of Appeal, while recognizing the authoritative character of the decision in Rowntree's Case,[22] held that, upon the facts in evidence, the finding of the jury that the defendants had not done what was reasonably sufficient to give the plaintiff notice of the conditions was so clearly perverse that it should be set aside and that judgment should be entered for the defendants. Roberta Cooke was \"a lady of intelligence\" \u2014\"a first\u2014class passenger\"\u2014 \"a lady of education\"\u2014facts\nwhich must have been obvious to the people who handed her the ticket.\nThe following three circumstances in connection with the ticket itself are dwelt upon by Lord Justice Phillimore, who delivered the principal judgment. The ticket did not describe itself as a \"ticket\" or \"receipt\" but was headed \"Passenger Contract\". In the first line and in very plain letters were the words \"Mrs. Cooke is entitled, subject to the conditions hereof\". The conditions themselves immediately followed in small but legible type, similar, I take it, to that in the case at bar, but under the heading \"Conditions\" There appears to have been nothing to indicate that signature by the passenger, to evidence her acceptance of the conditions, was contemplated, as it clearly was in the case at bar. Lord Justice Phillimore points to the several features of the ticket I have mentioned as calculated to draw the attention of the passenger to the fact that she was taking a \"passenger contract\" for carriage subject to conditions printed on the ticket. Pickford L.J. agreeing states that, the proper question being formulated, the answer to it becomes a question of fact in each particular case and adds:\nAll I say is that upon the particular facts of this case, in my opinion, the defendants took sufficient and proper means to bring these conditions to the notice of the plaintiff.\nNeville J., the other member of the court, said:\nIf all the cases are to be taken into consideration * * * the degree of notice necessary depends upon the degree of capacity of the recipient. I take it the learned judge must have meant\u2014as it was, or should have been, apparent to the defendants' agent when selling the ticket to the passenger. His Lordship also explicitly restricts his holding to\npassenger contracts of the character of the one before him.\nWhile it may be assumed that in the case now before us there was nothing to indicate to the defendants' ticket agent that the plaintiff might not be dealt with as a person endowed with a degree of intelligence not inferior to that of the plaintiff in the Cooke Case,[23] the features of the \"passenger contract\" in that case pointed out in the judgment of Phillimore L.J. as calculated to bring the conditions to the passenger's attention are entirely absent here. The document handed to the present plaintiff is at the outset called \"this ticket\": the words \"subject to the following conditions\" are found only in the tenth line of a paragraph of small type: and there is no heading such as \"conditions\". At the end of a series of eleven distinct conditions, occupying sixty-six lines of small type closely printed, occur the words\nI hereby agree to all the provisions of the above contract and attached coupons.\nSignature.\nWitness.\nThe provision thus made for signatures by the purchaser and a witness might well give to the plaintiff, or to any ordinary traveller of her class, the impression that the printed matter above the line indicated for purchaser's signature was not intended to apply to her\u2014did not concern her\u2014since she had not been asked to affix her signature to it. It is, I think, quite impossible to say that the decision in the Cooke Case[24] conclusively establishes that in the case at bar what the defendants did was reasonably sufficient to bring the conditions printed upon the ticket to the notice of the plaintiff as something by which she would be bound.\nAnother case relied on for the appellant was Acton v. The Castle Mail Packets Co.[25], where Lord Russell of Killowen quotes with approval from the judgment of Mellish J. in Parker v. South Eastern Railway Co.[26], the statement that where the agreement is not signed\nthere must be evidence independently of the agreement itself to prove that the (plaintiff) has assented to it;\nand also the following passage from p. 422:\nI am of the opinion that we cannot lay down as a matter of law either that the plaintiff was bound or that he was not bound by the conditions printed on the ticket from the mere fact that he knew there was writing on the ticket but did not know that the writing contained conditions.\nIn the Acton Case[27] the plaintiff was\nan intelligent man who had gone about the world\nand, in the opinion of the Lord Chief Justice, ought to have known that conditions would necessarily be attached to the passage he was engaging.\nIn the circumstances of this case (said his Lordship) the plaintiff ought to have assumed, and I think he must have known that (the ticket) probably did contain conditions upon which he was about to be carried.\nSitting as a trial judge without a jury, Lord Russell reached the conclusion that, as a matter of fact * * * the communication of that document to him was (in the circumstances of this case) reasonable notice to him of the terms and conditions upon which his passage money was received from him and upon which the defendants were willing to enter into a contract to carry him.\nThe conclusion reached apparently depended almost entirely upon the impression created by the appearance and demeanour of the plaintiff and his business experience upon the mind of the learned trial judge that he must have appreciated the fact that the printing upon the ticket contained conditions to bind him as terms of the contract of carriage.\nIn Hood v. Anchor Line[28] another case cited for the appellant, it is made abundantly clear that the question with which we are now dealing is one of fact which must be submitted for determination by the tribunal of fact, the function of the judge, where there is a jury, being simply to see that the proper question is considered by them and the duty of the jury being to determine it, looking at all the circumstances and the situation of the parties. The burden is on the defendant to shew that it has done all that could reasonably be required to bring the limitative conditions to the plaintiff's notice\nunder the usages of proper conduct in the circumstances.\nEmphasis was laid in Hood's case upon two facts:\u2014 Above the conditions was printed\nNOTICE: This ticket, is issued to and accepted by the passenger subject to the following conditions.\nAt the foot of the document was printed very plainly in capital letters \"PASSENGERS ARE PARTICULARLY REQUESTED TO CAREFULLY READ THE ABOVE CONTRACT\" and on the face of the envelope containing the ticket was again printed, also in capitals \"PLEASE READ CONDITIONS OF THE ENCLOSED CONTRACT\". The case was tried without a jury and their Lordships of the House of Lords agreed with the conclusion of the trial judge, affirmed by the Court of Sessions, that the company had done all that was reasonably necessary to give notice to the plaintiff of the conditions limiting its liability. Their Lordships again pointed out that the questions under consideration were questions of fact which must in each case be determined according to the circumstances in evidence.\nThe principles to be applied in determining the question of fact which we are considering are well stated by Pickford J. in Marriott v. Yeoward Brothers[29].\nIn dealing with a case such as this it is well to bear in mind the observation of Viscount Haldane in Kreglinger's Case[30] that\nwhen a previous case has not laid down any new principle, but has merely decided that a particular set of facts illustrates an existing rule, there are few more fertile sources of fallacy than to search in it for what is simply resemblance in circumstances, and to erect a previous decision into a governing precedent merely on this account. To look for anything except for the principle established or recognized by previous decisions is really to weaken and not to strengthen the importance of precedent. The consideration of cases which turn on particular facts may often be useful for edification, but it can rarely yield authoritative guidance.\nThe only principles established by the cases to which we have been referred in regard to the question whether the carrier has done what was reasonably sufficient to bring conditions limiting its liability printed upon a ticket to the attention of a purchaser, who does not acknowledge acceptance of them by his signature and has not read them and does not know them to be such conditions, are that it is always a question of fact to be determined in each particular case according to the particular circumstances of that case and that the burden of proof is on the carrier.\nTaking into account all the circumstances in evidence as above detailed, I am not prepared to say that the conclusion of the jury (who had the great advantage of seeing and hearing the plaintiff give her evidence) that the company had failed to discharge the onus of proving that it had done what was reasonably necessary to bring the conditions relied upon to her attention as something by which she was to be bound was so clearly perverse that it should be set aside. Having regard to the facts that the purchaser of the ticket was a woman, presumably of limited business experience and knowledge, that the ticket itself presented nothing calculated to draw her attention to the fact that the printed matter upon its face contained conditions of a contract of carriage by which it was intended that she should be bound (such as the features noted in the Cooke Case[31] and the Hood Case[32], and to the further fact of the indication on the face of the ticket of the intention of the company that it should be signed by the purchaser as evidence of acceptance of the conditions printed upon it, it seems to me that a jury could reasonably conclude that it was incumbent upon the defendants to do something more than the evidence discloses was done in this case to direct the plaintiff's attention to the conditions.\nIndeed when the facts are analysed we have merely the case of a ticket containing printed conditions not at all conspicuous being sold to a woman of ordinary intelligence. In Cooke's Case [33], so much relied upon by the appellants, Lord Justice Pickford expressly repudiates the idea\nthat in every case it is enough to give a person who can read and write a document which he can read.\nI would, for these reasons, dismiss this appeal with costs.\nBRODEUR J.\u2014The jury in this case found that the appellant company was guilty of negligence\nin permitting the plaintiff to land on a wharf known to be dangerous and in not providing a step from the end of the gang plank to the wharf.\nIt is contended, however, on the part of the steamship company that the ticket on which Mrs. Simpson travelled contained a provision that the company would not be liable for the negligence of the company's servants and that the accident of which she was the victim was due to the negligence of its servants. It is contended also that the accident having taken place on a wharf which was common government property it was not liable.\nOn the latter point I am of opinion that the company's contention is not well founded. The wharf was, it is true, in a dangerous condition, but it was the duty of the company and was part of its obligations arising out of its transportation contract to see that its passengers should be landed in a safe place.\nAs to the conditions stipulated on the ticket, I may say that the form of the ticket requires that the purchaser should sign and accept those conditions before a witness. The ticket sold in this case was destroyed by the company and could not be produced. The jury found on somewhat conflicting evidence that Mrs. Simpson never affixed her signature to the document. It was found also by the jury that she was aware that there was something written on the ticket but that she did not know it contained the conditions on which the defendant company relies and that the latter did not do what was reasonably sufficient to give the plaintiff notice of such conditions.\nIn this connection the defendant company claims that there was no evidence to support the jury's findings.\nI am unable to accept such a contention for a great deal of evidence was adduced with regard to the issuing of this ticket and the jury was absolutely justified in making those findings.\nThe appellant relied very much on the case of Cooke v. Wilson [34]. That case has some features resembling very much the facts we have to deal with in this case, but there is some difference which permits us to distinguish it. The ticket issued in the Wilson Case [35] contained in large type the word \"contract\" which should have immediately drawn the attention of the passenger.\nAll these cases which have been quoted present different aspects and features and shew that each case should be decided on its own merits.\nIt is therefore a matter for the jury to determine whether the circumstances shew that the purchaser was aware of the conditions contained in the ticket and whether the carrier has done what was sufficient to give the passenger notice of conditions. I have come to the conclusion that the verdict of the jury was right and for this reason the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nMIGNAULT J.\u2014I concur with Mr. Justice Anglin.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Tupper & Bull.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Barnard, Robertson, Heisterman & Tait.\n[1] 2 Ch.

(1909) art. 7325.\nThe appellant, while working on a machine by feeding cotton into it between two rollers, had both hands caught and crushed necessitating their amputation. The maximum compensation under the \"Workmen's Compensation Act\" was admitted by the respondent company: but the appellant claimed a greater compensation under article 7325 R.S.Q. on the ground of \"inexcusable fault\" of the respondent especially in not having provided the machine with protection devices. The respondent had installed an apparatus of wire for stopping the machine within four seconds. No other safety device was supplied by the manufacturers of the machine. Although the practicability of a certain guard may have been established at the trial, the respondent company, having an expert engineer continuously working at the discovery of new safety devices, had found none suitable for this machine. The provincial government inspector had never given to the respondent any notice to provide a safety guard. A somewhat similar accident had previously happened in the defendant's factory but no evidence was adduced as to the exact cause of that accident.\nHeld, Idington J. dissenting, that the \"inexcusable fault\" of the respondent company had not been established. Per Idington J. (dissenting).\u2014The appellant was ordered to do a dangerous work, of which he had no experience, without being given any instructions in contravention with the company respondent's own regulations; and, also, there were existing protection devices in use when the Calendar machine, or its principle, was applied to doing other work than the one done in respondent's factory.\nJudgment of the Court of King's Bench (Q.R. 32 K.B. 44) affirmed, Idington J. dissenting.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King's Bench, appeal side, Province of Quebec[1] reversing the judgment of Surveyer J. and dismissing the appellant's claim for augmentation of the maximum compensation under the \"Workmen's Compensation Act.\"\nThe material facts of the case are fully stated in the above head-note and in the judgments now reported.\nCharlemagne Rodier K.C. for the appellant.\u2014There is an \"inexcusable fault\" of the respondent company: as the appellant had no experience in the work he was ordered to do; the machine was dangerous; the appellant had received no previous instructions; there were no protection devices; the floor was slippery; there had been a previous similar accident.\nCharlemagne Rodier K.C. for the appellant.\nA. Chase-Casgrain K.C. for the respondent.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014This action is one brought under the \"Workmen's Compensation Act\" of Quebec. The plaintiff claimed not only the ordinary maximum compensation, which indeed was admitted by the defendant company, but alleging \"inexcusable fault\" on the part of the company claimed $25,000 damages for the injuries sustained by him. These injuries consisted of the loss of both his hands. They were caught and crushed in the machine which he was working, necessitating their amputation. For three months previous to the accident he had been working at the back of the same machine receiving the cotton as it passed through, but on the occasion of the accident he had been put to work at the front of the machine feeding the cotton into it between two rollers. The machine in question is called a Calendar and is electrically driven. It consists of two rollers of about 24\" (inches) in diameter which turn reversely on each other, and cotton in sheets or layers for the purpose of being pressed to an even surface is passed between them. They revolve at a maximum rate of about four revolutions per minute.\nThe \"inexcusable fault\" is alleged to have consisted mainly in the fact that the machine was defective in not having been provided with proper safety and protection devices for the workmen employed in running it. Other faults were alleged, but the absence of additional protective devices to those already provided was the main and chief one relied on and the only one in my opinion under which the plaintiff could hope possibly to succeed.\nTheir Lordships of the Judicial Committee in the appeal of Montreal Tramways Co. v. Savignac[2], stated as their opinion that\nit was unnecessary and probably undesirable to attempt a definition of inexcusable fault\nleaving the question to be determined in each case as it arose. If the plaintiff had suceeded in shewing that the work in which he was engaged when injured was dangerous work, and that there were other known protective devices for workmen engaged on Calendar machines of which the company could and should have known, and had neglected to provide, the question before us would have assumed an entirely different aspect. But the evidence seems clear that there were no other protective devices known or in use which the company could have or should have provided. As a fact the company had an engineer who was continually working, looking up new devices for safety apparatus. None so far had been found applicable to this machine. The manufacturers who supplied these Calendar machines did not provide any such additional safety device, other than the apparatus of wire for stopping the machine within four seconds. No evidence was given that any safety guard was in use anywhere on machines of the sort in question here. The government inspectors whose duty it is to see that employers were warned to guard dangerous machines when practicable had never given the defendant any notice to provide any additional safety guard on this machine, and I cannot find any evidence establishing that there was anywhere a practicable additional guard in existence or use which should have been known to the defendant company and installed by them.\nThe work in which the plaintiff was engaged was not specially dangerous work. On the contrary, I have had great difficulty in determining how the plaintiff could have had his hands drawn in between the rollers unless by gross carelessness or neglect on his own part. He was a workman who had been working on and about the machine which caused the accident for a period of about three months, although he had not previously to the day of the accident been employed in actually feeding the cotton between the slowly revolving rollers.\nUnder all the circumstances I cannot find \"inexcusable fault\" on the part of the company in not having provided an additional guard for the protection of the workmen feeding the cotton between the rollers.\nI would therefore dismiss this appeal.\nIdington J. (dissenting)\u2014The appellant having served as a shipping clerk for some years was given employment in one of the respondent's manufacturing shops by way of taking away from the rear of a Calendar machine pressed cotton which had passed through between the rollers of said machine.\nThe said machine consists of two rollers which are placed one above the other and each twenty-five inches in diameter at the rate of four revolutions a minute.\nIt was stated in argument and not denied and seems borne out by the evidence that a party engaged, as appellant was, when working at the rear of the machine, could neither see nor learn from where he stood when so engaged how the work was done of feeding the cotton into the front of the machine.\nHence the three months he was so engaged were of no service in way of instructing him how to feed the machine and the dangers to be avoided in doing so.\nHe was only twenty-five years of age when he was suddenly, on returning to work at one P.M. of the 3rd April, 1919, directed by the foreman over him to proceed to the front part of the machine and feed the cotton into it, and he obeyed the order so given. About half an hour after he had begun doing so his right hand was drawn in between the said rollers and in the effort to extricate it he slipped on the damp floor and so fell that his left hand also was drawn in between the said rollers.\nHis cries of distress arrested the attention of others and some one of them stopped the machine.\nAs a result of the accident both his hands had to be amputated and thus he is crippled for life.\nHe was given no instruction of any kind, or warning or help, as any young inexperienced beginner ought to have had, as is abundantly testified by more than one witness.\nThere was no guard or protective appliance of any kind in front of the machine. Such devices are in use in many ways and of different kinds when the Calendar machine, or its principle, is app\u00fced to doing other work than the particular kind done in respondent's factory. One witness pretends he has seen the like machine at work elsewhere when serving same purposes as in the respondent's shop and that without any guard other than the appliance used to stop the machine, which only proves how reckless some manufacturers can be.\nElectric current was the motive force used to operate the machine in question. It could be cut off by pulling a wire at the side of the machine, about three feet or more from where the appellant was standing when engaged at feeding the cotton into the machine.\nI am unable to understand people who refer to this as a safeguard or means of protecting the person engaged in feeding the machine. It obviously is not, and when once such a person's hands, or single hand, is drawn in he cannot even stop the machine. There had been a similar accident about eight months previously in the use of this machine, whereby the man engaged as appellant was, on the occasion in question herein, had lost part of his hand. Yet no means were actually taken by the respondent to apply any safeguard.\nApparently it is cheaper for people like respondent to pay the occasional small toll extracted from them by the terms of the \"Workmen's Compensation Act\" than to invent or apply any invention known to safeguard employees.\nThe appellant sued respondent for damages resulting to him and the learned trial judge held that there was inexcusable fault on the part of respondent leading to this accident and thus the $2,500 limit of the \"Workmen's Compensation Act\" was no bar to his recovery as if suing at common law. He assessed the damages on that basis at $17,500.\nI unhesitatingly agree with his finding that there was inexcusable fault.\nI am not so clear as to the finding of inexcusable fault having the necessary legal consequence of damages being recoverable to the full extent that would have been allowable had the \"Workmen's Compensation Act\" never been passed.\nI was tempted to think in the course of the argument here that there might be implied in the following quotation from the \"Workmen's Compensation Act\",\nthe Court may reduce the compensation if the accident was due to the inexcusable fault of the workman, or increase it if it is due to the inexcusable fault of the employer\nthe graduating of the scale of damages proportionately to the gravity of inexcusableness thus brought in question. However, though taking several objections in their factum to the measure of damages, counsel for the respondent do not present any such view or indeed any view we have given heed to here for many years past.\nEven when the amount exceeded that, we might, if trying the case or in sitting in appeal below have allowed; yet mistakes of that kind should not be entertained here and thereby encourage needless litigation.\nAgreeing, as I do, with Mr. Justice Tellier's view of the case, I think that possibly respondent missed a good chance when it failed to act on his suggested reduction.\nThe measuring of damages such as appellant has to endure by what a young man of twenty-five is earning to my mind is quite fallacious.\nAnd before parting with this case I cannot forbear quoting a sentence taken from the respondent's own regulations, which reads as follows:\nLes employ\u00e9s devront re\u00e7evoir de leurs contrema\u00eetres des instructions compl\u00e8tes avant de faire fonctionner aucune machine et ils devront bien comprendre ces instructions.\nIf the non-observance of this injunction had been properly and consistently acted upon I can hardly imagine respondent's foreman, who placed appellant where he met such disaster as in question herein, would have dared to venture on such a foolhardy step as ordering an ignorant and inexperienced youth to feed such a machine as in question, even if it had been protected or guarded as it was not.\nI would allow this appeal with costs throughout and restore the learned trial judge's judgment. Anglin J.\u2014The material facts sufficiently appear in the judgments delivered in the Court of King's Bench and in the opinion of my brother Mignault, in whose conclusions as well as his appreciation of the presentation of the appellant's case by Mr. Rodier I fully concur.\nOrdinary liability for the maximum compensation under the ''Workmen's Compensation Act\" having been admitted by the defendants, it is only necessary to consider the appellant's claim for augmentation of that amount under Art. 7325 (2) based on his allegation that the accident, in which he was very seriously injured, was due to \"inexcusable fault\" of his employer.\nIn Montreal Tramways Go. v. Savignac[3] their Lordships of the Judicial Committee said:\u2014\nIt is unnecessary and probably undesirable to attempt a definition of inexcusable fault.\nI shall not essay the formulation of a definition that is probably impracticable.\nThe only alleged fault on the part of the defendants which could with any degree of reasonableness be pressed as inexcusable was the omission to provide an efficient guard to prevent the hands of the operator being drawn into the Calendar machine at which the plaintiff was injured. The practicability of such a guard is perhaps sufficiently established by the evidence. But no guard was furnished by the manufacturer of the machine and there is no satisfactory evidence that such a guard was in use anywhere on machines intended for the purpose for which the machine in question was used. The Government Inspectors, whose duty it is to see that employers are warned to guard dangerous machines when practicable, had not notified the defendants to guard this machine. The evidence falls short of establishing that there was a practicable guard for it which was, or should have been, known to the defendants.\nAn accident, said to have been somewhat similar to that now under consideration, had happened in the defendant's factory some time before and the evidence warrants the inference that it must have been known to them. But the circumstances of this accident are not stated and it does not appear that it was due to a cause which the defendant could or should have provided against. For aught that is shewn this former accident may have been wholly due to carelessness on the part of the workman. Indeed, in the present case it is difficult to conceive how the plaintiff's hand could have been drawn between the rollers unless he was, at least momentarily, inattentive to what was an obvious danger. So obvious was it that it seems to me to be idle to attempt to found a charge of inexcusable fault on the placing of an adult of ordinary intelligence at the work to which the plaintiff was assigned, however limited his experience.\nHaving regard to all the circumstances the plaintiff in my opinion has failed to establish a case of inexcusable fault on the part of the defendants.\nBrodeur J.\u2014I concur with Mr. Justice Mignault.\nMignault J.\u2014Le savant avocat de l'appelant\u2014 qui a plaid\u00e9 sa cause avec beaucoup de talent et aussi avec une franchise qui lui fait honneur\u2014nous a fait remarquer que les honorables juges qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 saisis de cette cause se sont \u00e9galement divis\u00e9s. Ce qui explique peut-\u00eatre cette diff\u00e9rence d'opinion, c'est qu'indubitablement il y a eu faute de la part de l'intim\u00e9e, mais ce n'est pas l\u00e0 la question \u00e0 d\u00e9cider. Il s'agit de d\u00e9terminer si cette faute peut \u00eatre qualifi\u00e9e de faute inexcusable aux termes de l'article 7325 S.R.P.Q. (1909), et on peut la croire quasi-d\u00e9lictuelle au sens des articles 1053 et 1054 du code civil, sans en conclure qu'elle soit r\u00e9ellement la faute inexcusable dont parle l'article 7325.\nL'expression \"faute inexcusable\" nous vient de la loi fran\u00e7aise des accidents du travail. Dans un sens, toute faute est inexcusable par l\u00e0 m\u00eame qu'elle est faute. Mais le l\u00e9gislateur entend ici une faute d'une gravit\u00e9 exceptionnelle, quelque chose de plus qu'une faute m\u00eame lourde, on dit m\u00eame quelque chose qui se rapproche de l'intention criminelle (Dalloz, R\u00e9pertoire pratique, vo. Accidents de Travail, no. 226), et dans la discussion du projet de loi au s\u00e9nat fran\u00e7ais, on a propos\u00e9 cette expression comme rendant bien l'id\u00e9e du l\u00e9gislateur que la faute dont il s'agit devait \u00eatre d'une telle gravit\u00e9 qu'elle f\u00fbt sans excuse. En effet, on entend g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement par faute inexcusable une faute qui est plus pr\u00e8s du dol que de la faute lourde (Baudry-Lacantinerie, Louage, no. 2270). Il importe de tenir compte de l'origine de cette expression quand on se demande s'il y a eu, dans une esp\u00e8ce particuli\u00e8re, une faute inexcusable du patron ou de l'ouvrier.\nCela \u00e9tant dit, on peut se dispenser de d\u00e9finir cette faute. Le conseil priv\u00e9 d'ailleurs n'a pas voulu tenter cette d\u00e9finition dans la cause de Montreal Tramways Co. v. Savignac[4], et les circonstances varient tellement dans les esp\u00e8ces qui viennent devant les tribunaux qu'aucune formule ne pourrait \u00eatre imagin\u00e9e qui conviendrait absolument \u00e0 chacune de ces esp\u00e8ces. Le besoin d'une d\u00e9finition se fera moins sentir du reste si on peut indiquer certains \u00e9l\u00e9ments que l'on devra trouver dans chaque cas o\u00f9 l'on pr\u00e9tend que l'ouvrier ou le patron a \u00e9t\u00e9 coupable d'une faute inexcusable. J'accepte les \u00e9l\u00e9ments sugg\u00e9r\u00e9s par M. Sachet (Accidents du travail, 6e \u00e9d., tome 2, no 1439), et que l'honorable juge de premi\u00e8re instance consigne dans son jugement: 1\u00b0 volont\u00e9 d'agir ou d'omettre; 2\u00b0 connaissance du danger pouvant r\u00e9sulter de l'action ou de l'omission; 3\u00b0 absence d'une cause justificative ou explicative.\nEt j'ajoute qu'en exag\u00e9rant la faute du patron\u2014 il est peu probable qu'on exag\u00e8re celle de l'ouvrier et peut-\u00eatre \u00e0 bon droit\u2014on en arriverait facilement \u00e0 rendre la majoration de l'indemnit\u00e9 due \u00e0 l'ouvrier la r\u00e8gle au lieu de l'exception qu'elle doit \u00eatre sous l'empire de toute loi des accidents du travail. Car cette loi est fond\u00e9e sur l'id\u00e9e du risque professionnel (Fuzier-Herman, R\u00e9pertoire, vo. Responsabilit\u00e9 civile, nos. 1459 et suiv.), risque que le patron et l'ouvrier doivent assumer dans la mesure prescrite par le l\u00e9gislateur, et ce n'est que lorsque ce risque a \u00e9t\u00e9 augment\u00e9 par une faute inexcusable attribuable \u00e0 l'un ou \u00e0 l'autre qu'il convient de diminuer ou d'augmenter l'indemnit\u00e9 normale que comporte l'\u00e9valuation, dans les conditions ordinaires, de ce risque professionel.\nL'esp\u00e8ce que nous sommes appel\u00e9s \u00e0 juger me fournit l'occasion d'appliquer les principes que je viens d'exposer. B\u00e9langer, depuis longtemps \u00e0 l'emploi de l'intim\u00e9e dans le d\u00e9partement d'exp\u00e9dition des marchandises, n'\u00e9tait que depuis trois mois employ\u00e9 aux machines. Jusqu'au jour de l'accident il recevait, derri\u00e8re une machine connue sous le nom de \"calendar\", le coton destin\u00e9 \u00e0 \u00eatre enduit d'une couche de caoutchouc et qui passait entre de grands rouleaux ou cylindres tournant en sens inverse \u00e0 une vitesse au maximum de quatre r\u00e9volutions par minute. Ce jour-l\u00e0, vers une heure de l'apr\u00e8s-midi, l'employ\u00e9 qui faisait fonctionner cette machine, c'est-\u00e0-dire qui faisait passer entre les rouleaux une bande de coton large de quatre pieds, ayant manqu\u00e9 tout \u00e0 coup, le contre-ma\u00eetre le fit remplacer par B\u00e9langer. Ce fut un malheur pour celui-ci, car une demi-heure plus tard, il se faisait prendre d'abord la main droite et ensuite la main gauche entre les rouleaux, avec le r\u00e9sultat qu'on d\u00fbt lui amputer les deux mains. Il poursuit maintenant sous l'empire de la loi des accidents du travail, r\u00e9clamant l'augmentation de l'indemnit\u00e9 normale \u00e0 raison de la faute inexcusable de son patron. L'intim\u00e9e a pay\u00e9 \u00e0 l'appelant $2,500, le maximum de l'indennit\u00e9 normale, avec $99.45 pour les frais d'action. Toute la question maintenant est de savoir s'il y a eu faute inexcusable entra\u00eenant majoration d'indemnit\u00e9. La cour de premi\u00e8re instance, pr\u00e9sid\u00e9e par l'honorable juge Surveyer, a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 en faveur de l'ouvrier, jugeant qu'il y avait lieu de fixer l'indemnit\u00e9 comme si l'accident en question \u00e9tait r\u00e9gi par le droit commun, et elle a donn\u00e9 \u00e0 B\u00e9langer une augmentation d'indemnit\u00e9 de $15,000.00. Sur appel \u00e0 la cour du Banc du Roi, les honorables juges Martin et Greenshields ont d\u00e9cid\u00e9 qu'il n'y avait pas eu faute inexcusable du patron, le troisi\u00e8me juge, l'honorable juge Tellier, \u00e9tant d'un avis contraire, mais le juge Tellier a exprim\u00e9 l'opinion que l'indemnit\u00e9 devait tout de m\u00eame \u00eatre bas\u00e9e sur l'\u00e9chelle contenue \u00e0 la loi des accidents du travail, et il n'aurait accord\u00e9 au demandeur qu'une augmentation de $12,926.84. Il y a donc cette question subsidiaire \u00e0 r\u00e9soudre au cas o\u00f9 je serais d'avis que nous avons bien ici un cas de faute inexcusable du patron. J'ai dit qu'il y a eu indubitablement faute de l'intim\u00e9e, mais il ne faut pas se laisser influencer par cette faute au point de conclure \u00e0 l'existence d'une faute inexcusable qui est, je le r\u00e9p\u00e8te, l'exception sous l'empire de la loi des accidents du travail. Ainsi c'\u00e9tait une faute de mettre \u00e0 l'ouvrage sur cette machine un ouvrier inexp\u00e9riment\u00e9 dans ce genre de travail, sans lui adjoindre quelqu'un pour veiller \u00e0 ce qu'il s'y pr\u00eet de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 ne point s'exposer au danger, du moins pendant ses premiers essais. C'\u00e9tait encore une faute du patron si le plancher o\u00f9 se tenait B\u00e9langer \u00e9tait glissant comme il le pr\u00e9tend, mais d'autres t\u00e9moins le nient, ou si le coton qu'il devait faire passer entre les rouleaux pr\u00e9sentait des plis qui pouvaient saisir sa main et l'entra\u00eener avec le coton dans ces rouleaux. Mais il ne s'ensuit nullement que cette faute f\u00fbt inexcusable, et il ne peut r\u00e9sulter que confusion si on ne fait abstraction ici de la th\u00e9orie de la faute d'apr\u00e8s le droit commun, car nous sommes en pr\u00e9sence d'une loi qui y fait exception.\nPour savoir si dans l'esp\u00e8ce cette faute \u00e9tait inexcusable, il faut se rappeler encore ce que j'ai appel\u00e9 les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de M. Sachet. Y a-t-il eu en tout cela volont\u00e9 d'agir ou d'omettre, connaissance du danger pouvant r\u00e9sulter de l'action ou de l'omission, et absence d'une cause justificative ou explicative? Je ne le crois pas, du moins quant aux fautes que j'ai signal\u00e9es. Il y a eu imprudence, surtout en laissant travailler un ouvrier inexp\u00e9riment\u00e9, et cette imprudence, tout en \u00e9tant une faute, n'est pas une faute inexcusable au sens de la loi des accidents du travail.\nL'appelant a abandonn\u00e9 \u00e0 l'audition devant nous la faute qu'il imputait au patron de n'avoir pas pourvu \u00e0 un appareil pouvant amener l'arr\u00eat de la machine en cas d'accident. L'appareil, une broche \u00e0 la port\u00e9e de l'ouvrier, s'y trouvait et aurait immobilis\u00e9 les rouleaux dans l'espace de quatre secondes.\nMais l'appelant insiste et impute \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e une faute qu'il qualifie d'inexcusable, parce qu'elle n'aurait pas plac\u00e9 un appareil protecteur devant la machine pour emp\u00eacher que les mains de l'ouvrier n'y fussent entra\u00een\u00e9es, et cela d'autant plus qu'un accident semblable \u00e9tait arriv\u00e9 \u00e0 un ouvrier quelques mois auparavant, signalant ainsi au patron le danger que pr\u00e9sentaient ces rouleaux sans appareil protecteur.\nJe suis bien pr\u00eat \u00e0 reconna\u00eetre que si l'appelant pouvait dire que dans les autres usines on munit ces machines d'appareils protecteurs, ou qu'on peut facilement les en munir sans entraver le travail, et si l'accident ant\u00e9rieur avait \u00e9t\u00e9 connu du patron et faisait clairement voir le danger de laisser fonctionner ces machines sans ces appareils, on aurait r\u00e9uni les \u00e9l\u00e9ments dont parle M. Sachet, et partant il y aurait faute inexcusable.\nMais la lecture attentive de toute la preuve me convainc qu'il n'est pas d'usage de poser ces appareils protecturs sur des machines semblables. D'autres machines, comme celles qu'on trouve dans les buanderies, en ont, mais pas les rouleaux dont il s'agit ici. Et peut-on facilement les en munir sans entraver le travail? Cela ne me para\u00eet pas d\u00e9montr\u00e9. Des t\u00e9moins disent que les ing\u00e9nieurs de la compagnie ont mis la question \u00e0 l'\u00e9tude sans r\u00e9ussir \u00e0 trouver l'appareil dont parle l'appelant. Et il faut se garder d'affirmations comme celles que fait M. Guyon, sous-ministre du travail \u00e0 Qu\u00e9bec. Car si M. Guyon pouvait facilement fabriquer un tel appareil, comme il le dit, pourquoi n'en a-t-il pas ordonn\u00e9 l'installation avant l'accident, comme il avait le pouvoir de le faire? Nous trouvons dans ce cas, comme dans les esp\u00e8ces semblables, des gens qui apr\u00e8s l'\u00e9v\u00e9nement ont bien des suggestions \u00e0 faire. Le malheur, c'est qu'ils n'aient pas fait ces suggestions en temps utile; et en supposant qu'ils pouvaient eux-m\u00eames proposer un rem\u00e8de facile et pratique, rien ne d\u00e9montre que ce rem\u00e8de f\u00fbt connu de l'intim\u00e9e avant l'accident.\nReste l'accident arriv\u00e9 au nomm\u00e9 Hannah quelques mois avant l'accident de B\u00e9langer. J'ai lu attentivement la d\u00e9position de Hannah. Je ne trouve pas qu'il fasse voir comment l'accident lui est arriv\u00e9. Il a pu tr\u00e8s bien \u00eatre imprudent ou inattentif. Hannah faisait passer par les rouleaux le coton avec une couche de caoutchouc, B\u00e9langer y faisait passer le coton seul. Hannah se plaint de l'appareil pour faire arr\u00eater la machine, et pr\u00e9tend qu'il aurait d\u00fb y avoir un homme \u00e0 c\u00f4t\u00e9 de lui uniquement pour faire fonctionner cet appareil en cas d'accident. L'appelant ne se plaint plus de l'appareil qui immobilise les rouleaux. Hannah ne signale le besoin d'aucun autre appareil protecteur. En somme, en supposant que l'accident de Hannah et la cause de cet accident aient \u00e9t\u00e9 connus des officiers de l'intim\u00e9e, cela n'est pas d\u00e9montr\u00e9, il faudrait encore prouver que par cet accident l'intim\u00e9e a eu connaissance du danger possible et qu'elle avait le moyen de le pr\u00e9venir par des pr\u00e9cautions qu'elle a manqu\u00e9 de prendre. Dire que les rouleaux \u00e9taient dangereux pour un homme attentif, c'est une affirmation que le dossier ne permet pas de faire\nJe trouve donc qu'il y a eu dans l'esp\u00e8ce une faute, qui, si nous \u00e9tions sous l'empire du droit commun, donnerait heu \u00e0 l'application pleine et enti\u00e8re des articles 1053 et 1054 du code civil. Je ne crois pas cependant que cette faute soit la faute inexcusable dont parle la loi des accidents du travail. Et comme il s'agit d'une exception qu'admet cette loi dans l'\u00e9valuation de l'indemnit\u00e9 que l'ouvrier a droit d'avoir, il faudrait que je fusse convaincu que nous sommes dans le cas de cette exception pour \u00eatre en droit d'accorder l'augmentation d'indemnit\u00e9 que r\u00e9clame l'appelant.\nJe ne cite pas des d\u00e9cisions ant\u00e9rieures, car celles qu'on a invoqu\u00e9es sont des arr\u00eats d'esp\u00e8ce, et chaque cause a sa physionomie propre. Les pr\u00e9tentions de l'appelant ont \u00e9t\u00e9 soutenues avec beaucoup de talent, mais je les crois mal fond\u00e9es.\nJe renverrais l'appel avec d\u00e9pens.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: Charlemagne Rodier.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Casgrain, McDougall, Stairs & Casgrain.\n[1] Q.R. 32 K.B. 44.\n[2] [1920] A.C. 408.\n[3] [1920] A.C. 408.\n[4] [1920] A.C. 408.\n",

[1914] c. 109 s. 37.\nR.S.O. [1914] ch. 109 sec.37 provides that a person who makes lasting improvements on land under the belief that it is his own is entitled to a lien thereon for the enhanced value given it by such improvements or may retain it on making compensation to the owner.\nHeld, Idington and Duff JJ. dissenting, that a lessee of land with an option to purchase at the end of the term is not entitled to the benefit of this statute. As lessee he could not believe the land to be his own and the option does not warrant such a belief before it is exercised.\nThe lessee in such a case may obtain, as equitable relief, compensation for his improvements to the extent to which they enhanced the value of the land. His mistaken belief that the lessor owned the fee which he could acquire on expiration of the term was such a mistake of title as to bring him within the equitable doctrine applicable. To entitle the lessor to such compensation where the owner has not encouraged nor acquiesced in the expenditure therefor it is necessary that the latter must himself be asking some equitable remedy, but\nHeld, that in Ontario, in the common law action of ejectment and for mesne profits the compensation so made for improvements may be set off against the allowance for such profits.\nHeld also, that no compensation can be allowed for improvements made after the lessee was aware that the lessor\u2019s title was questionable.\nJudgment of the Appellate Division (47 Ont. L.R. 227) which reversed that on the trial (46 Ont. L.R. 136) varied.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario[1] reversing the judgment at the trial[2] in favour of the Appellants.\nThe material facts and the question of law raised on the appeal sufficiently appear from the above head-note.\nArmour K.C. and Bartlet K.C. for the appellants. The respondents are not entitled to the benefit of the Act. They could not have believed that the lessor had a title in fee.\nThe cases of Gummerson v. Bunting[3] and Bright v. Boyd[4] have no application. In both cases there was an actual purchase and justification for the belief that the vendor could convey the title.\nNor are they entitled to equitable relief. The belief in ownership is essential to this also. And there is no evidence that lasting improvements were made.\nIn any event no compensation can be granted for improvements made after respondents became aware of the lessor\u2019s want of title. Rodd K.C. and Fripp K.C. for the respondents. The appellants are stopped from disputing the claim as they must be held to have acquiesced in the placing of improvements on the land. The judgment of the trial judge should be restored.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014For the reasons stated by my brother Anglin, I am of the opinion that the judgment of the Appellate Division appealed from should be varied by striking out sub\u2011paragraph 2 of paragraph 3 and substituting a direction for a reference to ascertain (1) to what amount the plaintiffs are entitled for mesne profits; (2) by what amount the value of the property has been enhanced by reason of permanent improvements effected by the defendants before the 2nd of October, 1908; (3) what balance, (if any) the plaintiffs should recover as their actual damages.\nNo costs of main appeal.\nIDINGTON J. (dissenting)\u2014The result of this appeal and cross-appeal, in my opinion, should turn upon the question of whether or not section 37 of the Conveyancing and Law of Property Act, being chapter 109 of the Revised Statutes of Ontario, should govern the rights of the parties concerned.\nThat section reads as follows:\u2014\n37. Where a person makes lasting improvements on land under the belief that the land is his own, he or his assigns shall be entitled to a lien upon the same to the extent of the amount by which the value of the land is enhanced by such improvements; or shall be entitled or may be required to retain the land if the Court is of opinion or requires that this should be done according as may under all circumstances of the case be most just, making compensation for the land, if retained, as the Court may direct. I shall revert presently to the history of that enactment but meantime may be permitted to state the outline of the story out of or in relation to which its relevancy has to be considered.\nBy a lease of the 2nd February, 1903, the late Luc Montreuil demised to the Ontario Asphalt Block Company certain parcels of land for ten years at an annual rental of one thousand dollars a year, and thereby gave it an option to purchase same on giving six months notice during said period at the price of $22,000.\nThe said company thereby bound itself not only to pay said yearly rental but also to build a dock to cost not less than $6,000.00, which, if the option not exercised within said period, was to become the property of the said lessor.\nThe said lessee at once proceeded to erect upon said property a building and factory for the purposes of its business at a cost of eighty thousand dollars, or more, and the said dock at a cost much exceeding said $6,000.00 and added to such equipment, year by year, a great deal in way of improvement.\nAfter this expenditure it was discovered, in October, 1908, in regard to some other property which had been held by said lessor, upon an identical title by which part of that, covered by said lease and agreement, was held by him, that his title was found to be only that of a tenant for life and that the remainder would go to his children.\nHe made good to other purchasers by inducing appellants to release their claims therein.\nUpon learning of this, on the 2nd October, 1908, the respondent Asphalt Company\u2019s secretary wrote the said lessor as follows:\u2014 Windsor, Ont., Oct. 2nd, 1908.\nLuc Montreuil, Esq.,\nWalkerville, Ont.\nDear Mr. Montreuil:\u2014\nI understand that some question has arisen with reference to your right to sell the farm property at Walkerville, and it occurs to me that being the case, you should get from your children a confirmation of the lease that you made to The Ontario Asphalt Block Company, Ltd., of the premises they now occupy. In case of your death the children might repudiate the lease and as we have spent a very large sum of money on the building, etc., we would be obliged to hold your estate liable on your covenant for quiet enjoyment, in case any trouble arose, and all this can be avoided now by your getting from the children some documents confirming the lease.\nYours truly,\nO.E. Fleming,\nSecretary.\nAnd not receiving any reply again wrote him the following:\u2014\nWindsor, Ont., Dec. 24th, 1908.\nLuc Montreuil, Esq.,\nWalkerville, Ont.\nDear Sir.\u2014\nIt would be very much more satisfactory to us and also to yourself if you would have your children convey to you the property leased by you to the Asphalt Block Company, and under which lease you are bound to convey to them at the expiration of the lease.\nWe would feel very much more satisfied if you would do this.\nYours truly,\nO.E. Fleming,\nTreasurer.\nThe writer of said letters was called as a witness on the trial of this action brought by appellants to eject respondents from the possession of that part of said lands for which the said lessor had failed to get the said deed from appellants, as requested, and in course of his explanatory reason for writing said letters, testified as follows:\u2014 Mr. Rodd: You had made a large expenditure? A. Yes, and we had not any idea but what when we spent the first dollar on the property that we had purchased under the option we could not afford to spend the money without doing that.\nQ. You say that was the intention of the company from the outset? A. Yes.\nQ. Why did you take the lease instead of buying out-right at the first? A. Because $1,000 a year is less than 5% on the purchase price of $22,000, and in addition to that $22,000 meant a lot to us in establishing a plant of this sort.\nQ. At any rate that was the reason you wrote the letter? A. Yes.\nQ. Did you ever get any reply to those letters? A. No, no reply.\nQ. You were going to tell me what you had spent up to December 31st, 1912, on the plant? A. $159,126.18, and on the 31st December, 1917, $174,354.78.\nHIS LORDSHIP:\u2014And then you went on after the discovery; after 1908 you went on? A. Yes, my Lord, we had to take care of the business; it was a case of necessity.\nMR. RODD:\u2014What position would your client have been in if you had not gone on? A. We would not have been able to have taken care of the increase of business; business has to grow or go back; we could not stand still.\nThis evidence seems to have been overlooked by the court below when quoting part of the evidence given on cross-examination by the same witness, in the judgment appealed from.\nTaken together therewith and the other facts in evidence to which I will presently refer, I respectfully submit that it seems to me that the conclusion reached resting upon said cross\u2011examination is far from convincing.\nPassing meantime from that to relate what ensued, the respondent Asphalt Block Company continued in possession of said premises, enlarging and improving the factory so built, and in course of so doing making it quite evident that its owners were determined to enforce the option of purchase contained in the said lease. And in due course of time the respondent Asphalt Block Company served the lessor, on the 5th January, 1912, with notice pursuant to the terms of said option, that it intended to exercise the right to purchase said lands and premises according to the terms in the said lease provided, at the end of the said term of ten years.\nThe said notice recited the facts of the lease for ten years from the 2nd day of February, 1903; the going into possession; the option given of purchase at the expiration of said term upon giving six months previous notice in writing of its intention to do so.\nThe said lessor refused to carry out his agreement and the respondent Asphalt Block Company brought an action on the 10th February, 1913, for specific performance which was tried on the 27th of following May. Judgment was given therein directing specific performance of so much of the interest in said lands as the lessor could convey and allowing an abatement of price for what he could not convey, and damages for breach of his contract.\nOn appeal to the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario that judgment was modified as appears in the report of the case[5]. And an unsuccessful appeal therefrom to this court was heard in 1916.\nI understand counsel agreed in the statement that the reference directed thereby has never been proceeded with.\nLuc Montreuil, the said lessee when this case was before the said Appellate Division, as directed by that court, filed an affidavit shewing that he got a grant to himself of part of the lands covered by said lease in 1874 and giving in detail the ages of his children, from which it appears that the present appellants were each at the time of his making the lease in question over twenty-one years of age. They are shewn also to have made at his request conveyances of their interests to other purchasers from him of property held upon the same title as in question herein.\nThey also are shewn to have known of the improvements made by the appellant Asphalt Block Company, now in question, but never objected or in any way protested or warned the said company of their claim to be entitled to the remainder of said property, upon which they rest herein, asserting the right to eject the respondents from that part of the premises now in question.\nThe lessor and vendor Luc Montreuil, died in January, 1918.\nAnd in the following August, his children, the appellants, brought this action of ejectment.\nThe Asphalt Block Company, respondent, in reply set up the salient facts which I have set forth above and rely thereon, by way of counter claim, upon estoppel and seek a declaration to that effect, and next a declaration\nthat this defendant upon making proper compensation is entitled to retain the lands in question or in the alternative a lien thereon in respect of the improvements made under mistake of title as claimed in paragraph thirteen hereof.\nThe appellants joined issue thereon and the case went to trial before the late Chief Justice Falconbridge who gave effect to the latter contention. And in doing so of course rested entirely upon the section I have quoted above.\nThe First Appellate Division quoting, as already stated, the cross-examination of the secretary of the Asphalt Block Company, overlooking his examination in chief and, I respectfully submit, also overlooking the weight to be given the actual facts of such a large expenditure as made upon lasting improvements and all implied therein, and which testify, in my appreciation of fact, much more forcibly than the mere words, of doubtful import, upon which the Appellate Court relied, to the existence of the realities required by the statute, of belief in the efficacy of an option as a means or method of ownership.\nSuch is, I submit, the attitude which the court should hold in trying to solve the question of fact as to belief in ownership.\nAnd when we come to consider what the quality of ownership may be upon which such a belief may be reasonably founded, certainly we are not to bind him seeking relief under the statute in question to prove an actual absolute ownership or its equivalent, for then the statute would be rendered meaningless.\nWe may, first recalling that in our English law there is no such thing as any absolute ownership of land except in the Crown, properly turn to the many varying meanings which the word \u201cowner\u201d may present.\nWe find in Bouvier\u2019s Law Dictionary the following:\u2014\nOwner.\u2014He who has dominion of a thing, real or personal, corporeal or incorporeal, which he has a right to enjoy and do with as he pleases,\u2014even to spoil or destroy it, as far as the law permits, unless he be prevented by some agreement or covenant which restrains his right.\nSurely a man having an option to purchase can well believe himself such a person as therein and thus defined.\nClearly a man possessed of such an option as the opinion expressed in London and South Western Ry. Co. v. Gomm,[6] demonstrates, has an interest in land and the extent thereof may be demonstrated by the acts of the optionee evidencing this intention to exercise, long before the actual notice of acceptance as foundation for an assertion of belief in his ownership. The right of dominion over the land in respect of which he has such an option of absolute purchase is as absolute as any man may desire and the only question remaining, I submit, is whether or not at the time when he acts on his alleged belief, that is, under all the circumstances, an honest belief, in other words, an honest determination to exercise the option.\nThere are also cases cited in Stroud\u2019s Judicial Dictionary in which, though turning (in some of the cases cited) possibly on legislative interpretation, yet in the mode of reasoning adopted in disposing of. same, are worthy of note.\nThe judgments in the cases of Ramsden v. Dyson,[7] and Plimmer v. Mayor, etc., of Wellington,[8] may also be advantageously referred to for an elucidation of the principles upon which the courts of equity act in protecting the parties making improvements under the belief that they have such an interest in the property or right to acquire same, as entitles them to rely thereon in making substantial improvements.\nSurely one is, in such a case as presented herein, in just as good a position as the vendee paying a mere nominal deposit and that test seems to me to be important and ought to be observed as a guide, for such was the chief basis of the recognized law; and springing from that the doctrine so grew as to cover other like cases. Possibly prevention of fraud was the earlier basis.\nThe sole reason for the statement of the first part of the statute in question as it appeared in 36 Vict. c. 22, s. 1, was doubtless to render clear and of universal application by the imperative requirement of a statutory law, a doctrine developed in courts of equity and not so uniformly observed even there as was desirable, and seemed even to startle learned judges in common law courts. For example, though the doctrine had been enunciated and applied by the Chancellor of Upper Canada in the case of Bevis v. Boulton,[9] his successor, only four years later, in the case of Kilborn v. Workman,[10], refused to apply it, and nine years thereafter in the case of Gummerson v. Banting,[11], after reviewing many of the then leading cases in point, applied the doctrine.\nIn doing so it may be observed that he referred to the said Kilborn v. Workman10 and excused its non-application there by referring to the case of McKinnon v. Burrows, and mentioning that a later case in England had shown he was in error. The only McKinnon v. Burrows case I can find is a common law action in[12]\nClearly there was an error in failing to observe the English decision in the case of Bunny v. Hopkinson,[13] perhaps excusable if regard is had to the changed conditions from then to now. And, I submit, that the right therein recognized was no higher than the right of him possessed of an option upon which he might reasonably act and assert as a basis of honest belief in ownership as above defined.\nMy own impression is that there was another case in Ontario which in a more remarkable degree brought to public attention the want of uniformity in applying the law and led to the enactment of the first part of the clause now in question. I cannot find it reported, and my memory does not serve me to recall the name thereof. Illustrative, however, of the state of, even the judicial mind, in the common law courts, then being constrained to apply some equitable doctrines and procedure, I find the new enactment referred to as follows in the case of Carrick v. Smith[14], at page 399:\u2014\n36 Vic. ch. 22, O., declares that: \u201cin every case in which any person has made or may make lasting improvements on any land under the belief that the land was his own, he or his assignee shall be entitled to a hen upon the same, to the extent of the amount by which the value of such land is enhanced by such improvement.\u201d This is a very extensive protection, and perhaps it may be called very advanced legislation to give a lien in every case to a person who has made improvements, ments, even lasting improvements, on any land, under the belief that the land was his own.\nI think these several decisions and judicial expression show how much need there was for an enactment of the kind now in question not so much as an advancement in legislation, as the need of having the law well understood and of universal application.\nIt was much needed. It was introduced, I believe, by the late Hon. Edward Blake, a master of law and language, well knowing what he was about, and was aptly entitled\nAn Act for the protection of persons improving Land under a Mistake of Title.\nThe case of Gummerson v. Banting[15], cited above, is relied upon in the judgment appealed from to give herein the measure of relief which, in principle, was on all fours with the said enactment passed a couple of years after said decision. I am unable to distinguish the doctrine applied in the said decision, from the principle sought to be enforced by the enactment as it first stood. And all that was done thereafter was to add thereto by an enactment passed on the eve of the 1877 Revision of the Statutes of Ontario, which reads as follows:\u2014\nor shall be entitled or may be required to retain the land if the Court is of the opinion or requires that this should be done, according as may under all circumstances of the case be most just, making compensation for the land, if retained, as the Court may direct.\nIf justice is to be done in many cases in applying either the doctrine in Gummerson v. Banting,[16] or the statute of 1872, which in principle are, I think, identical, this addition was necessary, otherwise, innocent men might suffer unduly.The later enactment confers on the courts the power to avoid and avert such possible injustice.\nI think we have presented in this case a state of actual facts which call for such a legislative enactment, and that its efficacy should not be rendered futile or entirely nullified by reason of a witness hesitating under pressure of cross-examination to give the true and obvious meaning of what respondents claim and that too when at the very outset he had declared what he meant.\nI think the late Chief Justice Falconbridge was absolutely right and that his judgment should be restored.\nThe appeal should, I therefore hold, be dismissed with costs and the cross-appeal so far as seeking that alternative should be allowed with costs save so far as same increased by the contention that there never was a mere life estate but an estate tail or otherwise.\nI have not perhaps examined the lastly mentioned question as thoroughly as it may deserve. It seems, however, untenable and to have been abandoned since argument. DUFF J. (dissenting).\u2014The enactment to be considered, (sec. 37 R.S.O. ch. 109) is in these words:\n37. Where a person makes lasting improvements on lands under the belief that the land is his own, he or his assigns shall be entitled to a lien upon the same to the extent of the amount by which the value of the land is enhanced by the improvements or shall be entitled as may be required to retain the land if the Court is of opinion or requires that this should be done according as may under all the circumstances of the case be most just making compensation for the land, if retained, as the Court may direct.\nIt should first be noticed that the draftsman of this enactment has carefully avoided technical legal nomenclature. \u201cUnder the belief that the land is his own\u201d does not contain a single word (except the word \u201cland\u201d) having a definite legal meaning. The word \u201cowner\u201d itself is indeed a word of very flexible signification. Lister v. Lobley[17]; Phyn v. Kenyon,[18] United States of America v. 99 Diamonds[19]. The appellant company, that is to say the officers of the appellant company, believed that company was entitled to possession under a lease for a defined period under which the company had the right to make improvements and to remove them at the expiration of the term; and under it also the company was entitled to receive a conveyance of the fee simple from the lessor (who, it was believed, was the owner of the title in fee simple subject to the lease) upon the payment of a fixed sum of money and upon notice by the company exercising its option not later than a prescribed date. Treating the assumptions upon which all the parties were proceeding as facts, the company, it having been decided that the option should be exercised and the necessary moneys being available, had not only the necessary means within its hands but had all the necessary legal rights vested in it to acquire at its sole discretion the full title in fee simple. In a practical business sense the company was in control of the property. It could sell, investing the purchaser with not indeed a title in fee simple in possession, but the absolute right to acquire such a title on the payment of a specified sum of money. It had possession with full power to use the property for all the purposes of its business and particularly for the purpose of making the improvements over which the dispute arises. It may be open to argument whether or not the company so long as its option was not exercised, could by legal process prevent the lessor from transferring his title, but by exercising the option, that is to say, by binding itself to take the property on the stipulated terms, such a right would immediately become vested in it. A lessee invested with such a measure of control occupies a position which I think is not in any practicable way distinguishable (discarding of course the technical legal point of view) from that of a mortgagor in possession of property held by him subject to a mortgage securing a debt equal almost to the pecuniary value of the property and still less from a purchaser who has bound himself to buy but has paid only a small sum on account of the purchase money. In all these cases the person in possession has, subject to one condition, the payment of a sum of money, the same power of control over the property as that possessed by the owner in fee simple. If he makes improvements under the belief that his rights are in fact what they appear to be he does so in the belief that he possesses powers of control that will enable him to make full use of the improvements so long as his rights remain vested in him and which at the same time will enable him to transfer his powers and rights to another and on such transfer to obtain in the ordinary course the enhanced value of the property due to the improvements.\nI repeat, the language of the enactment is not lawyers\u2019 language, and construing the language according to the usage and understanding of men who are not lawyers I think the appellant company has brought itself within the condition expressed in the words above quoted.\nI am unable to agree that anything in Mr. Fleming\u2019s evidence creates any obstacle in the way of giving effect to this view. Mr. Fleming, a member of the bar, was being pressed on cross\u2011examination to give an answer which would involve an expression of opinion on a question of law, namely, the construction of the statute now under consideration. He gave the only answer that could be given, that is to say could properly be given if he was to answer the question at all; and in effect his answer is that he believed that the rights which the lease purported to give to the company were in fact vested in the company.\nThis is sufficient to dispose of the appeal. In view of the ground upon which, however, the majority of the court has proceeded I think it is important to make an observation or two upon the rule respecting the measure of damages in an action to recover mesne profits. In the American courts a rule has been adopted (the effect of which is stated in a well known text book Sedgewick on Damages, sec. 915) that the action for mesne profits is a liberal and equitable action and one which will allow of every kind of equitable defence and in particular that improvements made by the occupant may be the subject of set off. This is based upon reasoning derived in part from the rules of the civil law. But the reasoning is also based upon the supposed effect of earlier English decisions. The case principally relied upon in support of it, see Putnam v. Ritchie,[20] Jackson v. Loomis[21], is Coulter\u2019s Case[22] in which a set off was allowed of rent payable under a rent charge and the decision is explicitly put upon the ground that the disseisor might have recovered what he had paid in an action and the set off was allowed for the purpose of avoiding circuity of proceedings.\nThe American authorities appear also to proceed to some extent upon the analogy of the ancient real actions in which Mr. Sedgewick says, the set off was always allowed. Sec. 915. It would be profitless to follow the American authorities into this discussion. At common law damages were not recoverable in the real actions generally. They were recoverable in the assize, because it was regarded as a mixed action and by the Statute of Gloucester, VI Ed. I, this procedure was made applicable and this right given to the plaintiffs in real actions generally; Booth, Real Actions. But in ejectment which was a development of the old action of trespass de ejectione firmae damages, that is to say, damages in the nature of reparation for deprivation of possession or compensation for use and occupation were not recoverable prior to the statute of Geo. IV (I Geo. IV, c. 87 sec. 2); for this relief the plaintiff was obliged to resort to a supplementary action in trespass\u2014trespass for mesne profits. And the law governing the measure of damages in such an action was well settled. It is stated in these terms in Mr. Justice Lush\u2019s book on Practice, vol. 2 p. 1012:\u2014 The measure of damages is the yearly value of the land, subject to such deductions for ground rent, taxes &c., as were chargeable thereon, and as the defendant necessarily paid, and the costs of such proceedings as were necessarily taken in order to obtain possession, and in case of judgment by default, the costs of ejectment to be taxed as between party and party. If any special damage had been sustained this also may be recovered if specially laid in the declaration.\nTo the same effect it is given in Selwyn\u2019s Nisi Prius at p. 685, in Roscoe\u2019s Nisi Prius at p. 947 in Tidd\u2019s practice vol. 2 p. 889 and in Cole on Ejectment at pp. 642 & 643. Under the head of special damage a jury might take into consideration the plaintiff\u2019s trouble and inconvenience by reason of being kept out of possession and the costs of ejectment. The \u201cyearly value of the land\u201d calculated as in an action for use and occupation, Cole, 643. The rule is and has long been settled that the measure of damages in such an action is the value of the mesne profits calculated as mentioned subject to deductions of the character mentioned plus special damage if any be alleged and proved and it is a claim for such damages so measured which by the statute of Geo. IV and the Common Law Procedure Act (1852 sec. 218) the landlord might at his option add to a claim in ejectment against an overholding tenant and which under the Judicature Act of 1875 might and under the existing practice may now be joined to a claim to recover possession of land. In Ontario the statute of Geo. IV was adopted and re-enacted in 1856; it was reproduced in the C.S.U.C. ch. 27 sec. 60 and remained the law in Ontario until the passing of the Ontario Judicature Act of 1881 when the English rule of 1875 above referred to was reproduced as marginal rule 116, the rule which is now in force.\nThe claim for mesne profits authorized by the Upper Canada statute of 1856 and by the Ontaro rule just mentioned of 1881 was a claim the plaintiff was entitled to assert prior to the statute of Geo. IV in England and prior to the statute of 19 Vict. in Upper Canada in an action of trespass for mesne profits and it is such a claim and only such a claim that the plaintiff is now under the English Judicature Act and under the practice in Ontario entitled to join to an action for the possession of land.\nIt can I think be conclusively shewn that in passing upon such a claim whether under the existing procedure or under the old procedure the courts in England have never admitted the right of the defendant by the law of England to a set off for the cost of improvements except of course in a case in which (under the existing procedure) an equitable right arises, for example, from the conduct of the owner in encouraging the defendant to make such improvements relying upon a supposed title or right of possession. That is made quite clear by reference to the well known text books referred to above as well as by the decision of the Court of Exchequer in Cawdor v. Lewis[23], which is a decisive authority upon the point.\nI call attention to the law in this point because it is important in view of the course which has been taken in respect of the appeal, to make it quite clear that whatever be the law in Ontario the rule in other provinces where the law of England prevails in relation to these matters is definitely settled.\nAs regards the rule in Ontario, no point having been raised as touching the common law right of set off either in the court below or in this court and not having had the benefit of any argument upon it I should have required something much more convincing than anything I have seen to induce me to concur in laying down a rule for the guidance of the Ontario courts on this subject which diverges in a very marked way from the law governing the rights of the parties in the common law action of trespass for mesne profits as uniformly laid down in all the recognized books on procedure and as accepted and administered by the courts in England. The legislature of Canada in making provision for the joining of a claim for mesne profits in a landlord\u2019s action of ejectment reproduced the statute of Geo. IV ipsissimis verbis and in 1881 in providing for joining such a claim in all actions to recover possession of land the legislature of Ontario reproduced the English rule on the subject also ipsissimis verbis. Prima facie the claim thus dealt with by the legislature was the claim known to lawyers by the designation trespass for mesne profits and governed by long established rules, (rules as I have said expounded in all the recognized books of practice) governing the disposition of such a claim by the English courts. Prima facie that seems to be so and the presumption that it is so could only be displaced by shewing a continuity of decision and a settled practice in accordance with such decisions which it would be the duty of this court to respect as establishing a divergence between the Ontario and the English law. I find no evidence of any such course of decision. Two cases have been cited in which the court en banc refused to interfere with the verdict of a jury although the jury had evidently taken into account the improvements made by a trespasser in passing upon the question of damages but I cannot find any evidence that these decisions have been regarded as laying down any definite rule which has since been followed. They are not referred to in the latest books on practice, they are not cited in Mr. Justice Maclennan\u2019s book on the Judicature Act or in Holmested & Langton\u2019s book. They are referred to in one or two subsequent cases in an incidental way but in a manner which goes to indicate a considerable doubt as to the precise effect of them. Mr. Justice Osler, whose knowledge of practice must have been exact, says in McCarthy v. Arbuckle[24] at p. 415 that these decisions apply only where the possession is not tortious meaning apparently that they are limited to cases where the plaintiff\u2019s conduct has been such as virtually to amount to a licence.\nAn observation or two upon the grounds upon which the court below has proceeded. The view taken appears to be that the decision of the Court of Chancery in Ontario in Gummerson v. Banting[25] and of Mr. Justice Story in Bright v. Boyd[26] constitute a sufficient weight of authority to establish the proposition that according to the law of Ontario a person in possession of land under an honest belief that he has a title to it who expends money upon it in such a way as to enhance its value has apart from statute a charge upon the land to the extent of such enhancement. I do not think that principle is part of the law of Ontario except to the extent to which as a principle of law it is supported by the statute already discussed. It is the opinion of Mr. Justice Osler as expressed in McCarthy v. Arbuckle24 that the object of the statute was to enable a person expending money in such circumstances to assert in a substantive action against the true owner his right to a lien to the same extent to which he could have done so in answer to an equitable claim by the true owner to recover the land. If Mr. Justice Osler\u2019s view be the right view of the statute then, of course, no difficulty arises; it is quite clear that where the owner was obliged to resort to the Court of Chancery for the purpose of asserting his title against a person in possession who in good faith had expended money in effecting improvements increasing the value of the land, the court would require the plaintiff as a condition of equitable relief to make such compensation as might in the circumstances be just. The principle is well settled and it is unnecessary to elaborate it. It is sufficient to refer to Murray v. Palmer[27] at p. 490 and to Sudgen, Vendor and Purchaser (9th ed.) at p. 266. Bright v. Boyd[28] was such a case.\nOn the other hand the law is clear that where the plaintiff seeks the enforcement of his strictly legal rights and consequently does not require the aid of a court of equity this principle has no application. If the aid of a court of equity is not required then to cite from the work just mentioned \u201cand a person can recover the estate at law, equity, unless there be fraud, cannot, it is conceived, relieve the purchaser on account of money laid out in repairs and improvements, but must dismiss a bill for that purpose with costs\u201d.\nANGLIN J.\u2014In 1903 Luc Montreuil, believing himself to be the owner thereof in fee under his father\u2019s will, leased to the defendants for ten years the land in question, together with an adjoining water lot of which he was in fact owner in fee under a Crown grant to himself. The lease contained an option to purchase for $22,000 the entire property leased, exercisable at the end of the term on giving six months\u2019 previous notice; it also provided, in the event of the option not being exercised, for a renewal for ten years on like terms in other respects, but without the option to purchase; and it reserved to the lessees the right to remove all buildings and plant to be erected by them on the demised premises, except a dock, which they covenanted to build at a cost of not less than $6,000. It was expressly provided that, if the option were not exercised, this dock should become the property of the lessors on the expiry of the term or of any renewal thereof.\nThe defendants took possession under the lease and before October, 1908, expended on the dock and on buildings $80,000, or possibly a somewhat larger sum. How much of that expenditure was made on the part of the demised lands here in question does not appear.\nIn October, 1908, doubt first arose as to the extent of Luc Montreuil\u2019s interest. In litigation commenced then or shortly afterwards between him and the late Hiram Walker, over a piece of property held by the same title as that here in question, it was determined, in October, 1911, that under his father\u2019s will, Luc Montreuil was not an owner in fee but merely a life tenant[29] the remainder in fee having been devised to his children. Up to that time the evidence makes it abundantly clear that the children of Luc Montreuil (the present plaintiffs) had believed that their father owned in fee the lands devised to him. They appear to have acquired knowledge of their possible interest in remainder about the same time and probably in much the same way that their father\u2019s lessees learned of it. No investigation of Luc Montreuil\u2019s title had been made on behalf of the defendants either when they took their lease or before they began their large expenditures on the property.\nWith knowledge of the doubt cast upon the title of their lessor, the defendants made further large expenditures on the leased premises and in January, 1912, gave notice to Luc Montreuil of their intention to exercise the option to purchase. Montreuil having refused to convey an action for specific performance ensued in which his limited title to the land now in question was recognized. Specific performance of the option as to the other demised land held under Crown grant was ordered and, as to the land now being dealt with, the defendant was required to convey his life interest therein and the plaintiffs (the present defendants) were allowed an abatement in the purchase money (the amount thereof to be fixed on a reference) in respect of the interest in remainder which Luc Montreuil could not convey.[30]\nLuc Montreuil died in January, 1918. The defendants continued to hold possession of the entire property. The present action was begun in August, 1918, by the children of Luc Montreuil, the devisees in remainder under the will of their grandfather. By their statement of claim they demand30 possession of the said (devised) lands; (2) mesne profits; and (3) their costs of the action.\u201d\nThe statement of defence sets forth the terms of the lease and option, the exercise of the latter, the expenditure made by the defendants in improvements and the refusal of Luc Montreuil to convey to them. It alleges that the present plaintiffs were aware of the terms of the lease, that all or some of them took part in the negotiations leading to the making of it, and that they all stood by without protest while the improvements were being made and that they are therefore estopped from denying the defendants\u2019 right to hold the lands or alternatively are liable to them in damages. The R.S.O., ch. 109 (s. 37) is also pleaded and under it the relief is claimed either of the defendants being allowed to retain the land, making compensation to the plaintiffs for their interest therein, or of their being awarded compensation for the amount by which the value of the land has been enhanced by their improvements.\nThe late Chief Justice of the King\u2019s Bench, who tried the action, held that the case fell within the purview of the statute pleaded and gave judgment allowing the defendants to retain the land and referring it to the master to ascertain what compensation should be made by them to the plaintiffs[31].\nOn appeal by the plaintiffs the Appellate Divisional Court held that the case did not fall within the statute because the defendants never believed that the land was their own; but, following Bright v. Boyd[32] and Gummerson v. Banting[33], also held that, while the plaintiffs should recover the land, the defendants were entitled to equitable relief for the amount by which lasting improvements, made by them while under the impression that Luc Montreuil was owner in fee, had enhanced its value.[34] From this judgment the plaintiffs appeal asserting a right to recover the land unconditionally. The defendants cross-appeal claiming to have the judgment of the learned trial judge restored; they also sought to reopen the question of the extent of Luc Montreuil\u2019s interest, contending that it was an estate tail.\nBy notice given since the appeals were heard, the last mentioned contention has been abandoned in view of the futility of pressing it in the absence of any conveyance sufficient to bar the entail. The case must therefore be dealt with on the basis that Luc Montreuil had merely a life estate.\nThe statutory provision invoked by the defendants reads as follows:\u2014\n37. Where a person makes lasting improvements on land under the belief that the land is his own, he or his assigns shall be entitled to a lien upon the same to the extent of the amount by which the value of the land is enhanced by such improvements; or shall be entitled or may be required to retain the land if the Court is of opinion or requires that this should be done, according as may under all circumstances of the case be most just, making compensation for the land, if retained, as the Court may direct.\nThe part of this section which precedes the semicolon was originally enacted in 1873 by 36 Vict., ch. 22; the part following the semicolon was added in 1877 by 40 Vict. ch. 7, in preparation for the revision of that year in which the complete section appears as section 4 of chapter 95.\nThis statute gives the court the extraordinary power of depriving a lawful owner of his property against his will, although for a compensation. McCoy v. Grandy[35]. The conditions on which a jurisdiction so much in derogation of common law right is conferred must be strictly construed and fully satisfied. Hughes v. Chester & Holyhead Ry. Co.[36]; Wright v. Mattison[37]; Osterman v. Baldwin[38]; Rigor v. Frye[39]; Wheeler v. Merriman[40]; Hollingsworth v. Funkhouse[41]; Fan Valkenburg v. Ruby[42]. White v. Stokes[43], closely resembles the case at bar, although the wording of the statute, as in the other American cases, is somewhat different.\nDid the defendants when making their improvements believe that the land in question was their own? Unless they did they cannot invoke the statute just quoted. They had a lease with an option to purchase. They had neither legal nor equitable ownership. They no doubt believed that their lessor owned the fee of the property and that they could acquire it by an exercise of the option. But even if they intended to exercise the option the belief that Luc Montreuil actually owned the land excluded belief that it was theirs. Until they actually gave notice of intention to exercise the option, assuming its validity, they had merely a right of election either to acquire the land or not to do so. It is impossible to conceive that they could have believed under these circumstances that the land was their own. They might never have acquired its ownership. Young v. Denike[44], relied on by the late Chief Justice of the King\u2019s Bench, was a case of contract for sale under which, if the vendor had title, the purchaser would have become the equitable owner. Belief of the purchaser that the land was his own by equitable title was apparently regarded as sufficient to bring the case within the statute, although this is not mentioned in the judgment. No such belief could exist here. Moreover the provisions of the lease for its renewal, and that the dock to be built on the premises should belong to the lessor and that all other buildings erected by the lessees might be removed in the event of the option not being exercised certainly do not indicate that when the defendants leased the premises they had definitely determined that they would eventually purchase them. But, whenever the definite intention to purchase may have been formed, until the option was in fact exercised, whatever may have been their interest in the land (London and S.W. Ry. Co. v. Gomm[45]; Davidson v. Norstrant[46]) they could not have believed it to be their own. The portion of the evidence given by Mr. Fleming, the secretary-treasurer and legal advisor of the defendant company quoted by the learned Chief Justice of Ontario, read with the rest of his testimony, is conclusive that they had in fact no such belief.\nQ. Did you believe you owned it then?\nA. No, we could not own it. The only right we had was under the lease.\nIt is therefore, I think, quite clear, as held by the Appellate Divisional Court, that the defendants are not entitled to the benefit of the statute they invoke and that their cross-appeal fails.\nAre they entitled, as equitable relief, to the allowance in respect of lasting improvements which they have been accorded in that court?\nI should perhaps first consider the two objections chiefly pressed by Mr. Armour, (a) that because they merely held an option and did not believe themselves to be actual purchasers or owners of the property the defendants do not fall within the class of persons entitled to equitable relief in respect of improvements made in mistake of title; (b) that no actual enhancement in value was proved at the trial and the defendant\u2019s plea for compensation should therefore have been rejected.\n(a) I think effect should not be given to this objection. The evidence of Mr. Fleming makes it reasonably clear that when the expenditure for improvements was made the defendants had determined to exercise their option to purchase. They made improvements in the full belief that they could on the expiry of their lease acquire title to the land from their lessor. In this they were mistaken, and that mistake in my opinion was such a mistake of title as brings them within the equitable doctrine which they invoke. The cases are numerous in which an expectation of acquiring title has been held sufficient to support a claim for an allowance in respect of improvements made while it was reasonably entertained. Plimmer v. Wellington[47]; Biehn v. Biehn[48]; Unity Joint Stock Banking Assoc. v. King[49]. But see Smith v. Smith[50]. Nor does the fact that they were undoubtedly careless in making such expenditure without a proper investigation of their lessor\u2019s title disentitle them to such relief. So long as the mistake was bona fide the fact that it may have been due in part to carelessness does not debar the defendants from redress.\n(b) As to the second point, it is within the power of the Ontario courts under section 6447 of the Judicature Act to try one or more of the issues in any case and to refer any other issue or issues to a master for inquiry and report. That apparently has been done here by the Appellate Divisional Court as the form of the inquiry directed\u2014\u201cwhat, if any, lasting improvements were made\u201d and \u201cthe amount, if any, by which the value of the said lands was enchanced\u201d\u2014indicates. A passage from the judgment of Kay J. in Shepard v. Jones,[51] at page 472, is relied upon by the appellants. There were in that case, however, other grounds as well as lack of proof of actual enhancement assigned by the learned judge for the refusal to order an inquiry as to improvements. Reference may also be made to the direction for inquiry formulated the by Privy Council in Henderson v. Astwood,[52] at page 164, viz.,\nan inquiry whether any and what sum ought to be allowed * * * in respect of lasting improvements.\nIn the present case however there was evidence of enhancement in value given at the trial. Thus Mr. Fleming on cross-examination would place an additional value of $1,200 or $1,000 on the land in consequence of a shed standing upon it. Mr. Warden states that the land is really only good for manufacturing purposes and that for such purposes the Grand Trunk spur built upon it gives it additional value. In his opinion the buildings on the land make it worth $1,500 more than it would be without them. In the course of the trial the learned trial judge expressed the opinion that it was a self-evident proposition that this land, if intended for manufacturing purposes, would be benefited by the railway siding. In the view taken by him that the case fell within the Ontario statute and that the defendants were entitled to retain the land no actual determination that there had been enhancement in value was necessary. But upon the evidence in the record there might well be an adjudication that there had in fact been some enhancement in value. How much is quite another question.\nIf the defendants\u2019 right to equitable relief rests only on the authority of the decisions in Bright v. Boyd[53] and Gummerson v. Banting[54], cited by the learned Chief Justice of Ontario, I should, with respect, regard it as not established. In so far as those cases maintain the proposition that, \u201cwithout any contract or encouragement or standing-by\u201d on the part of the true owner and although he has not sought the aid or intervention of a court of equity and there is no trust or other matter cognizable only in equity (see Bevis v. Boulton)[55], he may be compelled at the suit of a person who has made improvements under mistake of title to compensate him to the extent to which the value of the land has been thereby enhanced, they would seem to carry the law farther than is warranted by English equity jurisprudence. (Beaty v. Shaw[56]. In the civil law the broad doctrine enunciated in Gummersons\u2019 Case54 no doubt obtains and the decision of Mr. Justice Story in Bright v. Boyd53 in the United States Circuit Court, would rather seem to have involved an extension of the English equity doctrine by introducing into it the principles of the civil law. The distinction between the two systems is clearly pointed out in that learned judge\u2019s work on Equity Jurisprudence, (14 ed. vol. 2, pars. 1089 and 1090), citing the case of Putnam v. Ritchie[57] where Chancellor Walworth of New York had expressed an opinion as to the state of the law contrary to the view acted upon by Mr. Justice Story. See also vol. 3, par. 1654. Whatever authority the Gummerson Case[58] may have had was practically destroyed by the observations made upon it in the Court of Appeal in Beaty v. Shaw[59]. Hagarty C.J.O. there said, speaking of the judgment of Spragge C. in Gummerson\u2019s Case:58\nThe learned Chancellor appears to me to state the rule of equity too broadly.\nMr. Justice Burton added that\nIt took the profession a good deal by surprise and was supposed to carry the law in reference to allowance for improvements, where there was no privity between the parties, no fraud, no standing by and suffering the improvements to be made, much farther than any previous decision either here or in England; and the passage of the 36 Vict. c. 22 (O) very shortly afterwards, probably prevented the point being further considered in a Court of Appeal.\nAgain the same learned judge said:\nThe case of Gummerson v. Banting58 was a peculiarly hard case, one of those cases which it is proverbially said are apt to excite the sympathies of a Judge, and lead to the making of doubtful law.\nThe equitable jurisdiction to provide for compensation in respect of improvements made under mistake of title is old and well known. Edlin v. Battaly[60] and Clavering\u2019s Case, mentioned in Jackson v. Cator[61] at page 689, may be referred to. The bases of the jurisdiction, however, and the circumstances under which it will be exercised are sometimes not so well remembered or appreciated. It may conduce to a clearer understanding of the ground on, and of the extent to, which I would vary the judgment in appeal if I should briefly examine them at the risk of appearing to make a pedantic parade of learning, some of which is, no doubt, quite elementary. Apart from the old and very meagre report of Edlin v. Battaly,[62] where a compromise was eventually reached, I have found no English decision, old or modern, that goes so far as either Gummerson v. Banting[63] or Bright v. Boyd.[64] In England the equitable jurisdiction to relieve a person who has made improvements under mistake of title by requiring compensation to be made him for enhancement in value seems to have been rested either on the power of the court of equity to compel the legal owner, when seeking its aid as a plaintiff, to do equity, or on the existence of a situation creating such a personal equity against the legal owner, when defendant, as would make his insistence on his legal right without submitting to compensation a constructive fraud. It is only in cases of the latter class that a person seeking the relief of compensation can do so as an actor. Sugden on Vendors and Purchasers, (14th ed.) ch. 23, s. 1, nos. 29 and 31.\nWhen the legal owner seeks the aid of a court of equity however, that court will compel him to compensate the defendant for enhancement in value through lasting improvements made by the latter under mistake of title, although no conduct on the part of the plaintiff, active or passive, can be relied upon as giving rise to such a personal equity against him. Neesom v. Clarkson,[65] is usually cited as authority for this proposition. It can scarcely be said to be satisfactory, for two reasons: first, because, as stated in a foot note, the right of the defendants to an account of the moneys expended on lasting improvements was conceded at the original hearing (2 Hare, 163) without argument and was not in question on the rehearing; and secondly, because, in delivering his judgment, Vice-Chancellor Wigram expresses the view that a defendant should not be granted this relief unless the equity which he claims is one that he himself might have enforced by bill. More satisfactory authority is to be found in Mill v. Hill,[66] which in some respects closely resembles the case at bar. The life tenant under an equitable settlement, which he suppressed, had conveyed to the defendant what purported to be an estate in fee. On his death the remainder man, who was entirely innocent in the matter instead of bringing action at common law in ejectment, as in the case at bar, filed a bill in equity to set aside the deed to the defendant. As a condition of being given relief he was required to submit to a decree for compensation for permanent improvements made by the defendant to the extent to which the value of the land was thereby enhanced. The defendant was, it is true, treated as a trustee for the plaintiff. Reference may also be made to Attorney-General v. Baliol College[67]; Cooper v. Phibbs[68]; and Davey v. Durrant[69]. Carroll v. Robertson[70] is an instance of this jurisdiction being exercised in the Court of Chancery of Upper Canada. See too Munsie v. Lindsay[71].\nOn the other hand where the legal owner has not by invoking its aid submitted himself to equitable jurisdiction, a clear case of encouragement of, or acquiescence in, the expenditure made under mistake of title must be made out by the person seeking com- pensation in equity in respect of it. 3 Story\u2019s Equity (14th ed.) par. 1645. Fry. J. in Willmott v. Barber[72], at page 105, thus states the essential elements of such a case in terms which have become classic.\nIt has been said that the acquiescence which will deprive a man of his legal rights must amount to fraud, and in my view that is an abbreviated statement of a very true proposition. A man is not to be deprived of his legal rights unless he has acted in such a way as would make it fraudulent for him to set up those rights. What, then, are the elements or requisites necessary to constitute fraud of that description? In the first place the plaintiff must have made a mistake as to his legal rights. Secondly, the plaintiff must have expended some money or must have done some act (not necessarily upon the defendants land) on the faith of his mistaken belief. Thirdly, the defendant, the possessor of the legal right, must know of the existence of his own right which is inconsistent with the right claimed by the plaintiff. If he does not know of it he is in the same position as the plaintiff, and the doctrine of acquiescence is founded upon conduct with a knowledge of your legal rights. Fourthly, the defendant, the possessor of the legal right, must know of the plaintiff\u2019s mistaken belief of his right. If he does not, there nothing which calls upon him to assert his own rights. Lastly, the defendant, the possessor of the legal right, must have encouraged the plaintiff in his expenditure of money or in the other acts which he has done, either directly or by abstaining from asserting his legal right. Where all these elements exist, there is fraud of such a nature as will entitle the Court to restrain the possessor of the legal right from exercising it, but, in my judgment, nothing short of this will do.\nAs put by Lord Eldon in Dann v.Spurrier[73]\nThis Court will not permit a man knowingly, though but passively to encourage another to lay out money under an erroneous opinion of title; and the circumstance of looking on is in many cases as strong as using terms of encouragement * * *. Still it must be put upon the party to prove that case by strong and cogent evidence, leaving no reasonable doubt that he acted upon that sort of encouragement. * * * It must be shewn that, with the knowledge of the person under whom he claims, he conceived he had that larger interest, and was putting himself to considerable expense, unreasonable compared with the smaller interest; and which the other party observed, and must have supposed incurred under the idea, that he intended to give that larger interest, or to refrain from disturbing the other in the enjoyment. Cotton L.J. in Falcke v. Scottish Imperial Ins. Co.[74] at page 243, emphasizes two of the requirements of such a case:\u2014\nBut in order to make this doctrine applicable there must be not only knowledge on the part of the person having the real title that the man whom he sees so acting believes he has a title and acts in consequence of that belief, but also a knowledge that the title on the faith of which he is acting is a bad one.\nAgain in Proctor v. Bennis[75] at page 760, the same learned judge said:\nIt is necessary that the person who alleges this lying-by should have been acting in ingorance of the title of the other man, and that the other man should have known that ignorance and not mentioned his own title.\nRamsden v. Dyson[76] and Plimmer v. Mayor of Wellington[77] are well known instances of the exercise of this jurisdiction.\nAnd when the case is clear and the circumstances are such that complete justice cannot otherwise be done the court does not stop at ordering compensation by the owner but will give the relief provided for by the addition to the Ontario statute of 1873 made in 1877, and, preventing his asserting his legal right to recover the property, allow the person whose expenditure he had encouraged to retain it making such compensation to the owner as may be fair. East India Co. v. Vincen[78]; Duke of Beaufort v. Patrick[79]; Atty. Gen. for the Prince of Wales v. Collom[80]; Davis v. Snyder[81]; Story\u2019s Equity (14th ed) vol. 1, no. 517. It can scarcely be necessary to state that for outlay after they became aware that their lessors\u2019 title was questionable (October, 1908) the defendants can have no equity for compensation, even though steps to establish the adverse claim were deferred. Russell v. Romanes[82]; Master of Clare Hall v. Harding[83]; Rennie v. Young[84]. Relief in such a case may possibly be given under very exceptional circumstances. Corbett v. Corbett[85].\nIn addition to the authorities already cited reference may be had to Smith\u2019s Principles of Equity (5 ed.) page 211; Snell\u2019s Principles of Equity (18 ed.) page 338; Pomeroy\u2019s Equity Jurisprudence, vol. III., par. 1241 and note; Ruling Case Law, vol. 14, vbo. Improvements, s. 6.\nIn the case at bar the evidence conclusively establishes that there was no sort of active encouragement by any of the plaintiffs of the defendants\u2019 belief in the ownership of the fee by Luc Montreuil. It is also made abundantly clear that prior to October, 1908, the present plaintiffs were quite as ignorant as were the defendants themselves that Luc Montreuil was not the owner of the lands in fee. All alike believed him to be so and that the present plaintiffs had no interest in the property. There was therefore neither knowledge by them of their own right nor of the defendants\u2019 mistaken belief of their right. The plaintiffs could not have known that\nthe title on the faith of which (the defendants were) acting was a bad one.\nThe defendants are therefore driven to invoke the other head of equitable jurisdiction, viz., that the plaintiffs are actively seeking the aid of equity. They are not helped by the fact that the Supreme Court of Ontario, in which they sued, is a court of equity as well as of law. The Judicature Act did not confer any new right of relief. Equitable relief may be granted by that court under section 16 (R.S.O. ch. 56) only where, and to the same extent as, the former Court of Chancery ought to have given such relief in a suit in that court. In order that the defendants should have an equitable right to the relief they seek, no case of constructive fraud having been made, it must still appear that the plaintiffs have invoked the equitable jurisdiction of the court.\nThe action brought by the plaintiffs is in fact purely a common law action for ejectment and mesne profits. Although before the time of Henry VII. an action in which damages for disseisin, of which the measure was the mesne profits, were awarded, when ejectment in a fictitious form with a nominal plaintiff came into use for the recovery of the term, or possession of the land, that only was recoverable in it, with nominal damages, but not with mesne profits, Goodtitle v. Tombs[86], which then became the subject of a supplemental but distinct action in trespass, in which it was necessary to shew a prior recovery of the possession in ejectment. Aslin v. Parkin[87]. Obviously the nominal damages given in ejectment did not afford a subject for set-off of compensation for improvements. Since the 19 Vict. ch. 43, sec. 267, however, (see now Ont. Con. R. no. 69) mesne profits may be recovered in ejectment (though not specifically demanded, at least where the plaintiff is a landlord suing his over-holding tenant, Smith v. Tett[88] and without the plaintiff having obtained possession. Dunlop v. Macedo[89]. What is sought in the present action is not an accounting for the rents and profits of the plaintiffs\u2019 lands while in the defendants\u2019 possession. Such an accounting would seem to involve an exercise of equitable jurisdiction and the correlative right of the defendants to an equitable allowance for enhanced value due to their improvements would thereupon ensue. Story\u2019s Equity Jurisprudence (14 ed.) section 1089. When they obtained the decree for specific performance, the defendants became tenants of the property pur autre vie. After the death of the cestui que vie their occupation was that of trespassers and they became liable to the owners for damages accruing during the continuance of their wrongful possession. The plaintiffs claim for mesne profits is nothing else than a demand for those damages.\nWhere a plaintiff sued at common law for mesne profits I have found no case in England where a set off for improvements was allowed; and, upon the defendant shewing that he had an equitable claim in respect of improvements, a plaintiff\u2019s action at law for mesne profits was, in at least one instance, stayed \u201cbecause in an action for mesne profits no set-off is allowed.\u201d Earl Cawdor v. Lewis[90]. See also Mayne on Damages (9 ed.) 476. But see too Putnam v. Ritchie[91] at page 404. Mr. Sedgewick, however, in his valuable treatise on Damages (9 ed.) vol. 3, sec. 915, says:\nThe action for mesne profits is everywhere held to be a liberal and equitable action, and one which will allow of every equitable kind of defence. Among the most important considerations that a defendant can urge, in answer to the claim for the rents and profits received by him, is that which the common law has, to a certain extent, adopted from the civil law, and which grows out of permanent improvements made by him upon the premises during his occupancy. The civil law treats the occupant in good faith with lenity. The reasoning of the civilians has so far obtained in many of our tribunals, that a bona fide occupant of lands is allowed to mitigate the damages in the action brought by the rightful owner by offsetting the value of his permanent improvements made in good faith, to the extent of the rents and profits claimed.\nIn a case noted in Viner\u2019s Abridgment, vbo. \u201cDiscount\u201d, no. 3, recoupment of damages was allowed by the assize \u201cbecause the land was sown and the house well amended\u201d; and in Coulter\u2019s Case[92], it was held that\nthe disseissor shall recoupe all in damages which he hath expended in amending of the house.\nSee too Brooke\u2019s Abr., vbo. \u201cDamages\u201d, no. 7, fol. 202. Citing these authorities Mr. Sedgewick in his work on Damages adds (ibid.) that\nin our own ancient real actions the improvements of the tenant appear always to have been the subject of set-off or recoupment. The set-off however cannot go beyond the value of the rents and profits; the defendant is never allowed to recover a balance, unless * * * the recovery * * * is allowed by statute. This principle, however, properly applies only to the case of a bona fide possessor, or one without notice.\nThis doctrine was approved in the United States Supreme Court in Green v. Biddle[93].\nUnder the Ontario statute (R.S.O. ch. 109, sec. 37), when it applies, the dispossessed occupant is given a lien enforceable at common law for the enhanced value created by his improvements and the court is empowered, and indeed required, after setting-off mesne profits, if any, to award him judgment for the balance. McCarthy v. Arbuckle[94]. No existing right of redress either at common law or in equity was affected. As early as 1818 statutory provision was made in Upper Canada (59 Geo. III., ch. 14, sec. 2) for compensation to defendants in ejectment for improvements made by them in consequence of erroneous surveys, whether made before or after the passing of the Act Gallagher v. McConnel[95]. The statutory right remained confined to such cases until 1873. But the common law courts of Upper Canada, influenced no doubt by the consideration shewn in the civil law for the occupant in good faith, in actions brought for mesne profits held that evidence of substantial improvements made by the defendant was admissible in mitigation of the plaintiffs\u2019 damages. Thus in Lindsay v. McFarling[96] where such evidence had been rejected by the trial judge, the Court of King\u2019s Bench directed a new trial, the Chief Justice saying:\u2014\nI think this evidence proper to have gone to the jury; it would most probably have materially affected the verdict,\nAgain, in Patterson v. Reardon[97] in an action for mesne profits the jury gave a verdict for nominal damages only, evidence having been given at the trial that the defendant had made substantial improvements on the lot from which he had been ejected. The court followed Lindsay v. McFarling96 and refused to hold the verdict perverse. In McCarthy v. Arbuckle[98] at page 411, Wilson C.J., citing Green v. Biddle[99] and Sedgewick on Damages (ubi. sup.) says:\nIn the former case (i.e. that of a possessor in good faith) the defendant in an action for mesne profits was allowed to set-off the value of his improvements.\nThis right of the defendant in an action to recover mesne profits is also recognized by Burton J.A. in Beaty v. Shaw[100] at page 609. The action at bar was tried by a judge sitting without a jury. Under the modern Ontario practice the master may, in such a case, where the power conferred by section 64[101] of the Judicature Act (R.S.O. ch. 56) is exercised, be required to perform some of the functions of a jury. I think he may and should be called upon to do so here. There is no reason why he should not inquire and report,101 to what amount the plaintiffs are entitled for mesne profits, of which apart from special circumstances, a fair occupation rent for the land is the usual measure (Commissioners Niagara Falls Park v. Colt101; but see Munsie v. Lindsay,)[102]; (2) what amount, if any, should be allowed as compensation to the defendants for enhancement in value of the property by reason of permanent improvements thereon effected by them prior to the 2nd of October, 1908; and (3), making the necessary set-off, what balance, if any, the plaintiffs should be allowed to recover as their actual damages. The defendants have no right in this common law action to any allowance in respect of improvements made after the 2nd of October, 1908, any more than they would have had if entitled to equitable relief. I cannot understand why in the judgment appealed from an inquiry was directed as to such subsequent improvements. It was apparently by inadvertence, as the learned Chief Justice of Ontario had distinctly indicated that as to such subsequent expenditures there could be no equity. Moreover, whatever might have been the case in granting equitable relief, the right of recovery here in respect of improvements being entertained merely in mitigation of damages cannot exceed the amount which the plaintiffs may be found entitled to under their claim for mesne profits. The purpose of allowing the set- off is to restrict the plaintiff\u2019s recovery to the actual damages they have sustained. I would therefore modify the judgment pronounced by the Appellate Divisional Court by striking therefrom sub-paragraph 2 of paragraph 3 and substituting a direction for a reference in the terms above indicated.\nWhile the cross-appeal should clearly be dismissed with costs, the proper disposition of the costs of the main appeal is not so obvious. The appellants have established that the respondents are not entitled to the equitable relief accorded them in the Appellate Division. On the other hand the direction for a reference to fix the compensation which the respondents should be allowed in respect of improvements should be maintained in a modified form and as relief at common law, to which they did not assert a right, although their pleadings contain averments of the facts essential to support such an allowance. On the evidence now before us it may well be that the difference in the monetary result will be comparatively slight. On the whole, I think at least approximate justice will be done if no order is made as to the costs of the main appeal.\nMIGNAULT J.\u2014I concur with my brother Anglin J.\nAppeal dismissed without costs.\nCross appeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Bartlet, Bartlet, Urquhart & Barnes.\nSolicitors for the respondent Ontario Asphalt Block Company: Rodd, Wigle & McHugh.\nSolicitors for the respondent Caldwell Sand and Gravel Company: Fleming, Drake & Foster.\n[1] 47 Ont.

J. and Anglin and Mignault JJ.\u2014The respondents have no ground for complaint; if the condition is good, they have no grievance; if it is bad, the license itself is void and the respondents have therefore no status as licencees.\nPer Idington J.\u2014The legislation of the province is intra vires.\nPer Duff J.\u2014According to section 50 of the \"Land Act\" and to section 57, s.s. 3a, as amended by c. 28, s. 6 of the B.C. Statutes of 1910, the Minister of Lands had no authority to renew the license in February, 1921, unless performance of the condition precedent (above quoted) had been waived; performance of the condition during the year ending in February, 1922, had not been waived; thus the respondents' license had already lapsed or would have lapsed on the 11th of February, 1922, and accordingly the respondents' application must fail. APPEAL per salturn from a judgment of the Supreme Court of British Columbia granting a motion for an injunction restraining the appellants from attempting to enforce a provision contained in a timber license issued to respondents.\nThe respondents are the assignees of a timber license issued on the 11th of February, 1912 and renewed yearly by the deputy minister of Lands of British Columbia, in which was inserted by virtue of a resolution of the oegislature, the following provision; \"this \"license is issued and accepted upon the understanding \"that no Chinese or Japanese shall be employed in \"connection therewith\". The respondents applied to the Supreme Court of British Columbia for an injunction against the appellants restraining them from taking any steps to cancel the license by reason the non-observance of the above quoted provision.\nJudgment was rendered by Murphy J. granting the application, relying upon an opinion expressed by the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1] on the submission of a question to that court under the \"Constitutional Questions Determination Act\" of the province. The Court of Appeal had held that such a provision in the liencses was invalid: (a) as contrary to the principle determined in the case of Union Colliery Company v. Bryden[2]; (b) as being in contravention of the \"Japanese Treaty Act, 1913\".\nJ. A. Ritchie K.C. for the appellants,\nSir Chas. H. Tupper K.C. and Charles Wilson K.C. for the respondents,\nE. L. Newcombe K.C. for the Attorney-General for Canada. THE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014For the reasons stated by my brother Mignault, I am of the opinion that this appeal should be allowed without costs and also that the respondent's action should be dismissed without costs.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014The respondent is the assignee of a special timber license issued by the deputy Minister of Lands on behalf of the Government of British Columbia in the following from:\nNo. 6138\n3957-12\n(Coat of Arms)\nThe Government of The Province of British Columbia Land Act and Amendments.\nTIMBER LICENCE.\nIn consideration of One Hundred and Sixty Dollars, now paid, being one annual renewal fee and the additional fee provided for in subsection (3a) of section 57 of the \"Land Act\" as enacted by section 6 of chapter 28 of 1910, and of other moneys to be paid under the said Acts and subject to the provisions thereof, I, Robert A. Renwick, deputy Minister of Lands, license Melville Tait to cut, fell, and carry away timber upon all that particular tract of land described in original licence No. 1812, Renewed by Nos. 3314, 5025, 6877, 12767, 25200, 420997, 5948, 14351.\nThe duration of this licence is for one year from the 11th Feb., 1912 renewable from year to year as provided by said subsection (3a) of section 57.\nThe licence does not authorize the entry upon an Indian reserve or settlement, and is issued and accepted subject to such prior rights or other persons as may exist by law and on the understanding that the government shall not be held responsible for or in connection with any conflict which may arise with other claimants of the same ground, and that under no circumstances will licence fees be refunded.\nN.B.\u2014This licence is issued and accepted on the understanding that no Chinese or Japanese shall be employed in connection therewith.\nROBT. A. RENWICK,\nDeputy Minister of Lands.\" The lands in question on which the timber to be cut grows, belong to the said province of British Columbia by virtue of section 109 of the B.N.A. Act, 1867, which reads as follows:\u2014\n109. All lands, mines, minerals and royalties belonging to the several provinces of Canada, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick at the Union, and all sums then due or payable for such lands, mines, minerals or royalties, shall belong to the several provinces of Ontario, Quebec, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick in which the same are situate or arise, subject to any trusts existing in respect thereof, and to any interest other than that of the province in the same.\nSuch is the result of the steps taken in 1871 by virtue of section 148 of said Act to constitute the union of said province with the other provinces of Canada under said Act.\nThe province of British Columbia may have had theretofore another title to said lands but whether higher or not need not concern us for the language just quoted seems to me for our present purpose to define as comprehensive and absolute an ownership as necessary to enable those duly empowered to act, and, acting on behalf of the province, to make whatever bargain they may deem proper.\nOf course under our system of responsible government that power of bargaining is again limited by the declared will of the legislature of the province.\nThat legislature declared on the 15th April, 1902, its will by the following resolution:\u2014\nThat in all contracts, leases and concessions of whatsoever kind entered into, issued, or made by the government or on behalf of the government, provision be made that no Chinese or Japanese shall be employed in connection therewith.\nThat was followed in June, 1902, by an order in council which made the declaration that the said resolution was applicable to many kinds of contracts enumerated therein and of those, \"special timber licences\" such as that set forth above were named.\nHence the stipulation, contained in the said licence above quoted and now in question, was adopted by the executive of British Columbia's Government.\nIts obligation binding respondent, the licensee, to the due observance thereof formed part of the consideration for the said licence.\nThe rights in question thereunder in any of the relevant yearly renewals are founded upon the contract of 1912.\nNotwithstanding the last mentioned fact or any of those considerations arising out of the ownership of the lands in question and the right of an owner to deal with the lands belonging to him or it, as to such owner may seem fit, the respondent applied to the Supreme Court of British Columbia for an injunction against the appellants restraining them from taking any steps to cancel the said licence by reason of the non-observance of the above quoted provisions in said licence against the employment of Chinese or Japanese, and the same was granted accordingly.\nThe learned judge granting same seems to have done so, without any argument, and in the course of the opening statement by counsel for respondent, relying upon an opinion expressed by the Court of Appeal for British Columbia on the submission of a question to the said court under the \"Constitutional Questions Determination Act\" of the province.\nIn order to get here, on their way to the court above, as speedily as possible the parties concerned consented to an appeal here, direct from the judgment granting said injunction, to this court. The reliance for said opinion of the Court of Appeal upon the case of Union Colliery Co. v. Bryden [3], seems to me, with great respect, to be misplaced.\nThe principle there involved was the right of mine owners to employ aliens or native Chinese or others despite the efforts of the government to regulate or prohibit the doing so. And it was held in said case to be ultra vires the powers of a provincial legislature to direct a general discrimination such as attempted and there in question.\nThis licensing of the right to cut timber on lands belonging to the province is entirely another question and depends on the right of an owner to impose limitations or conditions upon any grant made by virtue of such absolute ownership.\nSurely the private owner of lands on which there is timber can, so long as owning it, refuse to employ either Chinese or Japanese or any other class he sees fit, to cut same and also impose the like terms by way of condition of enjoyment on any one claiming under him by way of licence, lease or chopping contract of any kind.\nAnd I cannot see why the duly constituted authorities of a province empowered by the legislature to so act cannot do likewise.\nSuppose for safety's sake the legislature directed the exclusion of men in the habit of smoking from being employed in any way relative to the cutting of timber, could said enactment be held ultra vires?\nThe question involved, of the right to do so or as involved herein is in principle much more like that involved in Cunningham v. Tomey Homma [4], than in the Bryden Case [5]. There the discrimination was made as to the right to vote over which the local legislature had exclusive authority to give or to withold as it saw fit.\nI do not think that power was any more sacred than the absolute right over property expressly defined as belonging to the province.\nAgain I am unable to understand upon what principle an injunction can be maintained to deprive one of the parties to a contract from asserting its rights thereunder, against the other thereby attempting to get rid of its obligation which formed an important part of the consideration inducing the contract.\nSurely there can be no doubt that a contract which was founded upon the obligation to execute it by means of a restricted field of labour, cannot be held, economically speaking, to be the same contract, when the field of labour and cheap labour (as is sounded sometimes in our ears, open to receive common knowledge) is introduced to the advantage of the licensee.\nThat suggests another consideration, if provincial autonomy is to be disregarded, and it is that of the duty to administer its affairs in the most economical way possible and derive the best possible revenue from its timber resources.\nThat, however, is the business of the people of the province. And to take away from them the benefit thereof and bestow it upon someone else such as respondent does not seem to me a fair and equitable ground upon which to found an injunction such as in question herein.\nAnd none of these considerations are met by the claim that the Act of the Dominion Parliament enforcing the Japanese treaty renders the contract illegal. Assuming for a moment that it has such effect as contended by respondent, then it renders the consideration for such a contract illegal and hence the whole void.\nHow can such a contract founded upon an illegal consideration be held good in part and void as to that other?\nI cannot think any injunction met by such objections can be maintained.\nOn the general principles relative to the foundation for such an injunction as granted below, I think there are so many errors, for the foregoing reasons, that it cannot be upheld and should be dissolved.\nThe decisions in the cases of St. Catherines Milling Co. v. The Queen[6]; Smylie v. The Queen[7]; and Montreal Street Rly. v. City of Montreal [8], seem to me in point in regard to some of the grounds I have taken.\nAnd as to the enactment pretending to enforce the Japanese treaty, I do not find therein anything which necessarily involves the questions raised herein.\nThe only section of said treaty which has the slightest resemblance to anything that might bear upon what is herein involved is the third sub-section of Art. I thereof, which is as follows:\u2014\nThey shall in all that relates to the pursuit of their industries, callings, professions, and educational studies be placed in all respects on the same footing as the subjects or citizens of the most favoured nation.\nThis certainly never was intended to deprive the owners of property, whether private citizens or provinces, of their inherent rights as such, much less to destroy a contract made before the Act in question. Another observation must be made and it is that this injunction professes to deal with the Chinese as if upon the same footing as the Japanese, though the treaty is only one with Japan and does not touch the question of the employment of Chinese specified in the provision of the contract and in the requirements of the injunction.\nWhat right exists to deal with the Chinese in this case? Yet, if the licence has become void or liable to be cancelled on any single ground, why should the appellants be enjoined from proceeding to do so?\nI think this appeal should be allowed with costs throughout.\nWe heard the deputy Minister of Justice on behalf of his department, but, as I understood him, the Minister of Justice did not wish to intervene.\nI may be permitted to suggest once more that all the fundamental facts presented herein do not seem to present a case for raising the neat point of how far, if at all, the Dominion Statute of 1913, known as the \"Japanese Treaty Act,\" can be held to invade the rights of a province in its property or of its private citizens; that a provincial enactment similar to that in the R.S. Ont., C. 55, and its counterpart in section 67 of the \"Supreme Court Act,\" could be made applicable to produce more satisfactory results than can be hoped for herein in the way of definite determination of what is desired.\nDUFF J.\u2014The respondents are the assignees of a special timber licence issued in the year 1912 under the provisions of the \"Crown Lands Act\" of British Columbia which, by the terms of it, was on specified conditions renewable from year to year for a period which, it may be assumed for the purposes of this appeal, has not yet expired. One of the provisions of the licence is in these words:\nThis licence is issued and accepted on the understanding that no Chinese or Japanese shall be employed in connection therewith.\nAdmittedly this provision was not complied with and after some correspondence with the Attorney General proceedings were taken by the respondents in the Supreme Court of British Columbia claiming a declaration that they are entitled to employ Chinese and Japanese on the lands held by them under special timber licences; and Murphy J., before whom the proceedings came, held, following a previous judgment of the British Columbia Court of Appeal, that the stipulation was illegal and unenforceable and accordingly gave judgment against the Attorney General.\nThe general questions raised in the factums and on the argument have been fully discussed in the judgments on the reference in relation to the British Columbia Statute of 1921 [9], and these subjects require little further consideration on the present appeal; but the question now raised differs from that considered on the reference in this, that the Statute of 1921 does not, for the purpose of determining the actual rights of the parties in litigation, that is to say for the purpose of determining the rights of the respondents under their timber licence, come into play at all.\nThe provision which is the subject of discussion was inserted in the special timber licence in compliance with an order in council passed by the government of British Columbia in June, 1902, pursuant to a resolution of the legislature passed in April of the same year to the following effect:\u2014 That in all contracts, leases, and concessions of whatsoever kind entered into, issued, or made by the government, or on behalf of the government, provision be made that no Chinese or Japanese shall be employed in connection therewith.\nThe order in council declared that the resolution applied to special timber licences granted under section 50 of the \"Crown Lands Act,\" a class to which the respondents' licence admittedly belongs, and provided that a clause conforming to the instructions given by the resolution should be inserted in such instruments.\nSection 50 of the Lands Act authorizes the Chief Commissioner of Lands and Works to grant special timber licences subject to\nsuch conditions, regulations and instructions as may from time to time be established by the Lieutenant Governor in Council\nand by an amendment adding a sub-section (3a) to section 57 of the Act passed in the year 1910 (sec. 6 of c. 28 of the statutes of that year) it was provided that such licences should be \"renewable from year to year\" so long as there should be an adequate quantity of merchantable timber upon the land\nif the terms and conditions of the licence and provisions * * * and any regulation passed by Order in Council respecting or affecting the same have been complied with.\nThe licence itself in terms provided\nthe duration of the licence is for one year from the 11th February, 1912, renewable from year to year as provided by * * * sub.-sec. 3a of sec. 57\nof the \"Lands Act.\" The stipulation touching the employment of Chinese and Japanese is one of the terms and conditions of the licence within the meaning of the amendment of 1910 and it is also a provision of the regulation established by order in council within the meaning of that amendment. The observance of this stipulation is, therefore, by virtue of the provisions of the statute as well as by virtue of the terms of the contract as expressed in the instrument evidencing the licence in any one year, a condition precedent to the right of a licensee to have his licence renewed for the following year.\nIt follows that the Commissioner of Crown Lands had no authority to renew the licence in February, 1921, unless performance of the condition precedent had been waived and the existence of the authority to waive such a statutory condition precedent may be open to doubt. However that may be, it is quite clear that performance of the condition during the year ending in February, 1922, has not been waived and the declaration claimed by the respondent is one which cannot properly be pronounced.\nThis requires perhaps a little elucidation. The rule of law is that a grant subject to a condition precedent which is (or becomes before the performance of it) illegal or impossible, conveys no interest, \"no state or interest can grow thereupon\" Coke on Littleton 206a; Comyn's Digest, Conditions, D3; differing in this respect from a condition subsequent which because the interest passes by the grant and is vested in the grantee is inoperative to devest that interest if it be impossible in fact or in law. The Act of 1913 giving the force of law to the Japanese treaty plainly did not make it an illegal thing to abstain from employing Japanese nor did it, I think, prohibit agreements between private persons to abstain from engaging the services of such persons; and it may, however, be a debatable question whether a provincial government in exacting, in the exercise of its discretion, a stipulation such as that under discussion, is doing anything repugnant to the covenants of the treaty which guarantee to Japanese subjects equality with other aliens in the eye of the law.\nI shall assume however, conformably to the contention of the respondents, that the order in council of 1912 laying down a general rule amounting to a regulation established by the Lieutenant Governor in Council under section 50 of the \"Lands Act\" is an ordinance which could not remain in operation consistently with the due observance of the treaty stipulations; and that in this respect the legislation of 1913 operated upon existing as well as upon future grants. It does not follow that the respondents are entitled to the annual renewal of their licence. Even if, as the respondents contend, such is the effect of the legislation of 1913, still, on the principle above mentioned, which, I think, applies, the respondents' licence has already lapsed or must lapse at the end of the current year, that is to say on the 11th February, 1922; and the respondents' claim for a declaration in the terms of the writ must accordingly fail.\nIn the special circumstances of the case I think there should be no costs.\nANGLIN J.\u2014Although appended as a note or annexed to the plaintiff's lease, the condition against the employment of Orientals I regard as one of its essential terms\u2014as part of the consideration for which it was given.\nThe lessees sue for an injunction to restrain the lessors from cancelling the lease for non\u2014observance of this condition, on the ground that it was illegal and therefore void. If the condition was good, the plaintiffs have no grievance; if it was bad, the licence I think fails as a whole, with the result that the plaintiffs have no status as licencees.\nOn this ground, apart from other considerations, in my opinion this suit brought for an injunction against the Attorney General and the Minister of Lands for British Columbia cannot be maintained.\nMIGNAULT J.\u2014This is an appeal per saltum by consent from the judgment of the Supreme Court of British Columbia granting an injunction demanded by the respondent. The trial judge felt himself bound by a judgment of the Court of Appeal of that Province on a reference by the Lieutenant Governor in Council deciding that a clause in timber licences prohibiting the employment of Chinese and Japanese was ultra vires. It was therefore thought advisable to appeal direct to this court.\nBy the indorsement on the respondent's writ it is stated that it claims a declaration that it is entitled to employ Chinese and Japanese upon the hereditaments held by it under special timber licences containing this condition:\u2014\nN.B. This licence is issued and accepted upon the understanding that no Chinese or Japanese shall be employed in connection therewith.\nThe respondent prayed for an injunction restraining the appellants from interfering with it in its enjoyment of its special timber licences upon the ground that, in the course of working its special timber licences, it had employed and was continuing to employ Chinese and Japanese as labourers. In my opinion, if the condition of the special timber licence prohibiting the employment of Chinese and Japanese is void as being ultra vires, the licence itself, granted on this express condition taken ex hypothesi to be bad, is itself void.\nI would apply a familiar rule relating to contracts.\nWhere there is one promise made upon several considerations, some of which are bad and some good, the promise would seem to be void, for you cannot say whether the legal or illegal portion of the consideration most affected the mind of the promissor and induced his promise.\n(Anson, Law of Contract, 15th ed., p. 255).\nThe timber licence here was issued in consideration of $160.00 and of other monies to be paid under the provisions of the \"Land Act,\" and it contained, undoubtedly as part of the consideration, the condition that I have cited.\nIf this condition be bad, the license is also bad; if it be valid, the respondent has no ground for complaint. In other words, the government granted and the respondent accepted the license upon the express understanding that no Chinese or Japanese should be employed in connection therewith. To treat this condition at if it had not been inserted in the licence, would be to substitute an unconditional licence for one which the Government granted conditionally. If the condition be bad, the licence itself, and not the mere condition must fail.,\nI think that what I have said is supported by the ratio decidendi of the Judicial Committee in Grand Trunk Pacific Ry. Co. v. Fort William Land Investment Co.[10]. There the Railway Committee had made an order subject to a condition which it was without jurisdiction to insert in the order, and their Lordships decided that\nthe order itself, and not the mere condition, must fail.\nHere the demand of the respondent was clearly not maintainable, for, if, as it alleged, the condition of non-employment of Chinese and Japanese was illegal, the timber licence it had obtained was void, and if the condition was a valid one, its action was unfounded. Under these circumstances the constitutional question need not be discussed.\nI would allow the appeal without costs and dismiss the respondent's action also without costs.\nAppeal allowed without costs.\nSolicitor for the appellants: J.

Sask. (1909) c. 14, s. 1.\nThe appellant company sold to the Phoenix Publishing Company two machines subject to the condition that the title of the property would remain with the appellant until full payment of the purchase price, with the right to re-take possession on default of payment. Later, the Phoenix Company assigned for valuable consideration to A. B. representing the respondent company \"all (its) rights, title and interest'' in these two machines. The agreement of sale was not registered; but A. B. was aware of the above mentioned conditional sale. Default having been made on the payment of the purchase price, an action was brought by the appellant to recover from the respondent possession of the two machines.\nHeld, Brodeur and Mignault JJ. dissenting, that A. B. acquired title to the two machines subject to satisfying the appellant's \"lien\" thereon and was not \"a purchaser in good faith\" within section 1 of ch. 145 of the Revised Statutes of Saskatchewan, and that the respondent was therefore not entitled to rely on the protection of that section.\nJudgment of the Court of Appeal ([1921] 2 W.W.R. 971) reversed, Brodeur and Mignault JJ. dissenting. APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan[1], affirming the judgment of Brown C.J. at the trial[2] and dismissing the appellants' action.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions in issue are fully stated in the above head-note and in the judgments now reported.\nShapley and Huycke for the appellant.\nGregory K.C. and Hodges for the respondent.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014For the reasons stated by my brother Anglin, in which I fully concur, I would allow this appeal with costs throughout.\nIdington J.\u2014The question raised herein by this appeal is whether or not the respondent can be held to have been a purchaser of the property in question in good faith, for valuable consideration as against the appellant.\nThe answer depends upon the construction to be given section 2, sub-section (1) of the \"Conditional Sales Act\" of Saskatchewan, which reads as follows:\n2 (1) Whenever on a sale or bailment of goods of the value of $15 or over it is agreed, provided or conditioned that the right of property or right of possession in whole or in part shall remain in the seller or bailor notwithstanding that the actual possession of the goods passes to the buyer or bailee the seller or bailor shall not be permitted to set up any such right of property or right of possession as against any purchaser or mortgagee of or from the buyer or bailee of such goods in good faith for valuable consideration or as against judgments, executions or attachments against the purchaser or bailee unless such sale or bailment with such agreement, proviso or condition is in writing signed by the bailee or his agent and registered as hereinafter provided. Such writing shall contain such a description of the goods the subject of the bailment that the same may be readily and easily known and distinguished. The respondent, through its agent who transacted all the relevant parts of the business of the respondent, had actual notice of the appellant having agreed to sell the machine in question, and accessories thereto, to the Ph\u0153nix Publishing Company, Limited, subject to appellant's right to re-take possession on default of payment of the price, or any part thereof, or other breach of the conditions of intended sale.\nThat company, subject to such conditions, sold the rights it had in the machine to one A.B., who, in turn, sold to the Northern Publishing Company, Limited.\nThe Ph\u0153nix Publishing Company, Limited, having got into financial difficulties in the course of their business as publishers of a newspaper and printing business akin thereto, said A.B., acting as solicitor for others, investigated the financial and other conditions of the company with the object of buying for his clients the entire business and assets of said company. In the course of doing so he was given a list of the machines it was possessed of and of much other property acquired on course of said business.\nIn that list of machines there were set forth the respective liens, against each, and its accessories, including a lien of $4,500.00 on the machine in question in favour of appellant.\nThe learned trial judge refers thereto, and to the resultant bargain, as follows:\u2014\nThe evidence in this case discloses the fact that when Mr. A. B. first visited Saskatoon in May and consulted with the parties representing the Ph\u0153nix Publishing Co. that he was given a statement indicating the liabilities of the Ph\u0153nix Publishing Co. and more particularly indicating the parties who had Hens against the plant or any parts of it, including the lien of the plaintiff company. It is also clear from the evidence that at that time the purchase price of $15,000.00 for the plant was named, the price that was subsequently entered in the formal agreement and paid. So that I think it is a fair inference to make that in fixing the price of $15,000.00 for this plant, the vendors, the Phoenix Publishing Co. or the parties representing them, took into consideration all the liens which were detailed in the statement, including the plaintiff's lien. So that to some extent, at least, the lien was a factor in the deal.\nMr. Justice Lamont, in his judgment in the Court of Appeal, says:\u2014\n\"On June 17th, 1918, A. B., acting for the persons who subsequently became incorporated as the defendant company, purchased certain assets of the Ph\u0153nix Publishing Company for $15,000. These assets were valued at $40,000, but against them there were liens amounting to $23,355.\"\nA. B., by way of verifying this basis of the bargain he was trying to make, and did make, searched the office where liens might be registered and found the appellant had not registered any lien.\nIt seems to me quite clear that when the bargain was made between him and the company on the above basis he was not buying the actual goods of any of those lien holders, free from the several respective liens thereon, but the interest of the company therein subject thereto, and that he thoroughly understood the nature and purpose of the following resolution, and especially the reference therein to liens, passed by the shareholders of the company:\u2014\nResolved that resolution of the directors with respect to the sale of the plant, equipment, accessories and franchises of the Ph\u0153nix Publishing Company, Limited, to A. B. be and is hereby confirmed, provided that the said A. B. make arrangements re liens held on the plant, including the Hoe press, papers held in trust for the John Martin Paper Company, as shall be satisfactory to the directors, and such arrangements regarding wages and rent, as shall be mutually satisfactory to the employees, the landlord and the directors and that the directors be and are hereby authorized to conclude the sale of the equipment, plant, accessories and franchises, etc., of the company, except current accounts for advertising purposes. He was at the meeting \"in and out\" as he expresses it, and received a copy of that resolution.\nIndeed the respondent company was promoted, and its incorporation obtained, by him, and he was one of the provisional directors and later its president, when the deal now in question was carried out.\nThe special reference to the hen on the Hoe Press, in said resolution, arose by reason of some of those concerned in the Ph\u0153nix Company having become personally liable.\nThe following evidence of Mr. Lynd is illuminating as he was president of the Ph\u0153nix Company at the time in question:\nQ. Had that been discussed with Mr. A. B. at that time?\nA. As I said, the question of liens was discussed, but there was no definite understanding arrived at with regard to the liens.\nQ. What arrangements was Mr. A. B. to make regarding the liens?\nMr. Mackenzie: He said there was none arrived at.\nA. As I understood it at the time, Mr. A. B. was to make his own arrangements regarding the liens with the exception of the Hoe press, which he actually agreed to take care of.\nQ. What do you mean by \"his own arrangements?\"\nA. My understanding of it at that time was if he got the machinery he would pay the liens, or make arrangements to settle them in some way, and if he didn't, he would try to make some arrangements with the parties who held them. That was my understanding.\nQ. If he kept the machines he would pay the liens?\nA. Or make settlement with the lien holders.\n***\nQ. What were the assets of the Ph\u0153nix Publishing Co. at that time?\nA. We estimated that the whole thing was worth, outside of the mailing list, which at that time was not worth very much, we estimated the plant to be worth $40,000.\nQ. And did the Northern Publishing Co. assume any of the general accounts at all, any of the general liabilities?\nA. No, I don't think so. I don't think they assumed any liabilities.\nQ. If the assets were worth $40,000, can you tell us why the sale was made for $15,000?\nA. The question of liens was taken into consideration, the liens on the plant. Q. What liens?\nA. As far as the Ph\u0153nix Publishing Co. were concerned they took into consideration all the liens that were on the plant at arriving at the figures.\n***\nQ. Mr. A. B. says that the only arrangement was that the directors were to be relieved from liability.\nA. I think it went a little further. I think the Hoe press was to be taken care of, so that the directors would be relieved from liability.\nQ. And what about the other liens?\nA. We made no specific arrangement with him regarding them, but my understanding was he would decide himself, or the persons for whom he was acting, would decide whether they would keep the rest of the plant, because there was some question as to whether they needed it at that time.\nHis Lordship: There was nothing as to relieving your company from liability?\nA. No, my lord. We were not relieved in any way.\nQ. Were you as a director, or you, with other directors, asked to recoup the Northern Publishing Co. for any moneys paid on these liens?\nA. No. Not so far as I was concerned.\n***\nHis Lordship: Would it be correct to put it this way that as far as the liens were concerned, you had given Mr. A. B. full notice of the liens so that there was no come-back to your company?\nA. He knew about the liens.\nHis Lordship: But he was to take his chances\u2014\nA. That was my understanding of it. If he wanted the machinery he would take care of the liens, and make settlement in some way, and if not, he would try and arrange to send it back. That was my understanding.\nHis Lordship: And if he could get the machinery without having to pay for it so much the better?\nA. We didn't discuss that. As a matter of fact the Lanston Monotype were about the best creditors the Ph\u0153nix Co. ever had, and it was my impression when the Northern Publishing Co. refused to pay they were not quite keeping faith with us.\nIn the result that followed all the liens except that of the appellant were recognized and dealt with in the spirit which this evidence indicates was expected.\nI repeat it seems to me abundantly clear that the purchase by respondent was made on the basis of $40,000 being about the fair value of that being sold, and if all the lien holders could be settled with on a fair basis the purchase price might have been fixed at that sum. Evidently some of the properties owned were possibly in value not quite up to the respective amount of the liens thereof. Hence that phase of the bargain was left open and when it came to a formal assignment the consideration was named therein as $15,000.00.\nI am quite unable to believe that such sum was intended to cover the actual value of the plant, or any part thereof, subject to liens, as if free from liens; but on the contrary that it was the sum named for the residue of what passed thereby and the possible interest of the Ph\u0153nix Company in all the plant covered by liens.\nAnd if so I fail to see wherein this case can fall within any of the several cases relied upon which trace back to the case of Moffatt v. Coulson[3].\nIn that case the learned Chief Justice of that court in his opinion laid down as a test the following:\nI think he should be so held for there seems to me no reason to doubt upon the evidence that he paid in good faith, in this sense that he paid a fair consideration for the horse which is in question and did not buy him collusively in order to assist the mortgagors in placing him.\nThe words I have italicized in order to call attention to the gist of what was in the mind of the Chief Justice as a test, are not fitted to anything analogous thereto in what we find in above quoted evidence in this case by way of fact to pass upon.\nEvidently in that and each of the cases following it and relied upon there was something in way of a basis of valuable consideration in that sense so given, whereas herein if respondent is to have its way it gets a four thousand five hundred dollar machine and its accessories for nothing but the fair value of the chances of defrauding the appellant by invoking the words of the statute which do not fit the facts and the law as laid down in the case upon which Ferrie v. Meikle[4], seems to have been supposed to be founded.\nEven if the mode of thought of that far off day in administering the common law is applicable, I hold in this case that on the facts the respondent has failed to establish a case within the meaning thereof and hence the appeal should be allowed.\nIndeed all that the assignment by the Ph\u0153nix Company pretends to convey is the interest of that company in the goods in question and despite the recital I think, reading the instrument as a whole, that is all that was intended to be conveyed and hence no foundation for respondent's pretensions herein.\nThis case does not at all need a decision upon the many varying views that may be presented of the above quoted statute for there is not enough of common honesty at the basis of the pretensions set up on the facts to bring the claim so made as within the term \"good faith.\"\nI, however, lest from the foregoing I should be thought to be agreeing in the law as presented by the court below, do not hesitate to say that I cannot agree with the view of the law as expressed in the decision of the case of Ferrie v. Meikle4.\nI am of the opinion that in any jurisdiction where the common law and equity doctrines are to be administered by the same court, and when in case of conflict the equitable doctrines are to prevail, that ever since Le Neve v. Le Neve[5], the doctrine therein and in the numerous decisions since and founded thereon must be applied in construing a statute such as that in question herein. Apply that to this and the facts herein, and then the respondent's contention seems hopeless.\nI am, however, confining my opinion to the case of actual notice which is not to be confounded with constructive notice.\nThe discarding of the former seems so like fraud as to be beyond good faith but the application of constructive notice does not seem to me as necessarily so, within the range of the ordinary intelligence of mankind.\nYet I am not to be taken as in any way discarding or treating with contempt the doctrine of constructive notice. I merely desire to indicate that difference between actual and constructive notice which exists or might exist in applying such a statute as that before us.\nI think this appeal should be allowed with costs throughout and judgment given as prayed for by the appellant.\nDuff J.\u2014By a contract dated the 11th March, 1915, the appellant company agreed with the Ph\u0153nix Publishing Company, Ltd., of Saskatoon\nto sell for the sum of $4,120.80 to the Ph\u0153nix Publishing Company, Ltd., * * * two of its casting machines\nand certain accessories. The Ph\u0153nix Company agreed to buy the property specified, to pay the purchase price in specified instalments for which promissory notes were to be given. The contract further provided that a mortgage should be given to secure the deferred payments and until a mortgage was given, (an event which never happened), or the purchase money was fully paid, the title of the property was to remain with the appellant company who, in case of default, was to have the right to take immediate possession. It was further agreed that the Ph\u0153nix Company\nshall not assign this contract nor underlet or subhire the said property without the written consent\nof the appellant company. On the 17th of June, 1918, the Ph\u0153nix Company executed a deed to which the other party was Mr. A. B., by which the company professed to assign \"all the right, title and interest\" in and to certain goods and chattels including the property which was the subject of the previous purchase from the appellant company. This document contained covenants for the title and covenants for further assurance.\nDefault was made in respect of the payments of the purchase money due under the contract between the appellant company and the Ph\u0153nix Company. The respondent company which had received possession of the goods from the Ph\u0153nix Company sets up a title to retain them notwithstanding the terms of the last mentioned contract by reason of the provisions of sec. 1 of ch. 145 of the R. S. Sask. of 1909 as a purchaser of the property \"in good faith for valuable consideration.\"\nThe Court of Appeal held, being constrained as it thought by a judgment of the full court of Saskatchewan delivered in Ferrie v. Meikle[6], that the respondent company was a purchaser in good faith within the meaning of the statute and consequently that its rights were not affected by the agreement between the appellant company and the Ph\u0153nix Company. The learned judges who concurred in this judgment would have been disposed, as appears from the reasons of Mr. Justice Lamont, to take the view that when a purchaser relies upon this provision of the statute it is in every case a question of fact to be decided upon the circumstances in evidence whether or not the purchaser did in fact act in good faith and that if he failed to establish honesty in fact then his plea under the statute must fail. They gave judgment in favour of the respondent company in deference, however, to the opinion expressed in a previous decision that in order to exclude a purchaser from the benefit of the statute it must appear that the sale was a collusive one in the sense that it was simulated with the object of protecting the possessor of the property from proceedings by the holder of the lien. I shall give my reasons presently for thinking that the view upon which I conclude the Court of Appeal would have acted if the question had been res nova is preferable to that to which it felt itself constrained to give effect because of the previous decision. Before proceeding to that question it is convenient to point out that there are excellent reasons for rejecting the hypothesis that the gentlemen concerned in the transaction in question were actuated by any dishonest intention\u2014 an hypothesis which one is naturally slow to adopt.\nI am disposed to take the view that the parties never really intended to do anything more than to place the respondent company in the shoes of the Ph\u0153nix Company in relation to its agreement with the appellant company; in other words that the transfer was subject to the appellant company's rights. The bill of sale does in truth, as I have said, contain covenants for title and further assurance; but the learned trial judge has found as a fact that the arrangement between the parties was that the Ph\u0153nix Company was not to be responsible as upon a warranty of title in the event of the appellant company enforcing its rights. It is quite true that the learned judge also finds that the respondent company was to be under no obligation to indemnify the Ph\u0153nix Company in respect of the appellant company's claim. This was probably regarded as a matter of no consequence; the Ph\u0153nix Company being destitute of assets, would be a most unlikely object of legal pursuit.\nI gather that if the question had arisen as between the parties to the bill of sale the learned trial judge would have rectified the instrument; but that is of no importance because as between the appellant company and the respondent company for the purpose of determining any question arising under the statute touching the respondent company's status as a bona fide purchaser we are concerned only with the actual agreement, that is to say, with the intention of the parties and for that purpose we are entitled and bound to look at all the facts including oral expressions as well as writings. I am disposed to think that in essence the transaction was a transfer subject to the appellant company's rights under its agreement; and in that view it is quite clear that the statute has no application, the respondent company being a purchaser only of such rights as the Ph\u0153nix Company was entitled to transfer under its agreement with the appellant company, was not a purchaser of the property within the meaning of the statute. As against the appellant company, the Ph\u0153nix Company has possession and a right to retain possession until disturbed by the appellant company under the terms of the agreement and the right to acquire a title upon satisfying the conditions of the agreement. It could no doubt and did transfer the actual possession of the goods but its right of possession under the agreement(like all other rights under it) it was disabled by the terms of the agreement itself from transferring. The respondent company could not even become a bailee consistently with the provisions of the Ph\u0153nix Company's contract. On this hypothesis then the defence invoked by the respondent company patently fails. The alternative hypothesis is that the respondent company intended to buy and the Ph\u0153nix Company intended to sell upon the terms set forth in the bill of sale, that is to say that the parties intended that the respondent company should be placed in possession of the property as owner free from the claim of the appellant company. In considering that hypothesis the finding of the trial judge becomes important that the claim of the appellant company against the Ph\u0153nix Company was taken into account in fixing the price. It is important also to note that the effect of the transaction as a whole between the Ph\u0153nix Company and the appellant company was to denude the Ph\u0153nix Company of its assets. The purpose and intent of the transaction therefore upon this hypothesis was (notwithstanding the fact that the Ph\u0153nix Company had no title but only a bare possession coupled with a right of possession which it was not entitled to transfer) for a consideration altogether disproportionate to the value of the property, to place the respondent company in possession as owner. The respondent relied upon the statute no doubt and the judicial interpretation of the statute for protection against the appellant company's claim. Such conduct on part of the Ph\u0153nix Company would be an unlawful act in the sense that it would be a breach of contract and also in the sense that it would be a tort; and as the thing was done behind the back of the appellant company it was, if this hypo- thesis furnishes the true interpretation of that conduct, a flagrant breach of faith and the participation of the respondent company in these things was essential to effectuate the intention of the parties. It is quite true that the respondent company's agent declares that he had never seen the Ph\u0153nix Company's agreement with the appellant company. The fact that he failed to examine the agreement could not lend a more favourable colour to what occurred.\nCan it be said that a litigant having purchased goods under such circumstances has brought himself within the statutory description of \"purchaser in good faith for valuable consideration\"? If these words are to receive the interpretation which would everywhere be ascribed to them according to common usage, the answer is of course in the negative. Is there any good ground then for giving some colour to the meaning of these very plain words which, in such circumstances, would enable a purchaser to establish successfully in a court of law that although he knowingly participated in a dishonest dealing he was still in respect of that dealing a person who has acted in good faith within the meaning of this enactment?\nI think the earlier decision of the Court of Saskatchewan cannot be sustained. It rests upon a Manitoba decision, Roff v. Krecker[7], placing a construction upon a certain provision of a Chattel Mortgage Act in force in Manitoba which in turn rested upon two decisions, one a decision of the Upper Canada Court of Queen's Bench, Moffatt v. Colson[8], the other a decision, or I should rather say some language of Lord Justice James in Vane v. Vane[9]. With great respect I am unable to agree that either the Upper Canada decision or the language of Lord Justice James has any relevancy whatever to the question now before us which concerns the meaning of certain words in a \"Conditional Sales Act\" in force in Saskatchewan. The courts in both cases and indeed the same may be said of the Manitoba decision as well, were concerned with the construction of language found in contexts entirely different and the two earlier pronouncements upon which the Manitoba court proceeded are explicitly based upon considerations quite foreign to the interpretation of those words in the context in which they now appear. The judgment of Robinson C.J. in Moffatt v. Colson[10] shews that the purchaser was in fact acting in good faith in the sense that he paid full value for the property he bought; that he had no actual knowledge of the chattel mortgage which the mortgagee was seeking to enforce against him, but only a vague intimation from a third person that the stock he was buying was mortgaged stock; and in fact the description in the mortgage was quite insufficient to indentify the stock purchased as part of the property comprised in it and it was held in these circumstances that the mortagee must fail. The only relevant observation is the observation of the learned Chief Justice that the transaction was a transaction in good faith in the sense that it was not entered into collusively with the object of protecting the mortgagor but that it was a purchase for fair consideration. Virtually in that case it was found that there was in fact no dishonesty on the part of the purchaser. In Vane v. Vane[11] the question which Lord Justice James was considering at p. 399 in the observations relied upon in the Manitoba decision was the meaning of the phrase bona fide in this collocation: bona fide purchaser for valuable consideration who at the time of the purchase did not know and had no reason to believe that such a fraud had been committed,\nand his observations have reference solely to that question. They can afford no guidance to the construction of the words we are now called upon to construe.\nIt may very well be argued that both the Manitoba decisions and the Upper Canada decision can be adduced in support of a contention that for the purpose of applying the phrase purchaser in good faith when found in a modern statute one is not to govern one's self by the rules established in the Court of Chancery in relation to notice and the effect of notice. I do not in the least dissent from that; indeed, I think it is most important in construing modern statutes where questions arise as to the application of such expressions, to remember that good faith is a matter of fact and the existence or non-existence of it must be decided as a question of fact. It should be observed further that the Manitoba decision was a decision upon not a conditional sales Act but upon a statute dealing with a different subject; and it is always dangerous, as Sir George Jessel in Hack v. London Provident Building Society[12] pointed out, to construe the words of one statute by reference to the interpretation which has been placed upon words bearing a general similarity to them in another statute dealing with a different subject matter. It would, I think, be an insupportable presumption that the legislature of Saskatchewan in enacting the \"Conditional Sales Act\" was taking into account the judicial deliverances we have just been discussing. One further point remains. In 1897 a change took place in the phraseology of the \"Conditional Sales Act\" of the North West Territories. I think this change is not without significance, I think it lends point to the observation made above with regard to the equitable doctrine of notice. The legislature has substituted the condition of the existence of good faith for the condition of want of notice, but I am unable to see that this alteration throws any light upon the question we are now called upon to decide.\nThe appeal should be allowed.\nAnglin J.\u2014With profound respect for the learned trial judge and the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan, I am disposed to think that when the true nature of the transaction which took place between the Ph\u0153nix Publishing Company and A. B., representing the Northern Publishing Co., is appreciated, the latter company is not entitled to the protection of s. 1 of c. 145 of the Revised Statutes of Saskatchewan, 1909, as \"a purchaser in good faith for valuable consideration\" of the goods in question in this action, against the assertion of a \"right of property\" therein made by the plaintiff company. The plaintiff's \"right of property\" is for convenience spoken of in the record as its lien.\nThat A. B. bought from the Ph\u0153nix Publishing Company as a trustee for the persons who were then incorporating the Northern Publishing Company and with the intent of acquiring the property for that company admits of no doubt. The Northern Publishing Company can have no higher right to the protection of the statute invoked than was acquired by A. B.\nThe learned trial judge found that, while A. B. gave no undertaking to pay off liens on the Phoenix Company's plant (other than that on the Hoe Press) he took the plant subject to the chance whether the liens, including that of the plaintiff, (of the claims for which he was fully apprised) would or could be asserted in respect of it and without any right to be protected against them by the Ph\u0153nix Company. But in my opinion the evidence goes much farther. From the testimony of Mr. Lynn, the President of the Ph\u0153nix Company, who is accredited by the learned trial judge, I extract these passages:\nQ. Was there any arrangement made between the Ph\u0153nix Publishing Co. regarding liens on the plant?\nA. No. I would not say there was any arrangement made with him, but the question of liens was discussed.\nQ. Yes?\nA. I know this, that it was mentioned at that time that if Mr. A. B.\u2014if they\u2014if Mr. A. B. didn't want to take the machinery he would not have to pay for it, and there was no real arrangement made only in regard to the Hoe Press. The liens were mentioned all right.\nQ. There was a minute of the shareholders. Just read that.\nA. I might say prior to this that the directors had already met and gone over it with Mr. A. B., and we called a meeting of the shareholders for the purpose of having our action before the shareholders insisting that this provision should be put in there.\nQ. What provision?\nA. Provided that the said A. B. make arrangements re liens held on the plant, including the Hoe Press, papers held in trust for the John Martin Paper Company, as shall be satisfactory to the directors.\nQ. Had that been discussed with Mr. A. B. at that time?\nA. As I said, the question of liens was discussed, but there was no definite understanding arrived at with regard to the liens.\nQ. What arrangement was Mr. A. B. to make regarding the liens?\nMr. Mackenzie: He said there was none arrived at.\nA. As I understood it at the time, Mr. A. B. was to make his own arrangements regarding the liens with the exception of the Hoe Press, which he actually agreed to take care of.\nQ. What do you mean by \"his own arrangements?\"\nA. My understanding of it at that time was if he got the machinery he would pay the liens or make arrangements to settle them in some way, and if he didn't, he would try to make some arrangements with the parties who held them. That was my understanding.\nQ. If he kept the machines he would pay the liens?\nA. Or make settlement with the lien holders.\n*** Q. If the assets were worth $40,000, can you tell us why the sale was made for $15,000?\nA. The question of liens was taken into consideration, the liens on the plant\nQ. What liens?\nA. As far as the Ph\u0153nix Publishing Company were concerned, they took into consideration all the liens that were on the plant in arriving at the figures.\n***\nQ. And what about the other liens?\nA. We made no specific arrangement with him regarding them, but my understanding was he would decide himself, or the persons for whom he was acting would decide, whether they would keep the rest of the plant, because there was some question as to whether they needed it at that time.\nHis Lordship: There was nothing as to relieving your company from liability?\nA. No, my lord. We were not relieved in any way.\n***\nQ. In any event, as far as the liens were concerned, he was to deal with the lien holders and do the best he could?\nA. Well, yes.\nQ. And you say there was no arrangement outside of the written agreement?\nA. Between the Ph\u0153nix Publishing Co. and A.B.?\nQ. Yes.\nA No. No definite arrangement.\nQ. No arrangement?\nA. No.\nHis Lordship: Except as to the Hoe machine?\nA. Yes. And I may say further, that the shareholders understood that the lien was assumed. Whether Mr. A. B. was there or not I do not know. I know the directors got the impression that any machinery that was kept by the company by him would be taken care of.\nQ. That was the expectation?\nA. I think it was more than that; That was the understanding we got of it.\"\nIn A.B.'s evidence I find this corroboration:\u2014\n\"Q. You knew when you entered into that agreement you had to pay all these liens in order to get the rest of the plant, didn't you?\nA. There was a question if we would need the rest of it.\nQ. Then you would not get it?\nA. We would not need it.\nQ. And the vendors would get back their plant, wouldn't they?\nA. I presume so. Q. You were buying the whole plant, including the plant subject to liens, for $15,000?\nA. We bought everything that was included in that schedule for $15,000, and I was particularly instructed that we were not to assume any of those liens, and I had a partial understanding with regard to the Hoe press.\nQ And, notwithstanding that, your company paid liens to the extent of $15,000?\nA. It might have been that another plant would be necessary.\nQ. Did you ever request the Ph\u0153nix Company or did your company request the Ph\u0153nix Co. to refund any part of that $15,000?\nA. I didn't.\nQ. Do you know if your company did? That is, the defendant company?\nA. Not that I know of.\"\nMoreover in the bill of sale itself from the Ph\u0153nix Company to A. B. although the recital and the covenants are consistent with an absolute sale of the entire plant, the operative words of sale and transfer are restricted to\nall the right, title and interest of the bargainor in and to all the goods, etc.\nWhatever might be the situation in a controversy between the parties to this bill of sale, I am satisfied that as between the litigants now before us we should ascertain and be guided by the true nature of the transaction between the Phoenix Company and A. B. as disclosed by the whole of the evidence.\nWhile I have little doubt that A. B. when taking the transfer from the Ph\u0153nix Company had the intention of cutting out the unrecorded claim of the plaintiff by invoking the statute, I incline to think he failed to put himself in a position to effectuate that purpose.\nHad the transaction in fact been an absolute sale of the goods here in question to A. B. I should have felt called upon to consider very seriously whether what he did was not such an attempt to use the statute to accomplish a fraud on the plaintiff as this court, which is a court of equity, should strain its resources to frustrate. But the real bargain between A. B. and the Phoenix Company as to the plant in possession of the latter covered by liens (other than the Hoe Press as to which he agreed to protect his vendor) was that he would be at liberty to take it or not, in whole or in part, as he should find expedient; that in respect of whatever he took he would pay off, or otherwise arrange with, the lien-holders; and that what he did not take in that way, as he himself says, the vendors (i.e., the lien-holders) would get back. That being his position as to the goods now in question he was in my opinion not a purchaser of them in good faith for valuable consideration in any sense which would entitle him to the protection of s. 1 of c. 145 of the Revised Statutes of Saskatchewan.\nI would therefore allow this appeal with costs throughout and direct judgment for the plaintiff for possession of the goods described in the statement of claim. There should also be judgment for $5 as nominal damages for wrongful detention thereof unless the plaintiff prefers to take a reference to ascertain what actual damages it has sustained. Should it do so, the costs of the reference and further directions should be reserved to be disposed of by the Supreme Court of Saskatchewan.\nBrodeur J. (dissenting).\u2014If it were not for the decisions which have been quoted, I would have been of the view that the Northern Publishing Company and A. B. could not prevent the Lanston Monotype Company from taking possession of the goods in question. But the construction put on the statute by the courts in Ontario, in Manitoba and in England gives to the words \"buyer in good faith for valuable consideration\" a meaning which precludes me from giving to these words the construction which otherwise I would have put on them. The purchasers knew that the appellant company had a lien on these goods when they bought them from the Ph\u0153nix Company. They had notice that the Ph\u0153nix Company did not own them. However the jurisprudence seems to be well established that a purchaser in good faith means a real purchaser as distinguished from a collusive one, that the knowledge of an unregistered lien would not constitute the purchaser in bad faith. Moffatt v. Coulson[13]; Vane v. Vane[14]; Roff v. Krecher[15]; Ferry v. Meikle[16].\nI may add that this construction should not affect the well settled doctrine and jurisprudence in Quebec concerning art. 2251 of the Civil Code. Dessert v. Robidoux[17]; Les commissaires d'Ecoles de St. Alexis v. Price[18]; Renouf v. Cot\u00e9[19].\nFor these reasons the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nMignault J. (dissenting)\u2014The question here is whether a conditional sale of certain chattels with retention of ownership, which was not registered as required by chapter 145 of the Revised Statutes of Saskatchewan, 1909, can be set up against the respondent, the purchaser of these chattels. Only a brief reference to the facts is necessary. The appellant, in 1911, sold the chattels in question, a monotype machine and accessories, to one Aiken, publisher of the Ph\u0153nix newspaper in Saskatoon. Aiken disposed of these chattels (some of which had been changed by the appellant) to the Ph\u0153nix Publishing Company, Limited, which subsequently, in March, 1915, entered into a contract of purchase with the appellant, reserving to the latter the title to the property until the purchase price was fully paid. This contract of conditional sale was never registered.\nIn May, 1918, some parties interested in the Ph\u0153nix newspaper sought to purchase the plant and assets of the Ph\u0153nix company, and, at their request, Mr. A. B. went to Saskatoon and negotiated the proposed sale with the directors of the Ph\u0153nix Company. He obtained a statement of the assets and liabilities of the company, shewing the Hens affecting its property. There were five Hens, comprising that of the appellant, figured at $4,500. Of these liens, three were registered, those of R. Hoe and Co., (for which certain directors of the Phoenix Company were personally liable), of Canadian Linotype Co. and of Miller and Richard. The lien of Hettle Drennan Co. for $2,800.00 was apparently not registered, but Mr. A. B. says this firm was in possession and had to be settled with to get their goods. The appellant's lien, as I have said, was not registered.\nA resolution was adopted by the shareholders of the Ph\u0153nix Company authorizing the directors to sell to Mr. A. B. its plant, equipment, accessories and franchises,\nprovided that the said A. B. make arrangements re Hens held on the plant, including the Hoe Press. The sale price was $15,000.00. Later a formal agreement of sale was signed by the parties, no mention being made therein of any hens. It appears to have been understood that Mr. A. B. would look after the claim of R. Hoe and Co. for the Hoe press, and free the directors from any personal liability. As to the other liens, the learned trial judge found, and I fully agree with him after carefully reading the testimony, that, while it seemed to be understood that A. B. and those for whom he purchased were to take care of the Hoe press lien and to protect the directors against any possible action that might arise out of it, there was no such understanding as to the rest of the liens. The learned trial judge added that the purchasers took the plant and assumed any chance of the possibility of the lien holders asserting their liens.\nThis purchase was made by Mr. A. B. on behalf of the respondent company which was immediately constituted under the Saskatchewan Company legislation, Mr. A. B. becoming its first president. A formal transfer of the plant was made to it by Mr. A. B. After taking possession, the respondent, beside the purchase price, paid approximatively $15,000.00 in discharging liens on the plant, but the appellant's claim was not settled.\nThe question now is whether the appellant is entitled to assert its non-registered lien against the respondent. Section 1 of chapter 145, of the revised statutes of Saskatchewan, provides as follows:\nWhenever on a sale or bailment of goods of the value of $15 or over it is agreed, provided or conditioned that the right of property or right of possession in whole or in part shall remain in the seller or bailor notwithstanding that the actual possession of the goods passes to the buyer or bailee the seller or bailor shall not be permitted to set up any such right of property or right of possession as against any purchaser or mortgagee of or from the buyer or bailee of such goods in good faith for valuable consideration or as against judgments, executions or attachments against the purchaser or bailee unless such sale or bailment with such agreement, proviso or condition is in writing signed by the bailee or his agent and registered as hereinafter provided. Such writing shall contain such a description of the goods the subject of the bailment that the same may be readily and easily known and distinguished.\nBy section 2 of the same statute, it is provided that the agreement of sale shall be registered in the office of the registration clerk for chattel mortgages where the buyer or bailee resides within thirty days from the time of actual delivery of the goods.\nUnder section 1 the question is whether A. B. or the respondent company was a purchaser in good faith for valuable consideration. The learned trial judge, had he not considered himself bound by the authorities to which I will refer, would have thought not, and this view was shared by Mr. Justice Lamont in the Court of Appeal. I do not however think that either the ' learned trial judge or Mr. Justice Lamont considered that Mr. A. B. had acted fraudulently, and from my reading of the evidence I am quite clear that no case of fraud was made out, and none was alleged, the statement of claim merely asserting unlawful detention. The whole point is whether A. B., having purchased these goods with notice of the appellant's lien, was a purchaser in good faith for valuable consideration, and both courts have considered that nothing in the facts of this case would take the matter out of the operation of the rule laid down in the cases to which I will refer. There is no doubt that A. B. and the respondent gave a valuable consideration for the sale, to wit the $15,000.00 which was paid in cash.\nAs long ago as 1860, the Ontario Court of Queen's Bench held in Moffat v. Coulson[20] that a chattel mortgage not containing a sufficient description of the goods is void as against subsequent purchasers in good faith, and that notice of such a mortgage to the purchaser will not affect his right. This decision is relied on because, in the Upper Canada statute there under consideration (20 Vict., Can., ch. 3), the words\nsubsequent purchasers or mortgagees in good faith for valuable consideration\nwere defined. Chief Justice Robinson said:\nThe only question is whether this defendant should be held to be a subsequent purchaser in good faith, within the meaning of the second section, in which case only would he be entitled to hold against the mortgage, in consequence of the defective description of the horses. I think he should be so held, for there seems to be no reason to doubt upon the evidence that he bought in good faith, in this sense, that he paid a fair consideration for the horse which is in question, and did not buy him collusively, in order to assist the mortgagors in placing him out of the plaintiff's reach. ****** In our registry laws, the words \"purchaser for valuable consideration'' have never been held by courts of common law to exclude purchasers with notice of the unregistered conveyance.\nIn Manitoba, in 1892, the Court of Queen's Bench held in Roff v. Krecker[21] that a second chattel mortgage made in good faith, and for valuable consideration, takes priority over a prior unfiled chattel mortgage, even if the second mortgagee has actual notice of the prior mortgage. The Manitoba statute 48 Vict., ch. 35, amending a prior statute containing the words \"without actual notice\" which were struck out, used the expression\npurchasers or mortgagees in good faith for valuable consideration.\nChief Justice Taylor relied on the English case of Edwards v. Edwards[22] decided under the English Bills of Sale Act, 17-18 Vict., ch. 36, the first section of which provided that every bill of sale should be registered within a certain time, otherwise it should be null and void to all intents and purposes against, among others, sheriff's officers and other persons seizing any property or effects comprised in such bill of sale, in execution of any process. Referring to this case, the learned Chief Justice said:\u2014\nThe court there held that the fact that an execution creditor was, at the time his debt was contracted, aware that his debtor had given a bill of sale did not prevent his availing himself of the objection that it had not been registered. LeNeve v. LeNeve[23] was there cited and relied on, but James L.J., said that he thought it would be dangerous to engraft an equitable exception upon a modern Act of Parliament. Mellish L.J., agreed with him saying \"we ought not to put such constructions on modern Acts of Parliament\"\nFurther on the learned Chief Justice said:\nIt seems to me that under the authorities, the plaintiff being a purchaser in good faith for valuable consideration, his having had notice of the defendant's prior but unfiled mortgage is not material, and he is entitled to the protection of the statute.\nDubuc J and Killam J. concurred in this view, the latter with some reluctance. He was however impressed by the fact that the words \"without actual notice\" had been omitted when the statute was amended in 1885. He expressed the hope that the legislature would restore the statute to its previous position as respects this question of notice. This however was not done, as the present Manitoba Bills of Sale and Chattel Mortgage Act, R.S.M., 1913, ch. 17, shews.\nWe have therefore in two provinces, Ontario and Manitoba, authoritative decisions laying down that notice of a prior bill of sale or chattel mortgage does not prevent the subsequent purchaser for a valuable consideration from being a purchaser in good faith. The same construction has been adopted in the province of Saskatchewan. There the court of appeal held in Ferrie v. Meikle[24] that a purchaser in good faith and for a valuable consideration of chattels comprised in an unregistered lien note obtains a good title thereto, even though he has notice of the existence of the lien note. The court there followed Moffat v. Coulson[25] and Roff v. Krecken[26].\nShould we now overrule these decisions which have settled the law in three provinces of the Dominion? For my part, even were I of a contrary opinion, I would feel extreme reluctance to overrule long standing decisions which have emphasized the necessity of registration of chattel mortgages and liens on personal property. To do so would be to disturb rights acquired in the belief that these long unquestioned decisions correctly stated the law.\nMoreover we find in Saskatchewan the same development of the statutory law as in Manitoba. Ordinance No. 8 of the Northwest Territories in 1889, concerning receipt-notes, hire-receipts and orders for chattels, rendered the agreement, in the absence of registration, of no effect against any mortgagee or bona fide purchaser without notice. These words \"without notice\" were omitted by Ordinance No. 39 of 1897, section 1 of which is in the same terms as section 1 of chapter 145 R.S. Sask. (1909), and it does not seem possibleto disregard, in the construction of the statute as it now reads, the omission of these words in the new enactment.\nOn this question of statutory construction I have come to the conclusion to accept the interpretation placed on the words\npurchasers or mortgagees in good faith for valuable consideration. It is very important that the courts should respond to the efforts made by the legislature to require the registration of bills of sale, chattel mortgages and lien notes. And, for my part, I cannot concur in a construction which would give to notice or knowledge of a prior non-registered lien the same effect, against a purchaser who has on the faith of the registry bought goods and paid therefor, as the registration required by the statute.\nIt is contended that Mr. A. B. bought merely such rights as the Ph\u0153nix Company had in these goods. I think he bought the goods themselves, and the trial judge so held. It follows that the respondent is entitled to rely on the protection of the statute.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Mackenzie, Thom, Basiedo & Jackson.\nSolicitors for the respondent: McCraney, MacKenzie & Hutchinson.\n[1] [1921] 2 W.W.R. 971.\n[2] [1920] 3 W.W.R. 892.\n[3] [1859] 19 U.C.Q.B. 341.\n[4] [1915] 8 Sask.

The defendant company being in liquidation, the appellant proceeded, by way of seizure in garnishment, against the respondent company which had insured the defendant company under an indemnity policy to the extent of $2,000 for each of its employees. A clause of the policy provided that no action would lie against the respondent until loss had been actually sustained and paid in money by the insured. The respondent company, as garnishee, declared that it owed nothing and the appellant contested the declaration.\nHeld that the contestation of the declaration as garnishee by the respondent company should have been maintained. Per Davies C.J. and Duff, Anglin, Brodeur and Mignault JJ.\u2014The seizure in garnishment should have been declared tenante; as, although the respondent's obligation would not be payable until the defendant company had itself paid under the appellant's judgment, the appellant was nevertheless entitled to have the seizure remain binding until this condition should be fulfilled.\nPer Idington J.\u2014The respondent's obligation was payable at the time of the seizure under the clauses of the indemnity policy.\nJudgment of the Court of King's Bench (Q.R. 32 K.B. 146) reversed.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King's Bench, appeal side, Province of Quebec[1], reversing the judgment of Weir J. and dismissing the contestation of the declaration of the respondent made in answer to a writ of seizure in garnishment.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions in issue are fully stated in the above head-note and in the judgments now reported.\nDessaulles K.C. and Morris K.C. for the appellant.\nLafleur K.C. and De Will K.C. for the respondent.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014For the reasons stated by my brother Mignault, in which I concur, I would allow this appeal.\nIdington J.\u2014The appellant is the widow of a man who when working for the Asbestos & Asbestic Co. Ltd. on the 3rd February, 1915, was accidentally killed under such circumstances as entitled her to recover on behalf of herself and children from his said employers (hereafter referred to as the \"company\") damages arising therefrom. At that time the said company held an insurance policy issued to it in the next previous 29th December by respondent assurance corporation (hereinafter referred to as the \"corporation\") to indemnify the said company against such risk to the extent of $2,000, out of a total of $10,000 provided for in the policy.\nThe corporation was, immediately after the said accident, notified by the company of the same and the death of appellant's husband resulting therefrom.\nNothing having been done by either the company or the corporation, the appellant brought on the 21st January, 1916, an action against the company to recover damages arising from the said accident.\nOn the 16th July, 1916, the company was put into liquidation under the \"Winding Up Act\" of Canada.\nIn November, 1916, the liquidator was granted by the court at Sherbrooke authority to pay a dividend of 10%.\nOn the 31st January, 1917, the liquidator also obtained from the court authority to retain a sum of $2,000 to cover the appellant's claim in the event of the said action being maintained.\nBy an order of the court on the 23rd January, 1917, the corporation, which had elected to defend appellant's action, was permitted to plead thereto in the name of the company and, accordingly, on the 28th April, 1917, filed a defence.\nThe action came for trial on the 26th of June, 1917, and resulted in judgment for the appellant of $5,000 with interest and costs against the company.\nOn or about the 9th of January, 1918, the respondent corporation paid the appellant's costs of the action but, notwithstanding the foregoing history and the attendant circumstances, refused to meet its obligation under the policy to pay the $2,000 indemnity thus established as clearly its duty, so far as I can see, falling back on the condition that the company before being entitled thereto must first hand over to appellant the two thousand dollars.\nThis I will presently revert to and deal with the legal aspects thereof in light of other conditions in the policy.\nThe appellant thereupon applied to the court for authority to issue a writ of execution by means of attaching the money in the hands of the respondent corporation as garnishee and, on the 14th September, 1917, was granted same but the said corporation made its declaration to the effect that it owed nothing to the company. Thereupon an order was made, after notice to the liquidator requiring him to contest same and his failing to do so, in the following terms:\u2014\nDoth therefore grant the said motion to the extent following, namely, the said plaintiff is hereby authorized to take in the place and stead of the defendant and liquidator the necessary suits and proceedings to recover from the said Employers' Liability Assurance Corporation Limited the amount of the judgment rendered in favour of the plaintiff against the company defendant and liquidator bearing date the 29th June, 1917: and, further, the said plaintiff is authorized on her own behalf and for and on behalf of her minor children to contest the said declaration of the said garnishee, the whole with costs to follow the final result of such litigation.\nHence the proceedings which ensued where under Mr. Justice Weir found entirely in the appellant's favour notwithstanding that the respondent corporation set up the condition F. indorsed on the policy, reading as follows:\u2014\nCondition F: No action shall lie against the corporation to recover for any loss under this policy unless it shall be brought by the assured for loss actually sustained and paid in money by the assured in satisfaction of a judgment after trial of the issue; nor unless such action is brought within ninety (90) days after final judgment against the assured has been so paid and satisfied. The corporation does not prejudice by this condition any defences against such action it may be entitled to make under this policy. The sole part of the said condition upon which said corporation now relies, or can rely, is that the defendant company had not paid the judgment by reason of the manifest impossibility of its doing so after going into insolvency and liquidation, though everything else for which the condition provided was duly fulfilled and the interest of the corporation fully protected as it stipulated for.\nThe Court of Appeal, however, reversed Mr. Justice Weir's judgment on this ground alone.\nNeither court seems to have had its attention drawn to Condition \"I\" which reads as follows:\u2014\nCondition I:\u2014If the business of the assured is placed in the hands of a receiver, assignee or trustee, whether by the voluntary act of the assured or otherwise, this policy shall immediately terminate, but such termination shall not affect the liability of the corporation as to any accidents theretofore occurring. If the assured is a corporation, a change of title, or if a firm or individual a change of title or of ownership, shall in like manner terminate this policy, unless such change is consented to by the corporation, by an indorsement thereon, signed by the manager.\nI think this must be read along with condition F., and so read I fail to find how effect can be given to the words in condition I, just quoted,\nbut such termination shall not affect the liability of the corporation as to any accidents theretofore occurring,\nunless the ceremony of the actual payment by the company itself of that established to be due is thereby impliedly to be held as dispensed with. They expressly reserve the liability. How can that liability be pretended to be reserved, if effect is to be given to the present contention, that the mere non-payment by the defunct company of the money is, under such impossible circumstances, to be held as a barrier in the way? I can hardly imagine that the corporation deliberately contrived a trick by holding out a continued liability as being assured when in fact the term relied on had become simply impossible.\nThe non-payment might properly be relied upon as a protection against a dishonest scheme on the part of the insured, but when the personality of the insured had passed away I cannot think it either honest or the true meaning of the policy read as a whole.\nI agree that all else designed in condition F. may well be needed for the protection of the corporation and must be observed, but this latter part as to the actual payment of the amount by the company I think has been eliminated or must be so if the stipulation in condition I for liability is to be given effect to.\nI would allow the appeal with costs throughout against the corporation and give judgment for the $2,000 with interest thereon from the date of the judgment given the appellant.\nDuff J.\u2014The responsibility of the respondent under the policy is conditional in the sense at all events that no action lies against them until loss has been actually sustained and paid in money. It may of course be argued that the loss, insured against, that is to say, the loss in respect of which the respondents agreed to indemnify the Asbestos Company was a loss arising by reason of payment in money to the assured in satisfaction of a judgment; that payment, in other words, is not strictly a mere condition of the obligation but part of the substratum of fact out of which the obligation arises. It does not, however, seem to me to be seriously open to doubt that the obligation constitutes a conditional indebtedness within the contemplation, of Art. 675 C.P.C. and that the insurance moneys were \"due under conditions * * * not yet fulfilled\" when the seizure was made.\nThat being so it would follow that the appellant must succeed unless it should appear that the condition is one which could not be realized. I do not think this can be affirmed. A payment in part satisfaction would clearly I think give rise to a right of indemnity and that is a contingency which can not be put aside as beyond the bounds of practical possibility.\nAnglin J.\u2014I concur with Mr. Justice Mignault.\nBrodeur J.\u2014J'en suis arriv\u00e9 \u00e0 la conclusion que la contestation de la d\u00e9claration de la tierce-saisie \u00e9tait bien fond\u00e9e et qu'elle devrait \u00eatre maintenue.\nLa demanderesse-appelante avait jugement contre la compagnie Asbestos-Asbestic pour dommages r\u00e9sultant d'un accident qui avait caus\u00e9 la mort de son mari lorsque ce dernier \u00e9tait \u00e0 l'emploi de cette compagnie.\nLa compagnie Asbestos-Asbestic avait, lorsque cet accident est arriv\u00e9, un contrat d'assurance ou d'indemnit\u00e9 avec la compagnie intim\u00e9e \"The Employers Liability Assurance Corporation\" par lequel cette derni\u00e8re s'engageait de l'indemniser\nagainst loss from the liability imposed by law upon the assured for damages on account of bodily injuries or death accidentally suffered while this policy is in force by any employee or employees of the assured.\nCe contrat d'assurance contenait plusieurs conditions: par exemple, l'indemnit\u00e9 ne devait \u00eatre que de deux mille dollars si l'ouvrier se faisait tuer (clause A); si un accident survenait, l'assur\u00e9 devait imm\u00e9diatement en avertir l'assureur (clause C); et il n'\u00e9tait pas permis \u00e0 l'assur\u00e9 d'assumer aucune responsabilit\u00e9 vis-\u00e0-vis la victime de l'accident ou de r\u00e9gler la r\u00e9clamation de cette victime sans l'assentiment formel de l'assureur (clause E); si une poursuite \u00e9tait institu\u00e9e contre l'assur\u00e9 pour cet accident, il devait remettre l'action \u00e0 l'assureur pour que ce dernier puisse lui-m\u00eame conduire la d\u00e9fense (clause D); l'assur\u00e9 ne pouvait pas poursuivre l'assureur pour les dommages qu'il avait subis, \u00e0 moins qu'il n'ait au pr\u00e9alable pay\u00e9 la victime (clause F); dans le cas de faillite de l'assur\u00e9, la police\nshall immediately terminate, but such termination shall not affect the liability of the corporation as to any accidents theretofore occurring\n(clause J).\nVoil\u00e0 le r\u00e9sum\u00e9 de quelques-unes des conditions qui tendent toutes \u00e0 restreindre les obligations de la compagnie d'assurance et \u00e0 diminuer les droits de l'assur\u00e9.\nIl est fort possible que les contrats d'assurance en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral peuvent pr\u00eater \u00e0 des fraudes; mais dans une assurance comme celle-ci, on peut pr\u00e9sumer difficilement qu'un ouvrier se ferait mutiler de propos d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9 pour donner \u00e0 son patron l'avantage de faire une r\u00e9clamation frauduleuse contre son assureur, et surtout quand il s'agit d'un cas o\u00f9 la victime a perdu la vie.\nLa compagnie Asbestos-Asbestic ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 poursuivie par la demanderesse-appelante; elle a confi\u00e9 l'action \u00e0 la compagnie d'assurance qui a, au nom de l'Asbestos-Asbestic, fait les d\u00e9fenses qu'elle a jug\u00e9 \u00e0 propos de faire contre cette r\u00e9clamation; mais ces d\u00e9fenses ont \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9es et jugement a \u00e9t\u00e9 rendu en faveur de la demanderesse contre la compagnie Asbestos-Asbestic pour $5,000. Un bref de saisie-arr\u00eat apr\u00e8s jugement a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9mis entre les mains de la compagnie d'assurance en ex\u00e9cution de ce jugement et cette derni\u00e8re est venue d\u00e9clarer sous le serment de l\u2019un de ses principaux employ\u00e9s qu'elle ne devait rien et qu' elle ne devrait rien plus tard \u00e0 la d\u00e9fenderesse.\nCette d\u00e9claration \u00e9tait faite sous les dispositions de l'article 685 C.P.C. qui se lit comme suit:\n685. Le tiers-saisi doit d\u00e9clarer les choses dont il \u00e9tait d\u00e9biteur \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque o\u00f9 la saisie lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 signifi\u00e9e, celles dont il est devenu d\u00e9biteur depuis, la cause de la dette et les autres saisies faites entre ses mains.\nSi la dette n'est pas \u00e9chue, il doit d\u00e9clarer l'\u00e9poque o\u00f9 elle le sera.\nSi le paiement de la dette est conditionnel ou suspendu par quelque emp\u00eachement, il doit \u00e9galement le d\u00e9clarer.\nIl doit donner un \u00e9tat d\u00e9taill\u00e9 des effets mobiliers qu'il a en sa possession appartenant au d\u00e9biteur, et d\u00e9clarer \u00e0 quel titre il les d\u00e9tient.\nCette d\u00e9claration \u00e9tait absolument fausse et mensong\u00e8re, car la compagnie d'assurance \u00e9tait d\u00e9bitrice de la compagnie Asbestos-Asbestic en vertu du contrat d'assurance qu'elle avait avec elle jusqu'\u00e0 concurrence d'une somme de $2,000. Cette dette n'\u00e9tait peut-\u00eatre pas exigible parce que la d\u00e9fenderesse n'avait pas sous la clause F du contrat pay\u00e9 elle-m\u00eame le jugement qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 rendu. Mais \u00e0 tout \u00e9v\u00e9nement la compagnie d'assurance, qui \u00e9tait bien au courant de toute la cause puisque c'est elle-m\u00eame qui avait d\u00e9fendu l'action principale, aurait d\u00fb d\u00e9clarer qu'il y avait une dette conditionnelle. Esp\u00e9rait-elle qu'avec cette d\u00e9claration mensong\u00e8re elle emp\u00eacherait cette pauvre \u00e9trang\u00e8re qu'\u00e9tait la demanderesse de se mettre un nouveau proc\u00e8s sur les bras? Heureusement que les autorit\u00e9s consulaires du pays d'origine de la demanderesse sont venues \u00e0 son secours, qu'il s'est trouv\u00e9 des avocats assez d\u00e9vou\u00e9s pour se charger de cette nouvelle cause, et elle a contest\u00e9 la d\u00e9claration de la tierce-saisie. Si la tierce-saisie avait fait une d\u00e9claration v\u00e9ridique des faits, jugement aurait pu de suite \u00eatre rendu d\u00e9clarant la saisie-arr\u00eat tenante jusqu'\u00e0 l'av\u00e8nement de la condition de sa police d'assurance qui exigeait paiement pr\u00e9alable par l'assur\u00e9 (art. 690 C.P.C.). L'avocat de la demanderesse, suivant qu'il en avait l\u00e9 droit, a transquestionn\u00e9 l'officier de la compagnie qui a fait la d\u00e9claration (art. 686 C.P.C.). Et la demanderesse a obtenu par ce moyen des informations suffisantes pour \u00e9tablir qu'il y avait une obligation conditionnelle de la tierce-saisie en faveur du saisi.\nIl me semble qu'apr\u00e8s cela la tierce-saisie aurait d\u00fb de suite demander \u00e0 amender sa d\u00e9claration de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 la mettre conforme aux faits et aux pr\u00e9tentions qu'elle a \u00e9mises plus tard sur la contestation de sa d\u00e9claration. Mais non. Elle n'a pas jug\u00e9 \u00e0 propos de ce faire; et alors la demanderesse a \u00e9t\u00e9 oblig\u00e9e de contester la d\u00e9claration, ainsi qu'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 jug\u00e9 par la Cour de Revision.\nQue les r\u00e9ponses d'un tiers-saisi aux questions qui lui sont pos\u00e9es par le saisissant et qui sont \u00e9crites \u00e0 la suite de sa d\u00e9claration, ne forment pas partie de sa d\u00e9claration, et qu'un jugement ne peut \u00eatre rendu sur ces r\u00e9ponses de plano: le saisissant doit contester la d\u00e9claration. (Laframboise v. Rolland) [2].\nPar sa contestation la demanderesse a conclu \u00e0 ce que la d\u00e9claration de la tierce-saisie soit d\u00e9clar\u00e9e fausse et mensong\u00e8re et \u00e0 ce que cette derni\u00e8re soit condamn\u00e9e \u00e0 lui payer la somme de $2,000 qu'elle devait \u00e0 la compagnie Asbestos-Asbestic par son contrat d'assurance; et elle s'est fait autoriser en m\u00eame temps par le juge \u00e0 exercer non-seulement ses droits comme la demanderesse mais aussi les droits de la compagnie Asbestos-Asbestic. Je dois dire que pendant le proc\u00e8s sur l'action originaire la compagnie d\u00e9fenderesse a \u00e9t\u00e9 mise en liquidation. Nous ne savons pas exactement la raison pour laquelle elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 mise en liquidation; mais il est \u00e0 supposer que l\u2019\u00e9tait d\u00fb \u00e0 son insolvabilit\u00e9. Aucune preuve directe cependant n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite de ce fait.\nLa cour sup\u00e9rieure a maintenu la contestation de la d\u00e9claration de la tierce-saisie. En appel ce jugement a \u00e9t\u00e9 renvers\u00e9. On y a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que la tierce-saisie devait une dette conditionnelle. Tout de m\u00eame, le dispositif du jugement est \u00e0 l'effet que la contestation de la d\u00e9claration de la tierce-saisie est rejet\u00e9e et que la saisie-arr\u00eat est renvoy\u00e9e avec frais, mais sans frais en cour sup\u00e9rieure.\nCe jugement ne me parait pas logique. En effet, du moment que la cour reconnaissait qu'il y avait une dette conditionnelle de due elle aurait d\u00fb maintenir la contestation de la d\u00e9claration et d\u00e9clarer que la saisie-arr\u00eat aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 tenante. En effet, l'article 690 du code de proc\u00e9dure civile \u00e9nonce formellement que si les deniers dus par le tiers-saisi ne sont dus que sous des conditions qui ne sont pas encore accomplies le tribunal peut ordonner que la saisie-arr\u00eat soit d\u00e9clar\u00e9e tenante jusqu'\u00e0 l'av\u00e8nement de la condition.\nIl y avait en cour d'appel, ainsi qu'en cour sup\u00e9rieure, sur cette contestation de la d\u00e9claration, deux points en litige, savoir si la dette \u00e9tait exigible d\u00e8s maintenant ou si elle ne serait due que lorsque la d\u00e9fenderesse aurait elle-m\u00eame pay\u00e9 le jugement qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 rendu contre elle en faveur de la demanderesse.\nLa cour sup\u00e9rieure a \u00e9t\u00e9 d'avis que la dette \u00e9tait due et exigible.\nLa cour d'appel, au contraire, a \u00e9t\u00e9 d'opinion que la dette ne devenait exigible que lorsque la d\u00e9fenderesse l'aurait pay\u00e9e \u00e0 la demanderesse. En acceptant cette opinion de la cour d'appel je dis tout de m\u00eame que le dispositif de son jugement est erron\u00e9 en ce qu'au lieu de renvoyer la saisie-arr\u00eat elle aurait d\u00fb la d\u00e9clarer tenante et maintenir la contestation de la d\u00e9claration de la tierce-saisie.\nJ'en suis venu \u00e0 la conclusion que la demanderesse avait eu raison de contester la d\u00e9claration de la tierce-saisie et que sa contestation devait \u00eatre maintenue et que la saisie-arr\u00eat devrait \u00eatre d\u00e9clar\u00e9e tenante jusqu'\u00e0 ce que la condition stipul\u00e9e au paragraphe F de la police d'assurance ait \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9clar\u00e9e remplie par la cour sup\u00e9rieure.\nL'appel doit \u00eatre maintenu avec d\u00e9pens de cette cour et des cours inf\u00e9rieures contre l'intim\u00e9e, moins les frais de la cour du Banc du Roi o\u00f9 chaque partie paiera ses frais.\nMignault J.\u2014The appellant obtained, on June 29th, 1917, a judgment for $5,000.00 for damages against the Asbestos and Asbestic Company, Limited, as civilly responsible for the death of her husband while in its employment. During the proceedings, and before the filing of a plea, the company was placed in liquidation and William J. Henderson was appointed its liquidator. The respondent, thereunto obliged by an indemnity policy issued by it in favour of the company, contested the appellant's action in the name of the company, and several months after the judgment paid the appellant's costs of action. The present proceedings are to force the respondent to pay to the appellant the amount for which the respondent by its policy promised to indemnify the Asbestos and Asbestic Company, which, in the case of any one employee of the latter, was restricted to $2,000.00. The appellant proceeded against the respondent by way of seizure in garnishment and the latter declared that it had not and was not aware that it would have hereafter in its hands, possession or custody, or in any manner whatsoever, any money, movable effects or other things due or belonging to the Asbestos and Asbestic Company, the defendant.\nThe declaration was contested by the appellant and her contestation was maintained by the Superior Court, Weir J. The Court of King's Bench, Guerin J. dissenting, reversed the judgment of the Superior Court, and dismissed the contestation without costs in the Superior Court, stating however that the respondent had not disclosed in its declaration that it was subject to a conditional obligation towards the Asbestos and Asbestic Company under its policy.\nThe reason for which the appellant's contestation of the respondent's declaration was dismissed may be briefly explained.\nBy the conditions of the policy, the insured company, on the taking against it of an action for an accident to one of its employees, was obliged forthwith to hand over the papers served on it to the respondent, and was prohibited from making any settlement or payment to the injured employee or his representatives, and the respondent undertook to defend the action at its own cost. Condition \"F\" of the policy on which the respondent now relies reads as follows:\u2014\nCondition F: No action shall lie against the Corporation to recover for any loss under this policy unless it shall be brought by the assured for loss actually sustained and paid in money by the assured in satisfaction of a judgment after trial of the issue; nor unless such action is brought within 90 (ninety) days after final judgment against the assured has been so paid and satisfied. The Corporation does not prejudice by this condition any defences against such action it may be entitled to make under this policy.\u2022 The respondent successfully contended in the court below that no liability exists on its part until the insured company has actually paid in money the amount which it has been condemned to pay by a judgment, and, the insured not having paid the appellant's judgment, the respondent now argues that it truly declared that it owed and would owe nothing to the company. In my opinion the respondent's liability existed but was a contingent or conditional liability, and under Art. 685 C.P.C. the respondent should have declared that it was conditionally indebted. Had it done so, under Art. 690 C.P.C. the court, on motion of the plaintiff, could have declared the seizure binding pending the fulfilment of the condition. It follows that the respondent's declaration was not the one it should have made. This forced the appellant to contest it. In my opinion, however, the appellant cannot say that the respondent's obligation is payable or demand that the respondent be condemned to pay. So long as the Asbestos Company has not itself paid under the appellant's judgment, no demand of payment can be made against the respondent. But that does not mean that the appellant's seizure in garnishment should be dismissed as the Court of King's Bench dismissed its. Under Art. 690 C.P.C. the appellant, on the contrary, is entitled to have the seizure remain binding until the condition is fulfilled, if it ever be fulfilled.\nThere seems to be some possibility that it may be fulfilled. In the record there is a judgment of Mr. Justice Hutchinson of the 7th February, 1917, authorizing the liquidator, on his petition, to retain the sum of $2,000.00 to provide for the payment of the claim and costs of this appellant. Should the liquidator pay this money in part satisfaction of the appellant's judgment, the respondent will thereupon become liable to the Asbestos and Asbestic Company under condition \"F\" of its policy. This right of the Asbestos Company against the respondent is now being exercised by the appellant by virtue of her seizure in garnishment, so that, if the payment be made by the liquidator, she will be entitled to demand that the respondent make a new declaration under the seizure.\nThe parties were unable to inform us whether the liquidator still retains the sum of $2,000.00. Under the circumstances, and in view of the fact that the respondent did not make the declaration it should have made, I would give the appellant judgment declaring the seizure binding on the respondent until the condition rendering its obligation payable has been fulfilled. The appeal should therefore be allowed and the record remitted to the Superior Court for such further proceedings as may be necessary. Costs to the appellant in this court and in the Superior Court, and no costs to either party in the Court of King's Bench.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Lawrence, Morris & McGore.\nSolicitors for the respondent: DeWitt, Tyndale & Howard.\n[1] Q.R. 32 K.B. 146.\n[2] [1885] M.L.R. 2 S.C. 75.\n",

The respondent brought an action to recover taxes imposed on part of the bridge.\nHeld, that the part of the bridge extending to the middle of the river was subject to taxation, as it was within the municipality and the property of the appellant and not of the Crown, such bridge being an \"immovable\" within the meaning of article 5730 R.S.Q. (1909).\nJudgment of the Court of King's Bench (Q.R. 30 K.B. 181) affirmed.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King's Bench, appeal side, Province of Quebec[1], reversing the judgment of Guerin J. at the trial and maintaining the respondent's action. The material facts of the ease and the questions in issue are fully stated in the above head-note and in the judgments now reported.\nJ. O. Lacroix K.C. and J.P. B\u00e9lair for the appellant.\nPaul St. Germain K.C. for the respondent.\nIdington J.\u2014When due regard is had to the statutory definitions given the words used relative to what properties are taxable within the powers of the respondent and to the terms of the statute under and by which the appellant owns the bridge in question, I can see no ground for the appellant's pretensions herein.\nNor do I see any ground for the final forlorn hope, as it were, set up here for the first time, that he does not know how much of the bridge property he is assessed for.\nPlainly he is assessed for so much thereof as lies within the bounds of the municipality which on that side next the river extends to the middle of the stream according to the law laid down in the case of Maclaren v. The Attorney General of Quebec[2].\nThe township boundaries in question there seemed to have been definitely fixed by iron stakes placed on the respective banks of the stream, but the majority of this court held that to include the land to the middle of the stream and the court above maintained that holding, notwithstanding many surrounding circumstances tending to rebut that presumption of law.\nAnd the assessment, according to the actual cadastral number, is specifically declared by statute as sufficiently definite.\nI think the appeal should be dismissed with costs. Duff J.\u2014I concur in the dismissal of this appeal with costs.\nAnglin J.\u2014The plaintiff appeals from the judgment of the Court of King's Bench reversing that of the Superior Court which had dismissed with costs the action of the respondent municipality to recover the sum of $300 for annual taxes imposed on a part of a bridge crossing the river Mille Isles, or Jesus, between Ste. Rose and Ste. Th\u00e9r\u00e8se. This property is assessed as No. 425 in the cadastral survey of the municipality of Ste. Rose.\nThe appellant contests the validity of the assessment on four distinct grounds:\u2014(1) The bridge is not his property; (2) the bridge is not an immovable; (3) the bridge is not within the limits of the municipality of Ste. Rose; (4) the assessment ex facie covers the whole bridge, of which a part is admittedly within the municipality of Ste. Th\u00e9r\u00e8se.\n(1) By statute of Lower Canada of 1830 (10 & 11 Geo. IV., c. 56) James Porteous was authorized to erect the bridge in question as a toll bridge. By s. 3 of that Act the bridge and its dependencies and approaches, including the toll house and turnpike to be erected thereon,\nare vested in Jas. Porteous, his heirs and assigns forever.\nThe appellant is admittedly the assign of Jas. Porteous and holds and enjoys all the rights in regard to the bridge formerly belonging to Porteous. In view of the terms of the statute I cannot regard it as open to question that the bridge is the property of the appellant, subject to such qualifications and restrictions upon his exercise of the rights of ownership as the statute imposes. The fact that he has merely a right of servitude over the bed of the river presents no obstacle to his owning the structure of the bridge and its appurtenances.\n(2) Whether the bridge and its appurtenances constitute an immovable is the only question which I regard as seriously debatable. The taxing power is conferred by Art. 5730 (R.S.Q. 1909) of the \"Cities and Towns Act:\"\u2014\n5730. The Council may impose and levy annually on every immovable in the municipality, a tax not exceeding two per cent of the real value as shewn on the valuation roll. (3 Ed. VII, c. 38, s. 474).\nThere is no definition of the word \"immovable\" in the \"Cities and Towns Act.\" We therefore turn to the general law\u2014the provisions of the Civil Code dealing with \"The Distinction of Things\"\u2014to ascertain the scope of the term \"immovable.\" The following articles bear on this question:\u2014\n375. Property is immovable either by its nature or its destination or by reason of the object to which it is attached, or lastly by determination of law.\n376. Lands and buildings (b\u00e2timents) are immovable by their nature.\n377. Windmills and water-mills, built on piles and forming part of the building, are also immovable by their nature when they are constructed for a permanency.\n381. Rights of emphyteusis, of usufruct of immovable things, of use and habitation, servitudes and rights or actions which tend to obtain possession of an immovable, are immovable by reason of the objects to which they are attached.\n\"Buildings\" (\"b\u00e2timents\") is not defined.\nAlthough Littr\u00e9 defines \"b\u00e2timent\" as\ntoute construction servant \u00e0 loger soit hommes, soit b\u00eates, soit choses\nand adds\n\u00e9tymologiquement, le b\u00e0timent est ce qui porte, re\u00e7oit; * * * un pont est une construction et non un b\u00e2timent, the word \"b\u00e2timents\" in Art. 376 C.C. appears to be used in the wider sense of \"constructions\" Thus in Baudry-Lacantinerie, Des Biens, No. 26, we read of the word, \"b\u00e2timents\" in the corresponding article of the Code Napol\u00e9on, No. 518:\n26. Il importe d'\u00eatre bien fix\u00e9 sur le principe m\u00eame de l'immobilisation qui a sa cause n\u00e9cessaire mais suffisante dans l'adh\u00e9rence physique des objets au sol, dans leur incorporation. Ce principe, en effet, permet seul de r\u00e9soudre convenablement les difficult\u00e9s que soul\u00e8ve l'application de la loi. Celle-ci n'a pas d\u00e9fini le b\u00e2timent; mais, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 le principe m\u00eame qui r\u00e9git l'art. 518, cette d\u00e9nomination comprend certainement toutes les constructions adh\u00e9rant au sol par fondement ou par pilotis, toutes celles qui, incorpor\u00e9es au sol peuvent \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9es comme partie int\u00e9grante du fonds, peu importe qu'elles soient int\u00e9rieures ou ext\u00e9rieures. Ainsi, non seulement les maisons d'habitation, granges, magasins, sont immeubles par nature, mais aussi les b\u00e2timents, puits, galeries et autres travaux n\u00e9cessit\u00e9s par l'exploitation d'une mine.\nLaurent says (vol. V., no. 409):\nLe mot b\u00e2timent, dont se sert la loi, ne doit pas \u00eatre pris dans un sens restrictif. Tout ce qui est attach\u00e9 au sol, de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 faire corps avec lui, est immeuble par nature.\nIn Murray's Oxford Dictionary \"building\" is defined:\nthat which is built; a structure, edifice; a structure in the nature of a house built where it is to stand.\nIn The Queen v. Proprietors of the Neath Canal Navigation[3], Blackburn J. said that the word \"buildings\" in a taxing act (3 & 4 Wm. IV., c. 90, s. 33) would cover such a structure as the Holborn viaduct, which carries the main artery of London over Farrington St., but would not apply to a street paved and faced with stone work, which remains \"land.\"\nThe words \"b\u00e2timents\"\u2014\"buildings\" in Art. 376 C.C. may therefore be taken to mean \"structures\" and it follows that a bridge over a river resting on piers is an immovable by nature because it is a structure permanently affixed to the soil or bed of the river. This would certainly be the case if the appellant were the owner of such soil or bed. The fact that he is not such owner but is merely entitled to a servitude or right to maintain the bridge upon it does not prevent the character of immovability attaching to the bridge. Demolombe vol. 9, no. 128.\nIl importe peu, (says Huc vol. IV no. 9) que les constructions ainsi incorpor\u00e9es aient \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9lev\u00e9es par le propri\u00e9taire lui m\u00eame ou par un tiers.\nIn Aubry & Rau, vol. II, no. 164 we read:\nLes b\u00e2timents, ou autres ouvrages unis au sol, sont immeubles par leur nature, qu'ils aient \u00e9t\u00e9 construits par le propri\u00e9taire du fonds ou par un tiers, par exemple, par un fermier, par un locataire, ou par un usufructier, et ce, dans le cas m\u00eame ou le tiers constructeur se serait r\u00e9serv\u00e9 la facult\u00e9 de les d\u00e9molir de la cessation de sa jouissance.\nThe fact that the bridge is built on the bed of a river belonging to the Crown presents no difficulty. The statute declares the appellant's ownership of it; and its attachment to the soil gives to it its character of an immovable. Demolombe, vol. 9, nos. 126-7; Dalloz, Code Ann. Art. 518, nos. 23-25.\nAs something analogous to a windmill or a water-mill built on piles, specifically mentioned in Art. 377 C.C., which should probably be taken to express a rule of general application of which the windmill and the water-mill are illustrations (Fuzier-Herman, Code Civil Ann. vol. I, Art. 519, no. 6), the bridge may possibly also be regarded as within the purview of that article and the corresponding article of the Code Napol\u00e9on, no. 519. But if the word \"building\" should be given the narrower meaning of a \"structure in the nature of a house\" the presence in Art. 377 of the words \"and forming part of the building\" (\"et faisant partie du b\u00e2timent\") would probably exclude the bridge from its purview unless the conjunction \"and\" (et) should be replaced by the disjunctive \"or' (ou), the view taken of the construction of Art. 519 C.N. (Huc. vol. IV, no. 13). On the other hand if \"building\" should mean any \"structure\", as I think it does, it would seem to be unnecessary to resort to Art. 377 C.C. since Art. 376 would cover the case.\nMoreover the right of resting and maintaining the bridge on the bed of the river, which the statute of 1830 undoubtedly confers, I think vests in the appellant an interest in or right to the use of the bed or fond of the river in the nature of a servitude, which is declared by Art. 381 C.C. to be an \"immovable.\" The bridge itself in my opinion and the right to maintain it on the river bed would therefore appear to be taxable under Art. 5730 (R.S.Q. 1909) of the \"Cities and Towns Act.\"\n(3) The combined operation of Art. 5280 R.S.Q. 1909, Arts. 10 & 11 of the charter of the town of Ste. Rose (8 Geo. V., c. 98) and Art. 16 of the Municipal Code of 1916 puts it beyond all doubt that the territory of the town of Ste. Rose extends to the middle of the River Jesus and includes the portion of the bridge shewn on the cadastral plan as no. 425. The case falls within Art. 5281 of the R.S.Q. 1909, which confers \"jurisdiction for municipal and police purposes\" over the whole territory of the municipality, and not within Art. 5282 which confers merely \"police powers\" over navigable or other waters lying in front of the municipality and applies when the municipal boundary does not extend to the middle of the river, as it does in this case.\n(4) Finally, notwithstanding some apparent inaccuracy in the description of the cadastral lot no. 425 as given in the official registry of the county, and in the \"Livre de Renvoi Officiel\" in the department of Crown Lands, the assessment is of the cadastral no. 425 and a reference to the cadastral plan produced in the record indicates that that number covers only the portion of the bridge lying within the municipality of Ste. Rose. Moreover this defence was not pleaded and there appears to have been no inquiry at the trial as to the alleged inaccuracy of the cadastral description in the county registry office and the department of Crown Lands. Had there been such an investigation it might have been demonstrated, as is probably the case, that the area of 89 perches and 40 feet mentioned in the description comprises only the superficies of that part of the bridge which lies within the municipality of Ste. Rose. This ground of appeal, I think, should not be entertained.\nThe appeal in my opinion fails and should be dismissed with costs.\nBrodeur J.\u2014La question en cette cause est de savoir si la ville de Ste-Rose a le droit de taxer un pont appartenant \u00e0 l'appelant B\u00e9lair.\nCe pont est situ\u00e9 sur la rivi\u00e8re J\u00e9sus et relie la paroisse de Ste-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se \u00e0 la ville de Ste-Rose. Ce pont aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9rig\u00e9 par James Porteous en vertu d'une loi adopt\u00e9e par la l\u00e9gislature du Bas-Canada en 1830. Le propri\u00e9taire actuel, B\u00e9lair, qui est aux droits de Porteous, pr\u00e9tend que la ville de Ste-Rose n'a pas le droit de taxer ce pont: 1\u00b0 parce qu'il n'est pas dans les limites territoriales de cette ville; 2\u00b0 parce qu'il fait partie du domaine public; et en 3\u00e8me lieu, l'appelant all\u00e8gue que si le pont est imposable la taxe est impos\u00e9e ill\u00e9galement parce qu'elle frappe tout le pont tandis qu'il n'y en a qu'une partie dans Ste-Rose. I\nLe pont est-il pour partie dans le territoire de Ste-Rose?\nIl s'agit de savoir, pour r\u00e9soudre cette question, si la municipalit\u00e9 de la ville de Ste-Rose s'\u00e9tend jusqu'au milieu de l'eau de la rivi\u00e8re J\u00e9sus.\nCette ville a \u00e9t\u00e9 incorpor\u00e9e en 1918 par la l\u00e9gislature de Qu\u00e9bec, et la section 10 de sa charte d\u00e9clare express\u00e9ment que son territoire sera le m\u00eame que celui du village de Ste-Rose. Or le village de Ste-Rose \u00e9tait r\u00e9gi par le code municipal qui, \u00e0 l'article 16, dit que les limites d'une municipalit\u00e9 qui longe une rivi\u00e8re navigable ou flottable s'\u00e9tendent jusqu'au milieu de l'eau de telle rivi\u00e8re.\nPar cons\u00e9quent, le territoire de la ville de Ste-Rose est par sa charte d\u00e9clar\u00e9 couvrir le m\u00eame territoire que celui qui existait pour le village de Ste-Rose.\nMais l'appelant B\u00e9lair pr\u00e9tend que par l'article 5282 S.R.P.Q., dans la \"Loi des cit\u00e9s et villes,\" la juridiction d'une ville qui borde une eau navigable ne s'\u00e9tend jusqu'au milieu de telle eau que pour les fins de police seulement et que la ville de Ste-Rose n'a pas, \u00e0 raison de cet article 5282, le pouvoir de frapper d'imp\u00f4ts les \u00eeles ou les propri\u00e9tes priv\u00e9es qui seraient dans cette rivi\u00e8re J\u00e9sus.\nCette pr\u00e9tention aurait une certaine force si nous n'avions pas l'article 5281 de la m\u00eame \"Loi des cit\u00e9s et villes\" qui d\u00e9clare que la corporation a juridiction pour les fins municipales et de police et pour l'exercice de tous les pouvoirs qui lui sont conf\u00e9r\u00e9s sur toute l'\u00e9tendue de son territoire. Ce dernier article donne une juridiction aussi large que possible \u00e0 une municipalit\u00e9 de ville et comporte naturellement le pouvoir de frapper d'imp\u00f4ts les immeubles qui se trouvent dans son territoire. Or la ville de Ste-Rose par sa charte se trouve \u00e0 couvrir la moiti\u00e9 de la rivi\u00e8re; et, par cons\u00e9quent, elle peut y exercer tous les pouvoirs qui lui sont conf\u00e9r\u00e9s.\nM\u00eame si cet article 5282 \u00e9tait seul dans la \"Loi des cit\u00e9s et villes'' et si l\u2019on n'y retrouvait pas les dispositions de l'article 5281, il se pr\u00e9senterait une int\u00e9ressante question de savoir si la loi devrait \u00eatre interpr\u00eat\u00e9e aussi restrictivement que le sugg\u00e8re l'appelant.\nLes mots \"fins de police\" (police purposes) qu'on rel\u00e8ve dans cet article 5282 ont, dans l'acceptation ordinaire, un sens assez restreint. On les rattache \u00e0 l'ordre et \u00e0 la tranquillit\u00e9 que les officiers de la paix doivent maintenir; mais dans bien des cas ils ont trait \u00e0 l'organisation politique d'une municipalit\u00e9 en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral et couvrent les ordonnances pour tout ce qui concerne la s\u00fbret\u00e9, la commodit\u00e9 et le bien-\u00eatre de la municipalit\u00e9 ou de ses habitants. Cette expression nous vient du droit municipal am\u00e9ricain o\u00f9 elle est d\u00e9finie\nsuch as arise ordinarily in the administration of the affairs of cities and towns in the exercise of their powers to promote the public health, convenience and welfare.[4] Cyclopedia of Law, vol. 31, p. 903, words and phrases judicially defined, verbo \"Police purposes.\"\nPour promouvoir le bien-\u00eatre de la municipalit\u00e9, il faut de toute n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 pr\u00e9lever des fonds sur les propri\u00e9t\u00e9s qui y sont situ\u00e9es ou sur les personnes qui b\u00e9n\u00e9ficient de ses ordonnances. Aussi Tiedman, On Municipal Corporations, par. 254, dit formellement:\nThe power of taxation is but one phase of the police power of the government. Il n'y a donc qu'une r\u00e9ponse possible \u00e0 la question que je posais au commencement de ce paragraphe: c'est que le pont en question se trouve pour partie dans le territoire de la ville de Ste-Rose.\nII\nCe pont fait-il partie du domaine de la Couronne?\nIl nous faut pour disposer de cette question examiner la loi de 1830 qui en a autoris\u00e9 la construction.\nIl est \u00e9rig\u00e9 sur le lit de la rivi\u00e8re, qui est la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 du souverain. Mais est-il tellement incorpor\u00e9 au sol qu'il devienne par droit d'accession propri\u00e9t\u00e9 du sol lui-m\u00eame? S'il en \u00e9tait ainsi, le lit de la rivi\u00e8re et le pont se confondraient et alors la corporation municipale, qui ne peut pas taxer les biens du souverain, se trouverait dans l'impossibilit\u00e9 de frapper ce pont d'imp\u00f4ts.\nLa loi de 1830 a simplement autoris\u00e9 l'auteur de l'appelant \u00e0 jeter des piliers sur la rivi\u00e8re et d'y faire un pont. Cette loi modifie la jouissance que le public avait du lit de la rivi\u00e8re o\u00f9 les piliers ont \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9rig\u00e9s et la jouissance de la rivi\u00e8re elle-m\u00eame pour les fins de navigation.\nMais la l\u00e9gislature a conserv\u00e9 \u00e0 la Couronne la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 du sol o\u00f9 les piliers du pont sont \u00e9rig\u00e9s. Le jour o\u00f9 le pont cessera d'exister, la Couronne rentrera en pleine possession et jouissance du sol recouvert par les piliers. La l\u00e9gislature a donn\u00e9 la jouissance d'une certaine partie du lit de la rivi\u00e8re, mais la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de cette m\u00eame partie du lit de la rivi\u00e8re reste \u00e0 la Couronne. Le droit de jouissance devient alors s\u00e9par\u00e9 de la nue propri\u00e9t\u00e9 (art. 443 C.C.). Ce statut a donn\u00e9 \u00e0 Porteous et \u00e0 ses repr\u00e9sentants le droit d'y construire un pont que la loi, \u00e0 l'article 3, d\u00e9clare \u00eatre leur propri\u00e9t\u00e9. Le pont est un immeuble par sa nature parce que c'est un b\u00e2timent et qu'il est \u00e9difi\u00e9 \u00e0 perp\u00e9tuelle demeure sur un terrain dont Porteous et ses repr\u00e9sentants ont la jouissance. (Art. 376 et 377 C.C.).\nEn vertu de \"l'Acte des cit\u00e9s et villes,\" la ville de Ste-Rose a le pouvoir de taxer les immeubles appartenant \u00e0 des particuliers. Il est constant que ce pont, qui est situ\u00e9 dans les limites de la municipalit\u00e9, est un immeuble et qu'en cons\u00e9quence il peut \u00eatre soumis \u00e0 l'imp\u00f4t foncier m\u00eame contre celui qui n'aurait que la jouissance du sol sur lequel les piliers sont \u00e9rig\u00e9s.\nDemolombe, au vol. 9, no. 128, discutant les droits de celui qui est autoris\u00e9 \u00e0 construire dans des conditions semblables au cas qui nous occupe, dit:\nEn principe d'ailleurs il est tr\u00e8s possible que celui qui n'est pas propri\u00e9taire du sol lui-m\u00eame soit n\u00e9anmoins propri\u00e9taire d'un immeuble \u00e9difi\u00e9 superpos\u00e9 sur ce sol: tel est le droit de superficie.\nOr tel para\u00eet \u00eatre le caract\u00e8re du droit qui r\u00e9sulte de la concession par suite de laquelle un particulier a \u00e9t\u00e9 autoris\u00e9 \u00e0 \u00e9tablir une usine sur une rivi\u00e8re navigable ou flottable, esp\u00e8ce de droit de superficie pendant la dur\u00e9e de cette concession. C'est ainsi que la Cour de Caen a jug\u00e9 que les p\u00eacheries, salines, etc., qui seraient \u00e9tablies en vertu d'une concession du gouvernement, sur les rivages de la mer, forment \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard des concessionnaires, dans les relations du droit priv\u00e9, un bien immobilier, quoique les rivages de la mer fassent eux-m\u00eames partie du domaine public.\nOn nous r\u00e9f\u00e8re aux d\u00e9cisions de cette cour et du Conseil Priv\u00e9 dans les causes de Central Vermont Railway Co. v. Town of St Johns[5], et The Township of Cornwall v. The Ottawa and New York Railway Co.[6].\nCes d\u00e9cisions portent sur les statuts qui emp\u00eachaient la taxation des ponts de chemins de fer comme tels, et par cons\u00e9quent sont bien diff\u00e9rents du cas qui nous est soumis. Nous trouvons dans ces d\u00e9cisions des opinions qui d\u00e9terminent d'une mani\u00e8re certaine que ces ponts sont des immeubles et que sans les lois sp\u00e9ciales qui les r\u00e9gissaient ils pourraient \u00eatre frapp\u00e9s d'imp\u00f4ts dans les cas ordinaires.\nCe pont Porteous n'est pas dans le domaine de la Couronne. C'est une propri\u00e9t\u00e9 qui, comme tous les immeubles appartenant \u00e0 des particuliers, est susceptible d'\u00eatre tax\u00e9e.\nIII\nL'imp\u00f4t est-il ill\u00e9gal et frappe-t-il tout le pont?\nLe pont est situ\u00e9 dans deux municipalit\u00e9s mais ne porte qu'un num\u00e9ro au cadastre. La corporation de Ste-Rose ne pouvait imposer que la partie de l'immeuble qui se trouvait sur son territoire. Le r\u00f4le d'\u00e9valuation tel que fait peut porter \u00e0 ambiguit\u00e9, mais la preuve non contredite constate que l'on n'a \u00e9valu\u00e9 que la partie du pont qui se trouve dans la municipalit\u00e9. L'imp\u00f4t est donc l\u00e9gal et ne frappe pas tout le pont mais simplement la partie qui se trouve sur le territoire de la municipalit\u00e9 intim\u00e9e.\nPour toutes ces raisons je suis d'opinion que la Cour du Banc du Roi, qui a maintenu la validit\u00e9 de la taxe r\u00e9clam\u00e9e par l'action de l'intim\u00e9e, a bien jug\u00e9 et que l'appel doit \u00eatre renvoy\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens.\nMignault J.\u2014La Cour du Banc du Roi, infirmant le jugement de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure, a condamn\u00e9 l'appelant \u00e0 payer \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e $300.00 pour taxes municipales impos\u00e9es sur le pont connu sous le nom de Pont B\u00e9lair, sur la rivi\u00e8re J\u00e9sus, en face de Sainte-Rose, et l'appelant se plaint de cette condamnation. J'examinerai tr\u00e8s bri\u00e8vement ses griefs d'appel. Il dit d'abord qu'il n'est pas propri\u00e9taire du pont. Sa pr\u00e9tention, c'est qu'il n'a que le droit de pr\u00e9lever des p\u00e9ages, mais que le pont lui-m\u00eame, comme la rivi\u00e8re qu'il traverse et le chemin public dont il fait partie, est une d\u00e9pendance du domaine public et partant n'est pas imposable pour des taxes municipales.\nLa pr\u00e9tention de l'appelant serait peut-\u00eatre discutable, n'\u00e9tait-ce le texte pr\u00e9cis de l'Acte de la L\u00e9gislature 10-11 Geo. IV., ch. 56, qui donna \u00e0 James Porteous, l'auteur de l'appelant, l'autorisation de construire ce pont. L'article 3 de cette loi d\u00e9clare formellement\nque le dit James Porteous, ses hoirs et ayant cause, sont rev\u00eatus pour toujours de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 du dit pont et de la dite maison de p\u00e9age, barri\u00e8re et autres d\u00e9pendances qui y seront \u00e9rig\u00e9es sur ou pr\u00e8s d'iceux, et aussi de toutes les mont\u00e9es ou abords du dit pont, et de tous les mat\u00e9riaux qui seront, de temps en temps, obtenus et pourvus pour l'\u00e9riger, construire, faire, entretenir et r\u00e9parer.\nEt le m\u00eame article ajoute qu'apr\u00e8s cinquante ans Sa Majest\u00e9, ses h\u00e9ritiers et successeurs, pourront reprendre la possession et propri\u00e9t\u00e9 du dit pont, etc., en en payant la valeur. Ceci d\u00e9montre \u00e9videmment que la l\u00e9gislature, l'autorit\u00e9 souveraine, a accord\u00e9 \u00e0 Porteous et \u00e0 ses ayants cause la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 m\u00eame du pont, et puisque la couronne peut reprendre cette propri\u00e9t\u00e9, en en payant la valeur, c'est qu'elle s'en est d\u00e9partie. Il est donc inutile d'invoquer les textes concernant l'ali\u00e9nabilit\u00e9 du domaine public, car la l\u00e9gislature peut \u00e9videmment autoriser cette ali\u00e9nation, et bien que la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de l'appelant soit une propri\u00e9t\u00e9 restreinte puisqu'il est oblig\u00e9 de permettre au public, moyennant paiement de p\u00e9ages, de passer sur ce pont, ce n'en est pas moins une v\u00e9ritable propri\u00e9t\u00e9. La deuxi\u00e8me pr\u00e9tention de l'appelant est que le pont n'est pas un immeuble. Je me demande quelle serait la nature de ce pont s'il n'est pas immeuble, car ce n'est certainement pas un meuble, et il faut qu'il soit ou meuble ou immeuble. Le mot \"b\u00e2timents\" dans l'article 376 C.C., a une grande extension et comprendrait m\u00eame un pont tel que celui du demandeur. Mon honorable coll\u00e8gue, M. le juge Anglin, a discut\u00e9 cette question \u00e0 fond et en a fait une d\u00e9monstration convaincante, dont j'avoue que je me serais dispens\u00e9 tant le caract\u00e8re immobilier de ce pont me para\u00eet \u00e9vident. Dans mon opinion, ce n'est pas \u00e0 titre de servitude, car ce n'est pas une servitude, c'est par sa nature m\u00eame que ce pont est immeuble.\nSi l'appelant n'avait que le droit de percevoir des p\u00e9ages, ce droit me para\u00eetrait mobilier: Dalloz, 1865.1. 308. Mais le statut qu'il invoque lui conf\u00e8re la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 m\u00eame du pont, et alors poser la question de savoir si ce droit de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 porte sur un immeuble ou sur un meuble, c'est la r\u00e9soudre.\nSi l\u00e9 pont est immeuble, nul doute qu'il est imposable. L'article 5730 S.R.Q., qui fait partie de la \"Loi des cit\u00e9s et villes,\" laquelle s'applique \u00e0 la ville de Sainte-Rose (sauf les changements faits par la charte de cette derni\u00e8re), dit formellement que le conseil peut imposer et pr\u00e9lever annuellement, sur tout immeuble dans la municipalit\u00e9, une taxe n'exc\u00e9dant pas deux pour cent de la valeur r\u00e9elle, telle que port\u00e9e au r\u00f4le d'\u00e9valuation. Le pont B\u00e9lair est donc imposable.\nLa troisi\u00e8me objection de l'appelant m'a paru \u00e0 l'audition la plus s\u00e9rieuse. Le pont B\u00e9lair est d\u00e9sign\u00e9 au r\u00f4le d'\u00e9valuation comme \u00e9tant le num\u00e9ro 425 du cadastre. Dans la paroisse (maintenant la ville) de Sainte-Rose, le cadastre donne un num\u00e9ro sp\u00e9cial \u00e0 chacun des ponts qui traversent la rivi\u00e8re J\u00e9sus (je n'exprime pas d'opinion sur la question de savoir si un pont pouvait recevoir un num\u00e9ro au cadastre, l'article 2167 du code civil ne parlant que des lots de terre, car il ne s'agit ici que de d\u00e9terminer ce que le cadastre indique par le no. 425), et il d\u00e9crit le pont dont il s'agit comme suit:\nExtrait du livre de renvoi officiel de la paroisse Sainte-Rose, comt\u00e9 de Laval.\nPonts.\nNo. du lot: 425.\nPropri\u00e9taire: Joseph Placide B\u00e9l\u00e1ir.\nDescription.\u2014Traversant la Rivi\u00e8re J\u00e9sus du sud-est au nord-ouest en d\u00e9crivant une courbe, situ\u00e9 partie dans la paroisse de Sainte-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se et partie dans la paroisse de Sainte-Rose; born\u00e9 \u00e0 une extr\u00e9mit\u00e9 vers le sud-est par la paroisse de Sainte-Rose, \u00e0 l'autre extr\u00e9mit\u00e9 vers le nord-ouest par la paroisse de Sainte-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se, d'un c\u00f4t\u00e9 au nord-est et de l'autre au sud-ouest par la rivi\u00e8re J\u00e9sus et par une \u00eele qu'il traverse; contenant une perche de largeur sur huit arpents, neuf perches et quatre pieds de longueur; formant quatre-vingt-neuf perches et quarante pieds en superficie. (89-40).\nLe plan officiel du cadastre montre sous le no. 425 le pont qui s'\u00e9tend depuis la terre ferme jusqu'\u00e0 une \u00eele dans la rivi\u00e8re, laquelle \u00eele para\u00eet se trouver dans la paroisse de Sainte-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se, savoir la paroisse qui fait face \u00e0 Sainte-Rose de l'autre c\u00f4t\u00e9 de la rivi\u00e8re J\u00e9sus. Comme il s'agit du cadastre de Sainte-Rose, la pr\u00e9somption serait que le pont qui re\u00e7oit ce num\u00e9ro 425 est la partie du pont qui se trouve dans les limites de cette paroisse. M. Longpr\u00e9, maire de la ville et r\u00e9gistrateur de comt\u00e9 de Laval, dit dans son t\u00e9moignage que la partie du pont qui porte le no. 425 est la partie qui est dans Sainte-Rose. La description du livre de renvoi semblerait s'appliquer \u00e0 tout le pont, puisqu'elle dit qu'il traverse la rivi\u00e8re J\u00e9sus du sud-est au nord-ouest en d\u00e9crivant une courbe, et qu'il est situ\u00e9 partie dans Sainte-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se et partie dans Sainte-Rose. En comparant cette description du livre de renvoi au plan du cadastre, on voit que ce que le plan indique comme \u00e9tant le num\u00e9ro 425 n'est qu'une partie du pont, car l'autre c\u00f4t\u00e9 de la rivi\u00e8re n'est pas montr\u00e9 sur le plan et on n'y voit pas non plus la courbe mentionn\u00e9e au livre de renvoi. D'apr\u00e8s toutes les pr\u00e9somptions il ne serait question, dans le r\u00f4le d'\u00e9valuation, que de la partie du pont dans Sainte-Rose.\nDans sa d\u00e9fense, le d\u00e9fendeur pr\u00e9tend que ce pont est erron\u00e9ment appel\u00e9 immeuble, qu'il n'est ni plus ni moins qu'un pont de p\u00e9age, enti\u00e8rement situ\u00e9 en dehors des limites de la municipalit\u00e9 d\u00e9fenderesse; il ne soul\u00e8ve pas l'objection qu'il serait partie dans une municipalit\u00e9 et partie dans l'autre. Le factum de l'appelant discute la pr\u00e9tention \u00e9mise par la d\u00e9fense. Or la ville de Sainte-Rose, d'apr\u00e8s sa charte (8 Geo. V. (Qu\u00e9.) ch. 98), est l'ancien village de Sainte-Rose et son territoire est le m\u00eame (art. 10 de cette loi). Le territoire du village de Sainte-Rose, d'apr\u00e8s l'article 19, parag. 1, de l'ancien code municipal, s'\u00e9tendait jusqu'au milieu de la rivi\u00e8re. Je suis convaincu que le r\u00f4le d'\u00e9valuation de l'intim\u00e9e ne s'applique qu'\u00e0 la partie du pont qui se trouve \u00e0 Sainte-Rose.\nDepuis l'audition, un factum suppl\u00e9mentaire de l'intim\u00e9e affirme que cette partie du pont qui se trouve dans Sainte-Rose a \u00e9t\u00e9 v\u00e9rifi\u00e9e au bureau d'enregistrement par les avocats des parties comme ayant pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment la longueur mentionn\u00e9e au livre de renvoi, 8 arpents, 9 perches et 4 pieds. L'appelant, qui a produit \u00e9galement un factum suppl\u00e9mentaire, n'a pas contest\u00e9 cette affirmation. Dans ces circonstances, \u00e9tant d'avis que toutes les pr\u00e9tentions de l'appelant sont mal fond\u00e9es, je ne crois pas devoir renvoyer le dossier en cour sup\u00e9rieure aux seules fins de faire v\u00e9rifier un fait qui me para\u00eet suffisamment d\u00e9couler des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve que nous trouvons au dossier, savoir que l'intim\u00e9e n'a impos\u00e9 de taxes que sur la partie du pont B\u00e9lair qui se trouve chez elle.\nJe suis d'avis de renvoyer l'appel avec d\u00e9pens.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: J.

Respondent.\n1922: February 28; 1922: March 29.\nPresent: Idington, Anglin, Brodeur and Mignault JJ. and Cassels J. ad hoc.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF KING'S BENCH, APPEAL SIDE, PROVINCE OF QUEBEC.\nNegligence \u2014 Accident \u2014 Damages \u2014 Fault \u2014 Presumption of fault \u2014 Industrial establishment\u2014Employment of persons under 16 years\u2014 Liability of employers\u2014Arts. 1053, 1054, 1055 C.C.\u2014\"Industrial Establishments Act,\" R.S.Q. (1909) Arts. 3835, 3835d.\nThe respondents' son, aged fourteen years and with no education, was employed at the appellant company's factory. With the probable intention of going out without being seen, he climbed over a barricade placed to prevent the use as a means of egress of a doorway, left open for the purpose of ventilation, and fell to the bottom of a smoke flue where his body was found two days later.\nHeld, Idington and Brodeur JJ. dissenting, that, upon the evidence, the appellant cannot be held liable for the accident, which was due to the sole fault of the respondent's son.\nPer Anglin, Mignault and Cassels JJ.\u2014The facts in this case do not constitute any presumption of fault against the appellant company under article 1054 C.C. Quebec Railway, L.H. and P. Co. v. Vandry ([1920] A.C. 662) discussed.\nArticle 3835 R.S.Q. (1909), as amended by 9 Geo. V., c. 50, provides that the owner of an industrial establishment shall not employ boys or girls under sixteen years of age unless they can read and write fluently; and article 5835d provides that the employers who do not comply with these enactments cannot, in case of accident, allege fault of the injured employee. Held, Idington and Brodeur JJ. dissenting, that, notwithstanding the fact that the appellant company had employed respondent's son in contravention of the statute, it cannot be held liable as no fault on its part had been proven; the meaning of the statutory provisions being that the employer, when himself guilty of fault, cannot invoke the fault of the injured employee as a contributing cause of the accident.\nJudgment of the Court of King's Bench (Q.R. 32 KB. 30) reversed, Idington and Brodeur JJ. dissenting.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King's Bench, appeal side, Province of Quebec[1], affirming the judgment of the Court of Review[2], and maintaining the respondent's action which had been dismissed by the trial judge.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions in issue are fully stated in the above head-note and in the judgments now reported.\nJohn Hackett K.C. and E. F. Newcombe for the appellant. The appellant company cannot be held liable, as no fault or negligence on its part had been proven; this is a finding of fact by the trial judge.\nThe \"Industrial Establishments Act\" does not apply, as the respondent's son was not an employee of the appellant at the time of his death, as he had voluntarily broken his contract.\nThe sanction of article 3835 of the Act is found in article 3835 (b), which provides that, in case of accident, the employer cannot plead contributory negligence on the part of the victim; but the fault of the employee can be invoked.\nJohn Hackett K.C. and E. F. Newcombe for the appellant.\nGu\u00e9rin for the respondent. Idington J. (dissenting).\u2014I think this appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAnglin J.\u2014I am, with great respect, of the opinion that the judgment of the learned trial judge dismissing this action was right and should be restored.\nFour grounds of liability are urged on behalf of the plaintiff:\n(1) Actual fault on the part of the defendant, entailing liability under Art. 1053 C.C., as found by the Court of King's Bench;\n(2) Presumed fault of the defendant, based on its having had the care of the thing which caused the death of the plaintiff's son, as found by the Court of Review;\n(3) Fault under Art. 1055 C.C. because the slabs covering the flue were in bad condition;\n(4) Breach by the defendant of the \"Industrial Establishments Act\" (Art. 3835 R.S.Q., 1909) in employing a boy under sixteen years of age who did not read and write fluently and easily, and also of the requirements of Art. 3831, which prescribes that all such establishments shall be built and kept in such a manner as to secure the safety of all employed in them.\nThe evidence makes it reasonably clear that the plaintiff's son was killed as the result of climbing over a barricade placed to prevent the use as a means of egress of a doorway, left open for the purpose of ventilation, and then jumping on a smoke flue a few feet below and to one side, which apparently gave way under the impact allowing him to fall nine feet to the bottom of the flue and incidentally to break his leg, which probably rendered futile any effort on his part to escape. His partly calcined body was found two days later in the broken flue. The adequacy of the barricade to prevent any person mistaking the doorway in question as intended for use as an exit or accidentally falling through it admits of no doubt. There is not a vestige of evidence that the defendants had any reason to anticipate that anybody\u2014even a lad running away from his work\u2014would use the doorway as the unfortunate Despins did, or would jump down on top of the smoke flue, as he almost certainly must have done. The doorway in question opened on a court yard, the bottom of which was some eight feet below its sill, and from which there does not appear to have been any access to the street, unless by some very indirect route. I am unable to find actionable fault on the part of the defendants in regard to the condition of either the doorway or of the smoke flue. Both were made use of for a purpose and in a manner which it cannot be said the defendants should reasonably have anticipated. There is in my opinion no evidence to warrant either a finding of fault under Art. 1053 C.C. or a breach of Art. 3831 (R.S.Q. 1909) of the \"Industrial Establishments Act.\" I also agree with the learned judges who have held Art. 1055 C.C. inapplicable to the circumstances of this case.\nThe employment of the plaintiff's boy may have been\u2014probably upon the evidence in the record must be assumed to have been\u2014in contravention of Art. 3835 of the \"Industrial Establishments Act.\" Moreover, there may be very good reason for grave disapproval of the conduct of the defendant's foreman in regard to imposing extra work on the boy. But I cannot find that either one or the other of these matters was a determining cause of the accident which befell him. The only reasonable inference from the evidence seems to me to be that the sole determining cause of that accident was the boy's own rash act; and, while that may not be attributed to him by the defendant as a fault (Art. 3835 (d)), it excluded the existence of fault on the part of the defendant being a contributing cause.\nIt seems quite clear also, although no point is made of it, that keeping the boy at work during the night was a direct contravention of Art. 3835 (a). But this again was not a determining cause of the accident.\nThere is nothing to shew that the appellant's factory fell within any classification made by the Lieutenant Governor in Council under Art. 3833.\nWhere a master employs young boys and girls in any dangerous work he must no doubt take reasonable precautions to safeguard them against increased risk due to their inexperience and incapacity to protect themselves. He must keep a watchful eye on mischievous boys and guard them against such dangers as he does, or should anticipate they may incur. Robinson v. W. H. Smith[3] illustrates the principle. But a factory is not a kindergarten and injury sustained from causes not arising out of the employment and from conditions which a prudent master would not anticipate as at all likely to occasion it even to a youthful employee does not import fault.\nThe fact that the plaintiff himself was a party to the illegal employment of his son and incurred a statutory penalty for that offence (Art. 3850 R.S.Q. (1909)) probably presents a serious obstacle to his maintaining this action so far as it rests on a breach of the \"Industrial Establishments Act.\"\nFinally, there is no ground for a presumption of fault under Art. 1054 C.C. The damage was not caused by anything which the defendant had under its care. The sole proximate or determining cause, as already stated, was the act of the unfortunate boy himself. On this aspect of the case I agree with the views expressed by Mr. Justice Martin.\nThe appeal should be allowed. The defendants are entitled to their costs in the Court of Review, the Court of King's Bench, and this court, if they think it proper to exact them. There is not a little in the circumstances which leads me to express the hope that they will not do so.\nBrodeur J. (dissenting).\u2014La question dans cette cause est de savoir si la compagnie Dominion Glass doit \u00eatre tenue responsable de la mort d'Armand Despins, le fils du demandeur.\nArmand Despins \u00e9tait un jeune gar\u00e7on de quatorze ans et quelques mois qui travaillait de nuit dans les usines de cette compagnie. Le 18 juin 1919, son contrema\u00eetre, apr\u00e8s lui avoir reproch\u00e9 vivement son manque d'assiduit\u00e9 au travail et apr\u00e8s lui avoir dit qu'il le cong\u00e9dierait s'il ne s'amendait pas, lui donnait cependant \u00e0 faire une besogne plus consid\u00e9rable que d'ordinaire, vu l'absence d'un ouvrier. Il faisait tr\u00e8s chaud dans les usines ce soir-l\u00e0. Apr\u00e8s avoir travaill\u00e9 une couple d'heures, Despins a dit \u00e0 un de ses jeunes compagnons de travail qu'il \u00e9tait fatigu\u00e9 et qu'il laissait le service. Il se fit donner son paletot par ce compagnon. Afin de se d\u00e9rober \u00e0 la vue du contrema\u00eetre, il ne passa pas par la porte ordinaire, mais monta sur une passerelle qui aboutissait \u00e0 une ouverture donnant sur une cour int\u00e9rieure. Cette ouverture \u00e9tait de plusieurs pieds plus \u00e9lev\u00e9e que le sol de la cour; il lui a fallu sauter et il est all\u00e9 retomber sur un conduit d'air chaud qui, quoique recouvert de quelques briques, a du c\u00e9der sous la pression de son poids, car deux jours apr\u00e8s on retrouvait son cadavre dans ce conduit.\nLa cour sup\u00e9rieure a renvoy\u00e9 l'action en disant qu'il n'y avait pas faute de la part de la d\u00e9fenderesse. La cour de r\u00e9vision a accord\u00e9 cinq cents piastres de dommages. Deux des juges de cette derni\u00e8re cour ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d'opinion qu'il y avait eu par la d\u00e9fenderesse violation de la loi concernant l'emploi des gar\u00e7ons illettr\u00e9s dans sa manufacture et qu'il y avait pr\u00e9somption de faute sous l'article 1054 du code civil. Le juge Demers \u00e9tait d'opinion qu'il avait responsabilit\u00e9 sous l'article 1053 C.C.\nLa cour d'appel a confirm\u00e9 le jugement de la cour de r\u00e9vision, mais n'a pas acquiesc\u00e9 \u00e0 la proposition que l'article 1054 C.C. et que la cause de Quebec Ry. H. L. & P. Co. v. Vandry[4], invoqu\u00e9e par la majorit\u00e9 des juges de la cour de revision, pouvaient s'appliquer. Deux des juges de la cour d'appel, les honorables MM. Martin et Flynn \u00e9taient dissidents.\nIl y a eu, comme on le voit, beaucoup de divergence d'opinion dans les tribunaux inf\u00e9rieurs; et malgr\u00e9 qu'il ne s'agisse que d'un arr\u00eat d'esp\u00e8ce et que d'une condamnation de $500, il y a dans cette divergence d'opinion suffisamment pour justifier la d\u00e9fenderesse de se pourvoir devant cette cour.\nJe crois, pour ma part, qu'il y a responsabilit\u00e9 sous l'article 1053 du code civil et en vertu de la loi concernant l'emploi des gar\u00e7ons illettr\u00e9s dans les \u00e9tablissements industriels. Je concours dans l'opinion exprim\u00e9e si succinctement et si clairement par l'honorable juge Demers, quand il dit: Un ma\u00eetre, surtout lorsqu'il emploie de jeunes enfants, doit \u00e9carter tout danger dans ou pr\u00e8s de son \u00e9tablissement. Il doit s'attendre que ces enfants parcoureront tous les alentours; s'ils ne le faisaient pas, ce ne seraient pas des enfants. Ce malheureux accident aurait pu et d\u00fb \u00eatre pr\u00e9venu.\nUn patron doit prendre toutes les pr\u00e9cautions voulues pour \u00e9viter les accidents qui peuvent survenir aux ouvriers qu'il emploie. La jurisprudence va m\u00eame jusqu'\u00e0 \u00e9dicter sa responsabilit\u00e9 m\u00eame dans les cas o\u00f9 des accidents seraient la suite de l'imprudence de l'ouvrier lui-m\u00eame (Dalloz, 1881-2-79; 1884-2-89;1879-2-204).\nCette obligation du patron est encore plus \u00e9tendue quand l'ouvrier est un enfant qui, ignorant le danger, n'a ni la prudence ni l'exp\u00e9rience n\u00e9cessaires pour se prot\u00e9ger. Dalloz, 1879-2-47; 1886-2-153; 1887 -2-208; 1890-2-239).\nDans le cas actuel, il incombait \u00e0 la d\u00e9fenderesse, la Dominion Glass Company, de fermer cette ouverture de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 ce que les jeunes gar\u00e7ons qu'elle employait ne pussent pas y passer. Si comme elle le pr\u00e9tend, cette porte ne devait servir que pour ventiler son \u00e9tablissement, elle aurait pu alors mettre un grillage dans la partie sup\u00e9rieure. De plus, le conduit d'air chaud n'\u00e9tait pas recouvert de mat\u00e9riaux suffisamment solides pour ces ouvriers\u2014et il devait y en avoir\u2014qui avaient \u00e0 aller dans cette cour de l'usine pouvaient \u00eatre appel\u00e9s d'un moment \u00e0 l'autre \u00e0 franchir ce conduit; et alors elle aurait d\u00fb s'assurer que la couverture f\u00fbt assez solide pour cela. Il para\u00eet \u00e9vident, au contraire, par la preuve que certaines parties de cette couverture avaient perdu de leur force par la chaleur si intense et les gaz qui passaient dans ce conduit. Mais la d\u00e9fenderesse invoque la faute de l'enfant qui n'avait aucunement le droit _ d'aller dans cette cour o\u00f9 se trouvait ce conduit. Le statut cependant l'emp\u00eache d'invoquer cette n\u00e9gligence de la victime. La loi, \u00e0 l'article 3835 des statuts refondus (1909), dit\nqu'il est prohib\u00e9 \u00e0 tout patron d'un \u00e9tablissement industriel * * d'employer un gar\u00e7on ou une fille de moins de seize ans r\u00e9volus, \u00e0 moins qu'ils ne sachent lire et \u00e9crire.\nCes enfants doivent \u00eatre porteurs de certificats vis\u00e9s par l'inspecteur des \u00e9tablissements industriels et les communiquer au patron qui doit en conserver copie (art. 3835b et 3835e S.R.Q.) et l'article 3835 (d) d\u00e9cr\u00e8te que si le patron emploie un gar\u00e7on qui n'est pas porteur de ce certificat,\nil ne peut dans le cas d'accident se pr\u00e9valoir de la faute de la victime.\nVoil\u00e0 qui est bien clair.\nArmand Despins n'avait pas encore quinze ans quand l'accident est arriv\u00e9. Il ne pouvait \u00eatre employ\u00e9 par la Dominion Glass sans avoir un certificat qu'il savait lire et \u00e9crire. Ce certificat n'a jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9mis, et la d\u00e9fenderesse n'en avait pas de copie en sa possession. Alors elle ne peut donc pas invoquer la n\u00e9gligence de ce jeune gar\u00e7on.\nMais on dit que le demandeur, qui \u00e9tait le p\u00e8re de l'enfant \u00e9tait tenu, en vertu de la loi, de faire viser ce certificat par l'inspecteur (art. 3835b). C'est vrai que la loi d\u00e9clare qu'il est tenu \u00e0 cela \"autant que possible;\" mais cette obligation du p\u00e8re ne l'expose qu'\u00e0 une p\u00e9nalit\u00e9; et elle ne saurait \u00eatre invoqu\u00e9e pour diminuer la responsabilit\u00e9 du patron qui est \u00e9nonc\u00e9e aussi formellement que possible.\nPour ces raisons, l'appel doit \u00eatre renvoy\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens. Mignault J.\u2014Voulant d\u00e9serter son poste \u00e0 l'usine de l'appelante et tromper la surveillance du contrema\u00eetre, le fils de l'intim\u00e9, \u00e2g\u00e9 de moins de seize ans, s'est rendu, le soir du 18 juin 1919, dans une annexe de l'usine o\u00f9 il y avait une porte au deuxi\u00e8me \u00e9tage donnant sur une sorte de cour. Cette porte \u00e9tait solidement barricad\u00e9e jusqu'\u00e0 une hauteur d'environ quatre pieds. Rendu l\u00e0, le fils de l'intim\u00e9\u2014personne ne l'a vu, mais ce sont des conjectures que les circonstances autorisent\u2014aurait r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 passer en dessus ou en dessous de la barricade et, dans le but de descendre dans la cour, aurait saut\u00e9 sur un conduit ou tuyau en briques qui se trouvait \u00e0 trois pieds en bas de la porte et un peu \u00e0 c\u00f4t\u00e9, et qui servait de ventilateur \u00e0 la chambre des fournaises. Ce conduit n'\u00e9tant pas de force \u00e0 soutenir le poids de l'enfant\u2014ce n'\u00e9tait pas sa destination non plus\u2014celui-ci tomba dans le conduit et fut trouv\u00e9 l\u00e0 mort deux jours plus tard. C'est de cet accident que l'intim\u00e9 tient l'appelante responsable.\nLa cour sup\u00e9rieure a renvoy\u00e9 l'action de l'intim\u00e9, mais celui-ci obtint une condamnation de $500.00 \u00e0 la cour de revision o\u00f9 la majorit\u00e9 des juges, trouvant' qu'il n'y avait pas de faute de la part de l'appelante, ont cependant condamn\u00e9 cette derni\u00e8re en vertu de la r\u00e8gle de responsabilit\u00e9 l\u00e9gale consacr\u00e9e par la d\u00e9cision du conseil priv\u00e9 dans Quebec Railway L. H. & P. Co. v. Vandry[5]. Sur appel \u00e0 la Cour du Banc du Roi, ce dernier tribunal a confirm\u00e9 le jugement de la cour de revision, retranchant toutefois le \"consid\u00e9rant\" o\u00f9 il est question de la responsabilit\u00e9 l\u00e9gale du fait d'une chose, l'opinion \u00e9tant que la d\u00e9fenderesse avait \u00e9t\u00e9 coupable de faute. Deux des juges, les honorables juges Martin et Flynn, firent enregistrer leur dissidence. Je suis absolument de l'avis.de tous les juges de la Cour du Banc du Roi que le moyen fond\u00e9 sur la d\u00e9cision du conseil priv\u00e9 dans Quebec Railway L. H. & P. Co. v. Vandry[6] \u00e9tait mal fond\u00e9 dans les circonstances de l'esp\u00e8ce. On me permettra d'ajouter, avec toute d\u00e9f\u00e9rence possible, qu'il y a peu de d\u00e9cisions dont on ait plus abus\u00e9. Le conseil priv\u00e9, dans cette cause, a interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 l'article 1054 du code civil, \u00e9cartant le syst\u00e8me traditionnel de la faute, et, dans le cas de dommages caus\u00e9s par une chose, rendant la personne qui avait la garde de cette chose responsable des dommages en vertu de la loi seule et abstraction faite de toute faute, \u00e0 moins que cette personne n'e\u00fbt d\u00e9montr\u00e9 qu'elle n'avait pu emp\u00eacher le fait producteur du dommage. Cette d\u00e9cision nous lie, mais je me garderais bien de l'\u00e9tendre, car elle innove visiblement dans un domaine o\u00f9 la doctrine de la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 de la faute, comme base de la responsabilit\u00e9 civile, paraissait solidement assise. Et dans le cas qui nous occupe, on ne peut dire que le dommage ait \u00e9t\u00e9 caus\u00e9 par la porte. C'est malgr\u00e9 cette porte et sa barricade que l'enfant est parvenu \u00e0 sortir de l'usine. Le fait g\u00e9n\u00e9rateur du dommage n'est donc pas la chose de l'appelante, c'est l'acte de l'enfant lui-m\u00eame, et, pour r\u00e9ussir, l'intim\u00e9 devait prouver une faute, \u00e0 la charge du patron, qui a caus\u00e9 l'accident.\nJe suis d'avis que l'intim\u00e9 a failli dans cette preuve. L'appelante avait pris toutes les mesures que la prudence pouvait sugg\u00e9rer pour emp\u00eacher qu'on ne se f\u00eet mal en passant pr\u00e8s de la porte, dont la fonction n'\u00e9tait pas de servir de sortie mais de donner de l'air \u00e0 l'usine. La porte avait \u00e9t\u00e9 solidement barricad\u00e9e, et ce n'est pas l'insuffisance de la barricade qui a caus\u00e9 la mort de l'enfant de l'intim\u00e9, ce malheur est arriv\u00e9 parce que l'enfant a saut\u00e9 sur le conduit d'air chaud, lequel n'\u00e9tait pas destin\u00e9 \u00e0 cet usage. On pr\u00e9tend que l'appelante aurait d\u00fb mettre un \u00e9criteau \u00e0 la porte pour d\u00e9fendre de sortir par l\u00e0. Si la barricade n'a pas retenu l'enfant, l'\u00e9criteau ne l'aurait pas fait davantage, et on n'a pas prouv\u00e9 que quelqu'un avant cet enfant avait essay\u00e9 de passer par cette porte. D'apr\u00e8s mon opinion, il n'y a aucune faute qu'on puisse reprocher \u00e0 l'appelante.\nL'intim\u00e9 invoque la loi concernant les \u00e9tablissements industriels, art. 3829 et suiv. S.R.Q. (1909), qui, telle qu'amend\u00e9e par la loi 9 Geo. V., ch. 50 (1919), d\u00e9fend d'employer des enfants de moins de seize ans dans ces \u00e9tablissements, \u00e0 moins qu'ils ne sachent couramment lire et \u00e9crire, et, en cas d'accident, d\u00e9clare que le patron ne peut se pr\u00e9valoir de la faute de la victime (art. 3835d).\nCela ne veut pas dire qu'on peut condamner le patron qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 sans faute, mais seulement que le patron fautif ne peut all\u00e9guer, comme justification partielle, la faute de l'enfant. Ici, s'il n'y a eu aucune faute du patron, il n'y a pas de base \u00e0 la responsabilit\u00e9 civile et il importe peu que la victime ait ou n'ait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 imprudente. On pr\u00e9tend que l'emploi d'un enfant en dessous de seize ans, qui ne sait ni lire ni \u00e9crire, est contraire \u00e0 la loi. En supposant qu'il en soit ainsi et que le p\u00e8re de l'enfant, qui a profit\u00e9 de l'engagement de son fils, puisse reprocher cette ill\u00e9galit\u00e9 au patron, ce n'est pas l'engagement de l'enfant qui a caus\u00e9 l'accident. Le patron a pu encourir l'amende inflig\u00e9e par cette loi, mais on ne saurait, \u00e0 raison de l'emploi d'un enfant en contravention \u00e0 la loi, rendre le patron, qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 sans faute, responsable d'un accident dont l'enfant a \u00e9t\u00e9 victime. Je maintiendrais l'appel avec frais de toutes les cours et je renverrais Faction.\nCassels J.\u2014I concur with Mr. Justice Anglin.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Foster, Mann, Place, MacKinnon, Hackett and Mulvena.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Trudeau & Gu\u00e9rin.\n[1] Q.R. 32 K.B. 30.\n[2] Q.R. 59 S.C. 199.\n[3] [1901] 17 Times L.

V. c. 63 \"Act to amend the Supreme Court Act\" 10 & 11 Geo. V. c. 32, s. 1, s.s. (b).\nSubsection 3 (c) of section 219 of the B.C. \"Municipal Act,\" as enacted by 9 Geo. V., c. 63, provides that inter alia \"the powers of (the Court of Revision) shall be * * * to fix the assessment upon such land as is held in blocks of three or more acres and used solely for agricultural or horticultural purposes, and during such use only at the value which the same has for such purposes without regard to its value for any other purposes.\"\nHeld, Duff and Anglin JJ. dissenting, that this provision is imperative and does not admit of any discretionary power in the Court of Revision; that it requires that court to fix at its agricultural value the assessment of all lands held in blocks of three or more acres; and that the only discretion given the court is that of finding whether the land is solely used for agricultural purposes.\nPer Idington J.\u2014 Assuming such a provision to be discretionary, then this case would not be appealable to this court, as it is expressly excluded by s.s. (b) of the first section of the \"Act to amend the Supreme Court Act\" 10 & 11 Geo. V., c. 32. APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1], affirming, on equal division of the court, the judgment of Macdonald J. and maintaining the respondent's petition.\nThe respondents are the owners of 45.56 acres of land. In 1921, the assessor of the corporation appellant assessed part of this land at $2,700 per acre and the remainder at $2,250. The respondents appealed from this assessment to the Court of Revision of the appellant on the grounds that such land was and had been for several years used solely for agricultural purposes and should be assessed at the value which the same has for such purposes, without regard to the value for any other purposes, the respondents urging that the terms of s.s. 3 (c) of s. 219 of the B.C. \"Municipal Act,\" [(B.C.) 1919, s. 63, s. 7] were mandatory. The Court of Revision dismissed the appeal and confirmed the assessment. On appeal to Macdonald J., it was held that the land was and has been used for agricultural purposes, and the assessment was reduced to $250 per acre. This judgment was affirmed by the Court of Appeal[2], on equal division of the court.\nLafleur K.C. for the appellant. The power of the Court of Revision is discretionary and not obligatory: Julius v. Lord Bishop of Oxford[3]; Rex v. Mitchell[4].\nMcVeity for the respondents.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014 This is an appeal from the Court of Appeal of British Columbia which on an equal division of opinion dismissed an appeal from the judgment of Mr. Justice McDonald who, in his turn had allowed an appeal from the assessment of the Court of Revision assessing the lands of William Shannon and another, the now respondents, at their actual value and not at their agricultural value.\nThe learned judge held that on the proper construction of sec. 219 of the \"Municipal Act Amendment Act,\" 1919, (9 Geo. V., c. 63) all the lands of the respondents lying to the west of Granville St. came within the amended section of the statute, clause (c) s.s. 3, and in being used for agricultural purposes should be assessed at an amount not exceeding $250 per acre.\nThe amended section of the Act of 1919 replaced a section of the Act of 1917 which was as follows:\u2014\nThe Court of Revision shall have power to reduce the assessed value of land held and used solely for agricultural or horticultural purposes to such an amount as may seem just and equitable not withstanding that the same may be fixed thereby at an amount equal to its value for agricultural purposes. The section shall not apply to any lands the area of which is less than three acres.\nThat amended section reads as follows:\nThe powers of such court shall be\n(c) To fix the assessment on such lands, as is held in blocks of three or more acres and used solely for agricultural or horticultural purposes and during such use only at the value which the same has for such purpose without regard to its value for any other purpose or purposes.\nThe question in the appeal before us was whether this amended section was to be construed as discretionary or mandatory.\nIt is in my opinion necessary to read clauses (b) and (c) of s.s. 3 of sec. 219 of the Act of 1919 in order to gather their true meaning and intent.\nSub-section 3 of sec. 219 reads as follows:\u2014\n219 (3) The powers of the Court shall be:\n(a) To meet at the time or times appointed, and to try all complaints lodged with the assessor in accordance with the provisions of this Act; (b) To investigate the said roll and the various assessments therein made, whether complained against or not, and so adjudicate upon the same that the same shall be fair and equitable and fairly represent the actual value of each parcel of land and actual value of the land and improvements within the municipality; provided however, that the said court shall not during the year 1920 reduce the assessment of any parcel of land to an amount below ninety per cent of the amount for which such parcel of land was assessed on the assessment roll next preceding;\n(c) To fix the assessment upon such land as is held in blocks of three or more acres and used solely for agricultural or horticultural purposes, and during such use only at the value which the same has for such purposes without regard to its value for any other purpose or purposes.\nNow clause (c) as I have said, was introduced into the Act of 1919 in substitution of the clause I have above quoted from the Act of 1917. That section vested in the Court of Revision a discretionary power\nto reduce the assessed value of land held and used solely for agricultural or horticultural purposes to such an amount as may seem just and equitable.\nIt clearly vested in the Court of Revision a discretionary power to reduce the assessed value of lands held and used solely for agricultural purposes, but did not apply to any lands the area of which was less than three acres. It gave apparently no power to increase the assessment of such lands and its language was somewhat indefinite.\nThe amendment, clause (c) of sub-sec. 3 of sec. 219 of the Act of 1919 gave expressly no such discretionary power. Its language is mandatory and, in my opinion, clear and definite. The preceding clause (b) had vested a judicial discretion in the Court of Revision with respect to the various assessments made in the roll and so to adjudicate upon them that they\nshould be fair and equitable and fairly represent the actual value of each parcel of land and improvements within the municipality. Clause (c), however, which follows, dealing with\nlands held in blocks of three or more acres and used solely for agricultural or horticultural purposes and during such use only\nexplicitly directs the Court of Revision to\nfix the assessment at the value which the same has for such purposes without regard to its value for any other purposes.\nThe general discretionary power given to the court by clause (b) does not and cannot in my judgment apply to such agricultural land. That is made an exception. The court is directed to fix the value which the land has for agricultural purposes only, and to make the intention of the legislature absolutely clear, the words are added\nwithout regard to its value for any other purposes.\nThe court had to find first that the land was held in blocks of three or more acres and was used solely for agricultural purposes and when they had so found was to fix the value which the lands had\nfor such purpose without regard to its value for any other purpose or purposes.\nNo language could be used more clearly expressing the meaning of the legislature.\nI can find no possibility of any discretion being vested in the court other than that expressly given. The court is directed to fix the assessment upon lands which they find exceed in area blocks of three or more acres and which are\nused solely for agricultural or horticultural purposes * * * at the value which the lands have for such purpose without regard to its value for any other purposes.\nI repeat I can find no room whatever for the introduction of any discretion on the part of the Court of Revision beyond that which the clause expressly gives of finding the value of the lands for agricultural purposes irrespective of its value for any other purposes. The reasonableness or unreasonableness of this provision is not of course open to consideration on our part. We have to deal only with the language used by the legislature which, as I have said, is in my opinion clear and distinct and not open to any doubt. Clause (c) is undoubtedly an exception to the general discretionary powers given and imposed upon the court by clause (b). The only discretion given the court in clause (c) is that of finding whether the lands are bona fide and solely used for agricultural or horticultural purposes, and when that is so found then the duty is imposed upon the court of assessing the lands at the value which the lands have for\nagricultural purposes without regard to its value for any other purpose or purposes.\nFor these reasons I would dismiss the appeal with costs and so confirm the judgment of Mr. Justice McDonald.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014 This is an assessment appeal which turns, if appealable, upon section 219 of the \"Municipal Act Amendment Act,\" 1919, of British Columbia, which enacted as follows:\u2014\n219 (1). Every assessment roll shall be considered and dealt with by a Court of Revision, which shall consist of the members of the Council or five members thereof appointed for that purpose by resolution at the first meeting of the Council;\nand by Sub-section 3 thereof, as follows:\n(3) The powers of such court shall be:\u2014\n(a) To meet at the time or times appointed, and to try all complaints lodged with the assessor in accordance with the provisions of this Act;\n(b) To investigate the said roll and the various assessments therein made, whether complained against or not, and so adjudicate upon the same that the same shall be fair and equitable and fairly represent the actual value of each parcel of land and actual value of the land and improvements within the municipality: provided however, the said court shall not during the year 1920 reduce the assessment of any parcel of land to an amount below ninety per cent of the amount for which such parcel of land was assessed on the assessment roll next preceding:\n(c) To fix the assessment upon such land as is held in blocks of three or more acres and used solely for agricultural or horticultural purposes, and during such use only at the value which the same has for such purposes without regard to its value for any other purpose or purposes;\n(d) To direct such alterations to be made in the assessment roll as may be necessary to give effect to their decision.\nIt is Sub-section (c) above quoted that we are especially herein concerned with, but I quote the other sections as means of illustrating the nature of the duty imposed by said Sub-section (c) which is so much in dispute between the parties concerned herein that the Court of Appeal was equally divided.\nThe appellant contends that the said Sub-section (c) gave only discretionary power to the Court of Revision to determine whether or not such lands as in question herein should be given or denied the partial exemption provided for under the circumstances indicated from taxation upon the full actual value of the properties in question.\nIt seems to me that if appellant's contention is correct then the duty of the Court of Revision was merely that of a regulative, administrative or executive jurisdiction, and, if so, there exists no jurisdiction in this court to hear this appeal for all such like cases are expressly excluded by s.s. (b) of the first section of the amendment of the \"Supreme Court Act,\" 10-11 Geo. V, cap. 32.\nI incline to the opinion that the legislature intended by said Sub-section (c) to confer only a judicial discretion such as in the Sub-section immediately before and after same, and imposed the duty thereby to exercise the power conferred. All the powers given by this Sub-section 3 (c) of sec. 219, are classed thereby as of the same character and certainly most of them are clearly of a judicial character.\nIn either alternative this appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nI very much doubt if now there is any way of getting special leave, to bring an assessment appeal before this court, as was suggested in argument herein, for section 41 of the \"Supreme Court Act\" which long was the basis for such appeals was repealed by said amending Act of 1920 just now referred to.\nAnd the question arises as to whether what remains or is substituted, will permit of any leave to appeal.\nThe enumerated subject matters which may form the basis for such leave do not seem to comprehend assessment appeals.\nDUFF J. (dissenting).\u2014 The single question raised by this appeal concerns the construction and effect of one of the enactments of the \"Municipal Act Amendment Act\" of 1919, c. 63. The enactment in question is clause (a) of s.s. 3 of sec. 219. Sub-section 3 enumerates the powers of the Court of Revision, and it will be convenient to set it out in full. It is in the following words:\u2014\nSub-sec. 3. The powers of such Court shall be:\u2014\n(a) To meet at the time or times appointed, and to try all complaints lodged with the assessor in accordance with the provisions of this Act;\n(b) To investigate the said roll and the various assessments therein made, whether complained against or not, and so adjudicate upon the same that the same shall be fair and equitable and fairly represent the actual value of each parcel of land and actual value of the land and improvements within the municipality: provided however, the said court shall not during the year 1920 reduce the assessment of any parcel of land to an amount below ninety per cent of the amount for which such parcel of land was assessed on the assessment roll next preceding; (c) To fix the assessment upon such land as is held in blocks of three or more acres and used solely for agricultural or horticultural purposes, and during such use only at the value which the same has for such purposes without regard to its value for any other purpose or purposes;\n(d) To direct such alterations to be made in the assessment roll as may be necessary to give effect to their decision;\n(e) To confirm the roll either with or without amendment.\n(f) Any member of the court may issue a summons in writing to any person to attend as a witness, and any member of the court may administer an oath to any person or witness before his evidence is taken;\n(g)No increase in the amount of assessment and no change in classification from improved to wild lands shall be directed until after five days' notice of the intention to direct such increase or change, and of the time and place of holding the adjourned sittings of the Court of Revision at which such direction is to be made, shall have been given by the assessor in the manner set out in section 214, to the assessed owners of the land on which the assessments are proposed to be increased or changed as to classification, and any party interested or his solicitor or agent if appearing shall be heard by the Court of Revision.\nThe respondents applied to the Court of Revision to have the authority reposed in that court by clause (c) exercised in relation to certain property of theirs in the municipality which had been valued by the assessor in the usual way, that is to say, in conformity with the rule laid down in section 207 of the Act that land \"shall be assessed at its actual value.\" The application was rejected and on appeal to Mr. Justice Mac-donald that learned judge held that by the clause in question a duty was imposed upon the Court of Revision as regards lands satisfying the description of the clause (lands held in blocks of three or more acres and used solely for agricultural or horticultural purposes) to \"fix the assessment upon such lands\" according to the standard laid down in the clause itself. There being no dispute upon the point that the respondents' property falls within the category described, the learned judge allowed the appeal. On appeal to the Court of Appeal the judges of that court were equally divided in opinion, the learned Chief Justice and Mr. Justice Galliher taking the view that a discretion is reposed by the clause in the Court of Revision and that the decisions of the court in exercise of that discretion are not reviewable on appeal; while the other two learned judges constituting the court, Mr. Justice McPhillips and Mr. Justice Eberts, sustained the view of Mr. Justice Macdonald.\nThe municipality now appeals. The British Columbia \"Municipal Act\" (for the purposes of assessment and taxation) provides for the appointment of an assessor whose duty it is in each year to prepare an assessment roll in which he is, among other things, to state the value of lands assessed, the value of improvements upon them and to classify all such lands as wild lands or otherwise; in valuing lands and improvements he is to follow the rules prescribed by sec. 207 already referred to. It is moreover the duty of the assessor, after having sent certain notices to make a statutory declaration to the effect that he has set out in the roll to the best of his judgment and ability \"the true value of the land and improvements\" within the municipality, to return the roll to the clerk of the municipality. The statute sets up a Court of Revision which is to consist of the members of the council or five members thereof appointed at the first meeting of the council and the Act explicitly provides that any person appearing on the roll as the owner of lands or improvements may, at any time not later than ten days before the first annual meeting of the court, complain of any error or omission in the assessment prejudicially affecting him and in particular that any land or improvement in respect of which he is assessed has been valued too high or too low. (Sec. 216 s.s. 1, 2). In the year 1917 by c. 45 of the statutes of that year, sec. 46, a provision was for the first time introduced authorizing the Court of Revision to deal with agricultural lands in a special way, and that provision was in these terms:\u2014\n223a:\u2014 The Court of Revision shall have power to reduce the assessed value of lands held and used solely for agricultural or horticultural purposes to such amount as may seem just and equitable, notwithstanding that the same may be fixed thereby at an amount equal to its actual value for agricultural purposes. This section shall not apply to any lands the area of which is less than three acres.\nIn the year 1919 the provisions of the \"Municipal Act\" relating to assessment and taxation were consolidated and extensively revised. This Act makes very important modifications, and sec. 223a now appears as sec. 219, s.s. 3 (c).\nSection 219 is the first of a group of sections ending with section 222 which is introduced by the heading \"jurisdiction and proceedings,\" and s.s. 3 of that section is, unquestionably, primarily a provision dealing with jurisdiction. The words, it will be noted are, \"the powers of such court shall be\" those which are set forth in the enumerated clauses. Prima facie this is not the language of legislation designed to confer or create substantive rights and when these clauses (other than clause (c) ) are examined it will be found that, save in respect of one particular, the power given is a power to give effect to rights or to perform duties elsewhere provided for. Clause (a) for example, confers authority to try all complaints lodged in accordance with the provisions of the Act and that authority is an authority to effectuate the rights given and to perform the duty imposed by sec. 216, s. ss. 1,2 and 3; the right to prefer the complaint on the one hand and on the other the duty to hear and decide upon the complaint. Sub-sec. (b) is an authority to examine the roll and to see that the same shall be equitable and fairly represent the actual value of the land and improvements, in other words, to see that the assessments have been made in conformity with the provisions of sec. 207 and to perform the duties imposed upon the court by sec. 219 s.s. 1, which requires that each assessment roll shall be considered and dealt with by a Court of Revision. Sec. (d) which gives authority to direct alterations in the assessment roll in order to give effect to the decisions of the court merely confers jurisdiction to carry out the duties imposed by sec. 216, s. ss. 1, 2 and 3. Clause (e) gives authority to confirm the roll either with or without amendment and that is an authority to carry out the duties imposed by sec. 222, s.s. 1 and by sec. 216, s. ss. 1, 2 and 3, where the court decides that the roll is unobjectionable.\nThus, with the exception of clause (b), it can be affirmed in respect of all clauses just referred to that the true office of them is that which is their prima facie office, namely, to confer jurisdiction and to give effect to rights or to perform duties elsewhere provided for. As regards sub-clause (b) authority is given to revise and to correct the roll in pursuance of a complaint which authority, as already mentioned, is an authority to do no more than to give effect to the rights and perform the duties provided for by sec. 216; but there is a further authority and that is to investigate assessments even in the absence of complaint and as regards the value of lands and improvements, to bring the assessed value in to accord with the value as determined by the standard laid down in sec. 207. Now it seems to be abundantly clear that this last mentioned authority is a discretionary authority. In the first place it is incredible that the burden of examining every valuation, collecting evidence in relation to it and passing upon it should have been placed upon the board of revision. Again if such were the duty of the Court of Revision, the imperative duty of the Court of Revision, it is not easy to see the necessity for the enactments of sec. 216 requiring the board in terms to reconsider an assessment in respect of which complaint is made. In the second place the contrast between the language of sec. 216 which, in case of complaint, requires the board to proceed, and the language of sub-clause (b) which is facultative only, appears to be conclusive upon the point.\nComing now to clause (c). In relation to the matter dealt with in this clause, the Sub-section, here as in relation to the other enumerated matters, professes simply to give jurisdiction. The words, as they stand, (to quote Lord Cairns, in the case of Julius v. Lord Bishop of Oxford[5],\nare not equivocal. They are plain and unambiguous. They are words merely making that legal and possible which there would otherwise be no authority to do. They confer a faculty or power and they do not of themselves do more than confer a faculty or power.\nNevertheless, as Lord Cairns points out, although such is the effect of the words in themselves, there may be something in the nature of the thing empowered to be done, something in the object for which it is to be done, making it a duty of the body in whom the authority is reposed to exercise that authority. But Lord Cairns proceeds:\nIt lies upon those * * * who contend that an obligation exists to exercise (the) power, to shew in the circumstances of the case something which * * * creates this obligation. And the question as Lord Selborne lays down in the same case at p. 235,\nin general * * * is to be solved from the context of the particular provisions or from the general scope and objects of the enactment conferring the power.\nThe clauses of s.s. 3 other than clause (c) afford admirable examples of a power or faculty conferred by language in itself enabling only, which upon definite conditions it becomes by reason of provisions enacted aliunde the duty of the authority possessing it to exercise. For example clause (b) in so far as it gives jurisdiction to hear and decide complaints in respect of the valuation of property is a jurisdiction which the person assessed or the municipal council itself is entitled to invoke and which it is a duty of the Court of Revision to exercise where the party invoking it has complied with the conditions laid down in sec. 216, s.s. 1, 2 and 3.\nThe question upon which we have to pass is whether such a duty\u2014with the correlative right\u2014arises by virtue of clause (c), a duty which requires the court to exercise the authority thereby given when it is shewn that a piece of property falls within the description supplied by the clause; and for this purpose we must examine the pertinent provisions of the statute relating to this subject of assessment and assessment appeals to ascertain whether there is adequate evidence of an intention on the part of the legislature to establish the right and the duty contended for.\nThere is nothing in the provisions of the Act in express terms conferring such a right or creating such a duty. On the contrary there is much in the Act to indicate that the legislature had no intention of doing so. In the first place, what I have already said sufficiently indicates that where an imperative duty was to be laid upon the Court of Revision the legislature has imposed the duty in explicit terms. In the next place, the system of assessment, as I have already mentioned, contemplates a valuation in the first instance by an assessor, according to standards of valuation laid down in obligatory fashion by the statute. These obligatory standards of valuation are standards which are dealt with in elaborate terms in a part of the Act exclusively devoted to that purpose and grouped under the heading \"valuation.\" There is not a syllable in its provisions giving countenance to the idea that any such obligatory standard as is now contended to be applicable to this case was contemplated. The function of the Court of Revision is in general that which is implied in its title; and perhaps still more clearly implied in the terms of the oath prescribed for the members of the court by sec. 219, s.s. 2. It is a court appointed for the purpose of revising the assessment roll, correcting the work of the assessor and causing the assessment roll as made up by the assessor to conform to the requirements of the statute where such requirements are of an obligatory character. According to the interpretation now proposed, an exception would be introduced and a departure from this rule for which there appears to be no satisfactory reason. I cannot conceive any reason why (if in the case of lands meeting the description of clause (c) the standard of valuation is that which is now suggested) the statute has not made it the duty of the assessor in the first instance to deal with the subject. The assessor has responsible duties; it is his duty as already pointed out, to value lands and to classify lands, and I have heard no reason why, if the provision in question is to have the effect contended for, there should have been this departure from the ordinary procedure. The amendment of 1917 clearly gave to the Court of Revision an authority which was discretionary; and having regard to the considerations mentioned the doubtful language (conceding for the moment that it is doubtful) of clause (c) does not, I think, afford sufficient evidence that the legislature contemplated a change of the law in this respect.\nIt is not necessary for the purpose of this appeal to decide whether or not the discretion vested in the Court of Revision is one which may be exercised in relation to individual cases; or, on the other hand, whether the clause is not intended to confer upon the Court of Revision an administrative authority to establish in its discretion a rule governing the valuation of all lands in the municipality answering the description contained in the clause. It is quite plain on either view that it is not competent to a court of appeal to set aside a decision of the Court of Revision in exercise of its discretion on the ground that it has erred in exercising it.\nThe appeal should be allowed.\nANGLIN J. (dissenting).\u2014 I concur with Mr. Justice Duff.\nBRODEUR J.\u2014 The question in this case is whether agricultural or horticultural lands in the municipality of Point Grey should be assessed as such or should be assessed at their actual value.\nThe Court of Revision that has been established for the purpose of \"confirming and authenticating\" the assessment roll is composed of the members of the council or of five members thereof. The members of the court, before acting, take an oath that they will honestly decide the complaints presented to the court. The powers of the court are to be found in sec. 219, s.s. 3 of the Municipal Act of British Columbia. It has the power to investigate the roll, whether complained of or not, and to adjudicate that the same shall be fair and equitable. One of those powers is\nto fix the assessment upon such land as is held in blocks of three or more acres and used solely for agricultural or horticultural purposes, and during such use only at the value which the same has for such purposes without regard to its value for any other purpose.\nThe Court of Revision in the present case refused to assess Shannon's property as agricultural lands. An appeal from that decision having been brought before Mr. Justice Macdonald, the Court of Revision's decision was reversed and it was held that, the lands in question being used solely for agricultural or horticultural purposes, it was the duty of the Court of Revision to assess them as such and that the power which was given the court was not discretionary but mandatory.\nSome previous legislation dealing with the same subject for the first time in that province might have been properly construed as giving a discretionary power to the Court of Revision. But the law was amended, and the evident purpose was to impose a duty which formerly was of a discretionary nature.\nThere is no doubt that the land in question has been for thirty years or more a true agricultural land and has been exploited as such. Its value has been increased by the fact that the surrounding properties have become a residential part. If it were converted into town lots, it would give a larger income but their owners are satisfied to continue its exploitation as a farming land. The legislature, with the evident intention of encouraging agriculture, has enacted the legislation under review.\nIn Julius v. Lord Bishop of Oxford[6], Lord Selborne said, p. 235, respecting the construction of the words: \"it shall be lawful, and the like, when used in public statutes\":\nI agree with my noble and learned friends who have preceded me, that the meaning of such words is the same, whether there is or is not a duty or obligation to use the power which they confer. They are potential, and never (in themselves) significant of any obligation. The question whether a judge, or a public officer, to whom a power is given by such words, is bound to use it upon any particular occasion, or in any particular manner, must be solved aliunde, and, in general, it is to be solved from the context, from the particular provisions, or from the general scope and objects, of the enactment conferring the power.\nAll the powers which are vested in the Court of Revision in the different subsections of section 219 of the \"Municipal Act\" are of a mandatory character with the exception of the investigating power; why should the power given as to agricultural lands not be put on the same footing?\nI have come to the conclusion that the words in question are \"significant of an obligation\" to use the expression of Lord Selborne, and that it was then the duty of the Court of Revision to use its powers for the benefit of the farmers and horticulturists of good faith whose farms are in the territory of Point Grey.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nMIGNAULT J.\u2014 This is an appeal from the judgment of the Court of Appeal of British Columbia, dismissing on an equal division an appeal from the judgment of Mr. Justice Macdonald. The latter decided, in favour of the respondents, an appeal from the decision of the Court of Revision of the Corporation of Point Grey, a suburb of the City of Vancouver, and his judgment is attacked by the appellant.\nThe question to be decided, briefly stated, is whether, in the case of the assessment of lands coming within the contemplation of paragraph (c) of Sub-section 3 of section 219 of the \"Municipal Act Amendment Act\" of 1919, 9 Geo. V, c. 63 ,the Court of Revision has any discretion to refuse to fix the assessment of the lands at the value they have for agricultural or horticultural purposes without regard to their value for any other purposes.\nMr. Justice Macdonald found all the facts in favour of the respondents holding that their land was acquired in 1890, and has ever since been used by them solely for agricultural purposes, and that there was no suggestion that they were simply utilizing their property in this manner for the purpose of coming within the provisions of the statute. The only question that now arises is therefore the proper construction of the statute.\nReferring very briefly to the system of municipal assessment and taxation in British Columbia, I may say that properties are assessed at their actual value by a municipal officer known as the assessor. From this valuation an appeal lies by a complaint lodged with him to a body called the Court of Revision consisting of the members of the municipal council or five members thereof appointed for that purpose by resolution of the council. This court, the statute shews, is the real assessing body.\nThe duties of the Court of Revision are laid down in detail by section 219 of the statute, subsection 3, which is in the following terms: (see page 559). The assessment in question is for the year 1921, so the proviso of paragraph (b) is without application.\nThe construction of paragraph (c) is in issue between the parties. This provision before 1919, and as enacted by the \"Municipal Amendment Act\" of 1917, ch. 45, sec. 46, read as follows:\u2014\nThe Court of Revision shall have power to reduce the assessed value of lands held and used solely for agricultural or horticultural purposes to such amount as may seem just and equitable, notwithstanding that the same may be fixed thereby at an amount equal to its actual value for agricultural purposes. The section shall not apply to any lands the area of which is less than three acres.\nIt is important to note that the earlier enactment probably conferred a discretionary power on the Court of Revision, which, in the case of land held and used solely for agricultural or horticultural purposes, could reduce the assessed value of the land to such an amount as might seem just and equitable, so that the valuation might be placed anywhere between the actual value and the value for agricultural purposes.\nThe change in the language of this enactment is an important factor in arriving at its proper construction. There is no question now of reducing the assessed value of the land to such an amount as may seem just and equitable, but the power of the Court of Revision is to fix the assessment upon the land in question at the value which it has for agricultural or horticultural purposes without regard to its value for any other purposes.\nThe appellant contends that the Court of Revision may refuse to so fix the assessment although the land comes within the description of paragraph (c); that it can have regard to the value of the land for other than agricultural or horticultural purposes; and that it can discriminate between different agricultural or horticultural lands, and in some cases fix the assessment at the agricultural or horticultural value, and in other cases refuse to do so.\nThis appears to me so contrary to the plain language of the statute that I cannot accept the appellant's contention.\nAn effort no doubt should be made to give to permissive words in a statute their natural meaning, but it is equally clear that where a jurisdiction or a power is conferred to be exercised for the benefit of certain persons who are within the intendment of the statute, permissive words such as \"may\" or \"shall have the power\" are to be construed as imposing a duty coupled with a power and are therefore imperative. In Macdougall v. Paterson[7], it was held that where a statute confers an authority to do a judicial act in a certain case, it is imperative on those so authorized to exercise the authority when the case arises, and its exercise is duly applied for by a party interested, and having the right to make the application. See also Howell v. The London Dock Co.[8].\nI have not overlooked the rule of construction contained in the British Columbia \"Interpretation Act,\" R. S. B.C. 1911, ch. 1, sec. 25, as to the meaning of words such as \"may\" or \"shall,\" but these rules apply only where there is nothing in the context or in other provisions pointing to a different meaning, and here I find in the context and accompanying provisions a clear indication that the power conferred by paragraph (c) must be exercised. Subsection 3 opens with the words: \"the powers of such court shall be.\" Paragraph (a) concerns the meeting of the court at the time or times appointed. This is surely imperative. Paragraph (b) requiring the court to investigate the roll and the various assessments, whether complained against or not, and to so adjudicate that the same shall be fair and equitable is also imperative. Paragraph (d)\nto direct such alterations to be made in the assessment roll as may be necessary to give effect to their decision,\nand paragraph (e) \"to confirm the roll either with or without amendment\" are certainly mandatory. The only paragraph which possibly allows the court to deal with a matter of policy is paragraph (g) which refers to increases in the amount of assessment and to changes in classification from improved to wild land; the other paragraphs I have mentioned impose a duty on the court.\nUnder these circumstances, in the absence of apt words conferring a discretion, such perhaps as those contained in the 1917 enactment, it seems difficult to conclude that paragraph (c) is not as imperative as paragraphs (a), (b), (d), and (e) undoubtedly are.\nIt is said that in the case of the suburbs of a large city like Vancouver, it is unreasonable to value lands solely used for agricultural or horticultural purposes on a different scale from the neighbouring lands not utilized for such purposes, and that the Court of Revision should have the discretion to discriminate between lands so situated and lands in an entirely rural district. It suffices to answer that paragraph (c) makes no such distinction. To refuse to fix the value for agricultural or horticultural purposes would be to refuse to exercise the power conferred by this paragraph and, in my opinion, that cannot be done. The court is called upon to determine whether the conditions contemplated exist and if they do exist it has no choice but to fix the lower value. This determination is the only thing the court is empowered to adjudicate upon and when this is done, it must apply the legal consequences. Otherwise it would give effect to the will of the legislature in one case and in a similar case, in so far as the contemplated conditions are concerned, it would refuse to carry it out. I cannot place this construction on paragraph (c).\nThe authorities cited by Mr. Justice Macdonald in the first court and by Mr. Justice Martin and Mr. Justice McPhilips in the Court of Appeal certainly support the conclusion they have adopted, and looking at Sub-section 3 as a whole, this construction appears to me to give full effect to the scheme of assessment and taxation which the legislature has placed on the statute book.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: A.

The whole heating apparatus of the hotel was installed under a wooden shed, on the adjoining lot No. 2608 which was not mentioned in the lease. Later, the respondent leased lot 2608 to Tanguay & Co. where they intended to build an automobile garage. In the course of the construction, Tanguay & Co. began the demolition of the wooden shed without interfering with the heating apparatus. The appellant, alleging that the lease of the hotel implicitly included the shed, applied for the issue of an interlocutory injunction.\nThe application was refused by the Superior Court, which judgment was affirmed by the Court of King's Bench. On appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada, the respondent moved to quash for want of jurisdiction.\nA. C. Hill for the motion: The judgment appealed from is not \"a final judgment.\"\nSt. Laurent K.C. and Alleyn Taschereau, K.C., contra: The judgment involves a \"determination\" of a \"substantive right\" of the appellant, as one of the consid\u00e9rants of the judgment of the Superior Court held that the shed had not been leased to the appellant.\nSt. Laurent K.C. and Alleyn Taschereau, K.C., contra:\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014I am of the opinion that the motion to quash should be granted with costs.\nIdington J.\u2014I am of the opinion that the motion to quash should be granted with costs.\nDuff J.\u2014The judgment appealed from in its essence determines only that the plaintiff was not entitled to an interlocutory injunction in the circumstances. There has been no determination of any substantive right in whole or in part in controversy in the action, a condition which is necessary to bring the judgment within the definition of \"final judgment'' to be found in clauses (e) and (i) of sec. 2 of the \"Supreme Court Act\" relied upon by the appellant.\nAnglin J.\u2014The plaintiff seeks to appeal from the judgment of the Court of King's Bench affirming a judgment of the Superior Court refusing an interlocutory injunction. The defendant moves to quash the appeal on the ground, inter alia, that the judgment appealed from is not a \"final judgment,\" within the meaning of that term as used in the \"Supreme Court Act.\" In my opinion this objection to our jurisdiction is well taken.\nAll that has been \"determined\" is that for certain reasons a case was not made which entitled the plaintiff to the remedy of an interlocutory injunction. It is urged that amongst the reasons assigned there is at least one which involves an adverse determination of the cause of action itself. But, as I apprehend the practice of the courts of the province of Quebec, any reasons affecting the merits of the cause of action which may have influenced the court in passing upon this interlocutory application are open for reconsideration at the trial of the action. Notwithstanding that the application for an interlocutory injunction under Quebec procedure is an independent proceeding by way of petition, and possibly may be made before and without the issue of a writ in the action to which it is incidental, Allard v. Cloutier[1], the disposition of it, in my opinion, cannot be said to involve a \"determination\" of any \"substantive right\" of the plaintiff, within the definition of \"final judgment\" in clause (i) of s. 2 of the \"Supreme Court Act.\" Brodeur J.\u2014L'intim\u00e9e, La compagnie du St. Louis, fait motion pour casser l'appel faute de juridiction.\nLe jugement a quo a \u00e9t\u00e9 rendu sur une requ\u00eate pour injonction interlocutoire. Il y aurait eu d'abord une premi\u00e8re ordonnance d'injonction int\u00e9rimaire \u00e9mise le 26 mars 1921 par l'honorable juge Malouin; mais cette ordonnance a \u00e9t\u00e9, sur exception \u00e0 la forme, d\u00e9clar\u00e9e nulle et non avenue par l'honorable juge-en-chef, Sir Fran\u00e7ois Lemieux, le 4 avril 1921, parce que l'ex\u00e9cution de cette ordonnance n'avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 accompagn\u00e9e ou suivie d'un bref d'assignation.\nL'honorable juge-en-chef avait bas\u00e9 sa d\u00e9cision sur le jugement de la Cour du Banc du Roi dans une cause de Allard v. Cloutier[2]. Dans cette cause, la cour d'appel, afin de mettre fin aux divergences d'opinion qui s'\u00e9taient manifest\u00e9es au sujet de la proc\u00e9dure sur les injonctions demand\u00e9es lors de l'\u00e9mission du bref d'assignation, avait d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'une requ\u00eate pour injonction interlocutoire pouvait \u00eatre pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e avant l'\u00e9mission du bref et que si le juge refusait de l'accorder, alors il pouvait y avoir appel de sa d\u00e9cision avant l'\u00e9mission du bref d'assignation.\nL'appelante, nous dit M. St. Laurent, aurait alors tent\u00e9 de suivre les r\u00e8gles indiqu\u00e9es par la cour d'appel. Elle aurait donn\u00e9 avis, en avril 1921, qu'une requ\u00eate pour \u00e9mission d'une bref d'injonction interlocutoire serait pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e \u00e0 un juge de la cour sup\u00e9rieure. L'honorable juge Letellier, apr\u00e8s avoir entendu les parties, renvoyait la requ\u00eate le 26 avril 1921. Appel de cette derni\u00e8re d\u00e9cision fut port\u00e9 \u00e0 la cour du Banc du Roi qui a confirm\u00e9 la d\u00e9cision de M. le juge Letellier. Et ce jugement de la Cour du Banc du Roi est maintenant port\u00e9 devant cette cour. Nous avons \u00e0 d\u00e9cider si nous avons juridiction pour entendre cette cause.\nIl s'agit, comme on le voit, d'une requ\u00eate pour injonction interlocutoire qui devrait \u00eatre \u00e9mise avec le bref d'injonction.\nCes requ\u00eates, nous dit l'article 957 C.P.C., peuvent s'accorder lorsqu'il appert: 1. que le demandeur a droit au rem\u00e8de demand\u00e9 et que ce rem\u00e8de consiste en tout ou en partie \u00e0 emp\u00eacher la commission d'une op\u00e9ration quelconque; 2. lorsque la commission d'une op\u00e9ration causerait un tort irr\u00e9parable.\nLes requ\u00eates accord\u00e9es pour le premier motif pr\u00e9jugent bien souvent le proc\u00e8s, car elles peuvent adjuger sur le droit lui-m\u00eame du demandeur. Mais les d\u00e9cisions qui interviennent sur ces requ\u00eates peuvent \u00eatre revis\u00e9es par le jugement final. Dans le cas actuel, l'honorable juge Letellier n'a exerc\u00e9 qu'une discr\u00e9tion; or en vertu de la section 38 de l'\"Acte de la Cour Supr\u00eame,\" il n'y a pas d'appel des ordonnances o\u00f9 le juge a exerc\u00e9 un pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire. Il est vrai que le juge, en r\u00e9digeant son jugement, y a ins\u00e9r\u00e9 certains consid\u00e9rants qui peuvent pr\u00e9juger quelques-uns des points en litige.

[1918] c. 168 s. 116.\nBy sec. 116 of The Manitoba Railway Act \"all suits for indemnity for any damage or injury sustained by reason of the construction or operation of the railway shall be instituted within twelve months next after the time of such supposed damage sustained or, if there be continuation of damages, then within twelve months next after the doing or committing of such damage ceases, and not afterwards.\"\nHeld, reversing the judgment of the Court of Appeal (31 Man. R. 74) Idington and Cassels JJ. dissenting, that the limitation prescribed applies in case of an action brought by a railway passenger claiming indemnity for injury so sustained. Ryckman v. Hamilton, etc., Rly. Co., (10 Ont. L.R. 419) considered.\nPer Cassels J. The words \"or if there be continuation of damages, etc.\" indicate that the section was not intended to apply to the case of a passenger injured by negligence of the railway as a common carrier.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba[1] reversing the judgment at the trial in favour of the defendant.\nThe only question submitted on the appeal is whether or not the statutory provision quoted in the head-note applies to the case of injury to a passenger. The contention for the respondent is that the action was one claiming damages for breach of contract to carry safely to which the limitation in the Railway Act does not apply. The Court of Appeal so held reversing the judgment for the railway company at the trial.\nTilley K.C. for the appellant.\u2014The earlier decisions in Ontario and other provinces that the limitation clause does not apply to the case of a passenger carried for here are no longer of authority. Greer v. Canadian Pacific Ry. Co.[2]: Canadian Northern Ry. Co. v. Pszenicnzy[3]: and see Lyles v. Southend-on-Sea[4].\nThe action is based on negligence and its character cannot be changed by claiming for breach of contract.\nChrysler K.C. for the respondent, relied on the Ontario decisions and Sayers v. British Columbia Electric Ry. Co.[5] approved by Duff and Anglin JJ. in British Columbia Electric Ry. Co. v. Turner[6].\nTilley K.C. for the appellant.\nChrysler K.C. for the respondent.\nIdington J. (dissenting).\u2014The respondent was injured whilst a passenger on the appellant's railway by reason of one of the company's cars running behind that in which she was being carried negligently colliding with said car.\nThe appellant's only defence, so far as this appeal is concerned, is rested upon the following statutory limitation, being section 116 of the Manitoba Railway Act:\u2014\nAll suits for indemnity for any damage or injury sustained by reason of the construction or operation of the railway shall be instituted within twelve months next after the time of such supposed damage sustained, or if there be continuation of damages then within twelve months next after the doing or committing of such damage ceases, and not afterwards; and the defendants may plead the general issue and give this Act and the special Act and the special matter in evidence at any trial to be had thereupon, and may prove that the same was done in pursuance of and by authority of this Act and the special Act.\nI think this, as all statutes of limitation, must be held inoperative as a defence unless the language used is so clearly expressed as to leave no doubt of its meaning and that the intention clearly appears to have been to bar the action in which its limitation is so invoked.\nCertainly if we have regard to the judicial opinions expressed in this case and many others upon statutes similarly framed, there must exist the gravest doubt of its ever having been intended by the legislature to take away the right of such persons as respondent resting a claim upon a breach of contract.\nI need not labour the question for I cannot hope to succeed better than many others in numerous other cases which turned upon the like legislative expressions.\nMany of these cases are cited in the opinions of the learned judges below.\nAnd yet we are asked, by way of escape therefrom, to apply the decisions reached upon the Public Protection Act, 1893, far more clearly expressed than the very ambiguous section above quoted.\nI think this appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDuff J.\u2014The respondent's action against the appellant was brought to recover damages for negligence resulting in a collision between two of the appellant's cars in which the respondent, who was travelling as a passenger in one of them, was injured; and the sole question raised by the appeal concerns the construction of section 116 of the Manitoba Railway Act. That section is in these terms:\u2014 All suits for indemnity for any damage or injury sustained by reason of the construction or operation of the railway shall be instituted within twelve months next after the time of such supposed damage sustained, or if there be continuation of damages then within twelve months next after the doing or committing of such damage ceases, and not afterwards: and the defendants may plead the general issue and give this Act and the special Act and the special matter in evidence at any trial to be had thereupon, and may prove that the same was done in pursuance of and by authority of this Act and the special Act.\nIt is not disputed that the negligence to which the respondent's injuries are to be ascribed was negligence in the working of the appellant company's railway; and the point for examination does not touch the meaning of the phrase \"operation of the railway\" the application of which, in cases like the present, would seem to present no difficulty but turns upon the view to be taken of the general scope and purview of the section and the precise point for inquiry is: Does this section embrace within its purview an action brought by a passenger for default in the company's duties arising out of a contract of carriage or from the aceptance of the passenger for carriage?\nThis section appears to have been taken from the first sub-section of section 242 of the Dominion Railway Act of 1903. That section was a modification of an earlier section in which the class of proceedings affected by it was described in these words:\nAll actions or suits for indemnity for any damages or injuries sustained by reason of the railway,\nand these words have been the subject of examination in a series of cases in the courts of Ontario beginning at least as early as 1865. These decisions were subjected to an exhaustive scrutiny in a very able judgment by Osier J. A., speaking for the Ontario Court of Appeal in Ryckman v. Hamilton, etc. Ry. Co.[7] at pages 426 et seq., from which the conclusion was deduced that the class of proceedings contemplated did not include an action based on a railway company's breach of its common law duties founded on its undertaking to carry safely. The decisions were, broadly speaking, based on the view that the protection afforded by the limitation clause was intended to be available only where proceedings were taken against the company for something done in exercise or professed exercise of the special statutory powers given to the company for the purpose of its railway undertaking and was not intended to confer a privilege in respect of proceedings arising out of contracts and relations entered into by the company in the ordinary course of its business as carrier. It is difficult, no doubt, to extract from the judgments a precise definition of the scope of the provision, but one limiting rule was clearly established, and that is that the section did not apply to actions arising out of negligence in the carrying of passengers and some warrant for this way of construing the statute was supposed to be found in the last clause of the section which provided that the\ndefendants * * * may prove that the same was done in pursuance of and by authority of this Act or of the special Act.\nPerhaps the best summary of these authorities is to be found in the judgment of Boyd C. in Traill v. Niagara St. Catharines and Toronto Rly. Co.[8] at page 2, and it is in these words:\u2014\nThe prescription or limitation clauses of the Railway Act have been uniformly held to apply to actions for damages caused or occasioned in the exercise of powers given by the Legislature to the company for enabling them to construct and maintain the line\u2014but not to actions arising out of negligence in the carrying of passengers. This was laid down by the Court of Queen's Bench in 1856, Roberts v. Great Western R. W. Co.[9]. The reason of this rule was well defined by Richards J. soon afterwards in Auger v. Ontario Simcoe and Huron Ry. Co.[10]: \"The limitation clauses do not apply when the companies are carrying on the business of common carriers * * * (in the) use (of) locomotives, etc., for the conveyance of passengers and goods, etc., but the liability arises in those cases from the breach of contract, arising from their implied undertaking to carry safely, and to take proper care of the goods, etc.\" These decisions were accepted as rightly stating the law in Ryckman v. Hamilton, Grimsby and Beamsville Electric Ry. Co.[11].\nThe earlier section passed upon in these cases was to be found in virtually identical form in the railway legislation of most of the provinces as well as that of the Dominion and in 1903 as already mentioned that section was replaced in the Consolidation of the Dominion Railway Acts by a section consisting of two subsections, the first of which, as already mentioned, is identical with section 116 of the Manitoba Railway Act quoted above, and the second of which was in these words:\u2014\n(2) In any such action or suit the defendants may plead the general issue, and may give this Act and the special matter in evidence at the trial, and may prove that the said damages or injury alleged were done in pursuance of and by the authority of this Act.\nThis substituted section was held by Boyd C. in the decision above cited to be governed in its construction by the course of decision upon the earlier section; and the field of its application was held on that ground as well as by reason of the express language of sub-section (2) to exclude an action by a passenger for the negligent working of the railway. Section 116 of the Manitoba Act contains no provision corresponding to sub-section (2) but it is argued that the considerations to which effect was given in the construction of the earlier section equally apply to section 116 and that the change in language made for the first time in 1903 is not sufficiently marked to indicate an intention on the part of the legislature to bring about a radical change in the law.\nThe existing section has been the subject of consideration more than once in this court. One of the decisions only has, I think, any relevancy to the present case but that decision does, I think, relieve me from the responsibility of expressing an independent opinion as to the effect of it. I refer to Canadian Northern Ry. Co. v. Pszenicnzy[12]. That was an action brought by an employee of the C. N. Rly. Co. under the Employers' Liability Act of Manitoba, R.S.M. C. 13, sec. 61, for negligence which was held to be the cause of injuries suffered by him while engaged in unloading rails from a car unsuitably equipped for the protection of employees so occupied. Section 306 of the Dominion Railway Act was held to apply. The earlier decisions were relied upon by the plaintiff but it was decided that the section is available in such an action.\nThis decision necessarily involved the proposition that the principle of the restriction established by the earlier decisions could have no application to section 306. I am not aware of any among the earlier decisions which deal with the case of an action by an employee against the railway company for default in its duty arising out of the contract of employment but every argument which could be adduced to sustain the exclusion of actions by passengers for default in respect of duties arising out of the acceptance of a passenger for carriage applies with, if anything, increased force to such an action by an employee. The rights conferred by the Employers' Liability Act are, to borrow a phrase used by Lord Haldane in delivering the judgment of the Judicial Committee in Workmen's Compensation Board v. Canadian Pacific Ry. Co.[13], at page 191, \"the result of statutory conditions of the contract of employment,\" that is to say they are rights attached to the relation of the employer and employee by force of the general law governing the reciprocal rights and duties appertaining to that relation and in no way depend upon the special powers and privileges conferred upon the company by statute for the purposes of its railway undertaking. I am unable to perceive any principle upon which a distinction could rest; by which the first clause of section 306 could properly be held at once to include within its ambit such an action by an employee and to exclude from it such an action as that out of which the present appeal arises. It is not unimportant that the course of decision upon a statutory provision so widely in force should retain some perceptible degree of logical coherency.\nThe appeal must, in my opinion, be allowed and the action dismissed with costs.\nAnglin J.\u2014The plaintiff was injured when about to alight on Main Street in the City of Winnipeg, from a car of the defendant company in which she had been carried as a passenger. She had paid fare. Her injury was caused by another car also operated by the defendant company running into that in which she was, and the collision is now conceded to have been ascribable to negligence in the running of the cars. The action was begun a few days after the expiry of a year from the time when the injury was sustained and the sole question for determination here is whether it is barred by section 116 of the Manitoba Railway Act (incorporated in the defendant company's special Act, 55 Vict. (Man.) c. 56, by s. 32), which reads as follows:\u2014\nAll suits for indemnity for any damage or injury sustained by reason of the construction or operation of the railway shall be instituted within twelve months next after the time of such supposed damage sustained, or if there be continuation of damages then within twelve months next after the doing or committing of such damage ceases, and not afterwards; and the defendant may plead the general issue and give this Act and the special Act and the special matter in evidence at any trial to be had thereupon, and may prove that the same was done in pursuance of and by authority of this Act and the special Act.\nWas the plaintiff's injury sustained by reason of the operation of the defendant's railway? This question would seem to admit of but one answer. If the running of the cars is not \"operation of the railway,\" I find it difficult to conceive what would be. Viscount Haldane in delivering the judgment of the Judicial Committee in Canadian Nor. Ry. Co. v. Robinson[14], referring to the phrase \"operation of the railway,\" found in a similar collocation in section 242 of the Railway Act of Canada of 1903 (s. 306 of c. 37 of the R.S.C. 1906), said at page 745:\u2014\nSuch operation seems to signify simply the process of working the railway as constructed.\nIn doing the act or acts that resulted in the collision in question the defendants were \"working the railway as constructed,\" negligently, it is true, but with the intention of carrying it on in good faith. The primary rule of statutory construction is that, unless to do so would lead to absurdity, repugnancy or inconsistency with the rest of the statute the grammatical and ordinary sense of the words should prevail. The language of section 116 of the Manitoba Act is precise and unambiguous. No absurdity, repugnancy or inconsistency can arise from giving to it its natural and ordinary sense. On the other hand to hold that the case of a man in the street who is injured through negligence in running the cars falls within the purview of the section, but that the case of a passenger who sustains injury from the like cause does not, seems to me to involve inconsistency and repugnancy to common sense as well. Unless compelled by authority to hold otherwise, I should have no doubt that the plaintiff's injury was sustained \"by reason of the operation of the defendant's railway\" and that her action is therefore barred by the Manitoba statute above quoted.\nIt is said to be established by a long series of decisions, however, that claims for personal injuries sustained by passengers because they do not arise out of the work of construction or maintenance of the railway, are not within this limitation provision; and it is also urged that the plaintiff has based her claim on a breach of the defendants' contract to carry her with due care rather than upon tort and that her action therefore falls within a line of cases in which similar statutory provisions have been held inapplicable to claims for breach of contract.\nThe only paragraph in the statement of claim in which a contract is alluded to reads as follows:\u2014\n3. On or about the 6th day of February, A.D. 1919, the plaintiff was received by the defendant as a passenger on its railway, having paid her fare for that purpose, to be by it safely carried in a street railway car going from Saint Boniface aforesaid into Winnipeg aforesaid and north along Main Street in the said City of Winnipeg and delivered at her destination.\nThe fourth paragraph alleges negligence causing the collision; and that is the substantial issue in the action. The prayer is merely for the recovery of stated damages. All the allegations in the third paragraph might with equal propriety be made in an action for tort as in one for breach of contract. Suing in tort the payment of fare would properly be alleged in order to exclude the idea that the plaintiff had been a trespasser or had been carried gratuitously\u2014to establish the degree of care which the defendant owed her; that she was received as a passenger and was to be carried to a destination would be averred to shew the duration of the defendant's duty as a carrier. Neither by contract nor under its obligation as a carrier was the defendant company bound to carry the plaintiff safely, as the statement of claim alleges. Its duty was to carry her with due care, or, as put by Mr. Justice Dennistoun, citing Kelly v. Metropolitan Ry.Co.[15],\nsafely as far as reasonable care and forethought can attain that end.\nBreach of the duty to take such care is negligence and it is that negligence that it was essential the plaintiff should establish in order to maintain her action, in whatever form it was taken. I am not at all satisfied that the form of the plaintiff's action is for breach of contract rather than in tort.\nBut modern English authority seems to establish that in determining the applicability of a section such as that before us to the case of a person suing a railway company to recover damages for personal injuries sustained while he was a passenger the distinction as to the form in which the action is launched is not material. Lyles v. Southend-on-Sea Corporation[16], was such a case. The plaintiff had paid his fare and taken a ticket in the ordinary way and without any special conditions for carriage on a tramway operated by the defendants. He was injured while a passenger, as he alleged, through the fault of the defendants' employees. The question at issue was, whether the defendant was entitled to the benefit of a limitation provision. The existence of a contract, evidenced by the facts that the plaintiff had paid fare and taken a ticket, was relied upon as taking the case out of the statute. The statute invoked (s. 1 of the Public Authorities Protection Act, 1893) bars an action\nagainst any person for any act done in pursuance or execution or intended execution of any Act of Parliament or of any public duty or authority, or in respect of any alleged neglect or default in the execution of any such Act, duty or authority * * * unless it is commenced within six months next after the act, neglect or default complained of, or, in case of a continuance of injury or damage, within six months next after the ceasing thereof.\nThe English Court of Appeal was unanimously of the opinion that\nthe action was in substance founded on a breach by the defendants of their duty as a public authority engaged in the carriage of passengers.\nVaughan-Williams L. J. says at page 19:\u2014\nThe case of Taylor v. Manchester, & c., Ry. Co.[17], seems to shew that, even in a case in which a ticket is issued to the passenger, and the passenger through the negligence of the railway company's servants sustains personal injuries, the cause of action arising would in substance, although it might not in form, be founded upon tort and not upon contract. If that decision is applicable to a case arising under the Public Authorities Protection Act, 1893, the result would be that the present action must be treated as one in which the real substantial complaint is not for a breach of contract, but for a tort. Taylor v. Manchester, &c., Ry. Co.[18], was a decision under the County Courts Act, 1888, the question being whether the costs were to be allowed as in an action of contract or as in an action of tort. But I think the decision is applicable to a case in which the question is whether, in regard to the Public Authorities Protection Act, 1893, an action founded on a breach of the duty of the defendants towards a passenger to whom a ticket has been issued is to be regarded as an action for breach of contract or as an action in respect of a tort; and the result is that the present action fails because it was not brought within the six months limited by the Public Authorities Protection Act, 1893.\nThe result might have been different if the ticket had had upon its face special conditions, and I do not wish to conclude the question of the obligation of a railway company as common carriers even in cases in which there are no special conditions in the receipt given to the consignor.\nRomer L. J. says, at page 20:\u2014\nThe fact that as a matter of pleading the plaintiff's case against the defendant authority might be stated either as one founded on breach of implied contract, or as one founded on tort, does not appear to me to shew that the words of s. 1 of the Act ought not to be held to apply. The question whether the Act does or does not apply to a particular action or proceeding depends upon what is the substance of the action or proceeding. In the present case the substance of the action is damage to the plaintiff by neglect on the part of the defendant public authority in duly performing its public duty or authority of carrying passengers by its tramway. There was no special or particular contract between the defendant authority and the plaintiff in reference to his journey by the tramway in the course of which the accident occurred. The plaintiff was using the tramway as one of the ordinary public, availing himself in the ordinary way of the general obligation cast upon the defendants to work the tramway and to carry passengers by it.\nStirling L. J., says, at page 21:\u2014\n(3) The plaintiff's cause of action does not depend on contract, but arises out of a breach of the duty to carry the plaintiff safely cast upon the defendant corporation by the fact of his being taken as a passenger. Marshall v. York, Newcastle and Berwick Ry. Co.[19]; Austin v. Great Western Ry. Co.[20]; Harris v. Perry & Co.[21]. While the right of the defendant municipality to invoke section 1 of the Public Authorities Protection Act was undoubtedly upheld on the ground that the carriage of tramway traffic had been imposed on it by a statutory authority, this case seems clearly to support the proposition that where the plaintiff's claim rests on negligence of the defendant in the capacity in which it is entitled to the benefit of the statutory limitation, that limitation applies notwithstanding that the plaintiff may be entitled to claim, and may have averred, that such negligence also constituted a breach of the defendant's contract with him. Indeed that this is the position is distinctly recognized by Osier J. A., delivering the judgment of the Court of Appeal in Ryckman's Case[22], at pages 431-2, where Taylor v. Manchester, &c., Ry. Co.[23], is cited as authority for it. The learned judge said:\u2014\nWhether the party was a paying or a gratuitous passenger the substance of the action is a tort for (or) a misfeasance, an act of positive negligence on the defendants' part * * Even where there was a contract of carriage the plaintiff might have declared simply as for a breach of duty to carry safely, and the application of the limitation clause cannot depend upon the form in which the plaintiff has chosen to bring his action if the facts shew that it arises out of the defendants' breach of duty as carriers.\nSee too Kelly v. Metropolitan Ry. Co.[24].\nThere is not a little to be said in support of the view, if it were material here, that under clause 14 of by-law 543 of the City of Winnipeg, confirmed by 55 Vict. (M.), C. 56, sec. 34, a statutory obligation to operate a street railway service on Main Street was imposed on the defendants much the same as that imposed on the municipality in Lyles' Case[25]. But my opinion in this case in no wise depends on the company being under any such obligation to operate its railway.\nAlthough sub-section (3) of section 306 of the Dominion Railway Act (R.S.C. 1906, C. 47; now 9 & 10 Geo. V., C. 68, sec. 391), which expressly excepts from the operation of that section\nany action brought upon any breach of contract express or implied for or relating to the carriage of any traffic,\n(including the carriage of passengers, s.s. 31 of s. 2), has been said merely to embody an interpretation put upon the limitation clause of the earlier railway Acts and well established by authority; Canadian Northern Ry. Co. v. Anderson[26]; Canadian Northern Ry. Co. v. Robinson[27]; it may possibly go further and exempt from the operation of the section the case, which would otherwise be within sub-section (1), of personal injury to a passenger, when the claim is based on his contractual relations with the railway company, as was held in Traill v. Niagara Ry. Co.[28]. That is a question not now before us and I prefer to reserve it for further consideration, notwithstanding what I said in Robinson's Case27. But under the provision of the Manitoba Act here invoked, from which the express exception made by sub-section 3 of the Dominion section is omitted, I am convinced that although the plaintiff's claim be in form for breach of contract, that circumstance should not be held to take the case out of its operation. But are claims for personal injuries sustained by passengers caused by negligence, however framed, within the purview of the Manitoba statute? I find nothing in its language to exclude them. Two suggestions made in the course of the argument should be noticed here. They were (a) that the words \"if there is continuation of damage, etc.,\" would be inapt in such a case and their presence indicates that the section does not apply to such claims: (b) that the second member of section 116 places a restriction upon the generality of the preceding member which would exclude from it such claims for personal injuries.\n(a) As to the former suggestion, I fail to appreciate its force. The legislature has no doubt provided for cases where there is \"continuation of damages,\" but not exclusively. It has equally clearly provided for cases, such as that at bar, where the entire damage is sustained when the injury is inflicted. There are other classes of claims within the section to some of which the provision for continuing damage may be appropriate. Moreover a similar provision contained in the limitation section of the Public Authorities Protection Act, 1893, dealt with in Lyles' Case[29], was not held to render the limitation inapplicable to the plaintiff's claim for injuries sustained while a passenger.\n(b) The second member of section 116 in my opinion has not any restrictive effect upon the earlier member of the section. It merely sanctions a plea of the general issue and the putting in evidence of the Railway Act and the special Act with the facts necessary to bring the case within the authority they confer. In the revision of the Ontario Railway Act 1906 (6 Edw. VII, c. 30) it was wholly omitted from the limitation section (no. 223), presumably in pursuance of a modern Ontario policy to do away with the plea of \"not guilty by statute,\" Holmested Jud. Act, 4 ed., p. 605. Neither the authority of the Railway Act nor that of the special Act affords an answer to claims founded on negligence, and it is for such claims that the protection of the limitation provision is required. It is true that in some of the earlier cases decided when the section dealt with claims for injuries received \"by reason of the railway,\" the view was taken that it applied only to actions for damages occasioned in the exercise, or intended exercise, of powers given for the construction or maintenance of the railway. Roberts v. Great Western Ry. Co.[30] approved in Ryckman's Case[31]. I cannot but think that the words \"the construction or operation of\" were inserted to prevent such a narrow interpretation being given to the section in the future and to ensure that its application should extend to cases of injury arising from the operation or running of the railway as well as to those due to works of construction or maintenance. Parliament and the legislatures should be credited with having had some purpose in making the change. I think that purpose was to put it beyond doubt that the limitation is applicable to all claims for injuries and damages resting on negligence in working the railway. There can of course be no justification for refusing to give effect to the intention with which the law was changed. The Ydun[32], at page 241. In Greer v. Canadian Pacific Ry. Co.[33], my brother Duff was of the opinion that \"operation of the railway\" includes acts other than those done in the discharge of some duty imposed by statute. With Mr. Justice Dennistoun I adopt the view of Osier J. A., in Ryckman v. Hamilton etc., Ry. Co.[34], at p. 426, that the words \"may prove that the same was done in pursuance of and by authority of this Act and the special Act,\" mean no more than \"may prove that the damage or injury was sustained by reason of the construction or operation of the railway, \" as in the earlier part of the section.\nBut, if the limitation should be held to apply only to claims for damage or injury sustained by reason of acts\ndone in pursuance of and by authority of this Act and the special Act,\nI would find it not a little difficult to conceive the running of tram cars on the public streets in the City of Winnipeg to be aught else than something so done. The special Acts in this case are the statutes, 55 Vic., c. 56 (Man.), incorporating the defendant company and ratifying by-law no. 543 of the City of Winnipeg, and 58 & 59 Vic., c. 54.\nIt is said, however, that in deference to a long series of decisions claims for personal injuries to passengers should be held to be outside the purview of section 116 of the Manitoba Railway Act as it now stands. The two cases chiefly relied on are Ryckman v. Toronto, Hamilton & Grimsby Ry. Co.[35], in which the Ontario decisions up to that time are reviewed, and Sayers v. British Columbia Electric Ry. Co.[36], a decision of the full court of British Columbia. In each of these cases it was held that a claim for personal injury sustained while a passenger was not within the limitation provision\u2014in the former section 42 of c 207 of the Revised Statutes of Ontario, 1897; in the latter section 60 of c 55 of the statutes of British Columbia for the year 1896. Of course neither of these decisions binds us. In the Ontario case Osier J. A., delivering the judgment of the Court of Appeal, says, at page 427:\u2014\nIn the present state of the authorities it is to be desired, that a clear ruling should be given upon the subject by the Supreme Court.\nIn the British Columbia case Martin J. said, at page 111:\nThe question is not at all free from doubt and it is desirable in the public interest that it should be set at rest either by the legislature or the court of last resort.\nIt was not until 1903 that the words, \"by reason of the railway,\" of the earlier limitation sections were replaced in the Dominion Railway Act by the words \"by reason of the construction or operation of the railway.\" The corresponding change was effected in provincial railway Acts only some years later. In Manitoba the change was made in 1907 (6 & 7 Edw. VII, c. 36, sec. 3); in Ontario in 1906, (6 Edw. VII, c. 30, sec. 233). The limitation in the Ontario statute considered in Ryckman's Case[37], in 1905, dealt with claims for injury or damage sustained \"by reason of the railway,\" and the earlier Ontario and Upper Canada decisions there discussed were based on statutes couched in the like terms. In the Sayers Case[38], where the defendant company's Act of Incorporation required that\nall actions or suits for indemnity for any damage or injury sustained by reason of the tramway or railway, or the works or operations of the company shall be commenced within six months,\nit was held that the words \"by reason, et seq.\" should be read separatim as describing different branches of the company's undertaking. The words relating to the carrying of the tramway traffic were held to be \"by reason of the tramway or railway,\" and the court, following the decision in Ryckman's Case[39], held the section not applicable to an action for injury sustained by a passenger. A like view had been expressed by Gwynne J. in this court in North Shore Ry. Co. v. McWillie[40], at page 514.\nIn British Columbia Electric Ry. Co. v. Gentile[41], however, which did not come to this court, Lord Dunedin in delivering the judgments of their Lordships said, at page 1039, in referring to s. 60 of the statute dealt with in the Sayers Case[42], which had been cited in argument,\u2014\nTheir Lordships assume without deciding that the words \"operations of the company\" include the negligent running of cars.\nIn Greer v.- Canadian Pacific Ry. Co.[43], the present Chief Justice of Ontario said, at page 107:\nIt is no doubt well settled that the limitation section (i.e., s. 306 of the Dominion Railway Act of 1906) does not apply to a cause of action for a breach of the duty of a railway company as a common carrier; and all that was decided in that case (Ryckman's Case) 38, was that the action was for breach of the duty of the defendant as a common carrier to carry safely; and that the limitation section did not therefore apply.\nWith deference, there seems to be some slight confusion here of the responsibility of a railway company as a carrier of passengers with its responsibility as a common carrier of freight. The inapplicability of the limitation section of the Dominion Railway Act as it stood before 1903, and of the corresponding section of the Ontario Railway Act as it stood when Ryckman's Case38 was decided, to claims for personal injuries sustained by passengers may perhaps be regarded as having been \"well settled\" after that decision for the purposes of the Appellate Divisional Court, on which it was of course binding. But I doubt if it could in this court or the Privy Council properly be said to be \"well settled\" even on the plea that a long series of uniform decisions in the lower courts, though erroneous, should not be overruled.\nIn Roberts v. Great Western Ry. Co.[44], it was held, Robinson C. J. presiding, that the limitation section (16 V., c. 99, s. 10) did not apply to the case of a passenger injured by the defendant's negligence in running the train. The view which prevailed was that the application of the section was confined to actions for damages occasioned in the exercise of powers of construction or maintenance of the railway. The court was influenced by the terms of the statute, 7 Wm. IV, c. 14, s. 19, which it said \"expressed very clearly to what causes of action the limitation of actions was meant to extend.\" That section read as follows:\u2014\nXIX. And be it further enacted by the authority aforesaid, That when it shall not be otherwise provided in any Act to be hereafter passed, for any of the purposes aforesaid, and whereby powers and authority are given to be exercised over the property, real or personal, or over the person of any individual, for the promoting and securing the objects intended to be advanced by the corporation created by any such Act, then if any action shall be brought against any person or persons, for anything done in pursuance, or in execution, of the powers and authorities given by such Act, such action shall be commenced within six calendar months next after the fact committed; or in case there shall be a continuation of damage, then within six calendar months after the doing or committing such damage shall cease, and not afterwards; and the defendant or defendants in such action may plead the general issue, and give such Act, and the special matter, in evidence at the trial. This differs tolo coelo from the limitation section in the Railway Clauses Consolidation Act, 14 & 15 V. (C.) c. 51, s. 20, the prototype of the section found in the Canadian Railway Acts (C.S.C. 1859, c. 66, s. 83, and later statutes) and resembles the limitation provisions considered in Palmer v. Grand Junction Ry. Co.[45], and Carpue v. London and Brighton Ry. Co.[46], which I shall presently discuss briefly.\nWith profound respect I am unable to accept the view that owing to some historical connection the scope of such general words as \"all suits for indemnity for any damage or injury sustained by reason of the railway\" found in the Railway Acts and in 16 Vic., c. 99, s. 10 should have been restricted to that of the limitation provision of an earlier statute expressly confined in its application to actions brought for something done in pursuance or in execution of extraordinary powers over private property and persons conferred on railways. Why should Parliament when it dropped the restrictive words of the earlier statute be presumed to have intended nevertheless to continue them in operation notwithstanding the generality of the language in which the later Act is couched? Roberts' Case and Carpue's Case45, were the basic authorities for the decision in Ryckman's Case[47], and, notwithstanding the change made in the Dominion Railway Act in 1903 by the introduction of the words \"the construction or operation of,\" the view which prevailed in Ryckman's Case46, found favour with the present Chief Justice of this court, who dissented, in Greer's Case[48], at pages 341-2. Our courts have too often applied to Canadian statutes decisions of the English courts upon statutes considered to be in pari materia but couched in different language, intended to apply to other circumstances and indeed sometimes dealing with a different subject-matter. See the judgment of Duff J., in Toronto v. J. F. Brown Co.[49], at pages 181 et seq.\nIn May v. Ontario and Quebec Ry. Co.[50], it was held by Wilson C. J., after reviewing the prior decisions, that any damage done through negligence upon a railway in the carriage of passengers and the like is damage done \"by reason of the railway,\" and the same view was taken by O'Connor J. in Conger v. The Grand Trunk Ry. Co.[51]. In these two actions, brought by persons who had been injured through alleged negligence of the respective railway companies while being transported as passengers, demurrers by the defendants were maintained.\nIn Auger v. Ontario, Simcoe & Huron Ry. Co.[52], a case of horses killed at a highway crossing, Richards J. expressed the opinion that while cases where the liability rested on breach of contract to carry safely (amongst which he included cases of injury to passengers) were excluded from the operation of the limitation section, the principle of the decisions so holding did not extend to actions for tort for an alleged wrong done by the railway in exercising its statutory powers.\nIn Prendergast v. Grand Trunk Ry. Co.[53], section 83 of the C.S.C. c. 66, was held not to apply to a case where fire on the right of way had negligently been allowed to spread to adjacent land on the ground that the injury charged was at common law, by one proprietor of land against another, and was quite independent of any user of the railway. In Brown v. Brockville & Ottawa Ry. Co.[54], a case of injury to the plaintiff and his wagon on a highway crossing, Robinson C. J., delivering the judgment of the court said:\u2014\n\"By reason of the railway\" is a very comprehensive expression.\nReferring to the omission of the statutory signals on approaching a highway crossing he added\nIt may be said that the damage was not sustained by reason of the railway, but rather by reason of the manner in which the carriages on the railway were driven; but we think the substance and effect are the same in the one case as the other.\nThe other ground of complaint was defective construction of the crossing.\nMcCallum v. Grand Trunk Ry. Co.[55], was a case of fire, caused by sparks from a locomotive igniting material negligently left on the right of way, which spread to the plaintiff's land. Negligence in regard to the locomotive was not charged. The Court of Error and Appeal held that this was an injury sustained \"by reason of the railway.''\nDraper C. J. A., said at page 532:\u2014\nThe causa causans was therefore a part of the working of the railway, and the effect was \"by reason of the railway,\" and we are not deciding whether the defendants were guilty of negligence in letting the fire extend in manner and form as the second count charges, but whether, admitting that the second count is proved, it is a count claiming indemnity for a damage or injury by reason of the railway.\nHagarty C. J. C. P. added:\u2014\nIt was certainly by reason of the railway the injury was caused.\nBut he adds:\nThe case may be readily distinguished from others where some direct malfeasance has caused injury, or where contracts express or implied are broken. In Anderson v. Canadian Pacific Ry.[56], the limitation section was held not to apply to an action for loss of baggage where there was a special contract limiting the defendant's liabilities.\nIn the comparatively recent case of Traill v. St. Catherines and Toronto Ry. Co.[57], Boyd C., held that an action for damages for personal injury to a passenger was not within section 306 of the Dominion Railway Act (1906). But the learned, judge seems to have regarded the liability as one for breach of contract.\nUntil Ryckman's Case[58], was decided the law on the point under consideration can scarcely be said to have been \"well settled\" in Ontario, even under the section as it formerly stood.\nIn Kelly v. Ottawa Street Ry. Co.[59], the action, which was to recover damages for injuries sustained by a man in the street owing to the careless driving of one of the defendant's cars, was held by the Court of Appeal to be within the limitation section. If the plaintiff in the case at bar had reached the pavement before the moment of the collision so that her transportation as a passenger had terminated, her action would admittedly have been barred by the Manitoba limitation section. What ground of distinction, not purely whimsical, can be suggested for holding that, although in that case she would have been injured \"by reason of the operation of the railway,\" she should be deemed not to have been so injured because she was still in the vestibule or on the steps of the car in course of leaving it when the collision occurred? Although this court has in several cases considered the limitation section of the Dominion Railway Act since the introduction into it in 1903 of the words \"the construction or operation of\" (Canadian Pacific Ry. Co. v. Robinson[60]; Canadian Northern Ry. Co. v. Anderson[61]; Greer v. Canadian Pacific Ry. Co.[62], and Canadian Northern Ry. Co. v. Pszenicnzy[63]) the question whether an action for personal injury to a passenger due to negligent running of a train of cars of a railway company comes within the section as it now stands, i.e., whether such injuries are sustained by reason of the \"operation of the railway,\" has never been passed upon here, although the principle of our decision in the case last cited may bear upon it. It is true that in British Columbia Electric Ry. Co. v. Turner[64], Mr. Justice Duff reiterated the opinion which had prevailed in the Sayers Case[65], and I also expressed an inclination to the view that such an action was not within the limitation clause. We were there dealing, however with a British Columbia statute, which read \"by reason of the tramway or railway,\" and I was greatly influenced by the judgment in the Ryckman Case[66]. I have already alluded to the dicta of Gwynne J. in the McWillie Case[67], and of Duff J. in Greer's Case62.\nRobinson's Case went to the Privy Council and is reported in [1911] A.C., at page 739. The claim there was based on the alleged wrongful cutting off of a spur line. It was held that such a refusal of facilities was not an act done in the operation of the railway and therefore did not fall within the limitation enacted by section 306 of the Dominion Railway Act of 1906. Referring to this section Lord Haldane in delivering the judgment of the Board said, at page 745:\u2014\nIn the opinion of their Lordships the special provisions do not apply. They are confined to damages or injury sustained by reason of the construction or operation of the railway. The words of exception under the sub-section relate to carriage of traffic and to tolls, and do not require any construction which extends the meaning of the phrase \"operation of the railway.\" Such operation seems to signify the process of working the railway as constructed. The refusal or discontinuance of facilities for making a siding outside the railway as constructed and connecting it with the line does not appear to be an act done in the course of operating the railway itself.\nThere is no other case in the Privy Council, so far as I am aware, which has any direct bearing on the subject under consideration.\nTwo English cases, however, much relied on in Ryckman's case and in many of the other Canadian decisions, should be noticed.\nIn Palmer v. The Grand Junction Ry. Co.[68], the claim against the company was\nfor not safely carrying and conveying some horses in their carriages on the railway whereby one was killed and others were injured.\nThe question discussed was whether the company was entitled to notice of action under section 214 of its incorporating Act, 3 & 4 Wm. IV., c. 34. That section in terms applied to actions, etc.,\nfor anything done or omitted to be done in pursuance of the Act or in the execution of the powers or authorities, or any of the orders made, given, or directed in, by, or under the Act, unless fourteen days' previous notice in writing shall be given by the parties intending to commence or prosecute, etc. It was held that the company was not entitled to notice of action as for a thing done or omitted to be done in pursuance of the Act. Baron Parke in delivering the judgment of the court, said:\u2014\nThe defendants are sued as common carriers, who have received nine horses for the purpose of being taken to their journey's end, which they have not so delivered, but that on the contrary one has been killed, and three severely injured, in consequence of an accident on the railroad; the action is brought against them, therefore, in their character of common carriers; and it appears to me that a breach of their duty in that character is not a thing omitted to be done in pursuance of the act, or in the execution of the powers or authorities given by it.\nThe difference between the terms of s. 214 of the statute dealt with in the Palmer Case[69], and those of the Manitoba limitation provision is manifest. The one is expressly restricted to things done or omitted to be done pursuant to the authority or requirements of the statute or of orders made under it. The other is general in its terms applying to\nall suits for indemnity for any damage or injury sustained by reason of the construction or operation of the railway.\nIt is sought to restrict this general language to damages or injury occasioned by acts \"done in pursuance of and by authority of this Act and the special Act\" because in the same section provision is made for giving \"this Act and the special Act * * * in evidence,\" under a plea of the general issue. As already Stated I regard the inference of such a restriction upon the scope of the earlier member of the section as wholly unwarranted. In making it, to quote Mr. Justice Osier in Ryckman's Case[70]:\u2014\njudges * * * have refined and limited (the) construction and application of the section. The subject matter of the portion of section 116 which follows the semicolon is entirely distinct and different from that dealt with in the earlier part of the section. The two clauses were in my opinion very properly made to form separate sub-sections in the revision of the Dominion Railway Act in 1906 (c. 37, s. 306) and the like arrangement is continued in the new Railway Act of 1919, s. 391 of c. 68 of 9 & 10 Geo. V. See, too, R.S.O. 1914, c.263, s. 265; R.S.B.C. 1911, c. 194, s. 269. The first member of section 116 of the Manitoba Act seems to be directed to claims based on tortious acts or omissions in the course of constructing or operating the railway and must, I think, cover all such cases. Such acts or omissions are not within any statutory authorization. Statutory authorization does not afford a defence to actions founded on them, whether preferred by pleading the general issue or otherwise. The Palmer Case[71], moreover, dealt with the contractual obligation of common carriers of freight to carry it safely. In such a case proof of fault or negligence is not at all essential to the plaintiff, as it always is in a claim for personal injuries.\nCarpue v. London & Brighton Ry. Co.[72], on the other hand, was a case of personal injury to a passenger. The defendant company was incorporated by the 7 Wm. IV. and 1 Vic., c. 119 which, after empowering it to construct the railway and to use locomotives, enacted that no action for anything done or omitted to be done in pursuance of the Act or in execution of the powers or authorities given by it should be brought without twenty days' previous notice. It was held that notice of action was unnecessary, the defendants being sued in their capacity of common carriers. Here again we find a section of which the application is by its terms expressly confined to cases in which the act or omission constituting the cause of action is something authorized or imposed by the statute. Negligent acts or omissions in the course of the operation of the railway were not so regarded. In the Manitoba statute on the other hand \"operation\" is now expressly included and that word was inserted, as I think, for the very purpose of precluding in the future the restriction of the general terms in which the first member of the section is couched to matters of construction and maintenance\u2014a restriction which had been inferred by the courts from the presence of the concluding clause of the section in the Canadian Railway Acts when the language of its earlier provision had been \"by reason of the railway.\" See Parker v. London County Council[73]. Neither Palmer's Case[74], nor Carpue's Case[75], it seems to me, warrants the application of the principle on which it was decided to the limitation sections found in our Railway Acts, federal or provincial, in actions for injuries sustained by passengers through fault or neglect of railway employees in working the railway.\nMy conclusion from this review of the leading authorities, (for the length of which I feel I should apologize, although it seemed to be necessary because of the uncertainty and confusion existing as to their effect), is that taken as a whole they would not have compelled us to hold that the present action would not have been within the purview of s. 116 had it stood as it was prior to 1907, i.e., if it still read \"by reason of the railway.\" There certainly is nothing whatever in them seriously to embarrass us in giving the section in its present form the construction for which its plain, precise and unambiguous words, read in their grammatical and ordinary sense, appear to call. \"Operation\" means \"the working of the railway as constructed\" and that assuredly includes the running of the cars. While section 116 of the Manitoba statute, notwithstanding the omission from it of a provision similar to s.s. (3) of s. 306 of the Dominion Railway Act of 1906, which can scarcely have been other than designed, may not apply to actions of which the substance is breach of contract, as in cases of loss of or injury to freight in transport, in my opinion it clearly does apply to actions such as that at bar, of which the substance is fault or neglect attributable to the defendant in the operation of its railway occasioning personal damage or injury to the plaintiff. I cannot see any reasonable ground for distinguishing in this respect between the case where the person so injured is a passenger and that where he does not hold that relation to the company but is lawfully where he is, whether on a highway or elsewhere, when he sustains the injury.\nI would for these reasons allow this appeal with costs here and in the Court of Appeal and would restore the judgment of the learned trial judge dismissing the action.\nMignault J.\u2014My brother Anglin having made an exhaustive review of the decisions bearing on the construction of the limitation section of the Manitoba Railway Act (R.S.M. 1913, ch. 168, section 116), I propose very briefly to state my reasons for thinking that this appeal must be allowed. Section 116 reads as follows:\u2014\n116. All suits for indemnity for any damage or injury sustained by reason of the construction or operation of the railway shall be instituted within twelve months next after the time of such supposed damage sustained or, if there be continuation of damages, then within twelve months next after the doing or committing of such damage ceases, and not afterwards; and the defendants may plead the general issue and give this Act and the special Act and the special matter in evidence at any trial to be had thereupon, and may prove that the same was done in pursuance of and by authority of this Act and the special Act.\nThe respondent was injured when just about to alight from one of the appellant's cars through a collision brought about by the negligent operation of another of the appellant's cars. She waited more than a year before bringing this action, and the appellant contends that her right of recovery is now barred by section 116. The learned trial judge so held, but his judgment was reversed by the Court of Appeal.\nThe nature of the respondent's action was much discussed at bar. She alleges that she had been received by the appellant as a passenger on its railway, having paid her fare for that purpose, to be safely carried to her destination, and that owing to the negligence of the appellant in the management of its railway, the car in which she was travelling came into collision with another car operated by the appellant, and she was injured.\nIn substance this action appears to be based on a tort, the negligent operation by the appellant of its railway. But because some of the cases have distinguished between actions on tort and actions for breach of contract, the respondent urges that she has really sued for breach of contract, to wit, the contract to carry her safely to her destination. As I read section 116, the distinction relied on by the respondent would not really help her, for undoubtedly her suit claims indemnity for \"damage or injury sustained by reason of the * * * * operation of the railway,\" and such a suit certainly comes within the intendment of section 116. I might add that the contract implied by the purchase of a ticket for transportation is not a contract to carry the passenger safely, but with due care, and while the word \"safely\" is often rather loosely used in this connection, its meaning is simply that due care must be exercised in the carriage of passengers. So the allegation of negligence is an essential averment of an action like that of the respondent, whether it be viewed as based on a contract or a tort, and in either event it certainly comes within the language of section 116.\nIndependently of the many judicial pronouncements on limitation provisions of this kind, no difficulty can arise as to the construction of this section. The inquiry in this case is whether the damage was sustained by reason of the operation (i.e. the negligent operation) of the appellant's railway, and if so we cannot disregard the plain language, construed as it should be according to its ordinary and grammatical meaning, of section 116.\nSome decisions have held that the limitation section does not apply to cases where the question is as to the common law liability of a common carrier. But a carrier acts as a common carrier only when he carries goods, of course as a public employment. His liability when he carries passengers is subject to other rules, and does not arise unless negligence be proved (Halsbury, Laws of England, vo. Carriers, paragraphs 1 and 6). Therefore, as I have said, negligence is an essential element of the right of recovery of the passenger. Whether this takes his action out of the realm of contract into that of tort might be an interesting question to discuss, but I must hold that in any case the action of the respondent is clearly within the descriptive words of section 116.\nWhat I have said disposes of any question as to the applicability of this section to the respondent's action, unless we are bound by authority to hold that, notwithstanding its clear language, it does not bar the action of a passenger for damages caused by reason of the negligent operation of the railway. The consequence of so holding would be rather startling, for the respondent must concede that the section would apply had a stranger on the street been injured by this same collision, while at the same time contending that it does not bar her own action, she having been on the appellant's car as a passenger when the collision occurred. But my brother Anglin has conclusively shewn that the question of the proper construction of section 116 is open to this court, and I entirely agree with him. I may add that the language of provisions like section 116 has been changed from time to time. The wording was \"by reason of the railway\" when the Ryckman and Sayers Cases, much relied on by the respondent, were decided. Going further back, as my learned brother has done, we find language that may explain many of the decisions, but to persist in making a distinction which the statute does not now justify after its language has been changed, is something which for my part I cannot agree to.\nI do not think that the concluding portion of section 116 can restrict the generality of the limitation clause. It deals with an independent matter, the defences to the action, and moreover, if the authority of the statute can sometimes be set up as a defence, it certainly cannot avail where the statutory powers have been negligently used.\nMy opinion is therefore that the respondent's action is barred by section 116. I would allow the appeal with costs here and in the Court of Appeal and restore the judgment of the learned trial judge dismissing the action.\nCassels J. (dissenting).\u2014The question raised in this appeal is as to the applicability of section 116 of the Manitoba Railway Act to the case of injury to a passenger by reason of the negligence of the railway. The section reads as follows:\u2014\nAll suits for indemnity for any damage or injury sustained by reason of the construction or operation of the railway shall be instituted within twelve months next after the time of such supposed damage sustained, or if there be continuation of damages then within twelve months next after the doing or committing of such damage ceases, and not afterwards; and the defendants may plead the general issue and give this Act and the special Act and the special matter in evidence at any trial to be had thereupon, and may prove that the same was done in pursuance of and by authority of this Act and the special Act.\nLimitation clauses of a similar character applicable to railways have been discussed in a great number of cases, and it has been almost uniformly held that clauses similar to the one in question do not apply to actions arising out of negligence in the carrying of passengers. I think it is too late now to place a different construction on the section.\nDown to a certain date, the cases are reviewed by MacMurchy & Denison in the 2nd edition of the Railway Law of Canada, commencing at page 512, and by Chancellor Boyd in Traill v. Niagara, St. Catharines and Toronto Ry. Co.[76]. The authorities are also elaborately reviewed in the judgments of the Chief Justice of Manitoba and Mr. Justice Dennistoun. I have read over most of the cases referred to. I do not find in any one of them any reference to the words in this section: \"or if there be continuation of damages then within twelve months next after the doing or committing of such damage ceases, and not afterwards.\"\nThese words seem to me to indicate that the section was not intended to apply to the case of an injury to a passenger by reason of the negligence of the railway as a common carrier. Where a collision takes place and injury is inflicted upon a passenger, the damage or injury is sustained then and there, and it is difficult to see how in that case there could be a continuation of damages.\nMoreover I would call attention to the fact that in the Dominion legislation referred to by the Chief Justice and in the Dominion Railway Act of 1919 (9 & 10 Geo. V., c. 68, sec. 391), similar words are found which by reason of sub-section (3) cannot apply to cases of injury to a passenger.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Anderson, Guy & Chappell.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Coulter, Collinson & Procter.\n[1] 31 Man.

Act, (1867) ss. 102, 109.\nThe word \"royalties,\" in section 109 of the B.N.A. Act, must be construed in its primary and natural sense as the English equivalent of \"Jura regalia\" and its scope is not limited by its association with the words \"lands, mines and minerals.\" Bona vacantia fall within the meaning of that term and therefore belong to the provinces. Davies C.J. contra.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada, maintaining the respondent's action.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions in issue are fully stated in the judgments now reported. J. A. Ritchie K.C. for the appellant.\u2014The term \"royalties\" is not limited to escheats or something arising out of land but should be construed in its full natural and primary sense.\nE. L. Newcombe K.C. and C. P. Plaxton for the respondent.\u2014The scope of the word \"royalties\" ought to be limited by reference to the subjects with which it is found associated in section 109 B.N.A. Act. The term includes only those royalties which are connected with \"lands, mines and minerals.\" The qualifying words \"the property of the province,\" attached to the enumeration in section 109 have the effect of confining the operation of that section to subjects in respect of which at Confederation the province not only possessed the power of appropriation but had also exercised that power.\nJ. A. Ritchie K.C. for the appellant.\nE. L. Newcombe K.C. and C. P. Plaxton for the respondent.\nThe Chief Justice (dissenting).\u2014The question to be determined in this case is whether the sum of $7,215, representing the proceeds of certain assets and effects in the province of British Columbia agreed by both parties to be bona vacantia belongs to the Province of British Columbia or to the Dominion of Canada. The answer to this question depends upon the construction to be placed upon sections 109 and 126 of the \"British North America Act, 1867.\"\nThe learned President of the Exchequer Court held\nthat the meaning of sec. 109 was to pass to the provinces royalties arising from \"lands, mines, minerals\" (and) \"royalties\" limited to escheats or something arising out of lands as referred to in sec. 1 of the statute 15-16 Vict. (and) did not think it was ever in contemplation that under that term \"Royalties\" all royalties of every kind, including bona vacantia, were left to the provinces under the provisions of the statute. After carefully reading the several judgments of the Judicial Committee which deal with the construction of the two sections, and having given the question before us my best consideration, I have reached the same conclusion.\nMr. Newcombe on behalf of the Crown submitted that the legislature of British Columbia having had power before and at the union of that province with Canada to appropriate the casual revenue arising within the colony from bona vacantia, with the assent of the Crown, it follows, whether the power was exercised or not, that the casual revenues from this source fall within sec. 102 of the B.N.A. Act and, therefore, belong to the Consolidated Revenue Fund of Canada, unless they be part of the revenue covered by the words of exception in that section.\nIn Attorney-General of Ontario v. Mercer[1], the Earl of Selborne delivering the judgment of the Judicial Committee, said, at page 775:\nThe words of exception in sec. 102 refer to revenues of two kinds:\n(1) such portions of the pre-existing \"duties and revenues\" as were by the Act \"reserved to the respective Legislatures of the provinces\" and (2) such duties and revenues as might \"be raised by them, in accordance with the special powers conferred upon them by the Act\" It is with the former only of these two kinds of revenue that their Lordships are now concerned; the latter being the produce of that power of \"direct taxation within the provinces, in order to the raising of a revenue for provincial purposes\" which is conferred upon Provincial Legislatures by sec. 92 of the Act.\nThere is only one clause in the Act by which any sources of revenue appear to be distinctly reserved to the provinces, viz., the 109th section: \"all lands, mines, minerals and royalties belong to the several provinces of Canada, Nova Scotia, and New Brunswick, at the Union * * * shall belong to the several provinces of Ontario, Quebec, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, in which the same are situate or arise,\" etc.\nThe Judicial Committee in that case held that \"royalties\" in this section included the revenue arising from escheated lands. In the Precious Metals Case[2], that Committee held that it reserved to the provinces the revenues arising from gold and silver mines. In neither of these cases did the Judicial Committee feel called upon to decide whether the word \"royalties\" in sec. 109 extends to other royal rights besides those connected with or arising out of \"lands, mines and minerals.\" The question now presented is whether \"royalties\" in this section includes the casual revenue arising from bona vacantia in British Columbia.\nThe Judicial Committee seems to have concluded the question adversely to the province in the interpretation which it has put upon said sec. 109 in the cases which have come before it. In Mercer's Case[3] the Judicial Committee uses language as to the object and effect of the word \"royalties\" which limits the word to Royal territorial rights. This meaning is confirmed by Lord Watson in St. Catharines Milling and Lumber Co. v. The Queen[4], when, at page 58, referring to sec. 109, he said:\nIts legal effect is to exclude from the \"duties and revenues\" appropriated to the Dominion, all the ordinary territorial revenues of the Crown arising within the provinces. That construction of the statute was accepted by this Board in deciding Attorney-General of Ontario v. Mercer3.\nIf this be a correct and comprehensive interpretation of the object and effect of sec. 109, and I am disposed to think it is, then it cannot apply to royal rights which are not territorial, such as rights in respect of personal property, e.g., bona vacantia The alternative contention would seem to be that \"royalties\" must be understood in an unlimited sense\u2014that is to say as comprehending not merely all royal territorial revenues\u2014i.e., the revenue arising from lands, mines, minerals\u2014but also all other royal revenues.\nIn the result, I have reached the conclusion that the term \"royalties\" in section 109 following the words \"lands, mines, minerals,\" should be construed as limited to royalties incident to or arising out of the preceding words. In other words, the term \"royalties\" extends to such as arise out of territorial rights only, and does not extend to bona vacantia such as are in question in this action.\nThe Judicial Committee in the cases I have referred to, in accordance with its usual practice, was careful to confine its actual decision to the questions specially before it for decision in each case. But the observations used alike by Lord Selborne and by Lord Watson, which I have quoted, are such as to satisfy my mind at any rate that the true construction of the section is such as I have stated.\nIdington J.\u2014A company incorporated in England in 1871 to carry on business in British Columbia having, in the exercise of such powers as given it in that regard, acquired property in that province, of which the sum of $7,215.04 proceeds thereof remained in the hands of respondent Rithet some time after the time of the dissolution of the said company and later death of its liquidator without any special provision in law for the disposition of said balance.\nMr. Rithet applied to English representatives of the Crown, and in turn was referred by such to those in British Columbia or Canada.\nHence proceedings were taken in the Exchequer Court here by the Dominion authorities as against Rithet and the Attorney-General of British Columbia. The case was tried before Sir Walter Cassels J. of that court who rendered judgment on the 22nd January, 1918, awarding the said money, less costs of Mr. Rithet, to the respondent on behalf of the Dominion.\nThe Attorney-General for British Columbia appeals here from that decision, claiming that such bona vacantia belong to the Crown on behalf of that province.\nWe are not enlightened by way of evidence or admissions from what source this balance of money now in question was derived, or exactly when it was realized.\nThe same kind of commendable industry as was devoted to produce the interesting results put before us in the case and appendix possibly would have disclosed that the original source of the money was an exploitation of the natural resources of the province, now in law beyond dispute belonging to it, such as the precious metals, for example, and realized upon since the dissolution of the company.\nThe exact date of the conversion thereof into money might in relation to the actual facts of the date of the extinction of the company and legal authority of any one to represent it have shed some light upon the basic facts, or what should have been looked upon as the basic facts, to which the relevant law should be applied. It may have been that the conversion into money took place after the property had become bona vacantia and, under such circumstances, as to entitle appellant beyond doubt to recover same.\nThe converse speculation as to whether or not the conversion was of property to which the Imperial authorities on behalf of the Crown could have claimed, under the circumstances, upon the actual facts if disclosed, might have put the respondent on behalf of the Dominion out of court. We are deprived of the instruction or perhaps amusement which a close investigation might have led to, and must, leaving appellant in future to see that his province is adequately protected by administrative or legislative measures, proceed on the assumption that the bona vacantia in question must be of some class that is neither land, mines or minerals, but may be of the class which can be properly described as within the class named \"Royalties\" in section 109 of the B.N.A. Act of 1867, which reads as follows:\u2014\n109.\u2014All lands, mines, minerals, and royalties belonging to the several provinces of Canada, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick at the Union, and all sums then due or payable for such lands, mines, minerals, or royalties, shall belong to the several provinces of Ontario, Quebec, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick in which the same are situate or arise, subject to any trusts existing in respect thereof, and to any interest other than that of the province in the same.\nI am clearly of the opinion that the word \"royalties\" as used in that section never was intended to be given only the narrow and limited interpretation and construction that is contended for by counsel for the respondent on behalf of the Dominion.\nI cannot conceive of the men who in fact framed the scheme of government to carry out which this Act was enacted, listening for a moment to such a contention, unless to laugh at it.\nIn the Mercer Case[5], Lord Selborne delivering the judgment of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, spoke as follows:\u2014\nIt appears, however, to their Lordships to be a fallacy to assume that because the word \"royalties\" in this context would not be inofficious or insensible, if it were regarded as having reference to mines and minerals, it ought, therefore, to be limited to those subjects. They see no reason why it should not have its primary and appropriate sense, as to (at all events) all the subjects with which it is here found associated,\u2014lands as well as mines and minerals; even as to mines and minerals it here necessarily signifies rights belonging to the Crown jure coronae. The general subject of the whole section is of a high political nature; it is the attribution of royal territorial rights, for purposes of revenue and government, to the provinces in which they are situate, or arise. It is a sound maxim of law, that every word ought, prima facie, to be construed in its primary and natural sense, unless a secondary or more limited sense is required by the subject or the context. In its primary and natural sense \"royalties\" is merely the English translation or equivalent of \"regalitates,\" \"jura regalia,' \"jura regia.\" (See, in voce \"royalties\" Cowell's \"Interpreter\" Wharton's Law Lexicon; Tomlins' and Jacobs' Law Dictionaries.) \"Regalia\" and \"regalitates\" according to Ducange, are \"jura regia;\" and Spelman (Glos. Arch.) says, \"Regalia dicuntur jura omnia ad fiscum spectantia.\" The subject was discussed with much fullness of learning, in Dyke v. Walford[6], where a crown grant of jura regalia, belonging to the county palatine of Lancaster, was held to pass the right to bona vacantia. \"That it is a jus (said Mr. Ellis, in his able argument, ibid, p. 480) is indisputable; it must also be regale, for the Crown holds it generally through England by Royal prerogative, and it goes to the successor of the Crown, not to the heir or personal representative of the Sovereign. It stands on the same footing as the right to escheats, to the land between high and low water mark, to felons' goods, to treasure trove, and other analogous rights.\" With this statement of the law their agree, and they consider it to have been, in substance, affirmed by the judgment of Her Majesty in Council in that case.\nPart of that was quoted by Lord Watson approvingly in the Precious Metals Case[7].\nNeedless to say these cases did not decide the question raised herein, but these dicta from high authorities point the way in which we should go to interpret and construe such an Act as that now in question; I respectfully submit that was not the path followed by respondent or this litigation never would have arisen.\nThe said dicta indicate the trend of thought I have sought to apply in my perusal of this case which consists chiefly of argument.\nReading, in that spirit the word \"royalties\" which the conjunction \"and\" in said section 109 indicates to be given a separate and distinctly additional item of subject matter or class of revenue, to be assigned each of the respective provinces, I conclude that the appellant province is entitled by such reading alone to the bona vacantia in question.\nThere is no doubt of its being entitled under the terms of its union with the Dominion to that much.\nAnd the articles to which we have to refer to find the terms of the Union with the Dominion, indicate to me, that if British Columbia had, before the Union, any greater rights in regard to such a subject as that now in question, she did not lose them by reason of the Union.\nThe respective rights in this regard of the several provinces which originally constituted the Dominion may not have been identically the same, but the law enacted in 15-16 Vict., c. 39, ss. 1 and 2, put all such colonies as British Columbia on the same footing in that regard, unless wherein otherwise provided for.\nBritish Columbia's history I need not follow. She, at least by the time of her union with Canada, had acquired the right to assert the right given, to claim and collect such sources of revenue as now in question.\nI repeat I cannot find that she lost, by the Union, any such right.\nI cannot agree with Mr. Newcombe's argument that some legislative enactment was necessary before the Union. The power to enact or assert was continued, and is all she needs to rest upon herein.\nBut it is the sections 126 and 146 of the B.N.A. Act which must be read and applied, as those by and through which the negotiations which took place, under the latter, before reading section 102 which only gives the Dominion that which is left after such adjustment. The legal history of that Union is to be found in the pages LXXXIV and CVII of the Orders in Council preceding the Dominion Statutes for 1872.\nProperly read and considered along with other material above referred to, I submit with great respect that it seems to me there is no foundation for the judgment appealed from.\nThe argument of Mr. Ritchie before the Exchequer Court relative to the powers assigned the provinces over property and civil rights, deserves more attention than it got before us. For let any one who has considered the questions from that point of view and all that succession duties mean, and, in the last analysis, the fundamental question of the right in or to property, and see how easy it is for the local legislature to take care not only of the property of the intestate, who has only remote next of kin, but also by same power to avoid the need of any consideration of failure of heirs-at-law or next of kin by supplying a substitute therefor, and then it would appear that the contention set up herein is hardly worth while.\nI think this appeal should be allowed with costs, if any, to be allowed respondent Rithet, to be paid by his co-respondent, or out of the fund.\nIf there is an understanding, as probably there is, that the other parties are not to recover from each other costs, neither ought to recover costs.\nPossibly there should be no costs directed except as to Mr. Rithet.\nDuff J.\u2014Both the Dominion and the Province concur in presenting the view which the very able argument on behalf of the Dominion sufficiently establishes that the hereditary casual revenues of the Crown including bona vacantia arising within the limits of the Province were included in the \"duties and revenues\" over which the Province had power of appropriation before the Union; and consequently the question to be determined is whether the word \"royalties\" in sec. 109 embraces bona vacantia. The scope of that expression was the subject of consideration by the Judicial Committee in Attorney-General v. Mercer[8]. But the question upon which we have now to pass was left undecided. In effect their Lordships' view expressed in that case, in so far forth as presently relevant, is perhaps most clearly disclosed in the following passage from the judgment delivered by Lord Selborne taken from p. 778 of the report:\u2014\nIt appears, however, to their Lordships to be a fallacy to assume that, because the word \"royalties\" in this context would not be inofficious or insensible, if it were regarded as having reference to mines and minerals, it ought, therefore, to be limited to those subjects. They see no reason why it should not have its primary and appropriate sense\u2014as to (at all events) all the subjects with which it is here found associated,\u2014lands as well as mines and minerals; even as to mines and minerals it here necessarily signifies rights belonging to the Crown jure coronae.\nOn behalf of the Dominion it is contended that the scope of the word \"royalties\" ought to be limited by reference to the subjects with which it is \"found associated\" in sec. 109; that is to say that it includes only those royalties which are connected with \"lands, mines and minerals.\"\nThe object of the provisions of the B.N.A. Act beginning with sec. 102 dealing with the distribution of property between the provinces and the Dominion was, as their Lordships pointed out in Mercer's Case8, the attribution of Royal Rights for the purposes of revenue and government as part of a broad political scheme. I can perceive no reason why the word \"royalties\" occurring in this enumeration of the assets assigned to the provinces should not be given its full natural sense\u2014\"its primary and appropriate sense\"\u2014without restriction. If the intention had been to express the limited meaning the Dominion seeks to ascribe to the term it would have been easy to employ language more plainly limited in its scope. In effect the adoption of the Dominion construction involves, I think, the addition of some qualifying words to the language of the statute.\nMr. Newcombe also argued that the qualifying words, \"the property of the province,\" attached to the enumeration in sec. 109 have the effect of confining the operation of that section to subjects in respect of which at Confederation the province not only possessed the power of appropriation but had also exercised that power. Admittedly bona vacantia had not up to that time been the subject of any special legislation or of any special appropriation to the public purposes of the colony; but I think the suggested consequence does not follow. As Lord Watson points out in delivering the judgment of the Judicial Committee in the Liquidator of the Maritime Bank v. Receiver General of New Brunswick[9], the title to the property disposed of by this provision was, and after Confederation remained, in the Queen as Sovereign Head of the province; it was the property of the province in the sense only that the legislature and government of the province had been invested with the power of appropriation over it. That I think, is the sense in which the word \"property\" is used in sec. 109.\nThe appeal ought, I think, to be allowed. Anglin J.\u2014It is common ground that the monies paid into court by the defendant Rithet are bona vacantia. The parties are also agreed that the province of British Columbia prior to entering Confederation had the right to appropriate casual revenues of the Crown arising within that colony, other than droits of the Crown and droits of Admiralty (15-16 V. (Imp.) c. 39, s. 2), and that revenues arising from bona vacantia did not fall within either exception. All claim to the property in question has been expressly renounced by the Imperial authorities. That it belongs either to the provincial government of British Columbia or to the Dominion government may therefore be taken for granted.\nThe question at issue is whether bona vacantia are \"royalties\" reserved to the province by s. 109 of the \"British North America Act;\" and, as such, excepted from s. 102 and within s. 126 of that statute. The solution of that question depends upon the scope of the word \"royalties\" in s. 109. Is it used, as Mr. Ritchie, representing the Attorney-General of British Columbia, contended, in its primary and natural sense, or is it used, as Mr. Newcombe argued on behalf of the Dominion government, in a sense limited by its association with the words \"lands, mines, minerals?\" The latter view found favour with the learned President of the Exchequer Court.\nSection 109 reads as follows:\u2014\nAll lands, mines, minerals and royalties belonging to the several provinces of Canada, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick at the Union, and all sums then due or payable for such lands, mines, minerals and royalties, shall belong to the several provinces of Ontario, Quebec, Nova Scotia, and New Brunswick, in which the same are situate or arise, subject to any trust existing in respect thereof and to any interest other than of the Province in the same. The applicability of this section to the province of British Columbia is of course conceded.\nWhile in s. 102 of the \"British North America Act\" we find the clause\nover which the respective legislatures had and have the power of appropriation,\nand in s. 109 the phrase,\nbelonging to the several provinces * * * at the Union,\nI cannot seriously doubt that royalties of the class which the provincial legislatures had the right to appropriate were royalties \"belonging\" to the provinces in the sense in which \"belonging\" is used in s. 109.\n\"Lands, mines (and) minerals\" actually \"belonged\" to the several provinces at the Union. Stricty speaking, royalties (such e.g. as escheats\u2014The Mercer Case), [10] belong to a province only when they come into existence upon the occurrence of the circumstances out of which they arise\u2014in the case of an escheat, the death of the owner of land intestate and without heirs. The abstract right to them is what \"belonged\" to the several provinces at the Union. Hence the use, in the latter part of s. 109, of the two verbs \"are situate\" and \"arise\"\u2014the former applicable to \"lands, mines (and) minerals,\" the latter to \"royalties.\"\nThat bona vacantia fall within the term \"royalties\" regalitates, jura regalia or jura regia, when used without restriction, is authoritatively settled in Attorney-General v. Mercer10, where the holding to that effect in Dyke & Walford[11], is accepted and a passage from the argument of Mr. Ellis in support of that view (p. 480) is expressly approved. Although their Lordships of the Judicial Committee have twice had to consider the scope and meaning of the term \"royalties\" as it occurs in s. 109, in accordance with their well established practice when dealing with provisions of the \"British North America Act,\" they, on each occasion, abstained from further definition of it than was necessary for the determination of the case actually before them. Thus, in the Mercer Case[12], they held that it extended, at all events, to all revenues arising from prerogative rights of the Crown in connection with \"land\" as well as \"mines\" and \"minerals.\" In the Precious Metals Case[13], they held that a conveyance by the province of certain \"public lands\" did not imply a transfer of revenue arising from the prerogative rights of the Crown in regard to precious metals found therein, which belong beneficially to the province, not as mines or minerals and not as an incident of the land, yet under s. 109 and therefore as \"royalties.\" While their Lordships were careful in these two cases not to say that the term \"royalties\" is used in sec. 109 in its unrestricted sense, it may I think be gathered from the general tenor of the judgments that they inclined to the belief that its signification is not limited by its association with the words, \"lands, mines, minerals.\" Thus in the Mercer Case12\nthey see no reason why it should not have its primary and appropriate sense as to (at all events) all the subjects with which it is here found associated, lands as well as mines and minerals;\nand they add\nit is a sound maxim of law that every word ought prima facie to be construed in its primary and natural sense unless a secondary or more limited sense is required by the subject of the context. In the Precious Metals Case[14], while they said (pp. 304-5)\nit is not necessary for the purpose of this appeal to consider whether the expression \"royalties\" as used in section 109 includes jura regalia other than those connected with lands, mines and minerals,\nthey pointed out that \"mines\" and \"minerals\" in the sense of sec. 109 cover only the baser metals, which are incidents of land, and that the prerogative right in regard to precious metals is a jus regale, and as such not an accessory of land. But their Lordships add that the right to \"lands\" granted by the province to the Dominion Government by the 11th article of Union did not, to any extent, derogate from the provincial right to royalties connected with mines and minerals under sec. 109 of the \"British North America Act.\" (p. 305) thus indicating that in their view the jus regale in regard to the precious metals is, in some sense, a right connected with \"mines\" and \"minerals,\" notwithstanding that the latter term as used in sec. 109 comprises only the baser metals.\nI find great difficulty in appreciating the force of the argument in favour of restricting the meaning of the word \"royalties\" to such jura regalia as are associated with \"lands, mines (or) minerals.\" This is not the ordinary case of generic words following particular and specific words. \"Royalties\" is neither more nor less a generic word than \"lands, mines, (or) minerals.\" The fact is that the term \"royalties\" denotes a class of subjects differing entirely from \"lands, mines (and) minerals.\" No common genus embraces them. Without belittling the rule of construction invoked on behalf of the respondent\u2014noscitur a sociis\u2014care must always be taken that its application does not defeat the true intention of the legislature; Hawke v. Dunn[15]; and the cardinal rule that\nan Act of Parliament is to be construed according to the ordinary meaning of the words in the English language as applied to the subject matter, unless there is some other very strong ground derived from the context or reason why it should not be construed, Hornsey Local Boars v. Monarch Investment Building Society[16]\nshould not be disregarded.\nI share, to some extent, the view expressed by Rigby L. J. in Smelting Co. of Australia v. Commissioners of Inland Revenue[17].\nThe rule of construction which is called the ejusdem generis doctrine or sometimes the doctrine \"noscitur a sociis\" is one which, I think, ought to be applied with great caution because it implies a departure from the natural meaning of words in order to give them a meaning which may or may not have been the intention of the legislature.\nWere we to accede to the argument of Mr. Newcombe we would, I fear, put on the ordinary meaning of \"royalties\" a restriction that Parliament did not intend. Indeed, Parliament has already limited that word by the qualification, \"belonging to the several provinces * * * at the Union.\" Why should the court superadd another? It may be that from other provisions of the B.N.A. Act other limitations upon the signification of \"royalties\" should be deduced. For instance, the rights asserted by the Dominion to legislate concerning bona confiscata, deodands and royal fish, may be well founded; but, saving such possible exceptions, with profound respect, \"neither in \"the subject nor in the context\" do I find adequate reason for giving to the word \"royalties\" in s. 109 other than its primary and natural meaning. I think it includes the jus regale to bona vacantia. It would, indeed, present a curious incongruity if escheats should be included in, but bona vacantia excluded from, the royalties granted to the provinces.\nI would therefore allow this appeal and direct that judgment be entered for the Attorney-General of British Columbia.\nBrodeur J.\u2014I concur with Mr. Justice Duff.\nMignault T J.\u2014The controversy here is whether the province of British Columbia or the Dominion of Canada is entitled to certain monies, to wit $7,135 brought into court by the defendant, Robert Paterson Rithet, who, as agent for the liquidator of the Colonial Trust Corporation, a company incorporated in England and which was dissolved in 1904, collected these monies in British Columbia as being due to the company. The liquidator died in 1911, and the Crown as represented by the Government of the United Kingdom makes no claim to this sum. Both parties before us concede that the monies in Mr. Rithet's hands are bona vacantia and it is on this basis that the court below dealt with them, and decided that they should be paid to the government of the Dominion. The Attorney-General of British Columbia now appeals and I will assume, as the parties both contend, that the monies collected by the defendant are really bona vacantia. The shareholders, if any remain, of the dissolved company have made no claim to these monies, and should they ever do so, nothing in the judgment to be rendered should stand in the way of justice being done to them. The question to be decided turns on the construction of sections 102 and 109 of the \"British North America Act, 1867,\" which are as follows:\u2014\n102. All duties and revenues over which the respective legislatures of Canada, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick before and at the Union had and have power of appropriation, except such portions thereof as are by this Act reserved to the respective legislatures of the provinces, or are raised by them in accordance with the special powers conferred on them by this Act, shall form one consolidated revenue fund, to be appropriated for the public service of Canada in the manner and subject to the charges in this Act provided.\n109. All lands, mines, minerals and royalties belonging to the several provinces of Canada, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick at the Union, and all sums then due or payable for such lands, mines, minerals or royalties, shall belong to the several provinces of Ontario, Quebec, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick in which the same are situate or arise, subject to any trusts existing in respect thereof, and to any interest other than that of the province in the same.\nBritish Columbia came into the Canadian Confederation in 1871 and these sections apply to it as if it were named therein. Attorney-General of British Columbia v. Attorney-General of Canada. The Precious Metals Case[18].\nThe point which arises in this case is not covered by any authority by which we are bound. In Attorney-General of Ontario v. Mercer[19], the question of the meaning of the word \"royalties\" in section 109 was considered by the Judicial Committee, but as their Lordships stated in the Precious Metals Case18, at page 305, their decision did not go further than to hold that the word \"royalties\"\ncomprehends, at least, all revenues arising from the prerogative rights of the Crown in connection with \"lands,\" \"mines,\" and \"minerals.\" On behalf of the Dominion it is contended that this is all that the word \"royalties\" really comprehends; that to understand it in a general sense as synonymous with jura regalia would be to give to the provinces some species of property coming within the meaning of jura regalia, such as wrecks, confiscated property or deodands, which belong to the Dominion; and that since the word ''royalties'' as used in section 109 cannot be taken without some restrictions, a fair construction would be to limit these royalties to those connected with the enumerated species of property, lands, mines and minerals, applying the ejusdem generis rule.\nThe contention of British Columbia is that \"royalties\" in section 109 should receive its natural meaning as the English equivalent of jura regalia, and that as bona vacantia are among the jura regalia to which the King was entitled by virtue of his prerogative, the property in question belongs to the province and not to the Dominion. It is also suggested that at least the term \"royalties\" comprises any species of property as to which the province has powers of legislation, which would explain the exclusion of wrecks, deodands and property confiscated by virtue of the criminal law.\nIt was argued in the Mercer Case[20] that the term \"royalties\" had a special meaning restricting it to a royal right connected with mines and minerals, but their Lordships considered it a fallacy to assume that because the word \"royalties\" in this context would not be inofficious or insensible, if it were regarded as having reference to mines and minerals, it ought therefore to be limited to those subjects. They also said that they saw no reason why it should not have its primary and appropriate meaning, as to (at all events) all the subjects with which it is here found associated\u2014lands as well as mines and minerals, adding that the general subject of the whole section is of a high political nature, that it is the attribution of royal territorial rights, for purposes of revenue and government, to the provinces in which they are situate or arise.\nIf the object of section 109 is to attribute royal territorial rights for purposes of revenue and government to the provinces in which they are situate or arise, can it be applied to mere personal property such as this sum of money which the defendant collected in British Columbia as being due to the dissolved company? There does not appear to be any occasion here\u2014since the monies collected are bona vacantia and therefore without an owner\u2014to apply any rule such as mobilia sequuntur personam. The property is in British Columbia and has no other situation, real or notional. Moreover the whole question is whether bona vacantia of such a kind, under section 109 of the \"British North America Act,\" come within the meaning of the word \"royalties\" as used in that section. If they do, they are within the exception made by section 109 to section 102 and belong to British Columbia; if not, under the general rule of section 102, they should go to the Dominion.\nAfter full consideration, my opinion is that the word \"royalties\" in section 109, should be construed in its primary and natural sense as being the equivalent in English of jura regalia. Thus construed, it comprises bona vacantia (see Dyke v. Walford[21] approved by the Judicial Committee in the Mercer Case[22]). In my judgment it is not restricted or controlled by the words \"lands, mines and minerals\" which precede. It is a fourth head added to lands, mines and minerals, and should comprehend all property which is properly described as ''royalties,\" or at least such property as the property here in question. It may be that under Imperial statutes some species of jura regalia such as wrecks, do not go to the province, a point on which it is unnecessary to express an opinion here. It may also be that as an incident of the legislative authority of the Dominion Parliament over criminal law, property confiscated by virtue of the decision of a court of criminal jurisdiction should be attributed to the Dominion, a point also which does not call for a decision in this case. All that I intend to hold is that bona vacantia of the kind here in question belong to the province under section 109.\nI have not failed to notice the ingenious argument of Mr. Newcombe, founded on the difference of expression between sections 102 and 109, that while at the Union the province of British Columbia had the power of appropriation over ''royalties\" in the general sense, which would bring them under the general rule of section 102, it is not shown that this species of property \"belonged\" to British Columbia at the union, section 109 referring to \"royalties\" belonging to the province at the Union. But in my opinion the question here is of a right belonging to the province, and where the province has the right of appropriation over property it seems to me clear that the right to that property belongs to the province. I therefore think that this argument, while ingenious, is not conclusive against the right of British Columbia to claim the property in question. I would in consequence allow the appeal but without costs and decide that the monies in Mr. Rithet's hands should be paid to the province of British Columbia. I agree with the first court that Mr. Rithet is entitled to his costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: J. A. Ritchie.\nSolicitor for the respondent: C. P.

A condition thereof being that no assignment of it should be valid unless approved by the vendor. The respondent became, on the 21st June, 1920, by oral agreement the purchaser of the equitable interest of the appellants for $6,500; and, on the evening of the 22nd June, 1920, this oral agreement was reduced into writing, differences in the agreements being as to the time when possession was to be given and as to the terms of payment of the purchase price. About noon on the 22nd June, 1920, the appellants orally agreed to sell the same property to R. for $6,550, which agreement was immediately put into writing; and on the 23rd June, 1920, R. paid $1,550 to the appellants. The respondent, on the 30th June, 1920, registered a caveat. On the 6th July, 1920, McC., having received the balance of the purchase price from R., executed a transfer of the property to the latter, who, on the 8th July, 1920, had it registered subject to the respondent's caveat.\nHeld that, upon the evidence, the respondent's written agreement sufficiently embodied the terms of the oral agreement to warrant its being taken as a memorandum of the latter which satisfied the Statute of Frauds; therefore, the respondent had a valid agreement prior in time to that of R.; and, the equities of R. and of the respondent being equal at the time of the registration of the caveat, the respondent's equity being first in time, must prevail. McKillop and Benjafield vs. Alexander (45 Can. S.C.R. 551) followed.\nPer Duff J.\u2014When a party sets up that he is a purchaser for value without notice, the onus is on him to prove absence of notice. Laidlaw v. Vaughan, Rhys, (44 Can. S.C.R. 458).\nJudgment of the Court of Appeal (15 Sask. L.R. 24) affirmed.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan[1], reversing the judgment of MacDonald J. at the trial[2] and maintaining the respondent's action for specific performance of an agreement for sale.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions in issue are fully stated in the above head-note and in the judgments now reported.\nGregory K.C. and Hodges for the appellants.\u2014By reason of the additional terms as to the time of going into possession of the land and as to the change in the method of payment of the purchase price, the written agreement is not sufficient to satisfy the Statute of Frauds. The caveat filed by the respondent being in respect of a contract dated June 22nd, 1920, did not protect his rights under the oral contract of June 21st, 1920. At the time of the registration of the caveat the equities of the respondent and of R. were not equal; and R. had at that time a better right to call for the legal estate.\nTingley K.C. for the respondent.\u2014The respondent was prior in equity up to the registration of his caveat, which preserved that priority.\nGregory K.C. and Hodges for the appellants.\nTingley K.C. for the respondent.\nIf the respondent was not prior in equity when he registered his caveat, he obtained priority for his interest by the registration of the caveat.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014For the reasons stated by Mr. Justice Lamont when delivering the unanimous judgment of the Court of Appeal, I am of the opinion that this appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nIdington J.\u2014For the reasons assigned in the judgment of Mr. Justice Lamont speaking on behalf of the Court of Appeal, I think the prior equity of respondent ought to prevail and hence this appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDuff J.\u2014The question upon which the Court of Appeal proceeded presents no difficulty to my mind. In principle this court decided in McKillop v. Alexander[3], that notwithstanding the terms of the agreement between McClellan and Mrs. McDougall the effect of the agreement of sale made by Mrs. McDougall and Mackay was to give to Mackay an equitable interest in the lands of which McLellan was the legal owner. Now it is found by the trial judge, and the Court of Appeal have accepted his finding, that on the 21st of June, 1920, the McDougalls agreed to sell the property to Mackay. The agreement, it is true, was an oral one, but it was long ago established that the effect of the Statute of Frauds was only to prescribe the kind of evidence required for proving a contract for the sale of land and not to lay down a statutory condition of the valid constitution of such a contract. The agreement of the 21st June was a valid contract and enforceable, it is true, speaking generally, only against the party signing a memorandum complying with the requirements of the 4th section of the Statute of Frauds, but a valid contract none the less.\nIt is true, no doubt, as often has been said (Howard v. Miller) [4], that the proposition that a purchaser having only an agreement for sale of land has an interest in the land rests upon the assumption that the agreement is enforceable by equitable process in personam against the legal owner and, generally speaking of course, this would not be so in the absence of the evidence required by the 4th section of the Statute of Frauds. But as I have just said, the memorandum prescribed by the statute is required as evidence only and when the evidence is forthcoming and the agreement is consequently enforceable by legal process the interest of the vendee is deemed to have sprung into existence at the time when the agreement was actually made. On behalf of the appellant it is argued that the formal agreement entered into on the 22nd June between Mrs. McDougall and the respondent differs from the oral agreement made on the 21st June in a material particular and that consequently the oral agreement must be deemed to have been superseded and that the only interest vested in the respondent came into existence on the date of the execution of the written agreement.\nThis argument wholly ignores the distinction between rescission and variation. The subject was much discussed by the law lords in Morris v. Baron[5], and it was there pointed out that where the terms of an existing agreement are varied as, for example, by a change in price, the first agreement is not necessarily rescinded. That may of course be the effect of the second agreement because rescission may take place in one of two ways. It may take place because the parties have explicitly agreed simpliciter to rescind the agreement; and it may take place because upon the same subject matter the parties have entered into a fresh agreement complete in itself and that an intention to rescind the former agreement is implied because these two agreements cannot be simultaneously operative. But on the other hand, as the learned law lords pointed out in the case mentioned, you may have a variation of one or more terms of the contract without rescission of the contract, either express or implied. A very obvious case is the case in which the change which has been made merely varies the mode in which the contract is to be carried into effect. The question in any particular case must be a question of fact because it is a question of intention as to whether or not there was to be only partial rescission, that is to say, a variation, the original contract being kept on foot, or whether there was to be a complete rescission, a second and a new contract being substituted for the first. Now you could not reach the conclusion that what occurred between the parties to the present litigation belonged to the second category of arrangements rather than to the first without concluding at the same time that it was the intention of the respondent to abandon his rights under the agreement of June 21st. There is a presumption against that; see Thorne v. Cann[6]; and there is not the slightest evidence of any such intention. My conclusion is that on this point the decision of the Court of Appeal was right.\nAnother question of a different kind is raised by the appellant, and the question arises in this way. Rusconi entered into an agreement with the McDougalls by which in effect he agreed to take over the burden of the contract paying $1,500, the amount of the purchase money already paid by the McDougalls in cash and paying direct to McLellan the residue of the purchase money. He entered into communications with McLellan, the result of which was that McLellan executed a transfer, and deposited apparently the transfer in escrow to be delivered to Rusconi upon the payment of the residue of the purchase money to him. The contention put forward is that Rusconi was entitled to fortify his position by getting in the legal estate from McLellan and this, it is contended, he did because he had acquired the right to call for the legal estate by the arrangements he had made with McLellan and in consequence it is argued he had, upon settled principles, the better equity. The question as to the circumstances in which the acquisition of the right to call for the legal estate will be held to impart superiority in point of equity to a later over an earlier equitable interest is a question upon which it is difficult to lay down with confidence a precise general rule; the subject need not be considered because there is one answer to the appellant's contention which is conclusive against him. That answer is this; the position which he seeks to assume is that of purchaser for value without notice; and it is settled law (the subject is fully discussed in Laidlaw v. Vaugharir-Rhys[7]), that the defence of purchase for value without notice is a defence which must be pleaded and proved affirmatively. It is a defence in respect of which the onus in the strict sense is on the party claiming the benefit of it. He must affirmatively establish absence of notice. In the present case the appellants have not even pleaded that Rusconi entered into his contract with the McDougalls without notice of the McDougalls' contract with Mackay; absence of notice was not found by the learned trial judge or by the Court of Appeal and there is no evidence before this court enabling us to make a finding upon the point. This contention therefore also fails.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAnglin J.\u2014One McClellan, the registered owner of the property in question, sold it to the defendants, the McDougalls, in October, 1919, the contract containing a provision that no assignment of it should be valid unless approved and countersigned by the vendor.\nThe plaintiff, MacKay, became the purchaser, by oral agreement, of the equitable interest of the McDougalls on the 21st June, 1920, paying $100.00 on account of the purchase price of $6,500. Subject to a question as to discrepancies, this oral agreement was reduced into writing on the evening of the 22nd June. The plaintiff lodged a caveat to protect his interest on the 30th June. About noon on the 22nd of June, the McDougalls agreed orally to sell the property to the defendant Rusconi for $6,550. Subject likewise to some discrepancies, this agreement was also put into writing and on the 23rd of June Rusconi paid $1,550 on account of the purchase price. His agent immediately prepared and sent to McClellan, for execution by him, a transfer of the property to Rusconi. McClellan executed this transfer and on the 26th of June sent it to his bankers with instructions to hand it to Rusconi on receipt of the balance due McClellan on his agreement with the McDougalls. On the 29th June, McClellan wrote the McDougalls that he had accepted Rusconi's cash offer and would \"not accept Mr. MacKay on contract.\" On the 6th of July, Rusconi paid the balance of the purchase price to McClellan's bankers and obtained the transfer, and on the 8th of July had it registered subject to MacKay's caveat.\nThe learned trial judge took the view that because his written contract of the 22nd of June differed in two particulars from the oral agreement of the 21st, MacKay had no enforceable contract until the evening of the 22nd. These two differences are thus stated in the judgment of the Court of Appeal, delivered by Mr. Justice Lamont:\n(1) Under the oral agreement possession was to be given on July 15th, while in his written agreement it was to be given on July 10th, or sooner if possible, and (2) under the oral agreement the price was stated to be $6,500, while in the written agreement the plaintiff, although he was to pay $6,500 in all, was to pay the McDougalls their equity in cash and pay the balance to McClellan, in accordance with the terms in the agreement with the McDougalls, which was to be assigned to him.\nThe learned trial judge therefore held that Rusconi had the prior equity under his verbal agreement made at noon on the 22nd of June and on that ground dismissed MacKay's action against the McDougalls and Rusconi for specific performance. He also took the view that, because MacKay's caveat referred only to the agreement in writing dated the 22nd of June, the interest thereby protected must be taken to have originated when that agreement was executed.\nIn the Court of Appeal, the view prevailed thait the written agreement with MacKay of the 22nd of June sufficiently embodied the terms of the oral agreement of the 21st to warrant its being taken as a memorandum of the latter which satisfied the Statute of Frauds and that MacKay, therefore, had the prior equity, dating from the making of his oral agreement on the 21st, and was on that ground entitled to succeed.\nOn this question I am inclined to accept the conclusion reached by the Court of Appeal.\nOn the first point:\u2014\nThere was nothing to prevent the parties, who had agreed on the 21st of June that possession would be given on the 15th of July, changing that arrangement on the following day and providing, as they did, for possession on the 10th of July, or sooner if possible, Did that change make of the document of the 22nd of June a new contract in substitution for that of the 21st so as to prevent its being regarded as a memorandum thereof? That would seem to depend on whether the provision as to the date of possession should be deemed a material term of the agreement, or either an immaterial term or a collateral arrangement only. Fry on Specific Performance (6 ed) par. 368. An arrangement as to date of possession may be of the latter character: McKenzie v. Walsh[8]; Anderson v. Douglas[9]. On the whole case, I incline to the opinion that the provision as to the date of possession was not such an essential term of the oral agreement of the 21st of June that the change made in respect to it precludes the view taken in the Court of Appeal that the document of the 22nd was really a formulation of the oral contract of the 21st and not a new contract. As put by Mr. Justice Lamont:\nThe difference as to the time when possession was to be given is not material.\nOn the other point:\u2014\nThe evidence detailed by Mr. Justice Lamont seems to make it clear that the terms as to payment set forth in the written agreement of the 22nd did not differ from those discussed and agreed to orally on the 21st.\nThe three following objections raised by the defendants call for consideration:\n1. That the MacKay caveat protects only such interest as he acquired by the written agreement of the 22nd of June and therefore cannot be invoked to protect rights acquired under the oral contract of the 21st;\n2. In view of what has since transpired, specific performance of the MacKay agreement has been rendered impossible;\n3. The defendant Rusconi by his diligence acquired the better right to call for a conveyance of the legal estate held by McClellan.\n1. As is pointed out in the respondent's factum the caveator claimed an interest as purchaser under the agreement in writing dated June 22nd. This \"agreement in writing\" is the formal embodiment of the oral agreement of the 21st of June. I think the caveat sufficiently indicated the claim of the plaintiff as purchaser under the oral agreement of the 21st of June, evidenced by the writing of the 22nd, and therefore protected his equity under the oral agreement. Whatever rights MacKay had in or to the land in question covered by the caveat registered on the 30th of June were thereby preserved to him. McKillop & Benjafield v. Alexander[10].\n2. Nothing had occurred prior to such registration which would prevent the McDougalls transferring their equitable interest to MacKay. All that was done after the caveat was lodged was subject to MacKay's rights as they then existed and cannot interfere with the enforcement of them. For that purpose Rusconi has assumed McClellan's position. This ground of appeal cannot be maintained.\n3. Although impressed with the contention that by what he had procured to be done\u2014the execution of the conveyance to him by the holder of the legal estate and the depositing of it with his bankers for delivery on payment to them of the balance of the purchase money and the writing of the letter by McClellan to the McDougalls\u2014Rusconi had acquired a better right than MacKay to call for the conveyance of the legal estate, on further consideration I am satisfied that this is not the case. In dealing with an equitable estate in land the doctrine of obtaining priority by notice to the holder of the legal estate does not prevail; Hopkins v. Hemsworth,[11]. Rusconi did not obtain anything from McClellan which was tantamount to a declaration of trust in his favour or an undertaking to hold the land for him. Until delivery the deed sent to the bankers was wholly inoperative. Whatever might have been the effect of a similar letter from McClellan to Rusconi, McLellan's letter to the McDougalls carried no right to Rusconi. In what took place prior to the lodging of MacKay's caveat there was nothing to displace the original priority of his equitable claim. The uncompleted steps taken to obtain the legal estate had not that effect. Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de Paris v. Walker[12]. McClelland intention to convey the legal estate to Rusconi remained unexecuted on the 30th of June. Whatever rights were conveyed by the delivery of the transfer on the 6th of July and its subsequent registration were acquired subject to MacKay's prior equity,\nI fully recognize that a court of equity will not prefer one equity to another on the mere ground of priority of time until it has found by examination of their relative merits that there is no other sufficient ground of preference between them; that such examination must cover the conduct of the parties and all the circumstances; and that the test of preference is the broad principle of right and justice which courts of equity apply universally. Rice v. Rice[13]. Here after most careful consideration, I find nothing prior to the registration of MacKay's caveat which disturbed the equality between the two equities in all respects other than priority of time which is therefore effective and entitles MacKay's equity to prevail.\nThe provision of the McClellan-McDougall agreement that no assignment of it should be valid unless approved and countersigned by McClellan is a stipulation for his benefit and can be invoked only by him. It did not prevent MacKay acquiring an equitable interest in the property good as against the McDougall's and the subsequent purchaser Rusconi. McKillop Benjafield v. Alexander[14]; Sawyer & Massey Co. v. Bennett[15].\nI would for these reasons affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeal and dismiss this appeal with costs.\nBrodeur J.\u2014I concur in the result.\nMignault J.\u2014It is necessary to consider what was the legal position of MacKay and Rusconi respectively on the 30th of June, 1920, when MacKay registered his caveat. If on that date neither of these parties had more than an equitable right, MacKay being prior in time should be preferred. And any title to the legal estate which Rusconi obtained and registered after that date would be subject to MacKay's caveat.\nAs matters stood on June 30th, 1920, both MacKay and Rusconi had verbal agreements from the equitable owner for the sale of the property, which agreements had been reduced to writing. Rusconi, at that date, had not obtained the legal estate from McClellan, the legal and registered owner. It is true that on June 26th, McClellan signed in favour of Rusconi a transfer of his estate and interest in the property, but this transfer was sent to the bank to be delivered to Rusconi on full payment of the price, and it was delivered to him after June 30th. He therefore took the legal estate subject to MacKay's caveat.\nDid Rusconi, on June 30th, have a better right to call for the legal estate than MacKay? I think not. As matters then stood both MacKay and Rusconi had made an agreement of sale with the equitable owner, but MacKay was first in time. McClellan was then the registered owner of the property. He apparently objected to the sale to MacKay, and was willing to transfer the property to Rusconi, but no transfer had then been delivered to the latter. McClellan is not a party to these proceedings and MacKay and Rusconi must stand on the rights they had acquired from the McDougalls up to June 30th. These were purely equitable rights and the equities being equal MacKay is entitled to preference, for he was first in time. I would therefore agree with the Court of Appeal which decided in his favour.\nThe defence based on the Statute of Frauds, in my opinion, fails.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: McNeel & Hodges.\nSolicitor for the respondent: A.

The ships were, to the knowledge of the respondent, under construction for the appellant at the time of the agreements. The contracts contained the following clause: \"This contract * * * is entered into conditional upon the continuance of the steamship company's service and the sailings of its steamers between the ports named therein.\" Owing, apparently, to a dispute between the ship-builders and the appellant a delay occurred in the completion and delivery of the ships, which were not ready to sail in the named months. The respondent cancelled the contracts of affreightment and sued to recover damages.\nHeld, that the respondent was entitled to succeed. The above quoted provision covers the possibility of the abandonment of the appellant company's undertaking and the complete cessation of its service \"between the ports named\" and does not cover a temporary suspension of sailing not caused by either of the contingencies mentioned in the clause. Moreover, the principle of Taylor v. Caldwell (3 B. & S. 826), as to impossibility of performance is not applicable to this case; the contracts cannot be held to be subject to an implied condition excusing performance by the appellant if the ships were not fit for sailing during the months specified through no fault of the appellant.\nJudgment of the Court of Appeal ([1922] 1 W.W.R. 662) affirmed. APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1], reversing the judgment of the trial judge, Gregory J., and maintaining the respondent's action for damages for breach of two contracts of affreightment.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions at issure are fully stated in the above head-note and in the judgments now reported.\nD.L.McCarthy K.C. for the appellant.\u2014The contracts sued upon were not absolute, in the sense of binding the appellant to produce the named ships in any event, but the obligations of the appellant were expressly made conditional upon the actual sailing of the contract ships.\nThe appellant's obligations under the contracts were subject to an implied condition, that if without any default on the part of the appellant, the contract ships were not in existence when the date arrived for the performance of the contracts, then the appellant was to be excused from performance. Taylor v. Caldwell[2]; Roche v. Johnson[3]; Howell v. Coupland[4]; Kerrigan v. Harrison[5]; Bank Line Limited v. Arthur Capel & Co.[6].\nE.P. Davis K.C. for the respondent.\u2014The appellant was not excused from performance by the express conditions of the contracts; Elderslie Steamship Co. v. Borthwick[7].\nNo condition should be implied in the contracts relieving the appellant from responsibility for not performing the contracts. Baily v. De Crespigny[8]; Krell v. Henry[9]; Tamplin Steamship Co. v. Anglo\u2014Mexican Petroleum Products Co.[10]. IDINGTON J.\u2014The respondent sued to recover damages for breaches of two contracts which were respectively made on the 19th and 24th of March, 1920, by the appellant to carry lumber from Vancouver to Australia of which that quantity named in the earlier contract was to be received early in April of said year, and that in the later contract was to be received in April or May of same year.\nThe respondent incurred considerable preparatory expense for the purpose of performing, if permitted, its part of the contract, by assembling the lumber to be re-loaded, and lost part of a bargain it had made for the sale and delivery of said lumber in Australia, but the appellant failed to produce the vessels named, or either of them, to receive the said lumber.\nThe defence set up is that the vessels were not finished in time and that the respondent knew when these contracts were entered into that they had not been quite finished.\nIt relies on the following clause in each of the contracts:\nThis contract is not transferable and is entered into conditional upon the continuance of the steamship company's service and the sailing of its steamers between the ports named herein. If, at anytime, in the judgment of the steamship company or its authorized agents, conditions of war or hostilities, actual or threatened, are such as to make it unsafe or imprudent for its vessels to sail, or if the vessels of the company shall be taken, sold, or chartered for the use of any Government, or in the event of loss of, or damage to, any of the vessels of the company, or vessels chartered by them, resulting from actions of an enemy, perils of the sea, or other cause, the steamship company may discontinue or curtail its service; and in that event the steamship company shall be relieved from any liability hereunder, except that if its service be only curtailed the shipper shall be entitled to the carriage of a proportionate part of this contract.\nIt contends that under the first sentence I quote it was, under the circumstance, discharged from all liability. I cannot so construe the said conditions, nor can I read the first sentence as at all intended to excuse the appellant unless the failure to produce either of the vessels named was the result of its having fallen within some one or other of the conditions set forth in the second sentence above quoted, which is not pretended to have been the case.\nOn the contrary, the only excuse given at the trial was the failure, through a petty squabble between the contractor who had the contract and those who had let the contract to him, about something in regard to which he ultimately yielded.\nA further pretence is set up that a strike, or threatened strike, was to blame in part for the delay.\nResting upon this failure of the contractor the appellant invokes the doctrine of impossibility upon which the case of Taylor v. Caldwell [11] was decided.\nI do not think that can be made applicable herein unless we are to so extend the operation of the doctrine as to render almost any and every conceivable contract of little value.\nAnd especially so does that appear to me to be the case when each of the contracts here does absolutely and imperatively provide the implied undertaking on the part of said appellant that unless upon the happening of any of the said events named the vessel named would be available at the time named. And yet at the same time that it provides for its protection the conditions above set forth, it fails to anticipate the possibility of so common a condition of things as a strike against which it is usual to provide if such protection desired.\nThe appeal, I think, fails and should be dismissed with costs. But I see the Chief Justice and Mr. Justice Galliher seem to think assessment of damages needed, yet the formal judgment indicates the contrary.\nIf any error that had better be spoken to.\nDUFF J.\u2014I think the contention of the respondent company as to the construction of the contract must be given effect to. It is a commercial contract. Any plain man reading the second paragraph would read the first and second sentences together and treat the first as subject to the qualifications contained in the second. The distinction between constitutive conditions and resolutory conditions upon which the appellant relies is sadly out of place here. In a practical business sense, if the sweeping scope which the appellant gives to the first sentence is conceded, then the second sentence, or nearly the whole of it, is useless and out of place. In such circumstances it is legitimate to restrict the generality of the first sentence by reading the two together. And it is sufficient to reach the conclusion that such may be the proper construction of the document. An ambiguous document is no protection, as Lord Macnaghten said. See Nelson v. Nelson[12].\nThe second ground of appeal relied upon is that the principle of Taylor v. Caldwell[13], and analogous cases applies and that in conformity with this principle the contracts should have been held to be subject to an implied condition that the ships should be in existence and fit for sailing at the time when the date of sailing arrived and if that fail through no fault of the appellants, the appellants were to be excused from performance. The principle of Taylor v. Caldwell[14] has unquestionably been extended to cases in which parties having entered into a contract in terms unqualified it is found when the time for performance arrives, that a state of things contemplated by both parties as essential to performance according to the true intent of both of them fails to exist. Krell v. Heney[15]; Chandler v. Webster[16]. For the purpose of deciding whether a particular case falls within the principle you must consider the nature of the contract and the circumstances in which it was made in order to see from the nature of the contract whether the parties must have made their bargain on the footing that a particular thing or state of facts should be in existence when the time for performance should occur. Tamplin Steamship Co. v. Anglo-Mexican Petroleum Products Co.[17]. And if reasonable persons situated as the parties were must have agreed that the promissor's contractual obligations should come to an end if that state of circumstances should not exist then a term to that effect may be implied. Dahl v. Nelson[18]. But it is most important to remember that no such term should be implied when it is possible to hold that reasonable men could have contemplated the taking the risk of the circumstances being what they in fact proved to be when the time for performance arrived. Scottish Navigation Co. v. Souter [19].\nThe doctrine of English law is that generally a promissor except to the extent to which his promise is qualified warrants his ability to perform it and this notwithstanding he may thereby make himself answerable for the conduct of other persons. The seeming rigour of this doctrine is mitigated in the case of commercial contracts by the application of the principle above referred to which rests upon the assumption, as Lord Watson said in Dahl v. Nelson[20], that in relation to possibilities in the contemplation of the contract but not actually present to the minds of the parties, the parties intended to stipulate for what would be fair and reasonable having regard to their mutual interests and to the main objects of the contract.\nThe contracts were made on the 19th of March and provided for shipment at the end of April or the beginning of May. Is there anything in the circumstances affording a ground for saying that the agents of appellant and of the respondent as reasonable men could not have contracted on the footing that the appellants should assume the risk of what subsequently happened?\nIt is important to remember that there is no evidence to indicate that the delay was due to any extraordinary occurrence, to anything outside the ordinary course of events. There is a suggestion of a strike and there is a suggestion of a dispute between the Government and the contractors who were building the ships. The respondents were not aware of the precise relations between the appellants and the contractors and were entitled to assume that the contractors in entering into the contract were duly taking into account the possibilities incidental to those relations. There was nothing in the facts known to them making it unreasonable from the respondent's point of view that they should expect an undertaking as touching the date of sailing unqualified, at all events, in respect of any of the matters which have been suggested as accounting for the appellants' default. Real impossibility of performance arising from destruction of the ships by fire, for example, would have presented a different case. There is nothing in the evidence inconsistent with the hypothesis that the impossibility which no doubt did arise at the last moment was due to lack of energy on part of the Government or to supineness or indifference on part of the appellants. Impossibility arising from such causes is not the impossibility contemplated by the case of Taylor v. Caldwell [21]. See Hick v. Raymond [22].\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nANGLIN J.\u2014The Court of Appeal, reversing the judgment of Gregory J., who dismissed the action, awarded the plaintiff $7,701.93 for breach of a contract of affreightment.\nThe defendant failed to provide two vessels in which it had contracted to carry lumber of the plaintiff from British Columbia to Australian ports. The contractor for the construction of the vessels delayed delivery of them to the owner\u2014the Dominion Government\u2014which was consequently unable to turn them over to the defendant, an operating company.\nTwo distinct defences and grounds of appeal are preferred:\u2014(a) that by an express term of each of the two contracts of affreightment performance of it by the defendant is made contingent upon the named ship sailing on the contract voyage; (b) that, if performance was not excused by the express term relied upon, it was an implied condition of the defendant's obligation that the named vessels should be available for the service. (a) The express provision on which the defendant relies reads as follows:\nThis contract * * * is entered into conditional upon the continuance of the steamship company's service and the sailings of its steamers between the ports named herein.\nI agree with the construction put on this clause by Mr. Davis that\nconditional upon the continuance of the steamship company's service\ncovers the possibility of the abandonment of the company's undertaking and the complete cessation of its service. If the word \"service\" were qualified by the phrase \"between the ports named herein,\" it would mean the cessation of such service between those ports. I incline however to the former construction. This member of the clause, in my opinion, is not open to the view that it covers any merely temporary interruption in the service such as that which actually occurred. The word used is \"continuance\" and not \"continuity\" which the construction urged by the defendant would require.\nConditional upon the continuance * * * of the sailings of its steamers between the ports named\nprovides, I think, for the service between these ports being abandoned although the company's vessels should be placed on other routes. The phrase \"between the ports named\" gives the cue to the scope and purpose of this member of the provision. Mr. Justice Galliher very succinctly states the purview of the two members of the clause now under consideration in these words:\nI think it simply means that if the company went out of business or ceased sailing vessels between these ports, then the contract was off. Neither member of the clause relates merely to an interruption in the continuity of the company's service between Canada and Australia due to the vessel named in either contract being temporarily unavailable. I am quite satisfied that an omission of a schedule trip or trips due to that fact is not within the purview of the express provision of the contracts on which the defendant relies.\n(b) Neither, in my opinion, do the circumstances admit of the implication of a term excusing performance because the Government failed to deliver to the defendant the two ships for carriage by which the contracts were made.\nIn addition to the stipulation already mentioned, each of the contracts expressly provides that performance by the defendant shall be excused in several events\u2014loss of, or damage to, its vessels, suspension of service owing to hostilities actual or threatened, and requisition of its vessels by the government. It may be that the parties should be held in this enumeration to have exhausted the conditions on which the defendant was to be excused for not fulfilling its contract; Horlock v. Beal [23]; but see Nickoll and Knight v. Ashton, Edridge & Co.[24].\nIt was known to the contracting parties that the vessels in question were still under construction, although nearly completed when the contracts were made. The following statement of the law by Hannen J., in Baily v. De Crespigny[25], is generally recognized as authoritative: We have first to consider what is the meaning of the covenant which the parties have entered into. There can be no doubt that a man may by an absolute contract bind himself to perform things which subsequently become impossible, or to pay damages for the non-performance, and this construction is to be put upon an unqualified undertaking where the event which causes the impossibility was or might have been anticipated and guarded against in the contract, or where the impossibility arises from the act or default of the promissor.\nSubject to certain expressed conditions, none of which covers this case, the defendant bound itself by contracts absolute in form to transport the plaintiff's goods by named vessels at a stated time. I am not disposed to take the view that this should be regarded as a case of\nimpossibility arising from any act or default of the promissor.\nBut I find it difficult to conceive that delay in the delivery of the vessels was not a contingency which\nwas or might have been anticipated and guarded against in the contract\u2014\nthat it was an event that cannot reasonably be said to have been in the contemplation of the parties at the date of the contract. Krell v. Henry[26]. If it was, having failed to provide for it, a term containing an additional qualification of the defendant's contractual obligation, in order to cover default due to nonavailability of the vessels due to this cause, should not be implied. Such a term will not be implied merely because the court may think it reasonable, but only if the court think it necessarily implied in the nature of the contract the parties have made. Lazarus v. Cairn Line of Steamships[27]; Hamlyn v. Wood[28]. If, on the other hand, delay in delivery of the vessels was a contingency which neither was in fact, nor might have been, anticipated, the court should not imply the term that the contracts will thereby be put an end to without inquiring what the parties, as reasonable men, would presumably have agreed upon had that contingency been present to their minds. Dahl v. Nelson Donkin & Co[29]; F.A. Tamplin Steamship Co. v. Anglo-Mexican Petroleum Products Co.[30]. I find it difficult to believe that the plaintiff would have assented, or could have been expected to assent, to such a term as the defendant asks to have implied. Why should the plaintiff be expected to assume the entire risk of the consequences of the defendant's default, however innocent? The case, in my opinion, is not one for the application of the doctrine of Taylor v. Caldwell [31], and kindred authorities relied upon.\nI would for these reasons dismiss this appeal.\nBRODEUR J.\u2014The Canadian Trading Company, in March, 1920, entered into two contracts of affreightment with the Canadian Government Marine for loading with timber two ships of the latter called the Inventor and the Prospector plying between Canada and Australia. The shipment was to be made in early April 1920 on the Inventor and in April or May 1920 on the Prospector.\nWhen the contracts were made, the ships were under construction and should have been quickly completed. But for reasons which are not clearly shown in the evidence, they were not delivered to the appellant company to permit the Canadian Trading Company to load its timber at the time stipulated in the contracts. The Canadian Trading Company now claims damages from the Canadian Merchant Marine for not having fulfilled its obligation.\nThe defendant company pleaded that the contracts were not absolute; that it was not bound to produce the ships in any event; but that its obligation was made with the express or implied condition that the actual sailing of the contract ships should take place.\nThe defendant appellant company relies on a clause in the contract which declares that\nThis contract is not transferable and is entered into conditional upon the continuance of the steamship company's service and the sailing of its steamers between the ports named therein.\nThese provisions of the contract were embodied in the defendant's own form and they are evidently put in for its own protection. They should not be extended and should be construed in their ordinary meaning.\nThe breach of contract which is charged upon the company defendant has reference to delays in sailing. The contracts contemplated in the condition above quoted a cessation of the service and the discontinuance of the sailing. No such thing has occurred. The company continued its service and the sailings went on without any real interruption.\nThe condition which I quoted is formed of two sentences which should be read together. They carry out the same idea, viz., a cessation of the appellant's service and not a merely temporary one. Elsderlie Steamship Co. v. Borthwick[32].\nThe appellant company contends that there was impossibility on its part to carry out its contract and that there was an implied condition relieving it from responsibility for the performing of the contract. This defence of impossibility rests on an implied condition. The case of Taylor v. Caldwell[33], is to the effect that if the impossibility arises subsequently to the making of the contract, it will be no excuse if in its nature the performance might have been possible. In this case there is no evidence that the performance was impossible. The vessel could have been delivered on time and nothing in the evidence shows the impossibility to which reference is made in Taylor v. Caldwell[34].\nBesides the circumstances causing the impossibility could have been very easily foreseen when the contract was made. Many conditions were stipulated and the strike which is alleged as cause of the delay likely existed at the time the contract was made and so provision could have been made in the contract. The ships at the time the contract was made were already late in delivery and in the light of the following decisions, Lebeaupin v. Crispin[35], Baily v. De-Crespigny[36], Krell v Henry[37], I come to the conclusion that there was no implied condition which would relieve the appellant company from liability.\nUnder these circumstances the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nMIGNAULT J.\u2014The two contracts in question, for the breach of which the appellant was declared liable by the Court of Appeal of British Columbia, were for the shipment of lumber by two named ships, the Canadian Inventor and the Canadian Prospector, then, to the knowledge of the parties, under construction for the Canadian Government. At the time of the contracts the vessels were nearing com- pletion and no doubt the parties thought that they would be ready to take on their cargo and sail at the time mentioned in the contracts. However trouble ensued between the Government and the ship builders and the vessels were not ready in time. The respondent sues to recover damages by reason of the appellant's failure to have these ships ready for loading.\nThe defence was that the appellant was relieved from liability under the conditions of the contracts which said that the contracts were \"conditional upon the continuance of the steamship company's service and the sailing of its steamers between the ports named.\" The contracts also stated that if, at any time, in the judgment of the steamship company, or its authorized agents, conditions of war or hostilities, actual or threatened, were such as to make it unsafe or imprudent for its vessels to sail, or if the vessels of the company should be taken, sold or chartered for the use of any government, or in the event of loss of, or damage to, any of the vessels of the company, or vessels chartered by them, resulting from actions of an enemy, perils of the sea, or other cause, the steamship company might discontinue or curtail its service; and in that event the company should be free from any liability, except that if its service were only curtailed, the shipper would be entitled to the carriage of a proportional part of the contract.\nThe appellant relies on the first condition as to the continuance of the steamship company's service and the sailing of its steamers between the ports named, and, in the alternative, on an alleged implied condition that if, without any default on its part, the contract ships were not in existence when the date arrived for the performance of the contract, then the appellant was to be excused from performance. As to the express condition, the learned trial judge was of opinion that it relieved the appellant from liability, but his judgment was set aside by the Court of Appeal. After much consideration, I do not think that this condition can be said to apply to the contingency which happened. It expressly refers to a discontinuance of the company's service and sailing of its steamers between the ports named. This would not comprise a temporary suspension of sailing other than one caused by one of the contingencies mentioned in the rest of the clause, conditions of war, etc. Much less would it include the failure under these contracts to have the ship ready at the sailing time, for if it was known to both parties that it was nearing completion, the appellant certainly considered that it would be completed in time, and the non-completion of the ship or its failure to be ready was surely not meant by the parties to be guarded against by the general clause as to discontinuance of service. Such a contingency as happened could have been specially provided for and I do not think that it is now open to the appellant to say that it was covered by a general clause like the one in question. And it certainly does not come within the language of this clause reasonably construed.\nWhether the implied condition relied on by the appellant relieves it from liability is a question of much nicety. Mr. Justice Blackburn, in Taylor v Caldwell[38], laid down a rule which is accepted as settled law. He said:\nWhere from the nature of the contract it appears that the parties must from the beginning have known that it could not be fulfilled unless, when the time for the fulfilment of the contract arrived, some particular specified thing continued to exist, so that, when entering into the contract, they must have contemplated such continuing existence as the foundation of what was to be done, there, in the absence of any express or implied warranty that the thing shall exist, the contract is not to be construed as a positive contract, but as subject to an implied condition that the parties shall be excused in case, before breach, performance becomes impossible from the perishing of the thing without default of the contractor.\nBlackburn J., it is interesting to note, referred to the civil law and to Pothier, Obligations, No. 668, as laying down the rule that the debtor corporis certi is freed from the obligation when the thing has perished neither by his act, nor by his neglect, and before he is in default, unless by some stipulation he has taken on himself the risk of the particular misfortune which has occurred.\nIt seems to me\u2014and that is certainly the rule of the civil law as I understand it\u2014that the contingency which relieves a party from performing a contract on the ground of impossibility of performance, is an unforeseen event. I take it that this is the rule laid down by Hannen J., in Baily v. DeCrespigny [39]:\nThere can be no doubt that a man may by an absolute contract bind himself to perform things which subsequently become impossible, or to pay damages for the non\u2014performance, and this construction is to be put upon an unqualified undertaking, where the event which causes the impossibility was, or might have been, anticipated and guarded against in the contract, or where the impossibility arises from the act or default of the promissor. But, where the event is of such a character that it cannot reasonably be supposed to have been in the contemplation of the contracting parties when the contract was made, they will not be held bound by general words which, though large enough to include, were not used with reference to the possibility of the particular contingency which afterwards happens.\nSo that if the event which causes the impossibility could have been anticipated and guarded against in the contract, the party in default cannot claim relief because it has happened. The case of Nickoll and Knight v. Ashton, Edridge & Co.[40], is an interesting one and I have derived much benefit from the consideration I have given to it. There a cargo had been sold to be shipped by the steamship Orlando at an Egyptian port during January, 1900, and to be delivered to the plaintiffs in the United Kingdom. The contract provided that, in case of prohibition of export, blockade or hostilities preventing shipment, the contract or any unfulfilled part should be cancelled. In December, 1899, the Orlando was stranded through perils of the sea without default on the defendant's part, and was so much damaged as to render it impossible for her to arrive at the port of loading in time to load during January. It was held by A.L. Smith M.R., and Romer L.J., Vaughan Williams L.J. dissenting, that the contract should be construed as subject to an implied condition that if, at the time for its performance, the Orlando should, without default on the defendant's part, have ceased to exist as a ship fit for the purpose of shipping the cargo, the contract should be treated as at an end.\nThis case may be distinguished from the one at bar in that the stranding of a particular ship can reasonably be said to be an unforeseen event, for although any ship is exposed to the perils of the sea the stranding of a particular ship mentioned in a contract, so as to prevent it from taking on its cargo at the specified time, is certainly something which can be said to be unforeseen. But here the appellant undertook to carry a cargo on a ship nearing completion. It could certainly have been foreseen that something might occur in the ship yard, especially in these days of labour troubles, to delay completion, and by making an absolute contract without providing against the contingency of non-completion in time, the appellant, in my opinion, assumed the risk of this contingency. The respondent prepared all its cargo for the ship in time and would be subject to considerable loss if the appellant were relieved from the consequences of non-performance. Such a condition, if it had been stipulated, might not have been accepted by the respondent, which possibly would have preferred to ship its lumber through another steamship company.

J. and Idington, Duff, Anglin, Brodeur and Mignault JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR SASKATCHEWAN.\nHusband and wife\u2014Fraudulent conveyance\u2014Property in wife's name to defeat creditors\u2014Principal and agent\u2014Power of attorney to husband\u2014Transfer by attorney to himself\u2014Right of wife to relief.\nA husband (the appellant) had certain property put in his wife's (the respondent's) name, with her knowledge, for the purpose of defeating his creditors. He held a general power of attorney from her. A quarrel having occurred between them the husband registered this power and, as his wife's attorney, he had the property transferred into his own name. The wife sued to have the property re-transferred to her.\nHeld, Idington and Brodeur JJ. dissenting, that the wife was entitled to have the transfer to her husband set aside. In order to succeed, she had only to invoke the illegal act of her husband in executing as her attorney the transfer of the property to himself and she was not obliged to disclose the alleged fraud connected with her own title; on the contrary, the husband, in order to succeed in his defence, had to invoke such fraudulent arrangement made to defeat his creditors.\nJudgment of the Court of Appeal ([1921] 2 W.W.R. 963) affirmed, Idington and Brodeur JJ. dissented.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan[1], reversing the judgment of Taylor J., at the trial[2] and maintaining the respondent's action. The material facts of the case and the questions in issue are fully stated in the above head-note and in the judgment now reported.\nJohn Feinstein for the appellant.\nR. Hartney for the respondent.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014For the reasons stated by my brother Anglin with which I fully concur, I would dismiss this appeal with costs.\nIdington J. (dissenting)\u2014This is an action between husband and wife who during twelve or thirteen years had resorted to various devices to defeat the creditors of the husband who pretended to act for the wife and acting under powers of attorney from her to preserve for him or her the fruits of his labour and enterprise in fraud of his creditors.\nBut for his course of so dealing having been properly held by the learned trial judge a legal barrier in his way he was entitled to claim that his wife was his trustee of the properties in question herein.\nThe correct inference to be drawn from the history of the dealings between them is that in her giving the power of attorney in question it was given for the sole purposes of continuing to protect his property from and in fraud of his creditors.\nShe herein complains of his unexpected abuse of such power of attorney in conveying the property to himself.\nI cannot think that a suitor depending upon an instrument so designed to perpetuate a fraudulent course of dealing, and thus tainted with illegality, can properly ask the court to protect her from any abuse of such power. She has already had the benefit of the application of such a principle of law by being freed from any liability to account to her husband by reason of the trusteeship by which she would have had to account to him but for the whole being tainted with illegality.\nI do not see that she can properly complain after invoking the principle to defeat his claim of it being in turn applied to the residue of their illegal under\u00adtakings.\nThe principle upon which the decision of the Court proceeded in the case of Scheuerman v. Scheuerman[3], works both ways.\nNotwithstanding her illegal acquisition of the prop\u00aderties, I recognize that if she had given a power of attorney to a stranger to sell and dispose of same and he had dealt with them as the husband has done, she might have been entitled to relief by way of having him so empowered declared her trustee, quite independ\u00adently of the abstruse_ questions arising under the \"Land Titles Act\".\nIn my view of the case I need not either try to resolve that question or deal with many others discussed here and below.\nBut let us suppose, that power of attorney to her husband had expressly provided that he might convey thereby to himself, and she had applied to the court to have such an instrument rectified because it had been inserted by mistake, would she have been entitled to any such rectification of an instrument so tainted with fraudulent purpose as I think this was?\nWith some confidence I submit not, and that all that which is involved herein is essentially of that character. It was mentioned during the course of the argument that the creditors, or some of them, had issued executions and registered judgments against the lands in question.\nNothing I have said herein is to be taken (even if concurred in by others of my brother judges) as in anyway deciding the effect thereof in light of the legal puzzle arising out of the registration of the conveyance by the appellant to himself having been recognized by the registrar.\nThe creditors, of course, may, until that is solved, have a mesaure of protection meanwhile.\nI would allow the appeal herein with costs here and below and restore the judgment of the learned trial judge.\nDuff J.\u2014This appeal appears to present little difficulty once the facts are understood. The respondent was the registered owner of the lands under dispute. She had given her husband a power of attorney conferring upon him a wide general authority to deal with them, but this general authority did not embrace the power to execute a conveyance in favour of the agent himself. Any attempt to acquire a title by such a use of the authority vested in him would be a fraud upon the power. Prima facie, therefore, the wife is entitled to have the husband declared trustee for her.\nThe question therefore arises whether the husband can displace this prima facie right of the wife's by alleging that she held her title to the property for his benefit, but for the purpose of protecting it from his creditors. In other words, whether her title was acquired in pursuance of an unlawful design and plan to defeat the creditors of the husband. It is quite clear, I think, that such a defence is not competent to the husband. As Lord Hardwick said in Cottington v. Fletcher[4], as long ago as 1740 such \"fraudulent conveyances\" are \"absolute against the grantor.\" It is quite clear that the husband would not be heard in an action to impeach the wife's title brought by himself to set up a claim based upon an arrangement of the character he now seeks to rely upon. If authority were needed for such a proposition it would be found in the judgment of Lord Selborne in Ayerst v. Jenkins[5], and it is equally clear that the wife is entitled to assert her rights as owner, that is to say the rights incidental to her ownership against the husband as well as against a stranger, so long as it is not necessary for the purposes of her case to rely upon the fraudulent arrangement with her husband. The principle is illustrated admirably in the judgment of Mr. Justice Maclennan in Hager v. O'Neil[6], and in the decision of the Court of Appeal in Gordon v. Chief Commissioner of Metropolitan Police[7]. The appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAnglin J.\u2014I would dismiss this appeal.\nThe transfer to himself executed by the defendant as his wife's attorney transgresses one of the most elementary principles of the law of agency. It was ex facie void and should not have been registered.\nIn order to succeed the plaintiff merely requires to establish that in executing the transfer to himself of the property in question, which stood registered in her name, her husband committed a fraud on the power of attorney from her under which he professed to act. She does not have to disclose the alleged intent to defraud her husband's creditors in which her own title to the land is said to have originated, or to invoke any of the transactions tainted by that fraud. Simpson v Bloss[8]; Taylor v. Chester[9]; Clark v. Hagar[10]. It is the defendant who brings that aspect of the matter before the court in his effort to retain the fruits of his abuse of his position as his wife's attorney; and to him the maxim applies memo allegans turpitudinem suam est audiendus. Montefiori v. Montefiori[11].\nNeither does the plaintiff seek any equitable relief. The equitable maxim invoked by the defendant\u2014\"he who comes into equity must come with clean hands''\u2014is therefore inapplicable.\nNor did the defendant by making an unauthorized and illegal use of his wife's power of attorney put himself in a position to assert rights to property which the court would not have allowed him to prefer had that property remained registered in the plaintiff's name, as it was prior to his wrongful attempt to vest the legal title to it in himself.\nThe rights of the husband's creditors are not affected by this litigation, to which they are not parties. The confessedly guilty defendant cannot now shelter himself under the rights of his creditors whom he sought to defraud\u2014if indeed the creditors would be entitled to claim under the void transfer here in question.\nBrodeur J. (dissenting)\u2014This is a very sad case. This is an action between husband and wife. The husband used his wife's name to shield himself against the actions of his creditors. The properties acquired were put in his wife's name. All this was done by the husband himself under a power of attorney which he had from his wife. They both conspired together to defraud his creditors.\nIt has been found by the trial judge that the husband most brazenly lied in a suit instituted by one of his creditors to gain an advantage for his wife and himself; and that in this case the husband and wife evaded telling the truth or would not hesitate to tell falsehoods.\nThe wife in that atmosphere of purity developed, what is not surprising, an intimacy with a man named Iceton, whom she had as a boarder in her house. The husband realizing how far this intimacy would lead to, ordered this man to leave his house, but with not much success. He even found his wife and that man searching in his papers the title deeds of the properties which had been acquired. He then, using the power of attorney which he had from his wife, had the properties transferred to his own name and registered under the \"Land Titles Act.\"\nThe wife now sues him to have the properties re-transferred and registered in her name.\nHer action was dismissed by the trial judge on the ground that these properties had orginally been put in her name for the purpose of defrauding the creditors of her husband and that the courts of justice could not assist her in carrying out that fraud. Besides some creditors in the meantime have -registered claims to have the properties made available for payment of their claims; and the claims constitute a charge and lien upon the land. The trial judge decided also that the power of attorney was not wide enough to authorize the agent to transfer the lands in his name.\nThe Court of Appeal agreed with the trial judge that the power of attorney was insufficient to authorize the husband to transfer the properties in his name; but they reversed his judgment and decided that the transfers and their registration should be set aside.\nIf the husband had taken proceedings to claim that the properties in question belonged to him he could certainly not have succeeded; a man who is obliged to set up his own fraud as the basis for the granting of an equitable relief should not succeed. The wife would have been entitled to retain the property for her own use, notwithstanding that she was a party to the fraud.\nThe husband, in such a case, could not be relieved from the consequence of his actions done with intent to violate the law. In other words, the courts are always refusing to assist in any way, shape or form those who violate the law or who act fraudulently. Ex dolo malo non oritur actio. Gascoigne v. Gascoigne[12], Scheuerman v. Scheuerman[13].\nIt is disclosed in this case that the wife had conspired with her husband to deprive the creditors of the payment of their legitimate claims and that the power of attorney she gave her husband was given for the purpose of continuing the fraud intended against her husband's creditors. She seeks however to have the courts transfer to her the properties in question. It seems to me that, applying the principle mentioned in the cases above quoted, we should refuse to assist her. The properties should remain in the hands of the husband, to be sold for the payment of the legitimate claims of the husband's creditors. The appeal should be allowed with costs of this court and of the courts below and the judgment of the trial judge restored.\nMignault J.\u2014In my opinion the appeal fails.\nIt seems hopeless to contend that the husband (appellant) under the power of attorney which he held from his wife (respondent), could transfer to himself the properties standing in the land registration office in the name of his wife. His counsel could cite no authority permitting such a transfer, and it certainly cannot stand.\nThe wife's action to set aside this transfer was therefore well founded. The husband, however, resisted her action by alleging that the properties in question really belonged to him and that they had been placed in his wife's hands merely as a trustee to hold them for him. In the evidence it was disclosed that the husband, who formerly lived in Halifax, had left unsatisfied judgments there when he moved to the West, and for that reason, although these properties were purchased with his moneys or from moneys coming from a partnership in which his wife was nominally a partner, they were placed in her own name to hinder or defeat the action of the husband's creditors.\nIf the wife was a trustee for her husband to further any such purpose, the husband cannot be listened to to claim from his wife the properties thus held by her. Montefiore v. Menday Motor Components Co.[14]. To demand their return he would have to rely on an illegal contract, and this he cannot do. The wife's position is different in this sense that the properties already stand in her name and all she does or has to do is to attack the transfer which the husband made to himself under the power of attorney granted by his wife. To succeed she does not have to rely on an illegal contract, while the husband cannot get back the properties without claiming them under a contract made in furtherance of an unlawful purpose.\nI would therefore dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Irvine & Feinstein.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Hartney & Boyce.\n[1] [1921] 2 N.W.R. 963.\n[2] [1921] 1 W.W.R. 341.\n[3] [1915] 52 Can.

Consequently, in the opinion of this court, the Honourable Horace Harvey, who had been appointed Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Alberta in 1910, is still \"by law entitled to exercise and perform the jurisdiction, office and functions of the Chief Justice and President of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta\" instead of the Honourable D.

REFERENCE by the Governor General in Council of questions respecting the validity of letters patent appointing a Chief Justice of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta and a Chief Justice of the Trial Division of that court, for hearing and consideration pursuant to section 60 of the \"Supreme Court Act.\"\nThe questions so submitted are as follows:\u2014\nA Report of the Committee of the Privy Council, approved by His Excellency the Governor General on the 15th February, 1922.\nThe Committee of the Privy Council have had before them a report, dated 6th February, 1922, from the Minister of Justice, submitting herewith certified copy of the letters patent of 12th October, 1910, whereby the Honourable Horace Harvey was, as therein expressed, constituted and appointed to be The Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Alberta, with the style or title of The Chief Justice of Alberta; also certified copy of the letters patent of 15th September, 1921, whereby the said Horace Harvey was, as therein expressed, constituted and appointed to be The Chief Justice of the Trial Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta, and ex-officio a judge of the Appellate Division of the said court; also certified copy of letters patent of 15th September, 1921, whereby the Honourable David Lynch Scott was, as therein expressed, constituted and appointed to be the Chief Justice and President of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta as constituted under the \"Judicature Act\" of Alberta, chap. 3, 9 George V., as amended, and to be styled the Chief Justice of Alberta, and to be ex-officio a judge of the trial division of the said court. The following questions have arisen upon which, in the opinion of the Minister, it is advisable that Your Excellency in Council should be advised by the Supreme Court of Canada, viz.:\n1. Are the aforesaid letters patent of 15th September, 1921, nominating the said David Lynch Scott, effective to constitute and appoint him to be the Chief Justice and President of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta as constituted under the \"Judicature Act\" of Alberta, chap. 3, 9 George V., as amended, and to be styled the Chief Justice of Alberta, and to be ex-officio a judge of the Trial Division of the said court?\n2. If the last mentioned letters patent be not effective for all the purposes therein expressed, in what particular or particulars, or to what extent, are they ineffective?\n3. Are the said letters patent of 15th September, 1921, nominating the said Horace Harvey, effective to constitute and appoint him to be the Chief Justice of the Trial Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta, and ex-officio a judge of the Appellate Division of the said court?\n4. If the last mentioned letters patent be not effective for all the purposes therein expressed, in what particular or particulars, or to what extent, are they ineffective?\n5. Is the said Horace Harvey by virtue of the aforesaid letters patent of 12th October, 1910, or otherwise, constituted and appointed to be, or does he by law hold the said office of, or is he by law entitled to exercise and perform the jurisdiction, office and functions of the Chief Justice and President of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta, as constituted under the \"Judicature Act\" of Alberta, Chapter 3, 9 George V., as amended, and what judicial office or offices does he hold other than as provided by his said letters patent of 15th September, 1921?\nThe Minister therefore, recommends that the aforesaid questions be referred by Your Excellency in Council to the Supreme Court of Canada for hearing and consideration pursuant to the authority of Section 60 of the \"Supreme Court Act.\"\nThe Committee concur in the foregoing recommendation and submit the same for approval.\n(Signed) G. G. KEZAR,\nAsst. Clerk of the Privy Council.\nThe answers of the Supreme Court of Canada to these questions are printed at the end of this report.\nE. L. Newcombe K.C. for the Attorney-General of Canada.\nEug. Lafleur K.C. for the Honourable Horace Harvey.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014The questions submitted to us are five in number and ask us to advise whether, in our opinion, the letters patent issued to the Honourable David Lynch Scott of 15th September, 1921, as the Chief Justice and President of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta as constituted under the \"Judicature Act\" of Alberta, chapter 3, 9 Geo. V, as amended, are effective to so constitute him Chief Justice and President, and whether the letters patent of same date appointing the Honourable Horace Harvey Chief Justice of the Trial Division of said court are effective so as to constitute and appoint him as such Chief Justice. From the copy of the report of the Committee of the Privy Council, approved by His Excellency the Governor General, submitted to us, it appears that the Honourable Horace Harvey was by letters patent of the 12th October, 1910, appointed Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Alberta with the style and title as such Chief Justice and by letters patent of 15th September, 1921, the said Horace Harvey was constutited and appointed to be the Chief Justice of the Trial Division of such Supreme Court and ex-officio a judge of the Appellate Division of said court, whereas by letters patent of the same date the Honourable David Lynch Scott was appointed Chief Justice and President of the Appellate Division as constituted under the said \"Judicature Act\" as amended and to be styled the Chief Justice of Alberta and to be ex-officio a judge of the trial division.\nAs the Honourable Horace Harvey had never resigned his office as Chief Justice of Alberta to which he had been appointed in 1910 the submission to us was that by virtue of the amendments made to the Supreme Court Act of the province from time to time his commission as Chief Justice of the old appellate division dated in 1907 had practically come to an end by the creation of a new appellate division with new judicial officials.\nThe question immediately arose not whether he could be re-appointed as Chief Justice of the new Appellate Division for that, of course, no one questions, but whether he must necessarily receive a new commission appointing him as such Chief Justice or whether His Excellency's power on that regard was untrammelled and he could appoint any other eligible person from the bench or bar. To determine the question we had, of course, to consider all the statutes of Alberta bearing upon the creation and constitution of the Supreme Court of Alberta and its branches and divisions.\nThe Act of 9 Geo. V, chap. 3, called the \"Judicature Act, 1919,\" came into force by proclamation on the 15th day of September, 1920, on which date the letters patent or commissions in question were issued and in my judgment it is upon the proper construction of the several sections of this Act as amended by the statute of 1920, passed before the Act of 1919 was brought into force, that the question submitted to us must be answered.\nI may premise that the difficulties of reaching a firm and clear conclusion upon these questions are very great owing to the slipshod and inartistic manner in which the amendments to the Act of 1919 were framed and passed. However inartistically and loosely framed these amendments may be, there is no doubt in my mind that they indicate a clear and radical change in the intention of the legislature with respect to the Appellate Division in several important respects from the intention apparent from the sections as passed in 1919. First it was not to be a \"continuance\" of the then existing Appellate Division. Every word in the section of the Act as passed in 1919 and being amended indicating that, was struck out and secondly it was not necessarily to be presided over by the then Chief Justice of Alberta but by any eligible person of the bench or bar who his Excellency might appoint.\nThe 6th section of the Act of 1919 called \"The Judicature Act of 1919\" as originally passed read as follows: The Appellate Division shall continue to be presided over by the Chief Justice of the Court who shall continue to be styled as the Chief Justice of Alberta and shall consist of the said Chief Justice and four others of the Court to be assigned to it by His Excellency the Governor General in Council and to be called Justices of Appeal and three judges shall constitute a quorum.\nThe result of the amendment made in section 6 by the Act of 1920 made the section to read as follows:\u2014\nThe Appellate Division shall be presided over by a Chief Justice, who shall be Chief Justice of the Court and who shall be styled the Chief Justice of Alberta and shall consist of the said Chief Justice and four others of the Court to be assigned to it by His Excellency the Governor General in Council and to be called Justices of Appeal, and three judges shall constitute a quorum for hearing of appeals from any district court, but the Appellate Division when hearing such appeals may be composed of five judges. The Appellate Division shall be composed of five judges when hearing appeals from the trial division of the Supreme Court of Alberta, and in no case shall an appeal be heard by the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta when composed of four or an even number of judges.\nAnd on the day when the Act of 1919 was proclaimed as coming into force the 6th section of the Act read as I have above set out.\nThe result of that amendment was that instead of the old Appellate Division being continued and presided over by the then Chief Justice of Alberta as was expressly provided for in the Act of 1919 as originally passed, an Appellate Division of the Supreme Court was created which was to be presided over by a Chief Justice to be appointed by His Excellency the Governor General and to consist of that Chief Justice so appointed and four other judges of the court to be assigned to it by His Excellency the Governor General,\nThe Act in other words before being amended provided for the continuance of the then existing Appellate Division and that the then Chief Justice should continue to be its presiding officer while the amendment deliberately struck out the words providing for the continuance of the Appellate Division and of the continuance in office as its Chief Justice of the then existing Chief Justice and created an Appellate Division with a Chief Justice to be appointed by the Governor General who might be chosen and taken from those eligible either from the existing bench or bar. By thus expressly striking out the words that the Appellate Division should be \"continued\" and the further words providing that the existing Chief Justice should be the Chief Justice of the reconstituted Appellate Division leaving the appointment of the new Chief Justice untrammelled with His Excellency, it seems to me that the intention of the legislature was clearly not to continue the old Appellate Division but to so construct it as to create a new Appellate Division leaving the presiding officer to be any one eligible chosen by the Governor General. Further the amendment provided for an appeal to the Appellate Division from the newly constituted Trial Division and that when hearing such appeals the Appellate Division should be composed of five judges. The new and additional jurisdiction thus given to the reconstructed Appellate Division, the elimination from the section being amended of all words making the new Appellate Division a continuance of the old division and also of the words making the then Chief Justice of the court the Chief Justice of the new Appellate Division thus leaving the appointment of the new Chief Justice in His Excellency's hands untrammelled and the declaration that the Chief Justice to be appointed and four other judges of the court to be assigned to it by His Excellency the Governor General and to be called Justices of Appeals should constitute the Appellate Division, thus abolishing the old plan of the judges in a body selecting yearly these four judges combine to satisfy me that the Appellate Division so established was a new division with new judicial offices and some additional functions. It is strongly argued that such a construction is at variance with sections 3 and 5 which read as follows:\u2014\n3.\u2014There shall continue to be in and for the province a superior court of civil and criminal jurisdiction known as \"The Supreme Court of Alberta.\n***\n5.\u2014The Court shall continue to consist of two branches or divisions which shall be designated respectively \"The Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta,\" and \"The Trial Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta.\"\nI respectfully submit there is no real or necessary inconsistency between these two sections and the amended section 6. Indeed it may be said they rather support the argument as to the intention of the legislature not to leave it open to the slightest doubt that the \"Supreme Court of Alberta\" was continued but that it should thereafter consist of two branches or divisions respectively designated as the Appellate Division and the Trial Division, and with the respective jurisdictions and appointees assigned to each, and emphasizing such intention of creating a new division by striking out the word \"continue\" in two places of the section and by further expressly striking out the words of the section amended which provided for the former Chief Justice continuing as President of the Appellate Division,\nHaving reached this conclusion I would answer the first question and the third question in the affirmative and question 5 in the negative. Questions 2 and 4 do not require any answer in view of my answers to questions 1, 3 and 5. Idington J.\u2014The Province of Alberta was established by 4 and 5 Ed. VII., ch. 3, assented to 20th July, 1905, and known as \"The Alberta Act,\" which came into force on the 1st day of September, 1905.\nPrior thereto it had formed part of the North West Territories and fell within the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of the said Territories.\nThe Legislature of Alberta was, by said Act, given power for all purposes affecting or extending said province to abolish said court. That power does not seem to have been exercised until the Supreme Court was constituted by the legislature of that province acting within its powers under said \"Alberta Act,\" and the \"British North America Act,\" section 92, item 14 thereof, by the enactment of 7 Edw. VII., to be cited as \"The Supreme Court Act.\"\nSection 5 of said Act declared that the said court\nshall consist of a Chief Justice who shall be styled the Chief Justice of Alberta and four puisne Judges who shall be called the justices of the court.\nThe power of appointment of said Chief Justice and puisne judges rested, as it always has done in like cases, under sec. 96 of said \"British North America Act,\" with the Governor-General, and appointments were duly made pursuant thereto of the Chief Justice and puisne judges as specified by the said \"Supreme Court Act.\"\nThe appellate work of the court was referred to as en banc according to ancient form of speech, and it would seem to have been left to the judges to arrange amongst themselves who should sit en banc and who attend to nisi prius work, observing, however, the term times for en banc sittings fixed in regard to time and place by the Lieutenant Governor in Council, as required by section 30 of the said \"Supreme Court Act.\" That condition of things (save as to an amendment in 1908 increasing the number of puisne judges to five instead of four) existed when, on the resignation of the then Chief Justice, the late Honourable A. L. Sifton, the then Honourable Horace Harvey, a puisne judge of said court, was appointed to succeed him in 1910 as Chief Justice.\nIn 1913 tentative amendments were made and part thereof repealed and parts left to be brought into force by proclamation and the net result was that the power was given the Lieutenant Governor in Council at the second session of 1913 to proclaim an increase in the number of puisne judges from five to six, seven or eight, and, in January 1914, by proclamation the desired increase to eight was brought into effect.\nIn March following, another proclamation brought into effect subsection 2 of sec. 38 of ch. 9 of the Statutes of Alberta, 1913 (first session) being an amendment to sec. 30 of the \"Supreme Court Act.\"\nThat amendment was as follows:\n(2) by repealing sec. 30 and substituting therefor the following: 30. The court en banc shall be known as the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court and shall sit at such times and places as the judges of the court shall determine and three judges shall constitute a quorum.\n(2) The judges of the Supreme Court shall, during the month of December, and at such other times as may be convenient, select four of their number to constitute the Appellate Division for the next ensuing calendar year, but every other judge of the said court shall be ex officio a member of the Appellate Division.\n(3) The terms \"court en banc\" or \"court sitting en banc,\" and \"Appellate Division\" wherever used in this or any other Act or in any rules made thereunder, shall be deemed to be interchangeable and to have the same meaning.\nThe enabling the judges to fix their own term times, instead of being dependent as previously on the directions of the Lieutenant Governor in Council, and to distribute their work for the coming year, one can easily understand, but the mere changing of the name of the division would seem absolutely unimportant unless to keep up with the fashions of modern times.\nBut for the stress laid upon it by counsel in argument herein I should not have thought it worth mentioning.\nIf memory serves me correctly, he was under the impression that the rest of the court was at the same time designated the \"Trial Division\" which was not the case until the Act of 1919, presently to be referred to.\nNo change in the jurisdiction nor change in the organization of the court seems to have been pointed to as in contemplation at that stage in the history of the legislation we are concerned with.\nThe word \"court'' used in that connection is, by the interpretation clause of the Act the \"Supreme Court.\"\nSuch being the condition of things there was enacted in 1919 an Act styled, by sec. 1 thereof, \"The Judicature Act\" which in its growth gives rise to our present troubles.\nIt does not profess to be a consolidation of Acts relative to the Supreme Court, nor does it begin by recognizing the existence of that court but, on the contrary, after giving the name of the Act as just stated, and in sec. 2 an interpretation clause, by sec. 3 enacts as follows:\nThere shall continue to be in and for the province a superior court of civil and criminal jurisdiction known as \"The Supreme Court of Alberta.\"\nIt is to be observed that this enactment is under the caption of \"Constitution of court\" and clearly refrains from continuing the Supreme Court then existent, and instead of doing so declares there shall continue to be a Supreme Court of civil and criminal jurisdiction. That circumstance, in connection with much else to be presently referred to, suggests a clear intention not to continue the then existing court.\nIt is the intrepretation and construction of this \"Judicature Act,\" and amendments thereto, before it was brought into effect by proclamation as provided by the Act itself, as to which we are now interrogated.\nThe questions raised thereby are whether or not the legislature had created a new court or courts, to which the Dominion Government was entitled to appoint judges, or created new judicial offices which the said Government was entitled to fill.\nThe 6th section of the \"Judicature Act\" above referred to as originally enacted, reads as follows:\n6. The Appellate Division shall continue to be presided over by the Chief Justice of the Court, who shall continue to be styled the Chief Justice of Alberta, and shall consist of the said Chief Justice and four other judges of the court to be assigned to it by His Excellency the Governor in Council and to be called Justices of Appeal and three judges shall constitute a quorum.\nThat, which clearly contemplated the continuation of the then Chief Justice as such and his filling the new office, was amended before the proclamation was issued bringing the said \"Judicature Act\" into effect, by ch. 3, sec. 2, of the Statutes of Alberta, 1920, as follows:\nSec. 6 is amended as follows:\n(a) by striking out the words \"continue to\" where the same occur in Unes 1, 2 and 3 thereof, and by striking out the expression \"of the court\" where the same occurs in line two thereof; and by striking out the first 'the\" in the second line thereof, and substituting in lieu thereof the article \"a.\"\n(b) by striking out the words \"three judges shall constitute a quorum\" where the same occur in the seventh line thereof, and substituting the following in lieu thereof:\u2014 Three judges shall constitute a quorum for the hearing of appeals from any district court, but the Appellate Division, when hearing such appeals, may be composed of five judges. The Appellate Division shall be composed of five judges when hearing appeals from the Trial Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta and in no case shall an appeal be heard by the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta when composed of four or an even number of judges.\nThat in turn was amended the same year, 1920, before the proclamation bringing the said \"Judicature Act\" into effect was issued, as follows:\u2014\n(1) By adding after the article \"a\" in the 6th line of subsection (a) of section 2, the following: \"and by adding thereto after the words ''Chief Justice\" in the second line thereof, the expression \"who shall be Chief Justices of the Court and.\"\nThus the said section was made to read at the date of said proclamation as follows:\nThe Appellate Division shall be presided over by a Chief Justice, who shall be Chief Justice of the court and who shall be styled the Chief Justice of Alberta, and shall consist of the said Chief Justice and four other judges of the court to be assigned to it by His Excellency the Governor General in Council and to be called Justices of Appeal, and three judges shall constitute a quorum for the hearing of appeals from any district court, but the Appellate Division, when hearing such appeals, may be composed of five judges. The Appellate Division shall be composed of five judges when hearing appeals from the Trial Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta, and in no case shall an appeal be heard by the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta when composed of four or an even number of judges.\nThe said \"Judicature Act\" thus, and otherwise, amended was duly declared by proclamation, on the 15th of August, 1921, to come into force and effect on, from and after the 15th of September, 1921.\nThe other amendments, though substantial, have no important bearing on what we are concerned with herein.\nThe 59th section of the \"Judicature Act,\" enacted as follows:\n59. The \"Judicature Ordinance,\" being ch. 21 of the Consolidated Ordinances, 1898, and the \"Supreme Court Act,\" being ch. 3 of the Acts of 1907, and all amendments of the said Ordinance and Act, are hereby repealed. I submit that by said repealing section of the said Act, all the legislation effective prior to the 15th September, relevant to the Supreme Court of Alberta, was rendered nul, and in effect the said court was abolished as the legislature had power to do if it saw fit.\nThe only use such legislation thus drastically repealed could thereafter serve was as a possible historical means of helping to interpret the actual meaning of the \"Judicature Act,\" so brought into effect.\nThe clear meaning of the language used in said section 6 of the \"Judicature Act,\" as finally amended, as I read it, was to constitute the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta a new court of appeal requiring the appointment of a Chief Justice thereof and that when he was appointed he would be styled the Chief Justice of Alberta.\nThe party chosen for such position might be he who had been under the \"Supreme Court Act\" styled Chief Justice of Alberta, or any other person qualified by law to accept such a position. On such appointment the party so appointed would thereby become but not otherwise entitled to be styled such Chief Justice.\nIt seems to me in face of the several legislative attempts to make, by the amendment above quoted clear the purpose of the legislature, idle to contend that such was not the intention of the legislature, whatever may be urged as to the exact extent of the effect of the repealing section 59, which I quote above.\nThe Dominion Government evidently acted upon one or other of these interpretations, and proceeded upon the assumption that the new Court of Appeal and the new Trial Division, each required the appointment of a Chief Justice and as to the Court of Appeal, new puisne judges, and appointed accordingly Mr. Justice Scott to be Chief Justice of the Appellate Division and Chief Justice Harvey to be Chief Justice of the Trial Division, and reappointed some of those previously named to serve as puisne judges of the Trial Division.\nIt is stated that each accepted the respective position thus assigned to him, except the Honourable Mr. Justice Harvey who has declined so far as to refrain from taking the required oath of office, yet has continued to act as a judge.\nHis status on which he relies for his present contention was expressed thus by sec. 5 of the \"Supreme Court Act.\"\nThe court shall consist of a Chief Justice who shall be styled \"The Chief Justice of Alberta,\" etc.\nThe oath of office prescribed by sec. 7 of said Act which he presumably took, reads as follows:\nI, * * * solemnly and sincerely promise and swear that I will duly and faithfully, and to the best of my skill and knowledge, exercise the powers and trusts reposed in me as Chief Justice (or one of the puisne judges) of the Supreme Court. So help me God.\nThat oath, it is to be observed, makes no mention of the style now so much relied upon and, I respectfully submit, having been swept away by the repealing section above quoted before the present divisional courts could come into existence, is a rather slender thread to rely upon.\nFive months later we are asked the questions I will presently refer to.\nCounsel for Chief Justice Harvey in his factum remarks in dealing with the changes of sec. 6, upon the want of modification of sections 3, 4, 5, 7 and 9, of the statute of 1919. Sec. 3 I have already dealt with by pointing out that the legislature seems to have purposely abstained from continuing the then existing Supreme Court and, I may add, did so in light of the very different mode of treatment given by prior legislation relative to the Supreme Court of the North West Territories, when superseded by the creation of the Supreme Court of Alberta.\nFor many reasons apart from the situation we are confronted with it seems to me that example demanded some provisions which have not been made.\nSection 4 is simply another illustration of same spirit. Both show a determination to ignore the possibly continued existence of the old Supreme Court of Alberta, and detract from the force sought in such suggestion.\nSection 5 continues two branches or divisions of the court constituting one the Appellate Division and the other the Trial Division.\nAs a matter of fact, there always existed two classes of duties to be performed by the judges of the Supreme Court, but not until this Act of 1919 was there any such description given legislatively of a Trial Division.\nIt is brought into existence as a distinct entity by that Act, and the word \"continue\" is simply one of the many absurdities to be found in this legislation.\nThere was nothing in fact continued, but an existent duty was given over to a new court, called, in section 7, for the first time \"Trial Division.\"\nI fail to see how that helps in any way unless to uphold the action of the Dominion Government of which counsel complains.\nSection 9, when read in light of the amendments made to sec. 6 before it was brought into force and the plain language thereof especially when we consider sec. 59 had obliterated all styles resting upon prior legislation, clearly is consistent also with said action. It is contended, however, that said section 6 as it stands amended, when brought into effect, constituted him who had been heretofore styled \"Chief Justice of Alberta, \"the actual Chief Justice of the new Appellate Division, and hence to continue to be styled the \"Chief Justice of Alberta.\"\nIn other words, despite the several amendments to the contrary so clearly designed to remove any possibility of such being held to have been the intention of the legislature, we are asked to Say that such amendments must be treated as null. One of the alleged reasons for such contention is that he had been theretofore styled the Chief Justice of Alberta.\nHe had been so styled, but only by virtue of the \"Supreme Court Act\" so directing; but that Act and all else bearing upon such a question was repealed the moment that the \"Judicature Act\" came into force on the 15th September, 1921.\nFrom the earliest hour of that date, according to Alberta time, he ceased to be entitled any longer to be so styled.\nThe Act must be read as of the date when it came into force unless there is in it some clear intention to the contrary, which is not the case.\nAgain it is submitted by counsel for the Minister of Justice and I think quite correctly, that any attempt by the legislature to dictate to His Excellency who should be appointed to hold the new judicial office, would have been ultra vires.\nIndeed I should not be surprised to learn that the discovery thereof was the reason for the numerous changes made in said section 6, for as it stood originally it was clearly open to that objection. And as to the question of styling the head of the new court, or if you will, him called to fill the new judicial office created, the Chief Justice of the province, that is entirely within the power of the legislature.\nI was at first blush disposed to look upon that as emanating from the Royal Prerogative exercised on behalf of the Dominion, but on considering the matter fully I find nothing to found such a pretension upon, for section 96 of the B.N.A. Act limits the power of His Excellency the Governor General to merely nominating him who is to fill the office as created by the legislature.\nAll that legislation can do relevant to the creation or constitution or recreation or reorganization or abolition of the court, rests with the legislature except the nomination of the person to fill the office which alone rests with the Governor General of the Dominion as advised by his ministers.\nWhat has been done in that regard cannot now be undone by anything we may say herein for in answering such interrogatories, we and all concerned, I most respectfully submit, must never forget a single sentence contained in the judgment of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in the case of Attorney-General for Ontario v. The Attorney-General for Canada[1], wherein that court said:\nBut the answers are only advisory and will have no more effect than the opinion of the law officers.\nI have no doubt that the Alberta Legislature aimed at having, as Ontario long had had, and other provinces later, a new Court of Appeal separated from that dealing with the other work of its Supreme Court As now constituted the judges of either division are qualified ex officio to sit in the other, but, I assume, only to be made available in case of possible necessity.\nI submit these suggestions as probably explaining what was aimed at and hence helping to illuminate the language used.\nI may be permitted here to say that I prefer the method adopted in British Columbia, and betimes in Ontario, to that adopted by the Alberta legislature, to produce substantially the same result. In the first named of these the legislature whilst creating a court of appeal and, of course, styling the head thereof \"Chief Justice\" of the new court, preserve the title of Chief Justice of the province to him who then filled it and, on his vacating the place, to be passed on to the head of the appellate court.\nYet I must look at the case presented purely as a matter of law free from all such sentiment, and try to realize what those concerned were in truth about.\nIt cannot, I submit, be contended for a moment that the legislature could not have created a new appellate court and eliminated from the jurisdiction of the Chief Justice, and all other judges of the old Supreme Court, all the appellate powers it had theretofore exercised, and then leave him and them no other powers than those of trial judges.\nThat in effect is all the legislature, I imagine, really desired to bring about.\nBy the united efforts of the respective executives of the Dominion and of Alberta acting in harmony, that is all that has transpired.\nThe same result as I have pointed out could have been reached by pursuing another and possibly better method, at all events by some one of the several methods I have mentioned as adopted in other provinces. It is not my desire to criticize herein, but to try to realize from the past history of our country and its several provinces the probably justifiable object the legislature had in view, and then give to a rather peculiar growth of six years in way of legislation the exact measure of vitality it was intended to have.\nApproached in such a mood and attitude as such considerations are likely to produce, the contention set up by able counsel seems to me rather an undue strain upon the English language.\nClearly there were to be two courts where only one existed before, and two Chief Justices to be appointed.\nIt was then thrown upon the Dominion Executive to select him it chose for each respectively.\nWe have no facts stated relative to how this duty was to be discharged, though we may suspect or indeed infer from the remarkable coincidence of events which took place, that it was well understood between the two Executives concerned that the old Chief Justice and such of his puisne judges as the Dominion Executive chose to fill the positions they respectively were chosen to fill, should be effected by such a manner as would substantially protect them and the due administration of justice at the same time.\nClearly it so happens that some men are by nature and attainments better fitted for appellate courts than trial courts, and vice versa.\nThe salaries allotted the new Chief Justices were, we are told, in each case to be the same.\nIt may be pointed out that this is not the first instance on record of a legislature having taken upon itself to change the status of judicial officers, for I find that in pre-confederation days, though the old \"Court of Error and Appeal Act,\" chapter 13 of the Consolidated Statutes of Upper Canada, by section 5 thereof, had declared that the Chief Justice of the Queen's Bench, for the time being, and the judge entitled to precedence over all other judges should preside, yet by 24 Vic., ch. 36, sec. 1 that was repealed. Much stress seemed to be put by counsel for Chief Justice Harvey upon the fact that uncertainty as to the tenure of the position of Chief Justice of Alberta may be attended with serious consequences, inasmuch as important powers are conferred upon the Chief Justice of that court, the exercise of which by an incompetent judge might lead to serious consequences, and he cites the example of the \"Bankruptcy Act\" assigning the power to the Chief Justice to make the appointments to certain officers in certain contingencies.\nI should have thought that the doctrine of de facto applied to any officer would relieve any person so embarrassed and should be surprised if any one thought of applying to any one else than Chief Justice Scott.\nBut if that is not enough, clearly the true remedy must be that applied in the cases of Buckley v. Edwards[2], and McCawley v. The King[3], instead of the adoption of the opinion of this court as mere law officers of the Crown as intimated in the case cited above, which surely cannot be held especially if divided as entitled to override the opinions of the law officers of the Crown who presumably must have held in line with what I have concluded was the correct course.\nFor the foregoing reasons I would answer the first question in the affirmative. Hence the second needs no answer. I would also answer the third question in the affirmative, and the fourth I would answer by saying that his being ex officio a judge of the Appellate Division of the said court only qualifies him to act in the place or stead of some member of the court not being able to take the place to which he or his successor may have been assigned.\nThe fifth question I would answer in the negative and that he holds only the office provided by his said letters patent of 15th September, 1921.\nDuff J.\u2014The fundamental question raised by the present reference is this: Had the amendments of 1919 (9 Geo. V., ch. 3) and 1920 (ch. 3, s. 2 and c. 4, s. 43) the effect of abolishing the office of Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the Supreme Court of Alberta, an office created by the Supreme Court Act of 1907? If the office still exists then The Honourable Mr. Harvey is still the incumbent of it and he is also the President of the Appellate Division because the intention of the statutes mentioned is indubitably that the two offices shall be held by one and the same person.\nThe statutes of 1920 by their terms were to come into force on proclamation and they were passed as amendments of the statute of 1919 which was also to come into force on proclamation. The proclamation by which they became operative is dated 11th August, 1921. I shall speak of these statutes by reference to their respective dates.\nNow the statutes of 1913 (4 Geo. V, ch. 9) and 1919 (as originally framed) although they made some changes in relation to the functioning of the Supreme Court left quite unaffected most important matters of substance. 1st, the Supreme Court itself was not abolished\u2014the legislation did not create a new Supreme Court bearing the old name; secs. 2 and 3 of the statute of 1919 which were left untouched by the Act of 1920 demonstrate this; 2nd, in the division of the court into two branches effected by these Acts (of 1913 and 1919) the legislation does not appear to have proceeded by the way of the creation of new judicial offices save in respect of two matters which are not relevant to the present discussion\u2014the provisions made for a Chief Justice of the Trial Division and an additional judge of the Supreme Court.\nAn examination of the pertinent sections seems to give this result. Section 30 of the Act of 1913 which first authorized the designation \"Appellate Division\" provides simply that such shall be the designation by which the \"Court en banc\" shall be known; and by sub-section 3 of that section it is declared in terms that the phrases \"Court en banc\" and \"Appellate Division\" shall have the same meaning in that very statute of 1913 as well as elsewhere. By the Act of 1919 an important provision is introduced touching the selection of judges for duty in the \"Appellate Division\" and the weight and significance of this circumstance must of course be considered; but the phraseology of secs. 2, 3, 5, 10 and 28 shews that the legislature in using the designation Appellate Division was still applying it to the Supreme Court of Alberta sitting en banc.\nBy section 5, for example, it is enacted that \"the Court\" that is to say, the existing Supreme Court of Alberta, which when sitting en banc is, by force of the Act of 1913, known as the \"Appellate Division,\"\nshall continue to consist of two branches or divisions.\nIn section 6 the form of words used is\nthe Appellate Division shall continue to be presided over by the Chief Justice of Alberta, a turn of phrase implying an intention to preserve the identity of the Appellate Division; section 10 provides that all the judges of the Supreme Court shall ex officio be members, with equal jurisdiction, power and authority, of both divisions; and finally, by section 28 it is declared again that the terms \"Court en banc\" and \"Appellate Division\" wherever\nused in any Act or Ordinance * * * shall be deemed to have the same meaning.\nThese features of the statute afford good reasons for thinking that the legislature was not in 1913 or in 1919 erecting a new court under the existing style of the \"Appellate Division;\" and that in providing for the assignment of judges of the Supreme Court to duty in that Division the statute does not contemplate the establishment of new judicial offices.\nAs inconsistent with this view of the statute it is pointed out that the four judges who, under section 6 of the Act of 1919, together with the Chief Justice normally constitute the Appellate Division, are to be\nassigned to it by His Excellency the Governor General in Council\nand this provision is relied upon as giving support to the contention that the office of judge of that court is a new judicial office created by this statute. I may say at once, that\u2014after examining the indicia afforded by this legislation for determining the true character of this section (I am speaking now of the section as passed in 1919) whether, that is to say, in the context in which it is found it ought to be read as prescribing the duties or providing machinery for prescribing the duties appertaining to judicial offices already existing (or created by enactment aliunde) or on the other hand as establishing a new judicial tribunal or a new judicial office\u2014I think on the whole those indicia point rather directly to the conclusion that the office of the section is limited to making provision for the administration and exercise of the judicial duties and powers of the existing court, and the judges of that court. One consideration weighs very powerfully with me; and it is that arising from the circumstance that while the judges other than the Chief Justice constituting the Appellate Division are to be named by the Governor in Council, these judges are to be chosen\u2014that I think is the meaning of the section\u2014from among persons who are already judges of the Supreme Court of Alberta. If the office of judge of that court were a new judicial office the appointment by force of section 100 of the B.N.A. Act would rest with the Governor in Council and I am unaware of any authority possessed by a province to regulate the exercise of the Dominion authority in relation to judicial appointments by prescribing the class of persons from whom the appointees to judicial office shall be selected. The provision moreover for assignment by the Governor in Council would be pointless unless it be, as apparently it is, intended as an invitation by the legislature to the Governor in Council to act on its behalf in performing that duty.\nThe Act of 1919, that is to say the Act which received the Royal -assent in the year 1919 as ch. 3 was by its terms, as already mentioned, not to come into force until after proclamation; and before proclamation two statutes were passed (in the year 1920) amending sections 2 and 6 of this Act of 1919. The effect of this amendment of section 6 was that for the section so numbered as it stood in the statute as originally passed in the year 1919, the following was substituted:\u2014 The Appellate Division shall be presided over by a Chief Justice, who shall be Chief Justice of the court and who shall be styled the Chief Justice of Alberta, and shall consist of the said Chief Justice and four other judges of the court to be assigned to it by His Excellency the Governor General in Council and to be called Justices of Appeal, and three judges shall constitute a quorum for the hearing of appeals from any district court, but the Appellate Division, when hearing such appeals, may be composed of five judges. The Appellate Division shall be composed of five judges when hearing appeals from the Trial Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta, and in no case shall an appeal be heard by the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta when composed of four or an even number of judges.\nThe language of this section undoubtedly lends some colour to the contention that the legislature had in view the creation of a new office of Chief Justice of the Appellate Division, the incumbent of which should be ex officio the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court in substitution for the old office of Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, the incumbent of which under the statute of 1919 as originally passed would have been the ex officio President of the Appellate Division. But it must be remembered that sections 3, 5, 9, 10 and 28 of the Act as amended in 1920 stand as they originally stood in the Act of 1919 as conditionally passed in that year; that the Appellate Division is still, after the amendments of 1920, the Supreme Court of Alberta sitting en banc; that it is the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court who, by section 9, takes rank and precedence over all the judges of any court in the province and not the Chief Justice of the Appellate Division; and that in the Act even as it now stands there is no office formally designated in terms as that of the Chief Justice of the Appellate Division. And although section 6 in the form it assumes under the amendments of 1920 is capable of a construction according to which the then existing office of Chief Justice of the Supreme Court would cease to exist, that is not the necessary meaning of the words used. And the other construction, that which regards the whole section in so far forth as pertains to the office of Chief Justice (as well as in other respects) as an enactment designed to make provision for the distribution and assignment of judicial duties among existing judicial offices or judicial offices elsewhere provided for seems to accord better with the general tenour of the statute of which it is a part.\nThe answers which I think should be returned to the questions submitted are these:\u2014\nTo question No. 1:\u2014No.\nTo question No. 2:\u2014Wholly inoperative.\nTo question No. 3:\u2014No.\nTo question No. 4:\u2014Wholly inoperative.\nTo question No. 5:\u2014He is Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Alberta and as such is entitled by law to perform and exercise the jurisdiction, office and functions of Chief Justice and President of the Appellate Division.\nAngltn J.\u2014Seldom has the embarassment which may be occasioned by requiring this court to answer any question that the executive department of the Government may see fit to propound for its consideration and opinion been so forcibly brought to our attention as in the reference now before us. The court is called upon to express its opinion as to the status of two gentlemen on behalf of each of whom it is asserted that he holds the highest judicial office of the province of Alberta under letters patent from His Excellency, the Governor-General. Unfortunately only one of them has been represented before us by counsel, the other, although duly notified, having, as was his right, declined to appear. Nor is our embarrassment materially lessened because our\nanswers are only advisory and will have no more effect than the opinions of the law officers.\nBut the right of the Governor in Council to refer questions to this court touching any matter in regard to which he may see fit to do so, and our duty to consider and answer questions so referred (\"Supreme Court Act,\" s. 60) are conclusively settled, Attorney-General for Ontario v. Attorney-General for Canada[4]. A suggestion made by their Lordships of the Judicial Committee that the court may point out in its answer considerations which render difficult the discharge of the duty imposed upon it or that the answer itself is of little value, or may make representations to the Governor-in-Council looking to the withdrawal of the reference in whole or in part (p. 589) would seem, with respect, to have little practical value.\nThe facts out of which the questions referred in the present case have arisen are fully stated in the opinion of my brother Mignault. I shall not repeat them. The answers to these questions I think depend upon whether the Alberta \"Judicature Act\" of 1919 (9 Geo. V, c. 3), as amended in 1920 (c. 3, s. 2 and c. 4, s. 43), should be regarded as having created a new Supreme Court for that province, or, at least, an entire new set of judicial officers, or should be deemed to have continued the existing Supreme Court and judicial officers, merely adding to the number of the latter and creating an additional Chief Justiceship. The constitutional validity of the statute has not been challenged. The question argued at bar was one of construction\u2014what was the intention of the legislature as expressed in the several enactments? In view of the tenure of judicial office (s. 99 of the B.N.A. Act) I should be disposed to hold that the Alberta \"Judicature Act\" of 1919 as amended, had either the effect of abolishing the existing Supreme Court of Alberta and creating in its stead a new court under the same name, or of doing away with the existing judicial offices and substituting therefor new judgeships of the same class, only if it does not reasonably admit of another construction.\nFar from that being the case, however, it seems to me that another construction is not merely quite possible but is much more probably that intended by the legislature.\nI regard it as hot arguable that, as enacted in 1919, the Alberta \"Judicature Act\" did aught else than continue the existing Supreme Court with its existing judicial officers, by s. 6 assigning to one of them\u2014the Chief Justice of Alberta\u2014by his title of office, the duty of presiding over the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court and entrusting to the Governor General in Council the selection of four of the puisne judges who should, with the Chief Justice of Alberta, ordinarily constitute the membership of that division of the court. As amended in 1920 this may not so clearly be the purpose and effect of s. 6. Indeed, Mr. Newcombe strongly pressed that these amendments predicate an, intention to create five appellate judgeships as new positions to be filled by the Governor General in Council. It may be a little difficult to assign another purpose to the amendments. But no mere implication can suffice to overcome the explicit term of s. 3 that\nthere shall continue to be * * * a superior court of civil and criminal jurisdiction known as \"The Supreme Court of Alberta,\"\nand of s. 5 that the court (i.e. the existing court continued by s. 3) shall continue to consist of two branches or divisions which shall be designated respectively the \"Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta\" and \"The Trial Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta.\"\nSec. 6 as amended must be read and construed with sections 3 and 5, which remain as they were enacted in 1919. These provisions, in my opinion, make it quite impossible to contend successfully either that a new Supreme Court was established or that new divisions of that court were constituted. The existing court and the existing divisions are expressly \"continued\"\u2014one of them retaining the name given to it at its birth in 1914, \"The Appellate Division\" (4 Geo. V., ch. 9, sec. 38; 4 Geo. V., 2nd sess., c. 2, s. 11; Alberta Gazette Vol. X, pp. 164-5), and the other, likewise born in 1914 and existing since that date, as is evidenced by s. 5 of the Act of 1919, being by that section christened for the first time \"The Trial Division.\"\nIt is, I think, equally impossible to maintain that all the existing judicial positions in the Supreme Court were abolished and eleven new Supreme Court Judgeships created. If that had been the case, all the judges theretofore in office might have been superseded and a judiciary consisting of an entirely new personnel appointed by the Governor General in Council. Is it conceivable that the legislature intended to create a situation admitting of such a possibility? Again, although the judges theretofore in office should be reappointed, the former Chief Justice of Alberta might have been appointed a puisne judge and two of his former puisnes, or it may be the two additional judges provided for by the Act of 1919, appointed to the two Chief Justiceships. If a new court was constituted, or wholly new judicial positions were created by the legislation of 1919, as amended in 1920, it was undoubtedly the right of the Governor General in Council to select whom he would (subject, it may be, to prescribed requirements of qualification) to fill those positions. It was not competent for the provincial legislature to place any restriction upon the freedom of choice.\nI am of the opinion that the existing Supreme Court, the existing two divisions of that court and the existing judicial positions were continued by the Alberta \"Judicature Act,\" 1919-1920, and that the only new offices thereby created to which the Governor in Council was authorized to make appointments were the Chief Justiceship of the Trial Division and an additional puisne judgeship of the Supreme Court. Placing on s. 6, as amended, a construction in harmony with secs. 3 and 5 and within the competence of a provincial legislature, I read it as assigning to the Chief Justice of Alberta for the time being the duty of presiding over the Appellate Division, and to four of the nine puisne judges provided for, to be nominated by the Governor General in Council, the duty of sitting as ordinary members of that Division. To the Chief Justiceship of the Trial Division and to one of the nine puisne judgeships, as new positions the appointment lay exclusively with the Governor General in Council, subject, however, to this restriction, that the same person could not fill the two Chief Justiceships for which the \"Judicature Act\" provides.\nIt follows that the position of Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Alberta, with the style and title of the Chief Justice of Alberta, to which the Hon. Horace Harvey was appointed by letters patent of the 12th October, 1910, still exists and continues to be filled by that gentleman, he having neither resigned nor been removed from office by competent authority. While holding that office he was not eligible for appointment as Chief Justice of the Trial Division.\nI would for these reasons respectfully return the following answers to the questions referred by His Excellency in Council:\n(1) No; (2) Wholly; (3) No; (4) Wholly; (5) (a) Yes; (b) Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Alberta with the style and title of the Chief Justice of Alberta.\nBrodeur J.\u2014Five questions have been submitted to us by the Governor in Council under the provisions of sec. 60 of the \"Supreme Court Act.\"\nWe are called upon to give our opinion on the effect of the letters patent of the 12th October, 1910, nominating The Honourable Horace Harvey Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Alberta and on the effect of the letters patent of 15th September, 1921, nominating the same Mr. Justice Harvey, Chief Justice of the Trial Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta, and the Hon. D. L. Scott, Chief Justice and President of the Appellate Division of the same Supreme Court.\nThe effect and validity of these different letters patent depends very largely upon the construction of the statutes concerning the Supreme Court of Alberta and upon the respective powers of the federal and provincial authorities concerning the constitution, maintenance and organization of provincial courts and the appointment of judges of these courts.\nThe legislature of Alberta created in 1907 (7 Edw. VII ch. 3) \"The Supreme Court of Alberta\" which consisted of a Chief Justice and of a certain number of puisne judges, and determined that the Chief Justice (s. 6) who should be designated as Chief Justice of Alberta, should have rank of precedence over all other judges of any court in the province and should preside when the court sitting en banc (sec. 31) would hear appeals from any decision of any judge of the Supreme Court.\nIn 1910, Mr. Justice Harvey was appointed by the federal government to fill the position of Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Alberta.\nIn 1913, the legislature of the province enacted that the court en banc should be known as the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court. In 1919, a \"Judicature Act\" was passed declaring (sec. 3) that\nthere shall continue to be in and for the province a superior court of civil and criminal jurisdiction known as the Supreme Court of Alberta,\nand that the court should continue to consist of two branches or divisions which shall be designated as the Appellate Division and the Trial Division (sec. 5).\nIt was declared in sec. 6 of that ''Judicature Act\" that the Appellate Division should continue to be presided over by the Chief Justice of the court and by four other judges who should be assigned to it by the Governor General in Council.\nThis section six was amended twice in 1920 and reads now as follows:\nThe Appellate Division shall be presided over by a Chief Justice, who shall be Chief Justice of the court and who shall be styled the Chief Justice of Alberta, and shall consist of the said Chief Justice and four other judges of the court to be assigned to.it by His Excellency the Governor-General in Council and to be called Justices of Appeal, and three judges shall constitute a quorum for the hearing of appeals from any district court, but the Appellate Division, when hearing such appeals, may be composed of five judges. The Appellate Division shall be composed of five judges when hearing appeals from the Trial Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta, and in no case shall an appeal be heard by the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta when composed of four or an even number of judges. We have no information before us to the reasons why section 6 was amended in 1920, but I presume by, what has been contended by Mr. Newcombe at the argument that the federal government found in this original section 6 an encroachment upon its right to appoint the judges of the provincial courts.\nI fail to see, however, how section 6 as originally enacted could be considered as ultra vires.\nBy the B.N.A. Act (sec. 92, s.s. 14) the constitution and organization of the courts are within the domain of the provincial legislature. The legislature of Alberta had then the power to create a Supreme Court and to determine that it could be presided over by a Chief Justice whose powers and rank in its branches and divisions could be fixed by the provincial authorities.\nOn the other hand, it was for the federal authorities to determine whom they would select for the position of Chief Justice of the Supreme Court. In the exercise of its power, the federal government had in 1910 appointed Mr. Justice Harvey as the Chief Justice of this court and according to the B.N.A. Act, Mr. Justice Harvey would hold such office and could not be removed therefrom except on address of the Senate and House of Commons or unless the provincial legislature would abolish the court or the office.\nIt is no wonder then that in 1919, when the provincial legislature intended to call with specific names the trial and appellate divisions which practically existed before, it declared that the Appellate Division which was naturally more important than the other, should continue to have as its presiding officer the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court. The right to regulate and provide for the whole machinery for the proper administration of civil justice in its widest sense is with the provincial legislatures subject to the appointing power of the federal government and subject to the reserved power for the federal Parliament to create certain additional courts (sec. 101). The powers and authority of these judges is to be determined by the province; and once a person was appointed Chief Justice of a court he could not be removed except on the recommendation of the Senate and the House of Commons. On the other hand, this Chief Justice could see his powers and authority curtailed by the provincial legislature and even the court of which he is a member, or his title or both could be abolished by the province. At the same time, the province could extend his powers and authority in connection with the administration the same as the provincial legislature could impose additional authority or powers on the other judges.\nThe legislature of Alberta, in my opinion, had the power to state that the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court appointed by the federal authorities could continue to preside over the more important of the divisions of this court.\nSection 6 of the Act of 1919 as originally drawn was then intra vires.\nBut the legislature found it advisable to amend sec. 6 and to declare that the Appellate Division would be presided over\nby a Chief Justice who shall be Chief Justice of the court and who shall be styled the Chief Justice of Alberta.\nIt is contended that this amendment gave the authority to the Governor in Council to select any person to act as Chief Justice of the Appellate Division. This contention has undoubtedly a great deal of force. The legislature has shown its disposition not to interfere, with the power of appointment. At the same time we have to construe in the light of this amendment the other sections of the Act and particularly sections 3 and 7.\nSection 3 states that the Supreme Court has not been abolished and continues to exist. The main purpose of the Act is to provide for two specific divisions, viz., the Appellate Division and the Trial Division of the Supreme Court and that there will be at the head of each division a Chief Justice. It gives, however, to the one who is to preside over the Appellate Division the additional title of Chief Justice of Alberta and gives him by sec. 7 rank and precedence over all other judges, even the Chief Justice of the Trial Division.\nThe Supreme Court of Alberta being continued, the Governor in Council having in the discharge of its power of appointment nominated in 1910 the Honourable Mr. Harvey as Chief Justice of this court and Chief Justice of Alberta, it seems to me that the new legislation concerning the Chief Justice could not be construed as providing for a new office. It is the old office of Chief Justice of Alberta which is continued and maintained, though the legislature has assigned to this Chief Justice the duty to preside over the Appellate Division.\nThe legislature never intended to abolish the old office of the Chief Justice. The statute could not be construed as maintaining the old position of Chief Justice and as creating a similar position. The idea of having two Chief Justices of Alberta with the same power and authority has certainly not entered into the mind and intention of the legislature. The old position stands and has not been superseded by the one mentioned in section 6 of the Act of 1919. I therefore come to the conclusion that Mr. Justice Harvey being already the Chief Justice of Alberta, should have imposed upon him, under the new Act, the duty of presiding over the Appellate Division or should be confirmed in his right to preside over this Appellate Division.\nI would answer the questions as follows:\u2014\nTo the first question:\u2014No.\nTo the second question:\u2014The letters patent of the 15th September, 1921, nominating Honourable Mr. Scott Chief Justice of Alberta are wholly ineffective.\nTo the third question:\u2014No.\nTo the fourth question:\u2014The letters patent nominating Mr. Justice Harvey Chief Justice of the Trial Division are wholly ineffective.\nTo the fifth question:\u2014The Honourable Horace Harvey holds the office of Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Alberta with the style and title of Chief Justice of Alberta and is by law entitled to exercise the jurisdiction and perform the duties and functions of Chief Justice and President of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta.\nMignault J.\u2014The questions submitted by this reference are very important and, if I may say so, somewhat unusual. They call for an expression of opinion as to the status and authority of two eminent members of the judiciary in the province of Alberta. They also touch on some important constitutional problems which have seldom been discussed before the courts of this country. It seems impossible to satisfactorily deal with them unless they are prefaced by a very brief statement of what I may perhaps call the history of the case. The Provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan were created in 1905 out of what was known as the North West Territories. These territories had a court of superior jurisdiction called the Supreme Court of the North West Territories, which administered justice either by sitting en banc or by trial judges, and which the legislature of each province was empowered to abolish for all purposes affecting or extending to the province.\nThe legislature of Alberta, in 1907, passed an Act, 7 Edw. VII, c. 3, creating the Supreme Court of Alberta, consisting of a Chief Justice, styled the Chief Justice of Alberta, and four puisne judges. When sitting as an Appellate Court this court was called the Supreme Court en banc, its quorum was three judges and it was presided over by the Chief Justice, or in his absence by the senior judge. The Chief Justice had rank and precedence over all judges and the latter between themselves ranked according to seniority of appointment.\nWhile this statute was in force the Hon. Horace Harvey, then a puisne judge of the Supreme Court of Alberta, was appointed Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Alberta with the style or title of the Chief Justice of Alberta, his commission bearing date the 12th of October, 1910.\nIn 1913, by 4 Geo. V., c. 9, the \"Supreme Court Act\" above referred to was amended by changing the name of the court en banc to that of \"The Appellate Division of the Supreme Court,\" and it was enacted that during the month of December, or at some other convenient time, the judges of the Supreme Court should select four of their number to constitute the Appellate Division for the next ensuing calendar year, but that every other judge of the said court should be ex officio a member of the Appellate Division. These two statutes were repealed by the \"Judicature Act\" 1919 (9 Geo. V, c. 3), which was to come in force upon a day to be named by proclamation of the Lieutenant Governor in Council. This proclamation was issued on the 11th day of August, 1921, and fixed the 15th of September, 1921, for the coming in force of the Act.\nBy the provisions of this statute it is declared that there shall continue to be in and for the province a Superior Court of civil and criminal jurisdiction known as \"The Supreme Court of Alberta\" (sec. 3) and that the court shall continue to consist of two branches or divisions which shall be designated respectively \"The Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta\" and \"The Trial Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta\" (sec. 5).\nAs enacted in 1919, sec. 6 was as follows:\nThe Appellate Division shall continue to be presided over by the Chief Justice of the court, who shall continue to be styled the Chief Justice of Alberta, and shall consist of the said Chief Justice and four other judges of the court to be assigned to it by His Excellency the Governor General in Council and to be called Justices of Appeal and three judges shall constitute a quorum.\nIn 1920 (before the Act was proclaimed and had come in force), sec. 6 was twice amended, by c. 3 of the Statutes of that year, sec. 2, and by c. 4 of the same statutes, sec. 43. As thus amended\u2014and the changes can easily be noticed by careful reading\u2014 sec. 6 is in the following terms:\nThe Appellate Division shall be presided over by a Chief Justice, who shall be Chief Justice of the court and who shall be styled the Chief Justice of Alberta, and shall consist of the said Chief Justice and four other judges of the court to be assigned to it by His Excellency the Governor General in Council and to be called Justices of Appeal, and three judges shall constitute a quorum for the hearing of appeals from any district court. But the Appellate Division, when hearing such appeals, may be composed of five judges. The Appellate Division shall be composed of five judges when hearing appeals from the trial Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta, and in no case shall an appeal be heard by the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta when composed of four or an even number of judges.\nBy sec. 7 of the \"Judicature Act, 1919,\" the Trial Division consists of a Chief Justice, styled the Chief Justice of the Trial Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta, and five other judges, called justices of the Supreme Court of Alberta.\nThe Chief Justice of the court has rank and precedence over all other judges of any court in the province; the Chief Justice of the Trial Division has rank and precedence next after the Chief Justice of the court; the other judges of the court rank among themselves according to seniority of appointment (sec. 9). Every judge is ex officio a judge of the division of which he is not a member (sec. 10).\nReferring very briefly to these enactments, it will be noticed that although the term \"Supreme Court en banc\" was used from the origin of the court, and the term \"Appellate Division\" from 1913, the expression \"Trial Division\" was introduced only by the \"Judicature Act\" of 1919. Section 5 of the latter statute however appears to have recognized by the words \"the court shall continue to consist of\" that there had been hitherto two divisions of the Supreme Court. The second, or then unnamed Trial Division, was composed of the judges who did not sit in the Appellate Division, although no doubt any of the latter could hold trials if thought advisable.\nThe \"Judicature Act,\" 1919, as amended in 1920, came in force, I have said, on the 15th September, 1921. It increased the number of judges and added a Chief Justice for the Trial Division. For the salaries of these judges, Parliament made provision by 10-11 Geo. V., c. 56, s. 14 a (1920) which came in force by proclamation of the Governor in Council also on the 15th September, 1921.\nOn the same day, the 15th September, 1921, the Governor General, by commission under the Great Seal of Canada, appointed the Honourable David Lynch Scott described as\none of the judges of the Supreme Court of Alberta, as heretofore established,\n(to be)\nthe Chief Justice and President of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta, as constituted under the \"Judicature Act\" of Alberta, Ch. 3, 9 Geo. V., as amended, and to be styled the Chief Justice of Alberta and to be ex officio a judge of the Trial Division of the said court.\nAlso, on the same day, the Governor General, by Commission under the Great Seal of Canada, appointed the Honourable Horace Harvey described as\nChief Justice of the Supreme Court of Alberta as heretofore established (to be) the Chief Justice of the Trial Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta and ex officio a judge of the Appellate Division of the said court.\nThe reference states that the following questions have arisen upon which the advice of this court is desired by the Governor in Council: (see page 137).\nNotice of the hearing under this reference was given by order of the court to the Hon. Horace Harvey and to the Hon. David Lynch Scott, as well to the Attorney-General of Alberta. The two latter were not present or represented at the hearing. The Honourable Horace Harvey appeared by Mr. Eugene Lafleur K.C., and the Attorney-General of Canada by Mr. E. L. Newcombe K.C., Deputy Minister of Justice. The administration of justice in the province, including the constitution, maintenance and organization of the provincial courts, both of the civil and criminal jurisdiction, is by the British North America Act, (sec. 92, para. 14), assigned to the provinces. The appointment of judges of superior, district and county courts belongs to the Governor General, and their salaries are provided for by the Parliament of Canada (same Act secs. 96, 100). Judges hold office during good behaviour but are removable only by the Governor General on address of the Senate and House of Commons (B.N.A. Act, sec. 99).\nMr. Newcombe's contention was that the Alberta \"Judicature Act, 1919,\" created, if not a new court, at least new judicial offices which could be filled only by appointments made by the Governor-General; that anything in the said Act purporting to vest these offices in any existing Chief Justice or judge would be ultra vires of the legislature of Alberta, and that consequently the commissions issued on the 15th September, 1921, were effective for the purposes therein stated.\nMr. Lafleur argued that no new court and no new judicial office, with the exception of the Chief Justiceship of the Trial Division and the additional judgeships, had been created by the \" Judicature Act, 1919;\" that the Hon. Horace Harvey, as Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Alberta and Chief Justice of Alberta, could not be removed nor his offices taken away except by the method specified in the B.N.A. Act, sec. 99; that, as the Hon. Mr. Harvey still filled the said offices, no other person could be thereunto appointed, and consequently the commissions of the 15th September were inefficient to appoint the Hon. Mr. Scott to be Chief Justice and President of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta and Chief Justice of Alberta, and the Hon. Mr. Harvey to be Chief Justice of the Trial Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta, for obviously the two offices could not be filled by the same person.\nAssuming, but not deciding, that the legislature could destroy an existing judicial office, so as to deprive thereof the person duly appointed thereto, it would require a very clear enactment to make me come to the conclusion that the judicial office had been destroyed and that the titulary thereof was no longer entitled to exercise the powers, authority and jurisdiction thereunto appertaining. Still less would I be disposed to find\u2014in the reorganization and rearrangement by the legislature of an existing court, with provisions for the appointment by the proper authority of the Chief Justice and judges of the court, where the court had already, as it naturally would have had, a Chief Justice and judges,\u2014the creation of new judicial offices or the destruction of the existing ones. It is only when the legislature by legislation such as that under consideration, increases the number of judges of an existing court, or when, in dividing the court into different branches, it provides for additional Chief Justices, that I would readily conclude that a new judicial office has been established. It follows that if the existing judicial offices are filled and have not been destroyed, no new appointments can be made thereto.\nBearing these considerations well in mind, I will take up the proper construction of the Alberta \"Judicature Act, 1919,\" and I have no difficulty whatever in coming to the conclusion that the only new judicial offices created by this Act were the additional judgeships required to complete the number of judges provided for and the Chief Justiceship of the Trial Division. In other respects, in my opinion, the existing Supreme Court of Alberta continued. This is shown by sec. 3 of the Act. Sec. 5 assumes that there were already two existing branches or divisions of the court and it gives a name to the Trial Division. Sec. 6, as first enacted in 1919, shows that that was clearly the intention of the legislature, for the language was\nthe Appellate Division shall continue to be presided over by the Chief Justice of the court, who shall continue to be styled the Chief Justice of Alberta. * * *\nBut it is contended that the 1920 amendments show that this intention of the legislature was not persisted in. No doubt the present language of sec. 6 does not as emphatically express the intention not to create a new office of Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Alberta, but even were I of opinion that the new language of the section is equivocal or consistent with either construction, I would not, for the reasons above stated, give the preference to a construction that would deprive the existing Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of his high office, and possibly leave the Governor in Council free not to reappoint him to any judicial office. Furthermore, the language of sections 3 and 5 was not changed in 1920, and I find in these sections the clearly expressed intention to continue the existing court with its existing Chief Justice and judges, the number of which, however, was increased.\nIt appears unnecessary to express any opinion upon the right of the legislature to make these enactments. I assume, for the purpose of answering the questions submitted, that it acted within its powers. Answering now these questions, I will reply to the first and third questions in the negative. I do not think, in view of this answer, that questions 2 and 4 call for a reply; it is clear that the letters patent in question are wholly ineffective for the purposes therein expressed. I would answer question 5 by saying that in my opinion the said Horace Harvey holds the office conferred on him by his Commission of 1910, which office is continued under the ''Judicature Act\" of Alberta, 1919, and entitles him to be the Chief Justice and President of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta.\nAt the sittings on the 2nd day of May, 1922, the Supreme Court of Canada answered the questions submitted as follows:\nTo the first question:\u2014No.\nTo the second question:\u2014Wholly.\nTo the third question:\u2014No.\nTo the fourth question:\u2014Wholly.\nTo the fifth question:\u2014The Hon. Horace Harvey holds the office of Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Alberta with the style and title of Chief Justice of Alberta and is by law entitled to exercise and perform the jurisdiction, office and functions of the Chief Justice and President of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta.\nThe Chief Justice and Idington J. answer questions 1 and 3 in the affirmative, that the Honourable David Lynch Scott is the Chief Justice and President of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta and that the Honourable Horace Harvey is the Chief Justice of the Trial Division of such Supreme Court. The Chief Justice answers the fifth question in the negative and holds therefore that no answer is required to questions 2 and 4. Idington J. holds no answer to 2 necessary, but answers the fourth question by saying that the Honourable Horace Harvey being ex officio a judge of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court only qualifies him to act in place or stead of some member of the court not being able to take the place to which he or his successor may have been assigned. To the 5th question Idington J. answers in the negative and that the Honourable Horace Harvey only holds the office provided by his patent of September, 1921.\n[1] [1912] A.C. 571 at p. 589.\n[2] [1892] A.C. 387.\n[3] [1920] A.C. 691.\n[4] [1912] A.C. 571.\n",

V., c. 68, s. 309.\nThe appellant company would only be liable in case of negligent or unreasonable use of its statutory right to operate its trains, of which there was no evidence in this case; moreover, upon the evidence, the determining cause of the accident was the act of respondent's husband in projecting himself in front of the coming train. Idington and Brodeur JJ. contra.\nPer Idington and Brodeur JJ. dissenting.\u2014It was for the jury to determine whether or not the appellant company was guilty of fault; and its verdict for the respondent, upheld unanimously on appeal, should be maintained by this court.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King's Bench, appeal side, Province of Quebec, affirming the judgment of the trial judge with a jury, and maintaining the respondent's action.\nThe plaintiff's husband, Hector Sarrazin, was killed on the 1st August, 1920, about 6.19 p.m., in the Turcot yard of the defendant company, by a fast express train which had come from Ottawa and was then travelling at about 25 miles an hour\u2014its usual speed at that place. Sarrazin was engaged as a repair mechanic. He had been working at a car standing on a track to the north of the two main tracks passing through the yard and had crossed over to them to the south, presumably to procure a steel knuckle which he required. In returning he passed between two freight cars standing on the track immediately to the south of the main tracks, having apparently climbed over the coupling. He was first seen by the only eye-witness of the accident\u2014the engineer of the incoming express train\u2014jumping from between the two freight cars towards the main tracks, about 25 feet in advance of the oncoming locomotive, the buffer beam of which struck him on the left shoulder. The space between the southerly main track and the next track to the south was about six feet wide.\nThe plaintiff charged that the defendants were negligent in not moderating the speed of the express train while passing through the Turcot yard and in placing the car which the plaintiff was required to repair on one of the principal tracks towards the centre of the yard instead of on an outside track. By amendment, made towards the close of the trial, it was also alleged that where the accident occurred was a thickly peopled portion of the City of Montreal, that the tracks were not fenced or protected according to law and that the speed of the train therefore contravened s. 309 of the \"Railway Act\" (9 & 10 Geo. V., c. 68).\nThe action was tried by a jury who found that the death of Sarrazin was caused solely by the fault of the defendant's servants, consisting \"dans la vitesse du train \u00e0 cet endroit.\" Sarrazin was acquitted of contributory fault. In his charge the trial judge barely alluded to the allegation of excessive speed apart from the requirement of s. 309. He dwelt at some length on that section and discussed the evidence as to the number of houses in the neighbourhood and the character of the fencing of the right of way. Judgment was entered in the Superior Court on the jury's finding for $8,000 damages and this judgment was unanimously affirmed in the Court of King's Bench on the ground that there was evidence on which the jury could reasonably find that the cause of Sarrazin's death was the speed of the train and that such speed was so excessive as to amount to fault.\nLafleur K.C. and Beckett K.C. for the appellants. Except in cases within s. 309, there is no legal restriction on the speed of the defendant's trains and it is not competent for a jury to find excessive speed as a fault. Sec. 309 does not apply to a railway yard. There is no evidence that the locality of the accident was a thickly populated portion of the city or that the fencing was insufficient.\nThe determining cause of the accident was not the speed of the train, but Sarrazin's rash act in jumping or running in front of it when only 25 feet away.\nCurran K.C. and Forest for the respondent. Having regard to the number of men required and of locomotives used in Turcot yards, 25 miles an hour might reasonably be found to be an excessive speed, apart altogether from s. 309.\nLafleur K.C. and Beckett K.C. for the appellants.\nCurran K.C. and Forest for the respondent.\nThe locality was thickly populated and the fencing defective, and therefore s. 309 applies and a speed over 10 miles an hour was illegal. Had the speed been less, Sarrazin might have escaped. There is evidence to warrant the jury's finding of fault.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014For the reasons stated by my brother Anglin, with which I fully concur, I would allow this appeal.\nIdington J. (dissenting).\u2014The respondent herein sued for damages caused to herself and children by the death of her husband and their father whilst working in the Turcot yard of the said railway company. The case was tried by the court with a special jury. The learned trial judge submitted to the jury a number of questions of which the three following and answers thereto are all that call for our consideration oil this appeal:\u2014\n3.\u2014Est-ce que le dit accident a \u00e9t\u00e9 caus\u00e9 par la seule faute et n\u00e9gligence du dit Hector Sarrazin? Si vous r\u00e9pondez oui, dites en quoi cette faute et cette n\u00e9gligence consistent? Non, 9 \u00e0 2.\n4.\u2014Est-ce que le dit accident a \u00e9t\u00e9 caus\u00e9 par la seule faute et n\u00e9gligence de la d\u00e9fenderesse, ses employ\u00e9s ou serviteurs? Si vous r\u00e9pondez oui, dites en quoi cette faute et cette n\u00e9gligence consistent? \u2014Oui\u20149 \u00e0 2, dans la vitesse du train \u00e0 cet endroit.\n5.\u2014Est-ce que cet accident est d\u00fb \u00e0 la faute commune ou contributoire du dit feu Hector Sarrazin et de la d\u00e9fenderesse, ses employ\u00e9s ou serviteurs? Si vous r\u00e9pondez oui, dites en quoi la faute et la n\u00e9gligence de chacun consistaient? Non\u2014unanimes.\nThe answer to the first is most stoutly denied by the appellant's factum herein which seeks to attribute the sole proximate cause of the accident to the act of the deceased going from where he was working to the car standing on a track on the other side of the main tracks, to get a pin needed for use in the repair work he was engaged in and on his return therewith jumping down from between said cars Without waiting till the main lines were clear. It is alleged that had he taken due care he would not have jumped as he did and no accident would have happened. There is something to be said for this contention. It might have had more force with fair minded men if the appellant at the trial had not pressed rather far its contention that the deceased was entirely in the wrong and without excuse in attempting to get the pin from the place he did.\nThe alleged printed notice on which appellant so rested what it calls absolute prohibition of such an appropriation was only in English and not liable thereby to have been brought home to the mind of deceased.\nAnd when read it impliedly permits under stress of circumstances the very act complained of, for it directs if done it must be returned or rather replaced by another.\nI imagine the rather unfair use of such a notice did appellant more harm than good.\nThe circumstance of the deceased having jumped down was perhaps no more than an error of judgment.\nIt was however entirely a matter for the jury to determine whether so or not, giving due heed to all the attendant circumstances.\nNo one saw him jump except the engineer on the eastward bound train from Ottawa who had his own work to engage his attention.\nHe tells that there would be six feet between the cars on that train and the cars on the next track from which deceased jumped.\nIf so it is quite conceivable that deceased had hoped, without being negligent but merely erring in judgment to so land in that six feet of space as to be entirely safe but possibly he stumbled slightly further than he expected, and was struck on the shoulder by a part of the engine of the incoming train. He certainly did not intend to jump or in fact jump across the six feet of space between the car he stood on and the main track and thus land in front of the train though his shoulder got so far.\nI cannot therefore see how we can say the jury reached a conclusion, that no nine reasonable men could reach, that he was negligent.\nI thus eliminate the answers to questions three and five as deserving here of no further consideration.\nIndeed that to question five, for evident reasons, was not seriously pressed by either side.\nThe answer to question four in assigning its answer of fault \"dans la vitesse du train \u00e0 cet endroit\" is a most comprehensive one and may cover both the illegal conduct of running a train at more than ten miles an hour in a thickly populated locality contrary to the provisions of section 309 of the \"Railway Act\" and the running of a train at too high a rate of speed consistent with the safety of others in passing through such a busy railway yard as that in question.\nThere is evidence tending to shew to those conversant with the locality that both grounds were conceivably supportable in favour of the respondent.\nOne, if well grounded, is sufficient.\nIt seems quite clear that appellant had been habitually offending against said section 309, if not at the exact point of the accident perilously close to it and hence would not likely have been running at twenty-five miles an hour there but for this disregard of the statutory prohibition.\nOf course it is not what was done on other occasions than the one in question, but that on the latter alone which must govern what is in question herein. I regret to say that the evidence was not presented on either side in such a Way as to render quite clear to my mind the conditions and surrounding circumstances and bearing thereon.\nYet I imagine a jury from the district which paid as close attention as this one did to the case before it, as evidenced by very many pointed questions they put, could find a stronger case on that ground than I can by a perusal of the evidence with such a defective plan such as presented by appellant.\nOn the ground that passing through such a yard two trains at the same time, and the one in question, at all events, moving at the rate of twenty-five miles an hour, the case is one for the jury to determine whether or not appellant was guilty of fault.\nAnd certainly, at all events, it is not, I submit, for us to interfere and reverse the unanimous judgment of the Court of King's Bench better situated in many ways to determine the bare question of whether or not there was evidence to submit to the jury.\nI observe that there was no motion at the trial to dismiss the action on that ground.\nI think the appeal here should be dismissed with costs.\nAnglin J.\u2014It is quite impossible to know whether the jury dealt with this case as falling within s. 309 of the \"Railway Act\" or intended to find excessive speed amounting to fault quite apart from that provision. It will therefore be necessary to examine the case in both these aspects.\nI doubt whether upon the evidence it can be said that the locality through which the train was passing when it struck Sarrazin was thickly populated. But, if that fact be assumed in the plaintiffs favour, having regard to the conditions as to fencing shewn by the evidence, it would probably have been incumbent on the defendants to restrict the speed of their train at that place to 10 miles per hour. Granting this, however, it does not, in my opinion, entitle the plaintiff to recover, because the excess of speed over 10 miles per hour was not the cause of Sarrazin being killed, and probably also because s. 309 was not passed for the protection of yard employees of the railway company whose duties require them to be within the fences erected along the right of way.\nThe evidence in my opinion leaves no room for doubt that the determining cause of Sarrazin's death was not the speed of the train but his own act\u2014whether culpable or wholly innocent is on this issue quite immaterial\u2014in projecting himself almost immediately in front of the Ottawa express. That fact of course likewise affords a peremptory answer to the plaintiff's case if the jury's finding should be taken to mean that the speed of the train at 25 miles per hour in Turcot yard amounted to fault although s. 309 of the Railway Act did not apply. Moreover such a finding of fault in my opinion could not be maintained. There are no circumstances in evidence which indicate that there is any greater danger, or need for reduction in the speed of the trains, in the Turcot yard than exists in any other railway yard. I am not prepared to accede to the view that in the absence of proof of such special circumstances, a jury may fix the standard of what is or is not a proper speed for express trains passing through such a yard. There may no doubt be special circumstances\u2014such, for instance, as the known presence of some unusual concourse of people in the yard\u2014which would render the running of a train through it at 25 miles per hour sheer recklessness. In such a case the railway company would in vain invoke its statutory right to operate its trains. Columbia Bithulitic Ltd. v. British Columbia Electric Ry. Co.[1]. Statutory authorization affords a complete immunity for injury caused by the use of the powers so conferred so long as they are exercised without negligence. Canadian Pacific Ry. Co. v. Roy[2]. But the statute does not sanction or protect negligent or unreasonable use of the rights it confers. East Fremantle Corporation v. Annois[3]. Here there is nothing of that kind.\nOn the other hand the running of fast express trains at high speed on the main tracks passing through railway yards is such a well known feature of our railway traffic that resultant danger to persons employed in such yards may well be regarded as a risk of such employment assumed by them, so long as there is no negligence either in the management of such trains or in the direction or control of the persons so employed, which increases the danger.\nIn my opinion not only is the finding that there was fault on the part of the defendants which caused the death of Sarrazin unwarranted but\nit is absolutely clear from all the evidence in the case that no jury would be justified in finding any verdict other than one in favour of the\nappellant-defendant. Art. 508 (3) C.P.C.\nI would therefore allow this appeal; and, pronouncing the judgment which, in my opinion, the Court of King's Bench ought to have rendered (\"Supreme Court Act,\" s. 51), I would dismiss the action, with costs throughout if the defendant company should see fit to exact them. Brodeur J. (dissenting),\u2014Cette cause pr\u00e9sente de s\u00e9rieuses difficult\u00e9s; mais, apr\u00e8s avoir soigneusement consid\u00e9r\u00e9 les points en litige, j'en suis venu \u00e0 la conclusion que l'appel de la compagnie devrait \u00eatre renvoy\u00e9.\nLa compagnie a pr\u00e9tendu dans sa plaidoirie devant nous qu'elle pouvait donner \u00e0 ses convois la vitesse qu'elle jugerait \u00e0 propos, \u00e0 moins qu'ils ne soient dans la partie populeuse d'une ville ou d'un village. Je ne puis pas acquiescer \u00e0 une telle proposition. Je reconnais bien que l'endroit o\u00f9 l'accident a eu lieu n'\u00e9tait pas de ceux que l'article 309 de \"l'Acte des Chemins de Fer\" vise quand il d\u00e9clare que la vitesse ne doit pas y d\u00e9passer dix milles \u00e0 l'heure. Mais en vertu de la loi qui s'applique \u00e0 tout le monde, les compagnies de chemins de fer sont tenues en tout temps et en tout endroit d'agir avec prudence et avec soin. La question de faute d\u00e9pend des faits et des circonstances de chaque cas. Ce serait, suivant moi, un cas de n\u00e9gligence de sa part si dans une de ses cours o\u00f9 il y a une multitude d'employ\u00e9s au travail, elle se permettait d'y faire traverser ses convois \u00e0 une vitesse immod\u00e9r\u00e9e. La situation particuli\u00e8re de ses voies principales dans cette cour Turcot en fait un endroit excessivement dangereux. Et alors pr\u00e9tendre que ses trains pourraient y passer \u00e0 n'importe quelle vitesse me para\u00eet contraire aux principes \u00e9l\u00e9mentaires de la saine prudence. En dehors de toutes dispositions statutaires, la vitesse d'un train doit \u00eatre conforme \u00e0 la prudence requise pour la s\u00fbret\u00e9 de ceux qui ont le droit d'\u00eatre sur la voie.\nIl y a des circonstances particuli\u00e8res qui imposeront l'obligation de ralentir la vitesse des trains \u00e0 certains endroits, comme dans une cour, par exemple, pu encore lorsque le m\u00e9canicien voit qu'une personne est sur la voie ou en train de la traverser. C'est donc une question de fait qui doit \u00eatre laiss\u00e9e au jury. Il me semble que son verdict dans cette cause, qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 unanimement confirm\u00e9 par les cours inf\u00e9rieures, ne devrait pas \u00eatre renvers\u00e9.\nL'appel devrait \u00eatre renvoy\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens.\nMignault J.\u2014L'intim\u00e9e a obtenu, sur verdict d'un jury, jugement contre l'appelante pour $8,000.00, dont $3,000.00 pour elle-m\u00eame et $5,000.00 pour ses cinq enfants mineurs, \u00e0 raison de la mort de son mari, le nomm\u00e9 Hector Sarrazin, bless\u00e9 par une locomotive de l'appelante, et ce jugement a \u00e9t\u00e9 confirm\u00e9 \u00e0 l'unanimit\u00e9 par la cour d'appel. L'appelante demande l'infirmation de ce jugement et la cassation du verdict.\nIl n'y a aucune contradiction quant aux faits saillants de la cause. Le 1er ao\u00fbt 1920, vers six heures du goir, Hector Sarrazin et un compagnon nomm\u00e9 Lamer faisaient l'inspection de trois convois de marchandises qui devaient partir le m\u00eame soir, le but de leur inspection \u00e9tant de constater si tout \u00e9tait en bon \u00e9tat et de faire les petites r\u00e9parations n\u00e9cessaires. Ce travail se faisait dans la cour Turcot, qui est une grande cour de chemin de fer dans les limites de la cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al, longue d'environ deux milles, avec plusieurs voies tant au nord qu'au sud des deux voies principales o\u00f9 circulent les trains de l'appelante. Aucun chemin public ne traverse cette cour.\nImm\u00e9diatement avant l'accident, Sarrazin et Lamer travaillaient sur une des voies lat\u00e9rales, \u00e9tant la deuxi\u00e8me au nord des voies principales. A part ces voies principales qui \u00e9taient libres, les autres voies \u00e9taient occup\u00e9es par un grand nombre de wagons de marchandises qui devaient plus tard \u00eatre exp\u00e9di\u00e9s \u00e0 leur destination. Pour faire leur ouvrage et se procurer les outils n\u00e9cessaires, le d\u00e9funt et son compagnon n'avaient qu'\u00e0 rester du c\u00f4t\u00e9 nord o\u00f9 se trouvaient les chantiers de l'appelante et o\u00f9 il n'y avait aucun danger provenant de la circulation des trains. Cependant, pour une raison qu'on ne peut s'expliquer que par des conjectures, Sarrazin quitta l'endroit o\u00f9 il travaillait, traversa les deux voies principales et se rendit au sud de ces derni\u00e8res, avec l'intention sans doute de revenir \u00e0 son ouvrage qui n'\u00e9tait pas achev\u00e9. Quelques instants plus tard, pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment \u00e0, 6 h.19, le temps \u00e9tant beau et clair, le train rapide d'Ottawa \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al arrivait \u00e0 une vitesse de 25 \u00e0 30 milles \u00e0 l'heure, qui est sa vitesse ordinaire \u00e0 cet endroit. Le seul t\u00e9moin de l'accident, le nomm\u00e9 Weston, ing\u00e9nieur de la locomotive, \u00e9tait \u00e0 son poste. Il dit:\nQ.\u2014Did you see the man Hector Sarrazin, the plaintiff's husband, when you were crossing Turcot Yard.\nA.\u2014Coming into Turcot Yard?\nQ.\u2014Yes.\nA.\u2014Yes.\nQ.\u2014In what spot did you see him.\nA.\u2014Well, when I saw him first he was jumping between the cars that way (indicates).\nQ.\u2014What.\nA.\u2014He jumped out from between the cars in front of the engine.\nQ.\u2014I understand you to say that he jumped between two cars.\nA.\u2014Yes, he jumped from between two cars.\nQ.\u2014From the side.\nA.\u2014On to the track. From the side on to the main line. From the siding on the same side of the track on to the main line in front of me.\nI am coming in here (indicates) he jumped out from the cars on that side right immediately in front of the engine.\nWeston appliqua imm\u00e9diatement les freins et r\u00e9ussit \u00e0 arr\u00eater le train dans un espace de 500 pieds, mais rien au monde ne pouvait sauver Sarrazin qui fut frapp\u00e9 par la locomotive et eut le cr\u00e2ne fractur\u00e9. Il mourut le lendemain. Le jury fut d'opinion que Sarrazin \u00e9tait exempt de toute faute et que l'accident \u00e9tait arriv\u00e9 par la seule faute de l'appelante. A une question qui demandait en quoi consistait cette faute, le jury r\u00e9pondit: \"dans la vitesse excessive du train \u00e0 cet endroit.\" Le verdict n'indique pas pourquoi la vitesse du train \u00e9tait fautive \u00e0 cet endroit.\nIl est \u00e9l\u00e9mentaire de dire que si rien dans la loi ni dans les circonstances de l'esp\u00e8ce n'exigeait une vitesse moindre, il ne pouvait pas y avoir faute \u00e0 conduire ce train \u00e0 une vitesse de vingt-cinq \u00e0 trente milles \u00e0 l'heure ou m\u00eame davantage. La faute, par d\u00e9finition, est un manquement \u00e0 un devoir. S'il n'y a pas de devoir, si on exerce un droit, il n'y a pas de faute. Or, je le r\u00e9p\u00e8te, si rien dans la loi ou les circonstances de l'esp\u00e8ce n'imposait une vitesse moindre, le jury ne pouvait raisonnablement dire que la vitesse du train \u00e0 cet endroit \u00e9tait une faute.\nJe ne vois dans la preuve aucune circonstance qui ait exig\u00e9 une r\u00e9duction de vitesse \u00e0 cet endroit, \u00e9loign\u00e9 de quatre milles et demi du terminus o\u00f9 le train se rendait. Il n'y avait pas de groupements de travailleurs, m\u00eame la preuve ne fait voir \u00e0 cet endroit-l\u00e0 que Sarrazin et son compagnon. Et c'est l'acte de Sarrazin lui-m\u00eame, en se jetant au devant de la locomotive, qui a caus\u00e9 sa mort. Quand il parut l\u00e0 tout \u00e0 coup, il n'y avait pas de possibilit\u00e9 d'\u00e9viter l'accident.\nLa loi, non plus, ne prohibait pas cette vitesse. Vers la fin de l'enqu\u00eate la demanderesse obtint la permission d'amender sa d\u00e9claration en all\u00e9guant que l'endroit o\u00f9 l'accident est arriv\u00e9 est\nun endroit populeux situ\u00e9 dans la cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al et qui n'est pas prot\u00e9g\u00e9 ni cl\u00f4tur\u00e9 suivant la loi. Le but de l'amendement \u00e9tait d'invoquer Particle 309 de \"l'Acte des chemins de fer,\" qui, dans un tel endroit, veut que l\u00e0 vitesse des trains ne d\u00e9passe pas dix milles \u00e0 l'heure.\nMais au lieu de prouver que l'endroit de l'accident f\u00fbt populeux, on a prouv\u00e9 qu'il y a des rues et des maisons pr\u00e8s d'un mille de l\u00e0, en approchant de la station de St-Henri. L\u00e0 o\u00f9 Sarrazin s'est fait tuer, il n'y a ni rues ni maisons; c'est un vaste terrain plat, termin\u00e9 au nord par une c\u00f4te \u00e9lev\u00e9e au sommet de laquelle se trouve le chemin de Lachine, et au sud par le canal Lachine. Pr\u00e8s de l\u00e0, au sud, il y a les usines du Canada Car Company, s\u00e9par\u00e9es de la voie de l'appelante par le chemin de fer \u00e9lectrique du Parc et de l'Ile et une doubl\u00e9 cl\u00f4ture. Il n'y a pas un t\u00e9moin qui pr\u00e9tende qu'il y a de la population l\u00e0 o\u00f9 Sarrazin a \u00e9t\u00e9 bless\u00e9. Il est par cons\u00e9quent \u00e9vident que l'article 309 ne s'applique pas. Si donc la loi ne d\u00e9fendait pas une vitesse de vingt-cinq \u00e0 trente milles \u00e0 cet endroit, et si rien dans les circonstances de l'esp\u00e8ce ne rendait cette vitesse imprudente, aucun jury ne pouvait raisonnablement trouver l'appelante en faute \u00e0 cause de la vitesse du train \u00e0 cet endroit. Canadian Pacific Railway Company v. Roy (1).\nVoici un homme qui se jette tout \u00e0 coup au devant d'un train, un homme qui travaille depuis une ann\u00e9e dans cette cour et qui sait qu'il y passe de nombreux trains, quatre, dit-on, par heure. Et le jury r\u00e9pond que cet homme est exempt de toute faute. Au contraire, la d\u00e9fenderesse qui, en faisant circuler ses trains, exerce un droit que lui conf\u00e8re la loi, est, dit le jury, coupable de faute et responsable de la mort de Sarrazin. Un tel verdict, pour citer le langage de l'article 501 C.P.C., est un verdict que le jury, en examinant toute la preuve, ne pouvait raisonnablement rendre. Dans un tel cas, la loi permet au tribunal de rendre un jugement diff\u00e9rent de celui qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 rendu par le juge pr\u00e9sident au proc\u00e8s (art. 508 C.P.C.).\nL'intim\u00e9e, jeune m\u00e8re de vingt-quatre ans, ayant d\u00e9j\u00e0 cinq enfants, le dernier posthume, se trouve dans une situation d\u00e9plorable. Elle n'a eu, comme assurances, que $250.00 de l'association des employ\u00e9s de chemin de fer et $741 des Forestiers Ind\u00e9pendants. Cependant ce n'est pas l\u00e0 une raison de lui allouer une indemnit\u00e9 aux d\u00e9pens de l'appelante, si aucune faute de celle-ci n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 prouv\u00e9e et si Sarrazin, par son imprudence grossi\u00e8re, a caus\u00e9 sa propre mort.\nSans doute, comme le font remarquer les honorables juges de la cour d'appel, le jury est souverain juge des faits; mais il n'en est pas moins vrai que sa d\u00e9cision doit \u00eatre raisonnable. L'honorable juge Martin dit que peut-\u00eatre Sarrazin aurait pu \u00e9viter le coup qui l'a tu\u00e9 si la vitesse du train avait \u00e9t\u00e9 moindre. En supposant que telle ait \u00e9t\u00e9 l'opinion du jury, la forme de ses r\u00e9ponses nous r\u00e9duit aux conjectures, peut-on d\u00e9clarer fautive une vitesse que la loi permettait, surtout quand la voie \u00e9tait droite et libre et que la victime de cet accident s'est subitement jet\u00e9e au devant du train? Et est-ce une faute de n'avoir pas pens\u00e9 qu'un homme commettrait cette imprudence incroyable? Le verdict du jury est enti\u00e8rement pervers et d\u00e9raisonnable; et s'il \u00e9tait maintenu le service des chemins de fer serait notablement entrav\u00e9 en ce pays.\nIl est bien regrettable que le salaire annuel de Sarrazin ait d\u00e9pass\u00e9 le chiffre qui donne lieu \u00e0 l'application de la loi des accidents du travail. L'intim\u00e9e n'avait d'action que sous l'empire du droit commun, et elle ne pouvait r\u00e9ussir sans prouver la faute de l'appelante. J'ai lu la preuve tr\u00e8s attentivement, mais je ne trouve rien qui puisse justifier le verdict.\nL'appel doit \u00eatre maintenu et l'action de l'intim\u00e9e renvoy\u00e9e. L'appelante a droit \u00e0 ses d\u00e9pens dans toutes les cours si elle veut les exiger de l'intim\u00e9e.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellants: A. E.

Co. executed a contract agreeing to give the C.L.B. Co. the sole Canadian market for sale of the English Reports Reprint to be published in Edinburgh and of which it had the sole rights for the United States and Canada. The C.L.B. Co. by said contract agreed to buy a certain number of copies \u201cof each volume of the set (150 vols. more or less)\u201d at a price named per vol. The publishers of the work had issued a prospectus which was given to the C.L.B. Co. stating that the set would consist of about 150 vols. of about 1,500 pages each and the latter company solicited subscriptions on that basis. Most of the volumes after the first few contained considerably less than 1,500 pages and when 150 had been published it was seen that to complete the work over forty more would be necessary. The C.L.B. Co. refused payment for the following four volumes published and, in an action by the B.B. Co. for the price, counterclaimed in damages for breach of the contract.\nHeld, reversing the judgment of the Appellate Division (48 Ont. L.R. 238) which affirmed that on the trial (44 Ont. L.R. 529) that the C.L.B. Co. did not contract to purchase the entire set of whatever number of volumes it might consist but only to take 150 vols., more or less; that the contract must be construed in view of the statement in the prospectus as to the extent of the work; that the number of volumes and contents of each to be reprinted were known and the extent of the work to contain the reprint could be calculated within very narrow limits; therefore the term in the contract sued on that it would consist of \u201c150 vols., more or less\u201d was not an estimate but part of the description of the subject matter and the phrase \u201cmore or less\u201d would permit only a slight increase over the 150 vols. and the excess of 40 vols. or more is so unreasonable as to constitute a breach of the contract.\nHeld also, that the C.L.B. Co. is entitled to claim damages by counterclaim to the action of the B.B. Co. and not obliged to wait until the entire work is published.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario[1] affirming the judgment at the trial in favour of the plaintiff[2].\nThe material facts of this case are stated in the head-note. The Boston Book Co. sued to recover the amount due for the stipulated number of copies of volumes 151 to 154 inclusively. The defendant denied any liability therefor and counterclaimed in damages for breach of the contract to supply the whole set in about 150 volumes.\nThe trial Judge gave judgment for the plaintiff for the amount claimed and dismissed the counter-claim2. His judgment was affirmed by the appellate Division1.\nLafleur K.C. and Harding K.C., for the appellant. The prospectus was a part of the contract and contained its material terms. The court must consider it in order to be in the same position as the parties were when the contract was made. See McLeod v. McNab[3]; Chapman v. Bluck[4].\nThe statement in the prospectus amounts to a warranty. The parties did not intend that the written agreement should contain all the terms of the contract and the warranty does not contradict any of its terms. See Benjamin on Sale (6 ed.) pages 663 and 672. It was possible to ascertain with almost absolute precision the extent of the contemplated work so that the number of volumes mentioned in the contract cannot be a mere estimate and the expression \u201cmore or less\u201d admits of only a slight variation. Renter Co. v. Sala[5].\nThe damages are capable of being ascertained and the defendant can assert its claim in this action. Findlay v. Howard[6].\nBicknell K.C. and Gordon, for the respondent. The subject of the contract was a work of an extent that could not be ascertained in advance. Therefore the words \u201c150 volumes more or less\u201d were words of expectation and estimate only Tancred, Arrol & Co. v. Steel Co. of Scotland[7]; In re Harrison[8].\nThe words \u201cmore or less\u201d should be given the widest interpretation in a case of this kind Eckert v. London Electric Ry. Co.[9] and cases cited above.\nThese words cannot be construed as a warranty since, in a matter of such importance, specific terms of warranty would be necessary. Heilbut, Symons & Co. VoBuckleton[10].\nThe defendant has for many years been aware of the terms of the prospectus and has accepted and paid for the books issued. It has, therefore, elected to affirm the contract and lost its right to rescind; Clough v. London and North Western Ry. Co.[11], Erlanger v. New Sombrero Phosphate Co.[12]; In re Cape Breton Co.[13] per Pearson J. at page 229. DUFF J.\u2014The decisive point in the controversy is that raised by the question, what was the subject matter of the contract\u2014or rather that branch of the contract which in effect is a contract of sale? The respondents advance the view that they agreed to supply the appellants with sets of reports as they were published and only as they were published by Greene & Sons. The appellants, on the other hand, rest their case upon the proposition that the contract contemplated the delivery of sets, each set consisting of a number of volumes fixed within very narrow limits and each volume containing an approximately determined number of pages and each set being a complete reprint of certain specified law reports.\nThe document of the 5th day of June, 1900, is one which can only be fully understood by one who is informed of the circumstances in which it was executed. The phrase \u201cEnglish Reports Reprint to be published by Wm. Greene & Sons, of Edinburgh, Scotland, first volume to appear about September 1st\u201d\npoints to something which was known to and in contemplation of both parties to the contract and with reference to which they contracted; and in order to construe and apply the contract you must ascertain what\nthis was. Lord Davey, whose words I have been quoting, (Bank of New Zealand v. Simpson[14] proceeds to say\n\u201cextrinsic evidence is always admissible not to contradict or vary the contract but to apply it to the facts which the parties had in their minds and were negotiating about.\nIt will be very useful also to bear in mind the words of Lord Haldane in Charrington & Co. v. Wooder[15]. Where, says Lord Haldane, the description of the subject matter is susceptible of more than one interpretation, evidence is admissible to shew what were the facts to which the contract relates. If there are circumstances which the parties must be taken to have had in view when entering into the contract it is necessary that the court which construes the contract should have these circumstances before it.\nThere are certain circumstances which the parties must be taken to have had in view. Mr. Soule had in his possession a copy of the circular of Greene & Sons and this circular gave a list of the reports which were to be republished. It stated explicitly that all the reports mentioned could be republished in about 150 volumes of about 1,500 pages each.\nIt is indisputable that this estimate was one which could be subjected to rigorous tests; the precise works which were to be reproduced were known and the number of volumes required into which the whole series would run could be determined subject to a very narrow margin of error.\nThe appellants moreover, as well as the respondents, were publishers and booksellers and were, of course, known to be purchasing with a view to re-selling to their customers, the legal profession in Canada. It was quite well understood that they would follow the usual procedure in such a case. That is to say they would issue an advertisement or prospectus inviting subscriptions and inviting these subscriptions upon the faith of the essential terms, at all events, of the prospectus of Greene & Sons\u2014that a set of the reprint would contain the reports specified and that it would consist of 150 volumes of about 1,500 pages each. These were essential terms of the prospectus of Greene & Sons because on the basis of this prospectus subscriptions were being invited by them at the rate of a named price per volume and the total cost of the work to the subscriber would necessarily depend up on the number of volumes he was agreeing to buy; and, as this was a matter easily ascertainable by the publishers within, as I have said, very narrow limits the publishers\u2019 estimate, so called, would naturally be treated by the publisher and subscriber alike as within such limits, determining the number of volumes which the subscriber would ultimately be called upon topayfor. Precisely the same considerations would govern the relations between the Canada Law Book Company and its customers. A proposed subscriber\u2019s first question would be a question concerning the number of volumes and it was necessary that the appellants should be in a position to give such assurance upon this point as subscribers would naturally exact. The Boston Book Company dealing with Greene & Sons would expect from Greene & Sons, just as the individual subscribers would expect from the Canada Law Book Co., a contractual stipulation upon this point and that such a contractual stipulation had been or would be procured by the Boston Book Company from Greene & Sons must, I think, be taken to have been one of the assumptions upon which Mr. Cromarty and Mr. Soule proceeded in concluding their arrangements.\nAll these things, the character of the publication which Greene & Sons were offering to the public as the English Reports Reprint; the fact that the exact identity of the publications to be reproduced was known and the precise number of pages of a given size required to reproduce them could be ascertained; the fact that the appellants and the respondents were themselves publishers and dealers in books and fully understood this; the fact that the publication was being offered at a fixed price per volume, and consequently that the ascertainment of the number of volumes in each set as one of the conditions of the subscribers\u2019 contract within such limits as aforesaid was a point on which the appellants must be prepared for the purpose of securing subscriptions to enter into explicit engagements; these facts not only may but must be considered in construing the document signed by Mr. Soule and Mr. Cromarty for the purpose of ascertaining what was the subject matter of the sale.\nReading the document in light of the facts mentioned, two things appear to me to be almost manifest, 1st, that the English Reports Reprint means a reprint of all reports mentioned in Greene & Sons circular; and 2nd, a reprint embodied in about 150 volumes of about 1,500 pages each. In other words, that the parenthetical language \u201c150 volumes more or less\u201d is part of the description of the thing sold.\nThe phrase \u201cmore or less\u201d has of course no fixed quantitative significance. Its precise import and bearing upon the meaning and effect of any instrument in which it occurs must depend upon the subject matter and circumstances of the transaction. It is questionable perhaps whether decided cases ascribing to it a precise effect in particular circumstances can safely be taken as a guide in other cases. It has sometimes been treated as manifesting simply an intention that the figure given should be regarded as an estimate only, e.g. in Cockerell v. Aucompte[16] and in other cases it has been considered to denote that the quantitative expression which it qualifies though not mathematically exact is accepted as expressing an approximation to the number or other magnitude in relation to which the parties are contracting as closely as the particular business in a practica way admits of, e.g., in Finch v. Zenith Co.[17]. Here this phrase is to be construed in light of the considerations already mentioned and those considerations seem to give the key to its meaning. In a sense the number given\u2014150\u2014is an estimate but it is an estimate given by experts in possession of all the data required for the purpose of arriving at a judgment almost exact as to the number of volumes required. This number must necessarily, in some degree, be matter of uncertainty because it was thought, no doubt for very good reasons, desirable that in every case a volume of the reprint should contain only completed volumes of the republished reports, a condition necessarily resulting, no doubt, in some disparity in the size of different volumes of the reprint; and other circumstances also may have contributed to the uncertainty on this point. Some latitude therefore must be allowed as to the number of volumes which each set was to contain, but to that latitude strictly ascertainable limits might be set; and bearing in mind the fact the appellants had no contractual relations with Greene & Sons while it was quite understood that the figure given (150) must be the basis of contractual stipulations by the appellants in the agreements with their customers, I think these words \u201cmore or less\u201d must be considered to contemplate only such departure from the estimate (of 150) as should be regarded as reasonably arising from exigencies of publication which in the circumstances might naturally be unforeseen or overlooked; and that the figure given (subject to such reasonable degree of inexactitude as would not be incompatible with the skill and care to be expected in such circumstances) was accepted as part of the description of the thing they were dealing with. The law applicable in such circumstances is settled. Where goods are sold by description there is an implied condition that they shall correspond with the description; Bowes v. Shand[18]; and such implied conditions go to the root of the contract and if the appellants when delivery of the first volume was tendered had been informed that the work was to be in sets of 200 instead of 150 volumes they could have declined to accept the book and would also have had a right of action for breach of an implied contract that the designated reports would be contained in a set of about 150 volumes. Bowes v. Shand18.\nHaving accepted the volumes delivered the right to reject is lost, but they have a cause of action as upon a warranty that the work as delivered would comply with the description in the contract. This right the appellants are entitled to assert in an independent action; and they are entitled also in the action brought by the respondents to set up in diminution of, or as a complete answer to, the respondents\u2019 claim the loss they have suffered by reason of the difference in value between the thing agreed to be sold and that delivered; Mondel v. Steel[19]. This reduction or extinction of price is not by way of set off, and is regarded as satisfaction only pro tanto (1) (per Parke B. at pages 870 and 871); and consequently damages in excess of the amount so allowed can be recovered in another action or by counter-claim. In this case if this exceed the amount sued for the action should be dismissed with costs. There should be a reference to ascertain the damages and further consideration and costs (except costs of the appeals which the appellants should have) should be reserved. ANGLIN J.\u2014I agree with the view which prevailed in the provincial courts that what we have to deal with in this case is not an agreement for an agency, but a contract for the sale and purchase of goods. The parties put that contract in writing, in June 1900, in the following terms:\u2014\nThe Canada Law Book Company agree to take two hundred copies of each volume of the set (one hundred and fifty volumes more or less) at a price of ten shillings and sixpence (10s. 6d.) per volume, bound in half roan, f.o.b. Edinburgh; payment to be made by the Canada Law Book Company on each volume three months after shipment of the volume from Edinburgh.\nThe \u201ctwo hundred copies\u201d was a few months later changed by mutual consent to 150 copies and was eventually fixed at 175 copies.\nThe \u201cset\u201d had reached 160 volumes at the time of the trial; 164 volumes have now been delivered; and it seems reasonable to expect that when complete the \u201cset\u201d will comprise from 187 to 195 volumes. The vendor sues for the price of volumes nos. 151, 152, 153 and 154. The purchaser contests this demand and counterclaims for $20,000 as damages for breach of contract, and for specific performance.\nThe question presented is whether the words \u201cone hundred and fifty volumes more or less\u201d were introduced into the contract as mere words of estimate so that the purchaser bound itself to take and pay for the entire \u201cset\u201d at the price of 10s. 6d. per volume, however great the number of volumes it should be made to comprise, or whether these words constituted a part of the description of the subject-matter of the contract, non-fulfilment of which, as a \u201ccondition\u201d would entitle the purchaser to reject the goods and repudiate all liability, or, in the alternative, taking the goods, to recover damages as for breach of a warranty. The law on this subject is fully discussed in the judgment of the late Lord Justice Fletcher\u2011Moulton in Wallis, Son & Wells v. Pratt & Haynes[20], unanimously and wholly approved by the House of Lords[21]\nI say not \u201cfor a breach of warranty\u201d, but \u201cas for a breach of warranty,\u201d because, after a careful study of the evidence, I agree with the learned judges who have held that intention on the part of the vendor to enter into an undertaking (as to the number of volumes to be comprised in the set) collateral to the express object of the contract (Chanter v. Hopkins[22] has not been shewn. Heilbut, Symons v. Buckleton[23]. With very great respect, the effort to make of this case one of warranty collateral to the sale from the outset, if I may so put it, seems to have introduced confusion of thought and led to misconception of the true issue. If the statement of the number of volumes imports contractual obligation on the part of the vendor it is because it forms a part of the description of the goods sold. Was that the purpose of its insertion in the contract? The words in themselves are susceptible of being so regarded or of being treated merely as an estimate. In which sense they were in fact used must be determined by the context, if it affords the necessary cue, and, if not, by consideration of\nthe circumstances and the grounds upon which the contract was entered into\n(Beal on Legal Interpretation, 2nd ed. p. 123) and the object with which the words in question were inserted. Hart v. Standard Marine Ins. Co.[24]. While the \u201cset\u201d is described in an earlier clause of the contract as \u201cthe English Reports Reprint,\u201d to be published by William Green & Sons of Edinburgh, it is common ground that in order to have an adequate description of the subject-matter of the sale recourse must be had to a prospectus issued by the Edinburgh firm which the vendor (The Boston Book Company) placed in the hands of the purchaser (The Canada Law Book Company) before the contract was made. In its statement of claim the vendor says that its contract with the defendant\nwas entered into with reference to this prospectus, which is made a part of the said contract, and to which the plaintiff craves leave to refer at the trial of this action.\nAlthough the truth of this allegation, because not admitted in the statement of defence, was in issue under the Ontario practice, the evidence fully warrants the conclusion that the subject\u2011matter of the contract sued upon was the set of books described in the Edinburgh prospectus. The learned trial judge found that\nthis circular was before the parties to this action as the foundation of the contract made, and may, I think, be referred to as shewing what was meant by the English reprint referred to in the agreement.\nExtraneous evidence is admissible (even in the case of a memorandum required to satisfy the Statutes of Frauds)\nof every material fact which will enable the Court to ascertain the nature and qualities of the subject-matter of the instrument,\nor, in other words, to understand the subject-matter of the contract. Bank of New Zealand v. Simpson[25]. The description of the subject-matter given in the heading of the prospectus is\na complete re-issue of all the decisions of all the English Courts from the earliest times to 1865, in one uniform set of 150 volumes, forming \u201cThe English Reports,\u201d 1,300 to 1865. In the body of the prospectus was the following paragraph:\u2014\nWith the object of proving whether it were possible to print such an enormous mass of material in a good readable type and in a series of volumes which could be accommodated in an ordinary small bookcase, careful calculations and experiments in paper and printing have been made. It has been found as the result of these * * * that a complete set of all the decisions, from the earliest times to 1865, can be given to the profession in about 150 volumes of 1,500 pages each, * * *. The set when complete will occupy actually less room than a set of the official Law Reports from 1865 to date. How this desirable result will be attained is shewn on the specimen pages enclosed.\nThe accompanying specimen pages, printed as part of the prospectus, exhibited a copy of the original of page 127 of volume IX of Clark & Finnelly\u2019s House of Lords Reports and, opposite to it, a proposed page of the reprint containing all of pages 127 and 128 and most of page 129 of the Clark & Finnelly volume. In a note, printed between these two specimen pages, it is stated that\nthe re-issue will be printed in volumes of about 1,500 pages each. * * * By these means from 6 to 8 volumes of the Reports will be condensed into one volume of the \u201cEnglish Reports\u201d, of the handy size shewn on the other side.\nOn another page of the prospectus occurs the following:\u2014\nThe number of volumes in each series will be approximately as follows:\u2014\nHouse of Lords.....................................................................................\n11\nvolumes\nPrivy Council.........................................................................................\n6\n\u201c\nChancery...............................................................................................\n23\n\u201c\nKing\u2019s and Queen\u2019s Bench..................................................................\n32\n\u201c\nRolls Court.............................................................................................\n7\n\u201c\nVice Chancellor\u2019s Court.......................................................................\n13\n\u201c\nCommon Pleas.....................................................................................\n19\n\u201c\nExchequer.............................................................................................\n12\n\u201c\nEcclesiastical, Admiralty and Probate and Divorce.........................\n8\n\u201c\nBankruptcy and Mercantile Cases.....................................................\n5\n\u201c\nCrown Cases........................................................................................\n3\n\u201c\nNisi Prius...............................................................................................\n6\n\u201c\nBail Courts............................................................................................\n5\n\u201c It requires little argument to prove that a series containing all these reports in a moderate number of well printed volumes at one-eighth of their present cost and occupying only about one-tenth of their shelf-room must certainly become for all time coming the accepted edition for general use and reference.\nThe subject-matter of the contract in my opinion was not a set of \u201cthe English Reports\u201d to comprise an indefinite number of volumes\u2014merely estimated at 150\u2014but a set of the English Reports to consist of \u201cone hundred and fifty volumes more or less\u201d; and the vendor represented that its undertaking would be carried out by making each volume contain about 1,500 pages printed as indicated in the specimen page submitted.\nThe plaintiffs thus state the purview of the contract in their reply:\nAccording to the said contract * * * the defendant agreed to purchase from the plaintiff company one hundred and fifty copies of each volume of the set of English Reports reprinted, each set to contain one hundred and fifty volumes more or less, and each volume to contain fifteen hundred pages, more or less, for the price mentioned, and the plaintiff denies that there was any agreement that each volume of said sets was to contain at least fifteen hundred pages.\nExcept, perhaps, that the statement of the paginal content of each volume was rather a representation as to the intended method of carrying out the stipulation as to the number of volumes than itself a term of the actual agreement, this is, in my opinion, a correct statement of the contract between the parties; and upon it the defendant is, I think, entitled to maintain its counter-claim.\nMuch was made in argument of the fact that the price stipulated for in the contract is not a lump sum, but so much per volume. But the volume for which the fixed price was agreed to be paid was a volume not of indefinite size but to contain \u201cabout\u201d, or \u201capproximately,\u201d 1,500 pages, or, at least, a number of pages sufficient to permit of the whole \u201cset\u201d being completed in about 150 volumes, the size of the pages, the number of lines in each and the style of type being specified. If the very different view of the contract now contended for on behalf of the vendor were correct the defendant would have been bound to accept as a fulfilment of it volumes of say 200 pages each and to pay for a set comprising not 150 volumes or thereabouts, but upwards of 1,000 volumes, should the publishers see fit to extend the series to that extent. The suggestion that the parties intended any such contract is simply preposterous.\nThe evidence leaves no room for doubt that had the set been published in uniform volumes of about 1,500 pages each, with pages of the size and printed with the type shewn in the specimen exhibited in the prospectus, the entire set would have been completed in the \u201c150 volumes more or less,\u2019 contracted for. What the defendant bought and had a right to expect to receive was uniform sets of \u201c150 volumes more or less\u201d of \u201cabout 1,500 pages each\u201d. The number of volumes was in my opinion an essential part of the description of the goods bought.\nI extract the following passage from the judgment of Mr. Justice Riddell:\u2014\nThe first matter calling for comment is that in 1902 the publishers, whose prospectus was for the publication of the Privy Council Reports in 6 volumes, after publishing volumes 12-17 of the series, and thereby completing the Privy Council Reports ordinarily referred to, added three volumes, 18-20, of Indian Appeals, not, it is said, contemplated in the original proposition. This, the plaintiff says, was due to Stevens & Sons, whose name appears with Green & Sons as publishers, owning the copyright, and that they were unwisely grasping in extending these additional volumes to three reprint books, when they could easily have been put into two at most, or even by mamtaining the size of the early volumes consistently these additions could have been so combined as to make only one extra volume beyond announcement (letter May 21st, 1902). When we see that volumes 12-17 have an average of 820 pages only, 4,960 pages in all, and volumes 18, 19 and 20 have 999, 1,099, and 926 respectively, an average of 1,008 pages, 3,024 pages in all, the truth of the statement just referred to is manifest. The total paging of the Privy Council Reports is 7,984 less than 6 volumes of 1,500 each.\nSix volumes containing an average of 820 pages each certainly did not evince a genuine effort to produce a set of uniform volumes containing about 1,500 pages each. Volume 16 contains 837 pages; volume 17, 596 pages, the two volumes together making 1,433 pages, or less than the proposed 1,500 of a single volume. It is difficult to conceive of any honest explanation for not including these two books, which contain Moore\u2019s (N.S.) Privy Council Reports, vols. 3-6 and 7-9 respectively, in one volume. In the absence of the publisher I withhold further comment.\nHad the complete set as actually published been all tendered for delivery at once the defendant, in my opinion, would have been entitled to reject it as not corresponding to the particular description under which it was sold. But the books had, as was contemplated by the parties, been resold by the defendant to its subscribers before, or immediately upon, the contract being made with the plaintiff. The volumes were delivered not in a complete set but as each came from the press. The first six volumes contained, respectively 1,606, 1,335, 1,491, 1,403, 1,439 and 1,619 pages\u2014or an average of 1,482 pages apiece. There was no substantial ground for complaint up to this point. The six volumes averaged \u201capproximately\u201d or \u201cabout\u201d the 1,500 pages each mentioned in the prospectus. By the delivery of these six volumes to the subscribers the defendant was fully committed to the enterprise and its opportunity for rescission was gone forever. It retained, however, its right to recover damages for non-fulfilment of the contract in the subsequent deliveries. That right it preserved, so far as may have been necessary, by frequent letters of protest. It is perhaps worthy of note in passing that one of those letters elicited from the plaintiff, on the 13th of November, 1902, the statement:\u2014\nI think Green (the Scotch publisher) said that he had found that volumes of the average of 1,200 pages would bring the whole series of the reprint into 150 volumes.\nIt is argued, however, by the plaintiff that the words \u201cmore or less\u201d, appended to the words \u201cone hundred and fifty volumes\u201d in the contract, must be read in the broadest sense and provide a margin wide enough to cover the extra 37-45 volumes which it now seems reasonable to anticipate will be required to complete the set. Indeed, as Mr. Justice Riddell observes, the attitude of the plaintiff throughout, as indicated in the correspondence and the pleadings, has been that \u201cthe number of volumes is not stated absolutely but qualifiedly.\u201d It has not treated the \u201cone hundred and fifty volumes more or less\u201d as the mere estimate for which it now seeks to have it taken, but rather as importing merely the right to exceed 150 volumes by such margin as the words \u201cmore or less\u201d might afford.\nRegard being had to all the circumstances, and more especially to the terms of the prospectus, I find in the addition of the words \u201cmore or less\u2019 an indication not that a mere estimate was imported by the statement in the contract of the projected number of volumes, but rather that the plaintiff always recognized in the words \u201cone hundred and fifty volumes\u201d an essential part of the description of the subject-matter of the sale and accordingly qualified what would otherwise have been an absolute undertaking that the number of volumes should not exceed 150. The facts in evidence shew that the governing words of the description are those specifying the number of volumes. Benjamin on Sale (9 ed.) 803, 813.\nI am, with great respect, unable to accept the view that the defendant\u2019s counter-claim should be rejected as premature. There may not have been a breach of the plaintiff\u2019s contract when it delivered the first volumes containing substantially less than \u201cabout 1,500 pages\u201d. For some time it was possible that the deficiency might be remedied by making subsequent volumes larger. That possibility, however, is long since past, and the breach was complete when it ceased to exist. There is no reason why, applying the principle of Mondel v. Steel[26] the damages for such breach already sustained should not be applied, as far as the value of the \u201cset\u201d is thereby diminished, pro tanto in diminution or extinction of the contract price, so far as unpaid\u2014no reason why the defendant should be compelled to pay for the volumes already delivered in excess of \u201c150 volumes more or less\u201d, and for those yet to be delivered, and be obliged to take the chance of subsequent recoupment on its counterclaim. Government of Newfoundland v. Newfoundland Railway Co.[27].\nThe defendant has asserted that counterclaim for the whole of the damages it has sustained and will sustain by reason of the plaintiff\u2019s breach of contract. It can probably now be ascertained with at least approximate exactness how many additional volumes will be required to complete the \u201cset\u201d. In arriving at this figure care must of course be taken that it is not put higher than will be entirely fair to the plaintiff. I agree with Mr. Justice Riddell\u2019s view, however, that the damages should now be assessed once for all and that the proper course to adopt for this purpose is the reference which he suggests. A new trial seems to me to be unnecessary under the Ontario practice. (Ont. J.A., R.S.O., c. 56, ss. 64, 65.)\nWhat number of volumes in excess of 150 the plaintiff may claim it was within the contemplation of the parties might be comprised in the \u201cset\u201d without breach of contract, by virtue of the margin provided for by the words \u201cmore or less\u201d, must still be determined. No doubt these words sometimes have the effect of rendering the statement of quantity in the contract nothing more than an estimate, as was held in McLay v. Perry[28]; but see McConnell v. Murphy[29]. Here, having regard to the circumstances under which, and especially to the terms of the prospectus \u201cwith reference to which the contract was entered into,\u201d consideration of which is vital to its construction (Morris v. Levison[30], it is impossible to give them any such effect. The materiality of the number of volumes is too apparent. The number of volumes requisite to furnish a complete reprint, (the size of the pages, number of Unes to each page, and type being specified) was susceptible of precise mathematical determination; and the prospectus stated that it had been so determined. The case then was not one for an estimate at all. The only element of uncertainty was due to the desirability that the whole of each of the original volumes should be found in a single volume of the reprint\u2014that an original volume should not be split, or divided, so that part of it would appear in one volume and the rest in the succeeding volume of the reprint. This might necessitate some of the volumes of the latter falling slightly short of, and others slightly exceeding the average of 1,500 pages projected. Hence the statement in the prospectus that the volumes would each contain \u201capproximately\u201d or \u201cabout\u201d 1,500 pages and the contractual provision that the set would number \u201c150 volumes more or less\u201d. The words \u201cmore or less\u201d\u2014equivalent to \u201cabout\u201d\u2014are introduced in such a case.\nfor the purpose of providing against accidental variations arising from slight and unimportant excesses or deficiencies in number, measure or weight.\nBrawley v. United States[31]; British Whig Publishing Co. v. Eddy[32]. \u201cMore or less\u2019 are words of general import and the excess or deficiency, as the case may be, which they cover bears a very small proportion to the amount named. Cross v. Eglin[33]. They provide \u201ca margin for a moderate excess or diminution of the quantity.\u201d Reuter v. Sala[34].\nIn Morris v. Levison[35] 3 per cent either way was, under the circumstances, held to be a fair allowance under the word \u201cabout\u201d. In \u201cThe Resolven\u201d[36] a margin of 5 per cent was allowed under the word \u201cthereabouts.\u201d No doubt any margin fixed must be \u201cmore or less\u201d arbitrary. Having regard to the terms of the prospectus, however, as affording some indication of what the parties must have had it in mind to provide for, and to the precision with which the number of volumes requisite to complete the set could have been, and was in fact, stated to have been ascertained, I think an allowance affording \u201ca reasonable latitude\u201d must be confined to such excess as suitable arrangement of the matter in volumes and trifling error in calculation, practically unavoidable, might entail.\nI would allow the appeal with costs here and in the Appellate Division. There should be a reference to the master to ascertain any balance of purchase money due the plaintiff and the amount of the defendants\u2019 damages and the balance due either party, after making set-off.\nOther costs and further directions should be referred to the Supreme Court of Ontario.\nBRODEUK J.\u2014I concur with my brother Sir Walter Cassels.\nMIGNAULT J.\u2014I concur with my brother Anglin J.\nCASSELS J.\u2014I have given the best consideration that I am capable of to the appeal argued before this court on the 9th day of March, 1922. With all due respect to the opinions of a majority of the judges who heard the case at the trial and on the appeal, I am unable to arrive at the conclusions they have come to. With some exceptions of a minor character, which I will subsequently deal with, I am of opinion that the view pronounced by Mr. Justice Riddell is the correct one, that there was a warranty on the part of the Boston Book Company, and that the Canada Law Book Company, Limited, were entitled to have damages for a breach of such warranty.\nThe facts are so fully dealt with in the various judgments under review that it is unnecessary for me to repeat them. I agree with the view arrived at by Mr. Justice Riddell, that the contract between the Boston Book Company and the Canada Law Book Company is a contract of sale and purchase.\nIn the plaintiff\u2019s statement of claim, after referring to the two contracts of the 5th June, 1900, and the 19th November, 1900, the plaintiff states as follows:\u2014\nAt the time the said agreements were entered into the defendant had in its possession a prospectus issued by William Green & Sons stating in general terms their plans for the issue of the English Reports Reprint and the contract between the plaintiff and the defendant was entered into with reference to this prospectus which was made a part of the said contract and to which the plaintiff craves leave to refer at the trial of this action.\nThere is no privity between the Canada Law Book Company, Limited, and William Green & Sons.\nIn his reasons for judgment Mr. Justice Middleton is reported as stating as follows:\u2014\nIn other words, the estimate of 423 volumes for the work so far as it has gone has been exceeded to the extent of 37 volumes, the publication having actually yielded 160 volumes, and if the same proportion holds good for the 27 remaining estimated volumes the actual result will be 192 or 193 volumes, an excess of result over estimate of one\u2011third.\nIt is stated in the same judgment:\nAs contemplated by the parties, the defendants have sold to individual customers.\nIt was known to the Boston Book Company, that the object of the purchase by the Canada Law Book Company, Limited, was to re-sell them to their customers.\nMr. Justice Middleton states:\u2014\nUnfortunately I have before me only the parties to this action, and cannot deal in any way with those really at fault\u2014the publishers. Mr. Tilley presented various theories which might account for some discrepancy between the number estimated and the number produced, but slight investigation has made it plain that this will not account for more than a small fraction of the excess; and, so far, I am convinced that there has been on the part of the publishers a deliberate design to increase the number of volumes over the estimate. He states further:\u2014\nI can only regret that the parties did not join in an attack upon the publishers, against whom, unless more appears than was developed in the evidence in this case, a remedy ought to be found.\nIt seems to me that if the learned trial judge\u2019s views are correct, and that the Boston Book Company would have a remedy over against the Edinburgh publishers, it would follow that the contract between the Boston Book Company and the Canada Law Book Company, Limited, based upon the same representations as were made by the Edinburgh company to the Boston Book Company, would entitle the Canada Law Book Company, Limited, to a remedy against the Boston Book Company for breach of their representation which practically amounts to a warranty. The Boston Book Company would have their remedy against the Edinburgh Company.\nIn addition to the authorities referred to by Mr. Justice Riddell, I would quote from the case of Lloyd Limited v. Sturgeon Falls Pulp Co.[37]. It is a case decided by two judges of eminence, and was very fully argued by very eminent counsel on both sides. The case arose out of a contract of sale, the facts of which are set out in the letters marked \u201cS.T. and U\u201d at the foot of page 164 of the report. There had been a reference under the English statute to arbitration,\u2014the arbitrator named being the present Sir Charles Fitzpatrick. A reference was directed by the arbitrator for the decision of the English court upon a question among others of very great importance. On page 163 of the report in the Law Times, it is stated that the claimant sought to give evidence that the contract between the parties was not confined to the documents above referred to, S.T. and U, but that amongst the terms of the contract which they claimed was partly in writing and partly verbal, upon which they purchased the properties in question, or in the alternative amongst the matters verbally warranted to them by the defendants in consideration of which they agreed to and did enter into the contract of purchase were the following; the important one is contained on page 163, par. 8 (b):\nThat there was an inexhaustible supply of pulp wood upon the area comprised in the Government concession and more than the claimants operating on the scale contemplated by the parties or any other possible extension of such scale could exhaust within twenty-one years.\nBruce J states:\nA warranty in a sale is not one of the essential elements of a contract, but the sale is none the less complete in the absence of a warranty\u2014but it is a collateral undertaking forming part of the contract by the agreement, etc.\nOn page 166 on the top of the second column, the judge states:\nWe must decide that the verbal warranty alleged in paragraph 8 (b) must be regarded as a term so far collateral to the contract set out in the letters S.T.U. that oral evidence is admissible to establish the warranty.\nThere is no suggestion that the respondents, the Canada Law Book Company, Limited, are not sufficiently responsible for the amount awarded by the judgment of the trial judge, and in my view the proper order that should be made is to allow the appeal with costs in this court, and in the Appellate Division, with a direction that if the parties fail to agree there should be a re-trial enabling the present appellants to set up their claim for damages, and if they succeed then to the amount to which they may be held entitled, there should be a set-off as against the amount awarded by the judgment.

Mignault J. hesitante.\nIt is not necessary that the continuance of possession shall be with the consent of the lessor evidenced by some positive act. Mere non-interference therewith on his part suffices.\nPer Duff J. The interest created by a covenant to renew a lease for years at the option of the lessee is a present interest defeasible only by the election of the latter to discontinue possession. It is a vested right not one subject to fulfilment of a condition precedent.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario[1], reversing the judgment at the trial[2] in favour of the plaintiff.\nThe appellant company leased property to the respondents for five years with a covenant for renewal at expiration of the term for the same period at the option of the lessee. The term expired at the end of December 1920. Respondents remained in possession and on Jan. 7th, 1920, appellant verbally notified the manager of the respondents that their lease and option had expired, that they were overholding tenants and possession of the premises was demanded. The respondents immediately after wrote to appellant that they had accepted the option to renew, enclosing a cheque for one month\u2019s rent at the increased rent called for by the terms for renewal. The appellant in answer reiterated its possession and returned the cheque. They they then began proceedings to recover possession under the Landlord and Tenant Act.\nThe trial judge held that the respondents had not remained in possession with the express consent of the lessor and that their right to renew was gone. The appellate Division reversed his decision on the ground that they were bound by the case of Brewer v. Conger[3] which decided that express consent was not necessary. The plaintiffs then appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nNesbitt K.C. and K.F. Mackenzie for the appellant. Prima facie the option to renew granted by the lease must expire with it. The natural conclusion then is that it must be exercised within a reasonable time before the term ends as said by Bruce J in Lewis v. Stephenson[4].\nThe respondents were only tenants at sufferance and their possession was adverse and might have ripened into a title. See Ley v. Peter[5]. The decisions relied on by the Appellate Division are based on Hersey v. Giblett[6]. That case had been misunderstood. A house was let to Hersey as a yearly tenant thereof and he was in possession under that agreement when he exercised the option given therein to take a lease. Moss v. Barton[7] and Buckland v. Papillon[8] follow Hersey v. Giblett6 considered as deciding that the option can be exercised so long as the lessee is in possession with the lessor\u2019s consent.\nR.J. McLaughlin K.C. for the respondents. An option to renew contemplates continuation of the relation of lessor and lessee and its exercise is not restricted to the duration of the term. See Halsbury vol. 18 page 393, par. 845. The only authority to the contrary which is cited is Lewis v. Stephenson[9].\u2019 But that is only a dictum by a single judge which is dissented from in Allen v. Murphy[10].\nBrewer v. Conger[11] is in line with the decisions in England and the rule there followed should be confirmed.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014I am of opinion that this appeal must be dismissed with costs.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014The appellant seeks to eject respondents as overholding tenants from office premises which had been held by them under it by virtue of a lease for the term of five years to be computed from the 1st day of January, 1916, and they, by way of defence, rely upon the following option of a renewal given in and by said lease:\u2014 The lessees are hereby granted the option of renewing this lease for a period of five years from the expiration of the term hereby granted at a rental of $2,575.00 per annum on the same terms and conditions as herein set out except that as to renewal.\nThere is nothing restricting respondents to exercise said option within any specified time as usually is in the like cases of lease, and hence what is reasonable must be the limits of the right so existent.\nNothing was expressly said by either party as to renewal until the 7th of January, 1921, when appellant\u2019s manager intimated it did not intend to renew, and respondents instantly expressed their intention to exercise the option so given and, by letter reiterating same and enclosing a cheque for the first month\u2019s rent, repeated the exercise of the option. Preceding this there had been an expenditure of nearly four hundred dollars by appellant, at the expense of the respondents, in way of changes in the office partitions during the last few months of the expiring term which must have made plain to appellant the intention to renew.\nThe appellant was bound by the terms of the lease to perform many daily services in way of lighting, heating, elevating, supplying water, etc., which it does not pretend by any proof adduced to have interrupted and thereby asserted its claims as it might have done against a mere wrongful overholder.\nIn argument its counsel stoutly asserts that there is no evidence on the point and suggests the burden of proving that rested on the respondents.\nWith deference, I submit that in reply to any one trying to apply the rather narrow argument, put forward, that respondents were debarred from exercising their option after the 1st of January, 1921, unless they can and do shew that the appellant actually did something in way of assenting to their stay, it is not an unfair inference of fact in our climate, in order to meet such an argument, that if it had been possible to support it by evidence that would have been adduced.\nIn the court below there seems to have arisen an error as to the date of the first meeting between the manager of the appellant and one of the respondents. It is stated as having taken place on the fifth instead of the seventh, which counsel on each side are agreed is the correct date.\nThat shews how instantaneous the response on the part of the respondents was to the suggestion of the manager of appellant as to renewal.\nIt meets the situation which both the Master of the Rolls and Lord Chelmsford respectively suggested as the duty of a landlord before setting up delay as an answer to the exercise of an option.\nThese possibly new features of argument adduced before us are all, I think, that are not amply covered by the reasons assigned in the judgment of the Chief Justice of Ontario in dealing with the case as presented below and in which reasoning I fully concur and need not repeat here.\nI think this appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDUFF J.\u2014The operation of a covenant by a lessor to renew at the option of the lessee is a subject which has been much discussed and especially as touching the application of the rule against perpetuities. Such a covenant, even where the original lease is a lease for lives, does not come under the ban of the rule where it is wholly in the control of persons having vested interests in the lease. It has been said that this is an exception to the rule against perpetuities (Jessel, M.R. in London and South Western Ry. Co. v. Gomm[12] at page 579); but the so called exception has been supported upon another ground, namely, that the covenant to renew is part of the lessee\u2019s present interest. And in the case of an absolute covenant to renew a lease for years at the option of the lessee, it seems to be undeniable that the equitable interest created is not an interest to arise in future on fulfilment of a condition precedent but a present interest annexed to the land from its inception defeasible on a condition subsequent depending upon the election of the lessee to continue or to drop his possession. The vesting of a longer term does, no doubt, depend upon the happening of another event, namely, the application for renewal, but the present right, the right to have a renewal on application, is a different thing. That is a vested right, not a right to arise in future upon the happening of a condition precedent. This is the view expressed by the learned author of Gray on Perpetuities, 1915, pages 203-204, and by the learned author of Williams on Vendors and Purchasers in an elaborate discussion of the subject in 42 Solicitors Journal, at page 630. In support of it there is the statement of Jessel M.R. in Moore v. Clench[13], and of Farwell J., in Muller v. Trafford[14].\nThis view of the effect of such a covenant is not without its bearing upon the question raised by the present appeal. It harmonizes with the reasoning upon which the decision of Sir John Romilly, in Moss v. Barton[15], as well as that of Lord Chelmsford in Buckland v. Papillon[16], is based. Both treat the covenant to renew as vesting a right in the lessee which the lessee may exercise so long as he has not lost his right by electing not to exercise it. By going out of possession at the end of the term he would obviously exercise his option against renewal. If he continue in possession the lessor is in a position to call upon him at any time to say whether he will remain or take a lease; that the lessor is entitled to do, and the corelative obligation would rest upon the lessee to exercise his right by taking a lease or to lose it. This view appears to have been acted upon by the Court of Appeal of Ontario in Brewer v. Conger[17].\nIt is now argued that the decisions in England in effect establish the rule that at the expiry of the term the right to exercise the option is gone if the lessee has not already exercised it unless he continue in possession with the consent of the landlord\u2014consent meaning in this connection something more than a consent inferred from mere passivity.\nI do not so interpret the decisions in question. The principle as appears sufficiently, I think, from the reasoning of Lord Chelmsford as well as that of Sir John Romilly, which, as I have intimated already, accords with the view that in other connections has been taken of the effect of such a covenant, is that the lessee\u2019s option remains open and exercisable until he has done something which concludes it. It is quite true that in both these cases the lessee who had remained in possession for some years after the expiry of the lease had been in possession with the active assent of the lessor who had accepted rent and given the lessee thereby the status of tenant from year to year. But there must have been a period in both cases in which the lessee was in occupation without the assent of the lessor. There is nothing, I think, in the language of the judgments to indicate that during this period the right of the lessee to renew was supposed to be in suspense. On the contrary, both the Lord Chancellor and the Master of the Rolls pointedly emphasize the power of the lessor over the situation by reason of the circumstance that he is entitled at any time to call upon the lessee to elect whether he will take a lease or not. That is something which could hardly have reference to a time when the lessee was in possession under a tenancy from year to year, but must refer to a time when the lessor was entitled to demand possession of the premises but for the lessee\u2019s right to have a lease. In the result this view seems to accord with the convenience of the situation because the lessor, who admittedly remains until the last day of the term in the lands of the lessee as to the matter of renewal, is entitled the moment the term is expired to require the lessee to make his election; and it is entirely consistent with the view of such covenants that excludes them from the operation of the rule against perpetuities\u00bb There is moreover weighty evidence shewing that this is the accepted view. In Fry, Specific Performance, it is laid down without qualification that where no time is limited and where the landlord has never called on the tenant to declare his option, mere lapse of time will not preclude the tenant or his assign from exercising it. To the same effect is a decision of the Irish Court of Appeal in Allen v. Murphy[18], and a long series of American decisions. Indeed the view advocated by the respondent seems necessarily to involve the proposition that the option, unless exercised, does terminate with the lease, in the absence of something done by the lessor to extend it. For the lessee who merely remains in possession does nothing indicating an intention to abandon his right to a lease; he fails to procure the lessor\u2019s consent, that is all.\nThis is not enough because the basis of the cases above referred to is no more verbal formula. It, rests upon this very substantial foundation that the lessee has a present interest arising from the covenant and that this interest is not conditioned by his duty to ask for a lease before the expiration of the term or within any limited period. His right to call for a lease is qualified by the condition that if he gives up possession at the end of the term he loses it because thereby he exercised his option. If he remains in possession the landlord can force him to exercise his election by setting up his right to a lease in response to the landlord\u2019s demand for possession.\nIt is argued by Mr. Nesbitt that the principle of the English cases is excluded in consequence of the presence of a special provision that the lessee remaining in possession with the assent of the lessor should be deemed to be held as monthly tenant on specified terms.\nI am unable to agree with this conclusion. The Lord Chancellor points out in Buckland v. Papillon[19] that the right to demand a lease would not be one of the terms under which a tenant from year to year holds the premises after the determination of the orginal term. The right to demand a lease, he said, \u201chad nothing whatever to do with the tenancy from year to year\u201d. The option continued to exist not because the lessee holding over had become a tenant from year to year, but because the option had not been determined by the conduct of the lessee.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nANGLIN J.\u2014Much can be said for the opinion that convenience and certainty in regard to the position of landlord and tenant on the expiry of the original term would have been promoted by holding that the right of election for the renewal of a lease, under an option in which no time therefor is fixed, must be exercised before the expiry of the term to be renewed. The weight of American authority would appear to favour this view. The law, as so stated in 29 Cyc. 999, is approved or supported by the following authorities; Robertson v. Drew[20]; Shaw v. Bray[21]; Renoud v. Daskam[22]; Perry v. Rockland Lime Co.[23]; Thiebaud v. First National Bank[24]. A similar opinion was expressed obiter by Bruce J. in Lewis v. Stephenson[25]. But that opinion has been disregarded, if not overruled; Allen v. Murphy[26]; and, at least since Lord Romilly\u2019s decision in Moss v. Barton[27], it must be taken as settled that in English law the exercise of such an option is not restricted to the duration of the original term, if nothing else has occurred to determine it, but endures so long as the lessee continues in possession with the sanction of the lessor. In Moss v. Barton27 Lord Romilly may have unwittingly extended the effect of his own previous decision in Hersey v. Giblett[28], as Mr. Mackenzie contends in his very able factum. The yearly tenancy created by the agreement which contained the option for the lease no doubt subsisted when the tenant, Hersey, sought to exercise the option. But Moss v. Barton[29] was expressly approved in Buckland v. Papillon[30] and no dissent from it was suggested by Lord Chelmsford on the appeal in that case[31]. There an assignee of the tenant, who had continued in possession as a yearly tenant after the expiry of a three year\u2019s term, under an agreement for lease, was held entitled to exercise an option to take a lease for a further term. Lord Chelmsford says:\u2014\nHe continued in possession, and so became tenant from year to year, under the terms of the original agreement. I do not mean to include in those words the right to demand a lease, for that had nothing whatever to do with the tenancy from year to year; but I think that continuing in possession, with the sanction of the landlord, he was entitled to exercise his option. He had done nothing whatever to preclude him from demanding that lease at any time; and if the landlord wished to know upon what terms the tenant held, he might have called upon him to say whether he meant to have a lease or not. As the landlord did not choose to do so, it appears to me that the time was unlimited in which the tenant could demand a lease. As long as he continued tenant with the sanction of the landord, so long he retained his option.\nThe law appears to have been accepted as settled in this sense by leading English text writers; Foa, Landlord and Tenant, 5th ed. page 307; Fry on Specific Performance, 6th ed., page 516; 18 Halsbury L. of E., page 393, No. 845. It was so recognized in Ontario in the case of Brewer v. Conger[32]. In so far as the case last cited, notwithstanding the special circumstances mentioned in the judgment of Maclennan J.A. at page 14, indicative of communication having been made before the expiry of the lease of the tenant\u2019s intention to renew, should be regarded as authority for the proposition that an option for renewal, containing no time limit and no condition, may be exercised after the expiry of the term although the landlord\u2019s sanction to the tenant\u2019s retaining possession has not been shewn, I find it unnecessary to express an opinion upon the accuracy of the decision. Having regard to all the circumstances in the present case, some of which are noticed in the judgment of Meredith C.J.O.[33]\u2014I accept the view of that learned judge that when the landlord\u2019s agent, on the seventh day after the expiry of the term, notified the tenants that their lease had expired and they immediately asserted their right to a renewal and promptly sent a cheque for a month\u2019s rent at the renewal rate specified in the option, they were still in possession with the lessor\u2019s consent within the meaning of the English authorities. Their intimation of an intention to exercise their option was concurrent with the first intimation from the landlord that they could no longer hold possession with its consent and that they would be regarded as overholding tenants.\nThere is nothing to indicate that there had been any consent by the lessor to the creation of a monthly tenancy under the special provision therefor made in the lease. On the contrary, the notification of the 7th of January by the appellant\u2019s agent that the respondents would be regarded as overholding tenants negatives any such consent.\nThe appeal in my opinion fails and should be dismissed with costs. BRODEUR J.\u2014The question to be decided is as to the right of John Stark & Company to a renewal of a lease from the Guardian Realty to them.\nThe lease was made for five years from the 1st of January, 1916, and it was provided that John Stark & Company, the lessees, had the option of renewing the lease for a further period of five years on the same terms.\nSome time before the expiry of the lease the lessees asked for some somewhat extensive repairs which the lessor agreed to make provided their costs should be paid by the lessees. These repairs were made and paid for by the lessees, which shews the intention of the latter to remain on the premises and likely to exercise the option they had by the lease to renew it for a further period of five years.\nThe lessees remained in possession of the premises after the expiry of the lease on the 1st of January, 1921; and on the 7th they wrote the lessor that they had duly accepted the option of renewing the lease and sent their cheque in payment of rent for the then current month.\nThe lessor refused to accept the cheque and claimed that the lease and option had expired and that the lessees were liable for double rent as overholding tenants.\nThe question is whether the option should be accepted during the term of the lease.\nThe contract does not provide as to the date at which the option should be exercised. The law, as stated in Halsbury, vol. 18, page 393, is to the effect that if a lease which creates a tenancy for a term of years confers on the lessee an option to take a lease for a further term, the exercise of the option is not necessarily restricted to the duration of the general original term. This statement of the law is based upon the following decisions:\u2014\nMoss v. Barton[34]; Hersey v. Giblett[35]; Buckland v. Papillon[36].\nIn the latter case the Lord Chancellor, Lord Chelmsford, stated that the option continued after the expiration of the original term until something had been done to determine it and that it would continue so long as the tenant remained in possession with the assent of the landlord; that if the landlord wished to know upon what terms the tenant held he might call upon him to see whether he meant to have a lease or not.\nFry on Specific Performance, 5th ed. par. 1105, expresses a similar view in the following terms:\u2014\nBut where no time has been originally limited within which the tenant\u2019s option to have a lease must be exercised, and the landlord never called upon the tenant to declare his option, mere lapse of time will not preclude the tenant or bis assignee or personal representative from exercising it.\nWe have in Ontario the case of Brewer v. Conger[37], which is to the same effect and which holds that the option continues until something is done to terminate it.\nIn the case of Lewis v. Stephenson[38], there is a dictum of Bruce J. to the effect that the option should be exercised before the termination of the original lease. But this dictum has been dissented from in Allen v. Murphy[39].\nIn view of those authorities, I am of opinion that John Stark & Company properly exercised their option.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs. MIGNAULT J.\u2014With some doubt, I concur in the judgment of my brother Anglin dismissing the appeal. Independently of the authorities cited by him which, I think, conclude the matter, it would seem reasonable that an option to renew a lease should be exercised while the lease is still current, and not as in this case several days after it has come to an end. It is true that the lessees had remained in possession, but there was a clause in the lease stating that if they did so with the consent of the lessor they should be deemed monthly tenants. Now they say that having remained in possession with the consent of the lessor they can exercise their option for a renewal term and are not to be deemed monthly tenants. I bow to the authorities allowing them to do so, but I could not help feeling some doubt.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Mackenzie, Roebuck & Sanderson.\nSolicitors for the respondent: McLaughlin, Johnston, Moorehead & Macaulay.\n[1] 21 Ont.

Cette ruelle est dans une des plus vieilles parties de la cit\u00e9 de Qu\u00e9bec; et, si l'on en juge par les murs qui la bordent et par le pavage qui la recouvre, elle existe depuis un temps imm\u00e9morial et remonterait \u00e0 deux cents ans et peut-\u00eatre plus. Les titres en sont perdus et ne peuvent pas \u00eatre retrac\u00e9s.\nLorsque la cit\u00e9 de Qu\u00e9bec a \u00e9t\u00e9 cadastr\u00e9e en 1870 en vertu des dispositions des articles 2166 et suivants du code civil, cette ruelle a \u00e9t\u00e9 port\u00e9e au plan sous le nom de \"passage\", mais les autorit\u00e9s administratives, comme dans le cas des chemins publics, n'ont pas jug\u00e9 \u00e0 propos de lui donner de num\u00e9ro ni d'en indiquer le propri\u00e9taire. Au livre de renvoi officiel qui accompagne le plan, nous voyons que dans les descriptions des lots 3023, 3023-2 et 3026 cette ruelle est mentionn\u00e9e comme passage entre les nos 3023-3024,3025-3026-3027. Les personnes dont les propri\u00e9t\u00e9s bordaient ce passage s'en sont toujours servi comme de bons voisins, sans molestation et sans embarras. Mais, en 1918, les d\u00e9fendeurs Lemay ont achet\u00e9 l'une de ces propri\u00e9t\u00e9s, soit le n\u00b0 3023 du cadastre, et ont apparemment exig\u00e9 que leur vendeur leur c\u00e8de la moiti\u00e9 du passage; mais le vendeur fut assez prudent de d\u00e9clarer dans l'acte qu'il ne donnait aucune garantie quelconque \"as to his title and his rights thereto\".\nQuelque temps apr\u00e8s leur achat, les d\u00e9fendeurs Lemay ont commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 obstruer le passage en y faisant s\u00e9journer des voitures et en y d\u00e9posant d'autres objets, et l'ont rendu, sinon impossible, du moins difficile d'acc\u00e8s et d'usage pour les autres propri\u00e9taires qui l'avoisinaient.\nLa demanderesse, Madame Emilie Hardy, a cru devoir alors instituer la pr\u00e9sente action en all\u00e9guant qu'elle \u00e9tait propri\u00e9taire du n\u00b0 3026 qui bordait ce passage \u00e0 sa profondeur et a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 ce que les d\u00e9fendeurs soient condamn\u00e9s \u00e0 cesser le trouble; et elle a all\u00e9gu\u00e9 \u00e0 cette fin qu'elle\na toujours \u00e9t\u00e9 en possession, d'un droit de passage dans une ruelle * * * laquelle ruelle a toujours servi de passage commun pour Futilit\u00e9 de tous les h\u00e9ritages y aboutissant, entr'autres celui de la demanderesse et celui des d\u00e9fendeurs.\nLes d\u00e9fendeurs ont plaid\u00e9 qu'ils sont propri\u00e9taires en commun, avec le propri\u00e9taire du n\u00b0 3022, de ce droit de passage et que les titres de la demanderesse n'\u00e9tablissent en sa faveur aucun droit ni servitude de passage.\nLa cour sup\u00e9rieure a maintenu l'action de la demanderesse, et ce jugement a \u00e9t\u00e9 confirm\u00e9 par la cour d'appel qui a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que les d\u00e9fendeurs devaient\ncesser le trouble apport\u00e9 par eux \u00e0 l'exercice du passage dont la demanderesse avait la possession conjointe dans la dite ruelle. La question qui se pr\u00e9sente est donc de savoir si la demanderesse avait dans cette ruelle ou ce passage un droit qui lui permettrait de faire dispara\u00eetre les obstructions que les d\u00e9fendeurs y mettaient.\nLes d\u00e9fendeurs ont beaucoup insist\u00e9 devant cette cour sur le fait que I'action de la demanderesse, qui est de la nature d'une action possessoire, demandait \u00e0 \u00eatre d\u00e9clar\u00e9e possesseur d'un droit de passage, en d'autres termes, d'un droit de servitude pour lequel elle ne pr\u00e9sentait aucun titre.\nIl est vrai que l'expression \"droit de passage\" s'est gliss\u00e9e dans la d\u00e9claration. Mais il me para\u00eet \u00e9vident par les plaidoiries, et surtout par le plaidoyer des d\u00e9fendeurs, que la v\u00e9ritable question en litige est de savoir si la demanderesse a un droit de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 dans cette ruelle ou ce passage, ou encore si elle y a des droits suffisants pour lui permettre de demander que les d\u00e9fendeurs soient tenus de lui laisser la libre jouissance d'y passer.\nChose assez int\u00e9ressante, c'est que ces expressions \"passage\" et \"droit de passage\" ont souvent pr\u00eat\u00e9 \u00e0 l'\u00e9quivoque, m\u00eame chez les auteurs et dans la jurisprudence, et qu'il n'y a pas lieu d'\u00eatre surpris alors si nous trouvons la m\u00eame absence de pr\u00e9cision dans la d\u00e9claration.\nAinsi, par exemple, Pardessus, Trait\u00e9 des servitudes, vol. 1er, n\u00b0 231, nous dit:\nLe mot passage est \u00e9quivoque, puisqu'il peut tr\u00e8s grammaticalement \u00eatre expliqu\u00e9 dans le sens de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 du terrain sur lequel on passe, ou dans le sens d'une servitude consistant \u00e0 passer sur le fonds d'autrui * * *\nCe serait aux juges \u00e0 les r\u00e9soudre (les doutes qui peuvent provenir de l'emploi de ce mot).\nLa cour de cassation, en 1836, (Sirey, 1836-1-1867), a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que le passage reconnu n\u00e9cessaire sur un terrain communal pour mener des bestiaux \u00e0 l'abreuvoir peut \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 non comme une servitude de psssage mais bien comme un mode de jouissance de la chose commune.\nFuzier-Herman, R\u00e9pertoire, vbo. Servitudes, n\u00b0 17, nous d\u00e9clare que la distinction entre l'usage d'une chose \u00e0 titre de servitude et l'usage d'une chose \u00e0 titre de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 est parfois difficile \u00e0 \u00e9tablir.\nIl pourra arriver, (dit-il) qu'un demandeur dans l'impossibilit\u00e9 de prouver sans titres certaines servitudes comme celle de passage ou de puisage, s'appuie sur des faits de passage ou de puisage pour pr\u00e9tendre droit \u00e0 la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 d'un chemin ou d'un puits.\nLaurent, vol. 7, n\u00b0 162.\nLa cour d'appel a, je crois, ramen\u00e9 la question sur son v\u00e9ritable terrain en d\u00e9cidant que la demanderesse avait la possession conjointe du passage. L'honorable juge Guerin a cit\u00e9 dans ses notes de nombreuses autorit\u00e9s qui d\u00e9notent beaucoup de travail et de recherches.\nComme je l'ai dit plus haut, cette ruelle, ou ce passage, existe depuis un temps imm\u00e9morial. La ruelle a toujours \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 l'usage des propri\u00e9taires voisins, et le pavage qui la recouvre indique un usage qui remonte \u00e0 des temps tr\u00e8s recul\u00e9s. Il me semble que les d\u00e9fendeurs sont mal venus aujourd'hui \u00e0 essayer de s'approprier exclusivement l'usage de cette ruelle et \u00e0 d\u00e9truire les rapports de bon voisinage qui ont toujours exist\u00e9 entre toutes les personnes dont les propri\u00e9t\u00e9s donnaient sur la ruelle.\nMais en dehors de la question morale et de justice que je viens de poser, il y a les principes consacr\u00e9s par la loi et la jurisprudence qui \u00e9tablissent le droit de la demanderesse de se plaindre et de r\u00e9clamer ce qu'elle r\u00e9clame. La cour de cassation, appel\u00e9e \u00e0 juger un cas semblable \u00e0 celui qui nous occupe, a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 dans une cause en partage (Sirey, 1842.1.311) que si deux propri\u00e9taires contigus ont joui en commun pendant trente ans sans interruption et animo domini d'un passage form\u00e9, pour la desserte de leurs h\u00e9ritages, d'une parcelle de chacun d'eux, cette jouissance dispense de la repr\u00e9sentation de tout titre et constitue une pr\u00e9somption juris et de jure qu'il y a eu originairement convention respective de laisser \u00e0 toujours ces parcelles indivises et que ni l'une ni l'autre des parties n'est plus admise \u00e0 en demander le partage. Sirey 1891.1. 122; Sirey 1899-1-85.\nLa doctrine nous enseigne qu'il y a copropri\u00e9t\u00e9 sur les cours, ruelles, all\u00e9es, passages et chemins destin\u00e9s au service de plusieurs maisons et sur les cours et canaux affect\u00e9s \u00e0 l'exploitation de divers fonds.\nAubry et Rau, 4e \u00e9d. vol. 2. parag. 221ter, p. 413; Demolombe, n\u00b0 444, vol. 11; Baudry-Lacantinerie et Walh, Succession, 3e \u00e9d, vol. 2. no. 2153.\nFuzier Herman, vbo. Passage, au n\u00b0 65, nous enseigne que\nl'impossibilit\u00e9 d'acqu\u00e9rir un droit de passage par des faits r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9s de possession a amen\u00e9 les plaideurs \u00e0 soutenir que ce qu'ils avaient ainsi prescrit \u00e9tait un droit non de servitude mais de propri\u00e9t\u00e9, ou tout au moins de copropri\u00e9t\u00e9, du terrain sur lequel ils passaient depuis trente ans apr\u00e8s l'avoir pav\u00e9 ou macadamis\u00e9. Et les tribunaux ont accueilli cette pr\u00e9tention. [Il cite, au no, 67, plusieurs jugements de la cour de cassation \u00e0 l'effet qu'une] demande tendant \u00e0 \u00eatre reconnu prori\u00e9taire du droit de passer par un chemin peut \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9e dans le sens d'une demande afin d'\u00eatre reconnu copropri\u00e9taire du chemin lui-m\u00eame, et, par cons\u00e9quent, se fonder sur la prescription; \u00e0 la diff\u00e9rence du cas o\u00f9 il s'agirait d'un simple droit de servitude.\"\nIl y a eu en France au sujet de ces chemins une question de savoir si la commune avait pu acqu\u00e9rir un droit de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 ou de servitude sur un chemin de desserte par le seul fait du passage de ses habitants depuis un temps imm\u00e9morial. Les propri\u00e9taires avoisinants r\u00e9clamaient, au contraire, que ce chemin de desserte appartenait aux propri\u00e9taires riverains. Le l\u00e9gislateur a cru devoir trancher la question par une loi adopt\u00e9e le 10 ao\u00fbt 1881 par laquelle on d\u00e9clarait que ce chemin \u00e9tait pr\u00e9sum\u00e9 appartenir aux propri\u00e9taires riverains.\nIl r\u00e9sulte donc de la doctrine et de la jurisprudence que les circonstances qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 prouv\u00e9es dans la pr\u00e9sente cause d\u00e9montrent que la demanderesse avait un droit de copropri\u00e9t\u00e9 dans la ruelle ou le passage en question. Elle avait donc le droit de se plaindre de l'obstruction que les d\u00e9fendeurs y faisaient, et alors pouvait demander aux tribunaux de la faire cesser. Mais si on en venait \u00e0 la conclusion que cette ruelle, au lieu d'\u00eatre propri\u00e9t\u00e9 priv\u00e9e, appartenait aux propri\u00e9taires riverains, et pourrait \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme ruelle publique, cela pourrait donner lieu tout de m\u00eame \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente action de la demanderesse, ainsi qu'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 jug\u00e9 dans la cause de Johnson v. Archambault[2].\nLe jugement qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 rendu par la cour d'appel est bien fond\u00e9 et l'appel doit \u00eatre renvoy\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens.\nMignault J.

L'acte d\u00e9crit cet immeuble comme \u00e9tant born\u00e9 en arri\u00e8re, \u00e0 l'extr\u00e9mit\u00e9 de sa profondeur, par un passage ou ruelle conduisant \u00e0 la rue Ste-H\u00e9l\u00e8ne, aujourd'hui MacMahon, et ne conf\u00e8re \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e aucun droit de passage ou autre droit sur la ruelle. L'acte de vente dit que Madame Roy a acquis cet immeuble par le testament de son mari, mais ne trace pas le titre de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 plus loin. Toutefois un extrait du cadastre produit au dossier ferait voir qu'\u00e0 une date non mentionn\u00e9e ce lot aurait appartenu \u00e0 une Dame Veuve John Vanderheyden et \u00e0 ses enfants, et le d\u00e9clare born\u00e9 au fond par un passage mitoyen entre les lots 3023, 3024, 3025, 3026 et 3027.\nLes appelants sont propri\u00e9taires de l'immeuble n\u00b0 3023, subdivision n\u00b0 2, du m\u00eame cadastre, pour l'avoir acquis de Walter John Ray par vente dat\u00e9e du 23 mars 1918. L'acte d\u00e9crit l'immeuble comme \u00e9tant born\u00e9 au sud-ouest par un passage mitoyen. Par le m\u00eame acte Ray a vendu aux intim\u00e9s, sans garantie m\u00eame quant \u00e0 son titre ou \u00e0 ses droits, la moiti\u00e9 indivise\nof a strip of land now and which in the future can only be used as a common passage between the said lot no. 3023, no 2 * * * and the lot no. 3022 belonging to the Congregation of St. Patrick's Church, which said strip of land is indicated as forming part of a passage bearing apparently no cadastral number, but whereof the larger part (east side) ought to form part of the said lot 3023-2.\nRay avait achet\u00e9 le lot n\u00b0 3023-2 de Dame Annie Sophia Bell, veuve de Roderick McLeod, le 11 f\u00e9vrier, 1896, et avait \u00e9galement acquis d'elle, aussi sans garantie, les droits dans le passage mitoyen qu'il a a plus tard transport\u00e9s aux intim\u00e9s. Dans l'acte de vente, Mde McLeod dit qu'elle avait acquis cet immeuble de G. E. Borlase, le 28 mars 1890, et que Borlase l'avait achet\u00e9 du sh\u00e9rif de Qu\u00e9bec, par acte pass\u00e9 le 31 mars 1890 (c'est peut-\u00eatre une erreur de date). Ces deux derniers titres ne sont pas produits et nous ne savons s'ils ont pr\u00e9tendu c\u00e9der un droit quelconque quant au passage en question en cette cause. Par des extraits du cadastre qui sont au dossier, nous constatons que Mde McLeod \u00e9tait propri\u00e9taire du lot n\u00b0 3023 et qu'elle l'avait subdivis\u00e9 en deux lots, les nos 1 et 2, et en vendant le n\u00b0 2 \u00e0 Ray elle a stipul\u00e9 un droit de passage sur ce n\u00b0 2 en faveur du n\u00b0 1, pour communiquer de ce dernier immeuble au passage dont il a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait mention et de l\u00e0 \u00e0 la rue McMahon.\nSi nous consultons le plan du cadastre dont une copie est \u00e9galement au dossier, nous voyons un terrain marqu\u00e9 \"passage\" entre le n\u00b0 3022, o\u00f9 se trouve l'\u00e9glise St-Patrice, au sud-ouest, et le c\u00f4t\u00e9 du lot n\u00b0 3023-2 et le fond du lot n\u00b0 3026, au nord-est. Au fond du passage se trouve une partie du lot n\u00b0 3022 et une partie du lot 3027 appartenant \u00e0 M. Alphonse Pouliot. Toutes ces propri\u00e9t\u00e9s, dit-on, ont des portes ouvrant sur ce passage. Cependant les parties ne peuvent nous renseigner sur l'histoire du passage, mais il semble invraisemblable, s'il est r\u00e9ellement mitoyen, qu'il n'existe dans les titres provenant des auteurs des parties ou dans les titres de la congr\u00e9gation de \/?\/St-Patrice aucune mention qui ferait voir comment le passage a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tabli. L'acte de vente de Mde Roy \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e oblige celle-ci \u00e0 payer une rente de terrain constitu\u00e9e \u00e0 l'Hotel-Dieu de Qu\u00e9bec. Aurait-on pu d\u00e9couvrir l'histoire du passage dans les archives de l'H\u00f4tel-Dieu? Je l'ignore. J'ajoute que les extraits du cadastre ne peuvent prouver la mitoyennet\u00e9 du passage, mais peuvent diriger les recherches, car ceux qui ont fait le cadastre ont sans doute consult\u00e9 des anciens titres que les parties ne paraissent pas avoir trouv\u00e9s.\nDans tous les cas, il est clair que les documents produits ne conf\u00e8rent aucune servitude \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e sur ce passage. Et sans titre elle ne peut r\u00e9clamer un droit de passage comme servitude, ni exercer \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard, et \u00e0 titre de propri\u00e9taire d'un fonds dominant, l'action possessoire, car la servitude ne pouvant s'acqu\u00e9rir sans titre, et la possession m\u00eame imm\u00e9moriale ne suffisant pas \u00e0 cet effet (art. 549 C. C.), il ne peut \u00eatre question d'action possessoire fond\u00e9e sur la simple possession en mati\u00e8re de servitude.\nJe me contente de citer Pothier, Trait\u00e9 de la Possession, n\u00b0 90, alin\u00e9a 1. (L'alin\u00e9a 2 envisage le cas o\u00f9 celui qui a joui d'un passage rapporte un titre justifiant sa jouissance.)\nQuoique les droits de servitude pr\u00e9diale soient des droits r\u00e9els que nous avons dans un h\u00e9ritage, n\u00e9anmoins celui qui a joui du passage par un h\u00e9ritage, ou quelque autre esp\u00e8ce de servitude, par quelque temps que ce soit, sans avoir aucun titre pour en jouir, n'est pas re\u00e7u \u00e0 former la complainte, lorsqu'il en est emp\u00each\u00e9; parce que, suivant les principes de notre droit fran\u00e7ais, la jouissance que quelqu'un a du passage par un h\u00e9ritage, ou de quelque autre esp\u00e8ce de servitude, sans avoir aucun titre, est pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e une jouissance de pure tol\u00e9rance; or une telle jouissance n'est pas suffisante pour former la complainte. L'article de l'ordonnance de 1667, ci-dessus rapport\u00e9, d\u00e9nie en termes formels cette action \u00e0 celui qui n'est que possesseur pr\u00e9caire.\nL'article de l'ordonnance de 1667 mentionn\u00e9 par Pothier est l'article 1er du titre 18, qui est la source de notre article 1064 du code de proc\u00e9dure civile.\nL'intim\u00e9e, dans l'action qu'elle a intent\u00e9e aux appelants, all\u00e8gue son titre de propri\u00e9taire du lot n\u00b0 3026, et dit que depuis son achat elle a toujours \u00e9t\u00e9 en possession d'un droit de passage dans la ruelle en question, que les d\u00e9fendeurs la troublent dans l'usage et possession du dit droit de passage, et qu'elle a requis les d\u00e9fendeurs de laisser le dit passage libre et de lui permettre de jouir librement et constamment du dit droit de passage pour l'utilit\u00e9 de son susdit h\u00e9ritage dans la dite ruelle. L'intim\u00e9e r\u00e9clame donc la jouissance du dit droit de passage \"pour l'utilit\u00e9 de son susdit h\u00e9ritage\", c'est-\u00e0-dire du lot n\u00b0 3026.\nOr la servitude r\u00e9elle est une charge impos\u00e9e sur un h\u00e9ritage pour Futilit\u00e9 d'un autre h\u00e9ritage appartenant \u00e0 un propri\u00e9taire diff\u00e9rent (art. 499 C. C.). Visiblement l'intim\u00e9e pr\u00e9tend exercer l'action possessoire pour r\u00e9clamer la jouissance d'une servitude. Il n'y a pas moyen d'interpr\u00e9ter autrement son action si on a \u00e9gard \u00e0 la signification ordinaire des mots dont l'intim\u00e9e se sert, et elle r\u00e9clame ce droit de jouissance pour l'utilit\u00e9 de son h\u00e9ritage, partant \u00e0 titre de servitude.\nEt cependant le jugement de la cour du Banc du Roi (l'honorable juge Dorion a fait enregistrer son dissentiment) traite l'action possessoire intent\u00e9e par l'intim\u00e9e comme \u00e9tant une action r\u00e9clamant, comme possesseur \u00e0 titre de copropri\u00e9taire de ce passage, la cessation du trouble apport\u00e9 \u00e0 sa jouissance par les appelants. C'est changer la base m\u00eame de l'action de l'intim\u00e9e, et cela sans qu'aucun amendement ait \u00e9t\u00e9 fait ou m\u00eame demand\u00e9. La th\u00e9orie de la Cour du Banc du Roi, c'est qu'il peut exister des passages entre deux ou plusieurs fonds que les propri\u00e9taires de ces fonds poss\u00e8dent \u00e0 titre de copropri\u00e9taires avec indivision forc\u00e9e. Ces passages sont appel\u00e9s des passages communs et sont l'objet d'une communaut\u00e9 entre les riverains, et un des copropri\u00e9taires du passage peut exercer l'action possessoire pour se prot\u00e9ger contre le trouble apport\u00e9 \u00e0 sa jouissance m\u00eame par un des communistes. Et on cite une jurisprudence qui para\u00eet s'\u00eatre \u00e9tablie en France, et qui pr\u00e9sume assez facilement que cette communaut\u00e9 ou cette copropri\u00e9t\u00e9 avec indivision forc\u00e9e a \u00e9t\u00e9 cr\u00e9\u00e9e par un accord entre les riverains. Cette jurisprudence, qui avait d'ailleurs provoqu\u00e9 des dissentiments notables, a \u00e9t\u00e9 consacr\u00e9e par la loi fran\u00e7aise du 20 ao\u00fbt 1881 sur les chemins et sentiers d'exploitation, dont l'article 33 se lit comme suit, (Voy. Duvergier, Collection des lois, tome 81, p. 363).\nLes chemins et sentiers d'exploitation sont ceux qui servent exclusivement \u00e0 la communication entre divers h\u00e9ritages ou \u00e0 leur exploitation. Ils sont, en l'absence de titre, pr\u00e9sum\u00e9s appartenir aux propri\u00e9taires riverains, chacun en droit soi; mais l'usage en est commun \u00e0 tous les int\u00e9ress\u00e9s. L'usage de ces chemins peut \u00eatre interdit au public.\nN'ayant pas une loi semblable dans la province de Qu\u00e9bec, il est clair qu'on ne peut invoquer ici la pr\u00e9somption de copropri\u00e9t\u00e9 qu'elle \u00e9tablit. Et une telle pr\u00e9somption exigerait un texte de loi, car c'est une pr\u00e9somption l\u00e9gale (art. 1239 C.C.).\nEtant donn\u00e9e la nature de l'action de la demanderesse, il ne faut pas s'\u00e9tonner que la preuve de la possession de la copropri\u00e9t\u00e9 par elle soit nulle. L'intim\u00e9e prouve qu'elle passe dans la ruelle, et d'autres riverains y passent. Mais s\u00e9rieusement de tels actes de passage, aussi \u00e9quivoques, puisque ce sont des actes qu'accomplissent d'ordinaire les cr\u00e9anciers d'une servitude plut\u00f4t que des actes qu'exercent les propri\u00e9taires d'un fonds, pourraient-ils jamais conduire \u00e0 la prescription de ce terrain appel\u00e9 passage ou ruelle? Il est \u00e9vident que non. Et il est clair que de tels actes ne peuvent conduire \u00e0 la prescription d'une servitude qui est un droit moindre que le droit de propri\u00e9t\u00e9.\nLogiquement donc, et quelle que soit la jurisprudence fran\u00e7aise en mati\u00e8re de copropri\u00e9t\u00e9 avec indivision forc\u00e9e, je ne puis venir au secours de l'intim\u00e9e. Je le regrette, car les appelants sont \u00e9videmment de de mauvais voisins, et c'est une pr\u00e9tention ridicule qu'ils \u00e9mettent d'avoir acquis par les titres qu'ils all\u00e9- guent la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 indivise de la moiti\u00e9 du passage. Avec de tels titres, ils ne pourraient jamais emp\u00eacher I'intim\u00e9e de passer dans la ruelle. Cependant I'action de Fintim\u00e9e tombe par elle-m\u00eame. Cette action est juridiquement non recevable. L'intim\u00e9e, du reste, n'est pas priv\u00e9e du droit d'exercer une action confessoire si, en recherchant dans les titres de ses auteurs, elle peut trouver un titre \u00e0 une servitude de passage qui serait l'accessoire de son droit de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 du lot 3026.\nJe maintiendrais l'appel et je renverrais l'action de l'intim\u00e9e avec frais de toutes les cours.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Moraud & Alleyn.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Demers & Demers.\n[1] [1921] Q.R. 32 K.B. 311.\n[2] [1864] 8 L.C.J. 317.\n",

(1906) chapter 7, in the matter of the controverted election of a member for the Electoral District of West Calgary in the House of Commons of Canada, rendered on the 1st of April 1922, dismissing the appellant's petition with costs and declaring that the respondent was the duly elected member of the Dominion Parliament for that district. The election was held on the 6th of December, 1921. At the election the candidates were the petitioner, the respondent and one Ryan. On the 14th of December, 1921, the returning officer added up the votes and declared the result of the poll, as follows:\nBennett\n7,372\nShaw\n7,366\nRyan\n1,354\nA recount was then applied for by the respondent and held before Winter District Judge. On such recount, the District Judge, on the 23rd of December, 1921, certified the result of poll, as follows:\u2014\nShaw\n7,369\nBennett\n7,353\nRyan\n1,351\nThe principal grounds, upon which the District Judge held that a certain number of ballots should be rejected, were that some were marked in ink, some with a coloured pencil and some with the figure \"1\".\nTo this ruling and certain other rulings on the recount, which were given on grounds of minor importance, the petitioners objected and accordingly filed this petition.\nThe case was tried before Stuart and Ives JJ., who declared that the respondent was duly elected for West Calgary Electoral District, with a majority of 17 instead of 16 votes, affirming on the main grounds the decision of the District Judge.\nAim\u00e9 Geoffrion K.C. and A.

McL. Sinclair K.C. for the appellant.\nEug. Lafleur K.C. and Geo. H. Ross, K.C. for the respondent.\nIdington J.\u2014This appeal arises out of the dismissal by Mr. Justice Stuart and Mr. Justice Ives of an election petition claiming for the appellant the seat for West Calgary in the Dominion Parliament.\nThe first ground taken is that a recount had before the district judge ought to have been confined to the objections taken before the deputy returning officer and in turn that the trial should have been restricted accordingly.\nThe like objections having been taken unsuccessfully long ago, and never successful when taken since, tends to arouse a suspicion that counsel feels his other grounds of appeal are not so strong as he would desire. I see nothing in the grounds thus taken; and do see some useful purposes which subsection (3) of section 70 of the \"Dominion Elections Acts\" serves, without making a basis for such objections.\nTurning to the more arguable grounds taken, relative to the marking of the ballots, I am of the opinion that section 62, subsection (3) in the first sentence thereof, which reads as follows\n(3) the voter, on receiving the ballot paper, shall forthwith proceed into one of the polling compartments and there mark his ballot paper by making a cross with a black lead pencil within the white space containing the name of the candidate or of each of the candidates for whom he intends to vote,\nmeans just what is says, in imperative terms, and is mandatory.\nIf there ever had been a doubt of what Parliament intended it has, I submit, been entirely removed by the successive enactments spread over nearly fifty years, referred to in the judgment of Mr. Justice Stuart speaking on behalf of the trial court, in each amendment using more distinct and imperative terms ending in that which I have just now quoted.\nThe course of said legislation may be summarized thus:\u2014\nIt began in 1874 with merely directing a cross to be placed opposite the name of the candidate for whom the vote was intended to be cast; that in 1878 directed the cross to be made by a pencil; that in 1894 directed a cross with a pencil on the white portion of the ballot paper, opposite, or within the division containing, the name of the candidate intended to be voted for; that in 1900 directed the elector to make a cross with a black lead pencil within said white space, and in 1920, as above stated. The possible toleration of use of pen and ink only lasted four years and for very obvious reasons ceased to have any semblance of right.\nIn light of such a course of legislation I cannot see how any English decision, under an Act essentially different in its wording and containing no such restrictions, can help us. And as no Canadian decision binding us upholds the right to use pen and ink in making the cross, I fail to see how any votes so made can be counted. And equally so any made with a red pencil, or anything but a black lead pencil, must be discarded.\nThe question of cross or no cross comes next to be considered, and in connection with that feature of this appeal we are asked to count ballots marked with the figure 1, which was used instead of a cross on twenty-nine Calgary ballots.\nIt is urged that this use of the figure 1 arose out of voters having to use it at municipal elections, carried on under the proportional representation system, adopted therefor in Calgary.\nAs an explanation of a curious development, when no better can be got, it is interesting, as the latest thing to be tried on judges in an election case, but beyond that I do not see in it a good argument especially to induce them to ignore the plain provisions of a statute.\nIt happens to be a rather inappropriate one in fact, for under proportional representation the figure 1 is only used to express the first choice of the voter, and he is expected to go on and name his second and third choices by using the figures 2 and 3.\nSeeing there were three candidates, at the election in question, one would have expected to find some one of the many voters using the figure 1, to have gone on, if acting in truth as if on the supposition of the voting being under the proportional representation system, and given the figures 2 and 3 also a chance.\nThe habit of using 1 in two previous municipal elections does not seem a very satisfactory explanation for refraining from using a cross. I fear the right habit had not been fully formed. It may be better than none in the way of looking at the possible character of the Act, but I doubt if it is.\nLong ago many voters who had no choice went to the poll merely as a means of getting rid of the importunities of the canvassers; and possibly that is a better explanation for the peculiar form adopted.\nSo far as I am concerned I cannot count the figure 1 as a cross, or intended as a cross, and am of the opinion that all such ballots, so marked, ought to be discarded.\nI observe Mr. Justice Stuart regrets that Parliament could not have used language that would have settled the matter of marking ballots, without leaving it to judges to cudgel their brains over.\nI am rather inclined to regret, with great respect, that some judges in the past, happened occasionally to be dissatisfied with the common sense use and application of plain language, lest some perverse or stupid electors should by its application lose their votes.\nCommon sense says the loss of such electors' votes is no harm to the country, and it happens generally, though not here, that they are equally distributed between or amongst the candidates.\nThe conclusion I have reached render it unnecessary for me to pursue the matters in question further, for, in my opinion, the appeal fails and should be dismissed with costs. Duff J.\u2014The appeal has been presented on behalf of the appellant in a manner which enables me to proceed at once to the consideration of the ground of appeal which admittedly, in the view I take, is decisive.\nA certain number of ballot papers were marked by an unright stroke which it may be assumed was a figure representing the number one. All such ballots were rejected and the point upon which it is necessary to pass is whether or not they were rightly rejected. The argument on behalf of the appellant is two-fold. 1st, it is said that the requirement of sec. 46, of the \"Dominion Election Act\" that the ballot papers shall be marked with a cross is directory only, and that if the paper is marked in such a way, (that is to say, by some mark placed within the division containing the name of the candidate) as to indicate an intention to vote for that candidate and is not of such a character as to fall within the description of s.s. 2 (c) of sec. 66 of the \"Elections Act\" of 1920\nupon which there is any writing or mark by which the voter could be identified,\nthen the ballot ought to be counted. 2nd, it is said that the procedure in the counting of votes is exhaustively laid down by s.s. 2 and s.s. 4 of sec. 66 and that by those two subsections it is the duty of the deputy returning officer to count all ballot papers not rejected by him as falling within one of the classes a, b or c, enumerated in s.s. 2, which classes include only ballots not supplied by the deputy returning officer. ballots by which votes have been given for more candidates than are to be elected and ballots upon which there is some writing or mark by which the voter could be identified, and it is contended that ballots marked as those which are now under consideration do not fall within any one of these categories. In support of these contentions the appellant appeals to the course of decision under the English Act of 1872 and the schedules thereto. If we were free to consider the question without reference to previous decisions and pronouncements of judges of this court I should be disposed to attach a good deal of weight to the argument that it is not easy to distinguish in substance and effect the statutory provisions now before us from those upon which the English and Scotch judges have from time to time been called upon to pass; and it is really not suceptible of dispute that the English and Scotch judges have arrived at a view of the statute they are accustomed to administer under which the ballot papers now under consideration would be held to be sufficiently marked and would be counted as votes.\nBut we are, I think, relieved from the duty of approaching the question from that point of view. In the Bothwell Case [10] the Chief Justice of this court formulated a rule that where a voter had placed upon his ballot a mark indicating\na clear intent not to mark with a cross as the law directs, as for instance, by making a straight line or a round 0, then such non-compliance with the law, in my opinion, renders the ballot null.\nThis is only one branch of the rule enunciated there by the Chief Justice with the object of providing a formula capable of practical application in determining the sufficiency or insufficiency of the marking of a disputed ballot. It is implied in what the learned Chief Justice says that it is essential that the mark shall be something capable of being described as a cross; he finds it impossible, he says, to lay down a hard and fast rule by which it can be determined whether a mark is a good or a bad cross and the test is, he thinks, to be found in the answer to the inquiry whether\nthe mark evidences an attempt or an intention to make a cross.\nThat is the inquiry the result of which determines whether or not the mark is a sufficiently good cross. If there is evidence of such an attempt then the ballot is to be counted unless the mark or marks on the paper are of such a character as to exhibit an intention to provide means for identification, in which case the ballot should be rejected. But a mark made with the intention of making a cross is essential, and a straight line is therefore insufficient as clearly shewing an intention not to do what the law requires, to make a cross. This pronouncement of the learned Chief Justice was formally concurred in by Mr. Justice Fournier and by Mr. Justice Gwynne. Mr. Justice Fournier's judgment is interesting as shewing that these three members of the court explicitly adopted the rule enunciated by the Chief Justice as furnishing at least one test which deputy returning officers might apply in deciding whether disputed ballots should be counted or not counted. I emphasize this for reasons which will appear presently.\nThe decision in the Bothwell Case [11] followed a decision in the previous year, Jenkins v. Brecken [12] and on that appeal it had been decided by a court including all the judges who sat in the Bothwell Case [13]11 with the addition of Mr. Justice Taschereau, that an upright stroke placed in the compartment containing the candidate's name was not a sufficient mark; and indeed was considered to be of so little importance or significance that where two candidates were to be elected and a cross was placed in each of two compartments containing the names of candidates and an upright stroke opposite the name of a third candidate in another compartment it was held that the upright stroke might be ignored and that the crosses should be counted as valid votes; and it was also held that an \/?\/ as distinguished from a cross, a mark in which apparently there was no intersection of the lines, was not a sufficient mark.\nThere is in the report of this case no reasoned discussion of the questions raised touching the marking of the ballots. But in the Bothwell Case[14] we find the key, I think, to the decision; the marks referred to did not evidence an attempt to make a cross and were therefore treated as inoperative.\nMr. Geoffrion argued that the last sentence of the passage in the judgment of the Chief Justice in which he expounds his rule shews that the Chief Justice was not enunciating a rule of law but drawing an inference of fact and that the substance of his judgment upon this point is that the proper inference from the circumstance that a voter who has used an upright stroke, for example, to mark his ballot instead of attempting to make a cross, is that he is attempting to provide some means by which his ballot paper can be identified. It is undeniable that one sentence of the judgment is a little perplexing. After stating that noncompliance with the direction to make a cross in the sense above indicated evinces a wilful departure from the direction which nullifies the ballot paper, he proceeds, the irresistible presumption from such a plain and wilful departure from the terms of the statute being that it was so marked for a sinister purpose.\nThis sentence is, I agree at first sight a little puzzling; but reflection has confirmed the view I intimated upon the argument that the learned Chief Justice was not laying down what he conceived to be a just inference of fact in every particular case from the circumstance that a ballot is found to be marked with a single stroke or a round 0, an inference which I am quite sure the Chief Justice would not have considered justified, but is stating what he conceived to be the theory upon which the statute, on his construction of it, might have been rested, namely, that the requirement of the cross in the sense explained might reasonably be made imperative because speaking generally people marking their ballots with an honest intention to vote and no desire to provide a means of identification would follow the direction of the law and attempt to make a cross.\nI think the learned Chief Justice while impressed on the one hand with the danger of excluding ballots marked only with an honest intention of giving a vote was at the same time fearful of opening a wide door to the employment of corrupt devices if the direction of requiring a cross should be wholly disregarded.\nBut I do not think the method by which the Chief Justice arrived at his result is important. The rule itself is stated in a manner leaving no room for doubt. If it is clear that the voter has not attempted to make a cross the ballot is not to be counted; if the mark by its character sufficiently evidences an attempt to make one the ballot is to be counted unless there is adequate evidence of an intention to provide means of identification; and the exposition of the formula by his colleagues who concurred with him is equally clear. At p. 706 Fournier J. says:\u2014\nDans le cours de la discussion de cette cause l'honorable juge en chef ayant soumis \u00e0 l'examen de ses coll\u00e8gues une r\u00e8gle formul\u00e9e de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 couvrier \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s toutes les difficult\u00e9s qui peuvent \u00eatre soulev\u00e9es \u00e0 propos de la marque des bulletins, tous les membres de la cour y ont donn\u00e9 leur adh\u00e9sion. Cette r\u00e8gle n'est toutefois pas susceptible d'une application aussi g\u00e9n\u00e9rale que celle \u00e9nonc\u00e9e dans la cause de Woodward et Sarsons[15] car on ne pourrait pas l'invoquer pour valider un bulletin, comme dans les cas ci-dessus cit\u00e9s, ne portant par exemple qu'une seule ligne perpendiculaire ou horizontale. Dans ce cas, suivant notre r\u00e8gle, on ne peut pas consid\u00e9rer qu'il y eut de bonne foi une tentative de faire une croix, et les bulletins marqu\u00e9s de cette mani\u00e8re seraient rejet\u00e9s. Je n'ai pas besoin de r\u00e9p\u00e9ter ici la formule de cette r\u00e8gle que l'honorable juge en chef a d\u00e9j\u00e0 lue tout au long dans ses notes sur cette cause.\nAnd at p. 717 Mr. Justice Gwynne says:\u2014\nTo avoid therefore, as far as possible running the risk of avoiding an honest vote, I concur in adopting as the rule by which the court shall be governed in all questions to arise as to the sufficiency of a mark upon ballot papers in order to constitute a good vote, the rule as laid down in the judgment of his lordship the Chief Justice in this case.\nMr. Justice Henry seems to have concurred with the judgment of the Chief Justice. Mr. Justice Strong declined to express any opinion upon the point now under discussion.\nIt is quite true that for the purpose of deciding the Bothwell Case[16] it was unnecessary to express any opinion upon the question now discussed although I am inclined to think that the two decisions referred to when read together constitute a binding authority upon it.\nI do not, however, rest my decision upon that. The rule laid down by the Chief Justice and by at least two of his colleagues in the most explicit terms gives a concrete formula \"by which\" to quote Mr. Justice Gwynne again,\nthe Court shall be governed in all questions to arise as to the sufficiency of a mark upon ballot papers to constitute a good vote;\nand that rule must have passed into and governed election practice and have been the decisive factor in numerous cases depending upon the validity or invalidity of disputed ballots. In that sense it is impossible to suppose that the rule has not become part of the election law of Canada. It was formally declared to be the rule of this court in 1884 by three judges of the court and it should be noted in passing that the appeal to this court is given upon such questions with the object of providing a standard and attaining uniformity in decision. Meanwhile, the \"Elections Act\" has been consolidated and re-enacted many times; and it is a legitimate presumption of fact that the pronouncements of this court on such a point are not unknown to members of Parliament and others responsible for the form of such legislation; and no amendment of the relevant enactments justifies a suggestion that Parliament did not accept the rule in the Bothwell Case[17] as a rule conforming to the spirit and intention of the law.\nThe force of these considerations is not, in my opinion, affected by the fact that circumstances are disclosed in this record which might have affected the minds of Ritchie C. J. and his colleagues and led them to another view had they been before this court in the Bothwell Case17. Whatever one may think of the reasoning upon which the rule is based the rule itself is, I think, too firmly established to yield to anything less cogent than a statutory amendment. My conclusion therefore is that the requirement of the statute providing for the marking of the ballot with a cross is obligatory in the sense indicated by the judgments in the Bothwell Case[18], in the sense, namely, that the mark made by the voter must at least be one evidencing an intention to comply with the statutory direction by making a cross; and that in this sense the requirement is imperative\u2014nullity being the consequence of non-compliance.\nThe other points of substance involved, I do not discuss\u2014a decision upon this point adversely to the appellant involving, as I have already said, the failure of the appeal.\nThe appellant's contention remains that the only objections open on the recount were the objections presented on the counting of the ballots by the deputy returning officers at the conclusion of the poll. This contention, I think, also fails, for a reason which may adequately be expressed in half a dozen words. The recount is, in my judgment, as its name implies, intended to be a re-examination of all the \"ballot papers returned by the several deputy returning officers\" and in this the judge is to be guided by\nthe directions of the Act set forth for the deputy returning officers.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAnglin J.\u2014The determination of this appeal depends upon whether the provision of s.s. 3 of s. 62 of the \"Dominion Elections Act\" (10-11 Geo. V. c. 46), that\nthe voter shall * * * mark his ballot by making a cross with a black lead pencil,\nis absolute and imperative, or merely directory. Twenty-nine ballots, disallowed by the Election Court, are marked with a single stroke (1) instead of with a cross (X) as the statute prescribes. Of these 20 are marked for the appellant and 9 for the respondent.\nTwenty-three ballots, likewise disallowed, are marked with pen-and-ink. Of these 18 are marked for the appellant and 5 for the respondent.\nNine ballots, also disallowed, are marked with coloured pencils. Of these 5 are marked for the appellant and 4 for the respondent.\nCounsel for the appellant suggests no distinction between the nine coloured pencil and the twenty-three pen-and-ink marked ballots.\nThe majority against the appellant as found by the Election Court being seventeen, unless all the ballots now in question are held to be good, counsel for the appellant very properly concedes that his client's claim to the parliamentary seat cannot succeed.\nApart entirely from authority, I should be of the opinion that the provision of s. 62 quoted is absolute and imperative\u2014and equally so in both its prescriptions\u2014that a ballot not marked with a cross, or, at least with something that can be regarded as an honest attempt to make a cross, or a ballot marked in ink or in lead pencil of any other colour than black does not fulfil its requirements and must be rejected. In this view I am confirmed by the judgments of this Court in Jenkins v. Brecken[19], where, affirming the judgment of Peters J., a ballot marked with an \/?\/ instead of a cross was disallowed and in the Bothwell Election Case [20] where Ritchie, C. J., Fournier, Henry and Gwynne, JJ. concurring, held that if the mark indicated no design of complying with the law, but on the contrary, a clear intention not to mark with a cross as the law directs * * * such non-compliance with the law * * * renders the ballot null.\nThe soundness of the added remark of the learned Chief Justice,\nthe irresistible presumption from such a plain and wilful departure from the terms of the statute being that it is so marked for a sinister purpose,\nI regard as at least questionable. But that observation was unnecessary to the clear and precise decision that the statutory prescription is absolute and imperative (which therefore remains unaffected by it) and does not appear to have had the concurrence of the other members of the court who adopted the Chief Justice's conclusion. The rule thus formulated by this court should, in my opinion, be accepted as decisive of the character of the prescription of s. 62 (3) as to the marking of ballots and as to what is essential in order to fulfil the requirements of a cross.\nThe enacting provision of the English Ballot Act (s. 2) of 1872, merely speaks of\nthe voter having secretly marked his vote on the paper.\nBy rule 25 in the annexed schedule of rules he is simply required to \"mark his paper\". It is only in the \"Directions for the Guidance of Voters\" in the schedule of forms that there is any statement as to the kind of mark to be used by the elector in marking his ballot. The significance of this, notwithstanding the provision s. 28 that the schedules shall be construed as part of the Act, and the distinction between the effect of enactments as to the rules and forms which are directory only, and that of the absolute enactments of the sections in the body of the Act, is pointed out by Lord Coleridge C. J. in Woodward v. Sarsons[21]. English decisions, therefore, as to the form and method of marking ballots are scarcely applicable under our more rigorous statute. In England the tendency of the decisions has been in the direction of treating as sufficient any mark, in whatever form, from which it can be deduced that the elector intended to vote for a certain candidate. In Canada, on the other hand, the tendency has been to make more rigid and precise the statutory prescriptions as to the form and method of marking the ballot.\nSection 66 (2) is, in my opinion, not so exhaustive of the grounds on which a deputy returning officer should reject ballots as to require him to count a ballot not marked in accordance with the imperative requirements of s. 62 (3), unless, indeed, we should consider it to be the manifest intention of the legislature that any marking not in conformity therewith should be deemed\na writing or mark by which the voter can be identified\nwithin the meaning of the clause c. of s.s. 2 of s. 66.\nI am unable to accede to the view urged by Mr. Sinclair that the judge on a scrutiny, or the Election Court on a petition where the seat is claimed, is restricted to the consideration of such objections to ballots as were taken before the deputy returning officers and dealt with by them under s.ss. 2-3 of s. 66. By s. 70 the judge is required to recount all the votes (s.s. 3) according to the directions set forth in the Act for the guidance of deputy returning officers at the close of the poll (s. s. 4). His duty is not confined to reconsideration of such ballots as were objected to and passed on by the several deputy returning officers. It is a recount that the statute provides for\u2014 not merely an appeal from the decisions of the deputy returning officers. I am for the foregoing reasons of the opinion that this appeal fails and must be dismissed with costs.\nBrodeur J.\u2014I concur with Mr. Justice Anglin.\nMignault J.\u2014On the opening of the argument, the learned counsel for the appellant informed the court that the rejected ballots could be conveniently placed in three classes, to wit:\n1. 23 ballots marked in ink, 18 being for the appellant and 5 for the respondent;\n2. 9 ballots marked with a coloured pencil, 5 for the appellant and 4 for the respondent;\n3. 29 ballots marked with the figure \"1\", 20 for the appellant and 9 for the respondent.\nBesides these ballots, there is the case of Mrs. Baird who testified that she had voted twice, each time for the respondent, and the appellant applies to have one of these votes deducted from the respondents' total.\nThe majority against the appellant, according to the judgment appealed from, was 17, so that unless he succeeds as to classes 1 and 3 above mentioned, he will be unable to overcome this majority.\nThis will simplify my consideration of the case, for if the appellant cannot have the ballots marked \"1\" counted, his appeal fails.\nAfter due consideration I think we are bound by authority to reject these ballots. In the Bothwell Case[22] Chief Justice Ritchie, while disclaiming any intention to lay down a hard and fast rule, said at p. 696: Whenever the mark evidences an attempt or intention to make a cross, though the cross may be in some respects imperfect, it should be counted, unless, from the peculiarity of the mark made, it can be reasonably inferred that there was not an honest design simply to make a cross, but there was also an intention so to mark the paper that it could be identified in which case the ballot should, in my opinion, be rejected. But, if the mark made indicates no design of complying with the law, but, on the contrary, a clear intent not to mark with a cross as the law directs, as for instance, by making a straight line or a round 0, then such non-compliance with the law, in my opinion, renders the ballot null.\nFournier, Henry and Gwynne, JJ. concurred with the Chief Justice in formulating this rule which is therefore binding on us. I must consequently hold that the court below rightly rejected these ballots. In so deciding I follow the decision of this court in the Bothwell Case[23] and do not think it necessary to pass upon the contentions of the parties as to the construction of sections 62 and 66 of the \"Dominion Elections Act.\"\nMr. Geoffrion, for the appellant, said that in the City of Calgary there is a system of proportional representation, whereby voters indicate their first or second preference in figures, such as \"1\" and \"2\" and are told not to mark the ballot with a cross. This no doubt was a very unfortunate circumstance, but the law is the same for all the Dominion and no local circumstances can suffice to set aside so plain a requirement as the marking of ballots with a cross. I think therefore that these ballots were rightly rejected.\nIn view of the rejection of the ballots marked with the figure \"1\", the appellant cannot succeed and I do not think it necessary to pass on the validity of the ballots marked with a pen instead of a black lead pencil or on the validity of the other ballots. As I understand it, there are no decisions of this court dealing with the validity of ballots marked with a pen and ink. The result is that the appellant, although a considerable majority of those who marked the disputed ballots evidenced the intention of voting for him, loses the election as well as the appeal he has entered against the decision of the election court. At this late day, it is strange that citizens of this country should not be familiar with the manner of voting. And however regrettable it may be that the will of the majority ' should not prevail, still that will must be expressed in the required manner. Otherwise it is of no effect.\nThe appeal must be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\n[1] [1922] 1 W.W.R. 993.\n[2] 7 Can. S.C.R. 247.\n[3] 8 Can. S.C.R. 676.\n[4] 15 Can.

Mais j'y vois plut\u00f4t une condamnation de rendre compte suivant les termes du contrat qui stipule un certain percentage sur les profits.\nLa Cour du Banc du Roi n'a donc virtuellement prononc\u00e9 de condamnation que sur l'obligation de rendre compte. Elle a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que la d\u00e9fenderesse qui voulait se soustraire \u00e0 cette obligation devait s'y soumettre.\nL'objet de l'action en reddition de compte est de forcer toute personne qui a g\u00e9r\u00e9 les affaires d'une autre personne \u00e0 rendre un compte devant la justice des recettes et des d\u00e9penses et de remettre ses pi\u00e8ces justificatives et de condamner celui qui du rendant ou de l'oyant compte sera le reliquataire. D'ordinaire ces comptes se rendent hors les tribunaux; mais si le d\u00e9biteur ne remplit pas son obligation, alors il peut \u00eatre assign\u00e9 en justice. S'il n'y a pas de contestation quant \u00e0 l'obligation, une ordonnance est rendue obligeant le rendant compte de d\u00e9poser ses comptes et ses pi\u00e8ces justificatives dans un certain d\u00e9lai; et s'il fait d\u00e9faut de rendre son compte dans le d\u00e9lai fix\u00e9, alors on peut, comme dit Pothier, Proc\u00e9dure civile, ch. 2,\nobtenir sentence portant que faute par lui de le rendre il sera contraint de payer une certaine somme par provision.\nLe jugement, dont on fait appel en la pr\u00e9sente cause, est simplement un jugement ordonnant la reddition de compte.\nCe judgment est-il un jugement d\u00e9finitif? Aux termes de la section 37 de l'\"Acte de la Cour Supr\u00eame,\" il n'y a appel que des jugements d\u00e9finitifs, et on entend par jugements d\u00e9finitifs ceux \u00e0 la suite desquels \"I'action * * * est d\u00e9finitivement jug\u00e9e et d\u00e9cid\u00e9e.\" (Sec. 2, s.s. (e) ch. 139 S.R.C.).\nSous cette l\u00e9gislation de nombreuses d\u00e9cisions ont \u00e9t\u00e9 rendues, surtout dans des causes venant d'autres provinces que celle de Qu\u00e9bec; et il a \u00e9t\u00e9 jug\u00e9 qu'un jugement qui d\u00e9termine des mati\u00e8res en litige entre les parties mais qui ne donne pas le montant de la condamnation que le demandeur doit recouvrer n'est pas un jugement d\u00e9finitif qui peut \u00eatre port\u00e9 devant la Cour Supr\u00eame.\nVoir: Clarke v' Goodall[5]; Crown Life Assurance Co. v. Skinner[6]; Windsor & Essex v. Nelles[7].\nA la suite de ces jugements qui avaient pour effet d'emp\u00eacher l'appel dans un grand nombre de cas o\u00f9 la v\u00e9ritable question en litige \u00e9tait d\u00e9termin\u00e9e, le parlement a cru devoir en 1913 abroger l'alin\u00e9a 2 de l'article 2 de la loi de la Cour Supr\u00eame et le remplacer par le paragraphs suivant: Sauf ce qui concerne des appels de la province de Qu\u00e9bec ''jugement d\u00e9finitif\" signifie tout jugement * * * qui d\u00e9termine en totalit\u00e9 ou en partie un droit essentiel de l'une quelconque des parues en litige * * * et quant aux appels de la province de Qu\u00e9bec, \"jugement d\u00e9finitif\" signifie comme ci-devant tout jugement. * * * o\u00f9 l'action, la poursuite * * * est d\u00e9termin\u00e9e et conclue.\nJe comprends que la raison pour laquelle le l\u00e9gislateur n'a pas jug\u00e9 \u00e0 propos d'\u00e9tendre l'appel aux causes de Qu\u00e9bec, c'est que dans cette province l'interlocutoire ne lie pas le juge et que lors du jugement final ces interlocutoires peuvent \u00eatre modifi\u00e9s et renvers\u00e9s.\nLe jugement qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 rendu en la pr\u00e9sente cause n'est certainement pas un jugement d\u00e9finitif au sens de l'Acte de la Cour Supr\u00eame\".\nNous avons d\u00e9j\u00e0 eu devant nous une action en reddition de compte dans la cause de G\u00e9n\u00e9reux v. Bruneau[8], o\u00f9 nous avons d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que nous n'avions pas juridiction. Il est vrai que dans cette cause de G\u00e9n\u00e9reux v. Bruneau8, le montant pour lequel le d\u00e9fendeur aurait pu \u00eatre reliquataire aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 bien minime et n'aurait pas atteint $2,000; mais je consid\u00e8re que le motif du jugement devait certainement porter aussi sur le fait qu'un jugement ordonnant une reddition de compte n'est pas un jugement d\u00e9finitif et par cons\u00e9quent n'est pas appelable.\nJe puis aussi citer la cause de Leroux v. Juillet[9] o\u00f9 sur un jugement ordonnant la nomination d'un arpenteur dans une action en bornage nous avons d\u00e9cid\u00e9 qu'il n'y avait pas d'appel.\nJe dois ajouter que les amendements faits en 1920 \u00e0 \"l'acte de la Cour Supr\u00eame\" ont fait dispara\u00eetre cette difference entre les appels venant de Qu\u00e9bec et ceux venant des autres provinces, et que si la pr\u00e9sente action avait \u00e9t\u00e9 institu\u00e9e apr\u00e8s juin 1920, elle aurait pu \u00eatre port\u00e9e en appel ici sur le jugement a quo.\nPour ces raisons, la motion doit \u00eatre accord\u00e9e avec d\u00e9pens.\nMignault J.\u2014For the reason that the judgment appealed from is not a final judgment within the meaning of section 2 subparagraph (e) of the \"Supreme Court Act\" as it stood before the 1920 amendment, I am of opinion that the appeal should be quashed with costs of the motion to quash.\nMotion granted with costs.\n[1] [1911] 44 Can.

[1906] c. 30\u201431 Eliz. c. 5, s. 5\u20143 & 4 Wm. IV, c. 42, s. 3. Under the provisions of \"An Act to supplement the revenues of the crown\", the province of Alberta claimed from the railway companies double taxes for 1913 to 1918, both inclusive and also penalties for 2,191 days at $20 a day for failure to deliver to the provincial treasurer in each year a written statement showing the number of miles of railway, whether exempt from taxation or not (Alta. S. [1906] c. 30, s. 4).\nHeld, that under the provisions of the Statutes of Limitations (31 Eliz. c. 5, s. 5 and 3 & 4 Wm. IV, c. 42, s. 3), the respondent's right to recover is restricted to such penalties as accrued within two years previous to the commencement of its action.\nHeld, also, Idington and Anglin JJ. dissenting, that the words \"any statute\" in the proviso (added by s. 10 of c. 5 of Alta. s. [1909]) to section 12 of the Revenue Act above cited \"that no tax shall be payable under this Act upon or with respect to any portion of a line of railway aided by a guarantee of bonds * * * under the provisions of any statute * * * \"are not restricted to a statute of the Province of Alberta but also comprise a statute of the Parliament of Canada. Per Idington, Duff and Anglin JJ.\u2014The power given to the court to relieve against penalties (\"Supreme Court Act\", Alta. s. [1907]) c. 3, as amended by Alta. s. [1907] c. 5) does not authorize it to relieve against statutory penalties.\nJudgment of the Appellate Division ([1921]) 1 W.W.R. 1178) varied, Idington and Anglin JJ. dissenting in part.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta[1], reversing the judgment of Hyndman J at the trial[2] and maintaining the respondents' action to recover taxes and penalties alleged to be due and owing in respect of 176.23 miles of railway owned by appellant companies.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions in issue are fully stated in the above head-note and in the judgments now reported.\nMaclean K.C. for the appellants: \"Any statute\" includes Dominion statutes.\nThe Statutes of Limitations must be applied to the respondents' claim for double taxes and penalties.\nThe Supreme Court of Alberta, under the provisions of the Supreme Court Act, had power to relieve against the penalties and forfeitures sued for in this action.\nLafleur K.C. for the respondents.\nIDINGTON J. (dissenting in part)\u2014The respondent sued the appellant for taxes due under the provisions of an \"Act to supplement the Revenues of the Crown in the Province of Alberta,\" being chapter 30 of the Statutes of 1906 of said province, and for penalties thereby provided for. The learned trial judge having dismissed the action, the Appellate Division reversed that and allowed everything claimed; hence this appeal here.\nI agree with the view taken by the Appellate Division that if the order in council upon which respondents rely for the determination of the value of the railway is to be held ineffective, then the $20,000 a mile provision set forth in the statement of claim would become operative and that the lesser sum claimed herein would still be recoverable herein.\nThe mileage seems to have been admitted in the course of the trial and that seems to answer the objection taken on that score.\nA much more difficult question is raised by the use of the words \"any statute\" in the following amendment passed in 1909, c. 5, sec. 10:\u2014\nProvided, however, that no tax shall be payable under this Act upon or with respect to any portion of a line of railway aided by a guarantee of bonds, debentures, debenture stock, or other securities under the provisions of any Statute for a period of fifteen years from the date of the commencement of the operation of the portion of the line so aided, and thereafter during the currency of the guarantee as aforesaid the amount of taxes payable hereunder upon or with respect to such portion of any line of railway so aided shall not exceed an amount equal to $30 per mile of the mileage of such portion of such line in the Province.\nIt seems that in respect of a small part of the line of railway in question herein the appellant or those through whom it claims got such aid as specified from the Dominion government by virtue of a statute of Parliament and thus it is contended the exemptions provided for were made operative in relation to said part of the line.\nThe Appellate Division divided on this question. I agree with the majority of said court in holding that the word \"statute\" in the said provision covers only the case of a statute of Alberta. To avoid the absurdity of giving with one hand and taking away with the other, might seem a very good reason for the legislature of Alberta, if passing such a statute, exempting the object of such a bounty from taxation.\nI do not see any good reason for the legislature concerning itself in that regard about what other legislative bodies might or might not have done in that regard.\nAnd the amendment made later to give effect to that view indicates that the legislature had so intended to restrict the operation of the exemption.\nThe action seeks to recover for penalties imposed by the following, which is section 5 of the said Act of 1906:\u2014\n5. Every person, company or corporation who, or which, and the manager or agent in the province of any company or corporation as aforesaid who neglects to conform to the provisions of the preceding section shall each be liable to a penalty of twenty dollars per day for each day during which default is made; and the person, company or corporation aforesaid shall also be liable to pay a tax of double the amount for which he or it would have been liable under this Act, and any penalty or such double tax may be recovered with costs in any court of competent jurisdiction in an action brought in the name of the provincial treasurer.\nThe preceding section therein referred to required a return to be made by parties defined, of whom appellant answers the description, on or before the first of July in each year, beginning with July, 1906, shewing the number of miles of railway line, or part thereof, which such like parties as appellant were operating, and whether claimed to be exempt, etc.\nThe appellant never made any such return and became liable to said penalties.\nIt however got leave from the learned trial judge to amend its pleadings, setting up the defences in paragraphs 7, 8, 9 and 10 of its amended statement of claim. It pleads therein the statutes of 18 Elizabeth, c. 5; 31 Elizabeth, c. 5, section 5, and 3 & 4 Wm. IV. c. 42, section 3.\nThe Appellate Division seems to have overlooked this though counsel, as I understand, say the matter was mentioned in argument there.\nIndeed one of the grounds taken in the notice of appeal from the learned trial judge is that he had given leave to so plead, as appellant did by said amendments.\nI find in Darby & Bosanquet, 2nd ed., a reference to the statute of Elizabeth, stating it is in force but intimating that it was held in Noy's Reports, 71, that it did not apply to an action brought by the party aggrieved, and that, in such case, is now provided for by the 3rd section of 3 & 4 Wm. IV, cap. 42. In looking at said case in Noy's Reports, page 71, the matter is cleared up as the statute of Elizabeth relied on was held only applicable to a common informer, which respondent will hardly assent to be called but rather as a party aggrieved.\nHence I take it that the latter statute is that which must govern herein.\nTherefore I hold the action for penalties herein, which I hold the double tax to be, as well as the per diem penalty of $20.00 a day, is barred beyond the two years preceding the 10th of October, 1919, when the action was brought.\nThe time began to run on the 1st July, 1917, as to the per diem penalty, and can only be computed as to that year for the last six months of the year 1917, and the like period between the 1st of July, 1918, and the end of that year. And as to the double tax it can only apply to the years 1917 and 1918.\nThe amount of the judgment in the Appellate Division should be reduced accordingly. The appeal, I think should be allowed to that extent with costs of this appeal and in the Appellate Division and no costs of the trial.\nI do not see how the other defence set up in the other amended defences can avail appellant anything.\nI am by no means clear as to what the treasurer rests his right upon to recover the penalties, though it may be implied from the provisions of the Act.\nThe contention founded upon the power of the court to relieve from such penalties as mentioned in the Amending Act of 1907, c. 5, seems to me to be applicable only to such contractual penalties and forfeitures as the Court of Chancery had exercised jurisdiction in regard to.\nDUFF J.\u2014The chief question arises under the proviso to sec. 12; and the point in dispute is whether the lines of railway in respect of which the taxes sued for are said to have accrued or any part of them fall within the description\nline of railway aided by a guarantee of bonds, debentures, debenture stock or other securities under the provisions of any statute.\nI am not in agreement with the view which prevailed with the majority of the Appellate Division touching the effect in this proviso of the words under the provisions \"of any statute\".\nIt is serviceable sometimes to repeat the exact words of Lord Wensleydale's canon enunciated in Grey v. Pearson[3], and described as the golden rule of reading Acts of Parliament by Jarvis C. J. in Mattison v. Hart[4]. These are Lord Wensleydale's words:\u2014 In construing wills, and, indeed, statutes and all written instruments, the grammatical and ordinary sense of the words is to be adhered to, unless that would lead to absurdity or some repugnance or inconsistency with the rest of the instrument; in which case the grammatical and ordinary sense of the words may be modified so as to avoid that absurdity, repugnancy, or inconsistency, but no further.\nNow what is the ordinary meaning of the words in dispute? I do not in the least doubt that, for the purpose of determining that, you must consider that it is a statute of the legislature of Alberta which is speaking; but you may and must also consider what it is that the statute is dealing with. The subject is the taxation of railways and the clause to be construed is a clause exempting certain railways from its operation. Generally, both as to railways wthin the incidence of the tax and those excepted from its operation. it deals with railways constructed or in operation under the authority of statute, that is to say under the authority of an Act of the Parliament of Canada or of an Act of the Legislature of Alberta.\nI can see little reason to doubt that the ordinary meaning of the words quoted when employed in a statute dealing with railways of these two classes (railways in operation under the authority of the Parliament of Canada and railways in operation under the authority of the local legislature) includes statutes of the Parliament of Canada as well as those of the Alberta Legislature. There might of course be something in the context excluding that meaning; to attribute such meaning to the words might give rise to some repugnancy to the declared or apparent object of the statute and if so, then the literal meaning would give way to an interpretation more in harmony with the ascertained purpose of the legislature. In Vacher v. London Society of Compositors[5], Lord Macnaghten said:\nIn the absence of a preamble there can, I think, be only two cases in which it is permissible to depart from the ordinary and natural sense of the words of an enactment. It must be shewn either that the words taken in their natural sense lead to some absurdity or that there is some other clause in the body of the Act inconsistent with or repugnant to, the enactment in question construed in the ordinary sense of the language in which it is expressed.\nNow there is nothing absurd in the notion that the legislature should grant exemption from taxation in respect of railways, construction or maintenance of which has been aided by a guarantee of bonds given under the authority of the Dominion Parliament. There is nothing absurd in such a notion being a motive of legislation by the Alberta legislature. On the contrary, joint action or combined action by the Dominion and a province in lending financial aid to railway enterprises in different forms has been a not uncommon type of legislative activity in the past history of this country. It can, I think, offer no sort of clue to the intention of the legislature as expressed in this enactment to contrast the financial advantages in a strictly provincial point of view of subsidizing by way of tax exemption a railway company whose obligations the province has guaranteed on the one hand with the advantages to be derived from lending assistance to a company supported by the Dominion Parliament alone. Such speculations as to the relative weight of possible motives which may be conceived as prompting such legislative action would carry us far beyond the strict limits of the judicial function and would expose us to the risk, as Lord Haldane said in the same case on p. 113, of \"going astray in a labyrinth\" where one has \"no sufficient guide\". These considerations have no application with regard to any taxes accruing after the 13th April, 1918, that is to say to taxes claimed for any year subsequent to 1917. The respondent was therefore not entitled to recover in respect of any part of the railway in question aided by a guarantee of securities under the provisions of any Dominion or Provincial statute. This condition appears to be fulfilled only in the case of the line from Lloydminster to Edmonton. As regards the other points made, the invalidity of the order in council is I think, of no importance. The respondent relies upon it, it is true, but the only possible effect of that is to limit the respondent's claim for assuming the order in council to be invalid the respondent would be entitled to recover upon the basis of a valuation of $20,000 a mile. As to the statutes of limitation, I think the appellants have made good their contention. The combined effect of 31 El. cap. 5 and 3 & 4 Wm. IV, cap. 42 is, I think, to impose a limitation of two years and this applies, I think, to the claim for double taxation as well as to the sums claimed nominatim as penalties.\nI am unable to accept the contention that the authority to relieve from forfeitures expressed in general terms and conferred upon the Supreme Court by the statute of 1907 extends to penalties and forfeitures declared by a public enactment and thereby made exigible upon the non-performance of a general duty created by such enactment, such as a duty to pay taxes or to make a return under a taxing statute.\nIn the result the appeal should be allowed in part and the judgment below varied. The respondent is entitled to recover taxes for the year 1918 on the footing of the valuation of the order in council of the 29th August, 1908 at the rate of 2 % of the value as fixed by such valuation of the railway in question and for the year 1919 at the rate of 1%. For the years preceding 1918 the respondent is entitled to recover taxes at the rate of 1% on the same valuation in respect of the line between Edmonton and Strathcona and is also entitled to recover a penalty of $20.00 a day for each day of the period from the 30th day of August, 1917 to the 31st day of December, 1918. The appellants are entitled to the costs of the appeal to this court. The respondents should have the costs of the action and of the appeal to the Appellate Division.\nANGLIN J. (dissenting in part)\u2014On the points which it covers the judgment delivered by the learned Chief Justice of Alberta is, to me, entirely satisfactory and I feel that I cannot usefully add to it.\nThe only point not covered is the application and effect of the statute 31 Eliz. c. 5 s. 5 invoked by the appellant. Its applicability seems to be established. The right of the plaintiff to recover is thereby restricted to such penalties as accrued within two years previous to the commencement of the action in August, 1919.\nBy section 5 of the Alberta statute of 1906 (c. 30), the appellant is made liable for a penalty of $20.00 a day for each day during which default is made in delivery of the return prescribed by section 4, and also to pay double the amount of the tax for which it was liable. The appellant urges that it has been ordered by the Appellate Division to pay for penalties $20.00 per day for six years, from 1913 to 1918, inclusive\u20142,991 days in all. This is in accordance with the prayer in the statement or claim. These penalties appear to have been awarded solely in respect of default in making the return for the year 1913. Recovery of penalties for defaults in regard to the returns for the years 1914, 1915, 1916, 1917, was not prayed for. In a penal action such as this, I would not be disposed to allow the plaintiff to alter or enlarge the claim by amendment.\nI am, however, unable to assent to the suggestion that default in respect of the return for each year ceased when delivery of that for the succeeding year became due.\nIn the result the recovery of penalties claimed should be restricted to such per diem penalties as accrued in respect to the 1913 tax from the 30th of August, 1917. The double tax is recoverable only in respect of the 1918 taxes.\nThe judgment should be modified accordingly and the appellant should have its costs in this court.\nBRODEUR J.\u2014By an Act passed in 1906, the legislature of Alberta declared that any railway company not exempt from taxation was bound to pay a tax to the provincial government; that the executive authorities could determine the actual value of the railway; and if they failed to do it, then the actual value should be taken to be $20,000.00 for each mile.\nOn the 29th of August, 1908, the Lieutenant Governor in Council fixed the value of all the railway lines at a sum of $11,985.34 per lineal mile.\nThe Canadian Northern Railway was then operating 176.23 miles of railway in Alberta and became liable to taxation. But a statute was passed in the same year 1908 declaring that\nno tax shall be payable under this Act upon or with respect to any portion of a line of railway aided by a guarantee of bonds, debentures, debenture stock or other securities under the provision of any statute. The evidence shows that the Dominion Parliament had guaranteed the debentures of the Canadian Northern in 1903 to the extent of 169 miles of its railway from Lloydminster to Edmonton and that a subsidy in money had been granted by the federal authorities for the other 7.23 miles from Edmonton to Strathcona operated by the Canadian Northern. It is claimed by the appellants that this aid by the federal authorities would constitute the Alberta lines of the Canadian Northern exempt from taxation.\nOn the other hand, the respondent, the provincial treasurer, contends that the exemption would cover only railways aided by a provincial statute, and that as far as the 7.23 miles between Edmonton and Strathcona the exemption could not be claimed because there was only a cash subsidy for them and not a guarantee of bonds.\nThe main question which we have to decide is whether the words \"any statute\" in the Act of 1908 above quoted refer to provincial laws only or to both Dominion and provincial laws.\nA law imposing taxation should always be construed strictly against the taxing authorities, since it restricts the public in the enjoyment of its property. These taxing laws are not to be extended beyond the clear import of the language used and the powers granted to the officers charged with their execution must be strictly pursued. Tennant v. Smith[6]; Clerical Assurance Soc. v. Carter[7].\nAt the time this railway taxation act was passed, there were no railways subsidized or aided by the province and the statute must have had in contemplation the exemption of railways aided by the federal authorities. The words \"any statute\" in the Alberta Act of 1908 should then include all the statutes in force, viz, the Dominion as well as the provincial statutes.\nThis interpretation which I give to the statute of 1908 appears to me so well founded that in 1918, on the 13th of April, the Legislature of Alberta amended this provision in such a way that the statute referred therein was a provincial statute.\nIt is contended that the amendment has a retroactive effect, but the declaration is not made in terms sufficiently wide to be construed retroactively. If there were some doubt, the doubt should be solved against the retrospective effect; and besides, in this case, it would disturb vested rights.\nI then come to the conclusion that the Canadian Northern was exempt from municipal taxation on the 169 miles of railway extending from Lloydminster to Edmonton until the statute of 13th of April, 1918 was passed. As to the 7.23 miles between Edmonton and Strathcona, the company should be held liable because it received only a cash subsidy and did not obtain from the federal authorities a guarantee of bond.\nThe plaintiff in his claim also asked that the defendant company be condemned to pay penalties imposed by the law. The law provided that any railway company would be bound to deliver to the provincial treasurer each year a written statement correctly showing the number of miles of railway, whether the same is exempt from taxation or not, and that any company which failed to file a statement should be liable to a penalty of $20.00 per day for each day during which default is made and to double taxation. The railway company invokes against this penal claim the statutes of 31 Elizabeth, c. 5, s. 5, and 3 & 4 William IV, c. 42, s. 3, which declare that all actions for forfeiture upon a penal statute should be brought within two years after the offence has been committed, whether the action is brought by the party aggrieved or by a common informer.\nThese statutes are such that they leave no doubt that the claims for penalties should be restricted to two years. The action having been instituted on the 30th day of August, 1919, the penalty of $20.00 a day should cover the period from the 30th of August, 1917. As the double taxation is in the nature of a penalty, it should also be restricted to two years on the 7.23 miles of railway from Edmonton to Strathcona. Since the exemption from taxation on the 169 miles has ceased since the law of the 13th of April, 1918, the company should be condemned to pay double taxation for part of the year 1918 on these 169 miles.\nThe plaintiff has amended his original statement of claim to cover the taxation for the year 1919 but he has made no claim for penalties for the other period. The plaintiff is entitled to recover the full taxes on the basis of 1% for this year 1919.\nThe appeal should be allowed in part and the judgment below varied in the manner I have indicated. The appellants are entitled to the costs of the appeal to this court. The respondents should have the costs of the action and of the appeal to the Appellate Division.\nMIGNAULT J.\u2014Two questions raised under this appeal have received my serious consideration.\n1. Were the appellants exempt from the tax claimed from them? 2. Are they liable for the penalties demanded for failure to deliver to the provincial treasurer a statement showing their mileage?\nOn the first question as to the construction of the words \"any statute\" in section 10 of chapter 5 of the Alberta statutes of 1909, which exempts certain lines of railway from the tax, I share the opinion of the learned trial judge and of Mr. Justice Beck in the appellate divisional court that these words should not be restricted to a statute passed by the legislature of the province of Alberta but comprise also a statute of the Parliament of Canada which of course would be in force in Alberta as well as in any other province of the Dominion. No more comprehensive term could be used than \"any statute\" and I feel that I should give it its ordinary and grammatical meaning.\nIn 1918, the legislature of Alberta amended the \"Interpretation Act\" by ch. 4, sect. 48, assented to on April 13th, by inserting immediately before clause 11 of section 7 thereof the following new clause: \u2014\n10a. The expression \"province\" means the province of Alberta, and the expressions \"Act\" and \"statute\" mean an Act or statute of the province.\nFor the reasons fully stated by the learned trial judge, I am of opinion that this amendment is not retrospective and that it applies only in the future. Therefore if the appellants were, before April 13th, 1918, aided in respect of their line of railway by a guarantee of bonds, debentures, debenture stock or other securities under the provisions of a statute of the Dominion of Canada, no tax was payable by them under the Act in question for a period of fifteen years from the date of the commencement of the operation of the portion of the line so aided, and thereafter during the currency of the guarantee as aforesaid the amount of taxes payable upon or with respect to such portion of the line of railway so aided, could not exceed an amount equal to $30.00 per mile of the mileage of such portion of such line in the province.\nI take it as established that the portion of the line of railway between Lloydminster and Edmonton was aided by a guarantee of bonds by the Dominion of Canada under a Dominion statute. The order-in-council authorizing the guarantee is dated the 20th July, 1903, so that the fifteen years period would extend to July, 1918. The portion of the line known as the Edmonton, Yukon and Pacific Railway (from Edmonton to Strathcona, 7.23 miles) was aided merely by a cash subsidy, and this portion would not come within the operation of the exemption clause.\nThe tax in question was payable on September 1st in each year (sect. 9). Applying the 1918 amendment from the date of its enactment as excluding any statute granting a guarantee of bonds, etc, other than an Alberta statute, the 1918 taxes, for the aided portion of the line, could only be claimed for the broken period from April 13th to December 31st, and the taxes for 1919 in entirety. The taxes demanded in this action for 1913, 1914, 1915, 1916, 1917, and the broken period of 1918 from January 1st to April 13th are not due in respect of the portion of the appellant's line from Lloydminster to Edmonton.\nThe second question is whether the appellants are liable for the penalties demanded by this action for failure to deliver to the provincial treasurer the statement required by section 4 of the Act (chapter 30 of the statutes for 1906)? This statement is required whether or not the line of railway is claimed to be exempt from taxation, and it is admitted that during these years no such statement was delivered to the provincial treasurer.\nThe respondent claims a penalty for the years 1915 to 1918 both inclusive, to wit 2,191 days at $20.00 which is the statutory penalty, and further a double tax, also a penalty, which is claimed for 1913, 1914, 1915, 1916, 1917 and 1918. By an amendment, the respondent demanded $21,121.76 for taxes for 1919, but no double tax as a penalty.\nTherefore the demand is for the following amounts:\u2014\nTaxes for 1913 to 1919, both inclusive\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u2026.\u2026\u2026..\n$147,852 32\nDouble taxes for 1913 to 1918, both inclusive\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u2026\u2026\u2026..\n126,730 56\nPenalty for 2,191 days at $20\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..\n43,820 00\n$318,402 88\nAnd the respondent prays for interest at 7% on the aforesaid sums from the dates on which they respectively fell due.\nAs to the claim for the $20.00 penalty, it is made for a single penalty of $20.00 per day for the 2,191 days. No penalty running concurrently with other like penalties for each separate default is demanded, and this being a penal action, I would strictly restrict the respondent to the demand made by its particulars and by the prayer of the statement of claim.\nThe double tax, I have said, is also a penalty and must be treated as such.\nThe appellant pleaded by an amendment the statute 31 Elizabeth ch. V., restricting a demand of penalties to two years from the date of the action, which is August 30th, 1919. I am of opinion that this point is well taken and consequently the penalty of $20.00 per day cannot be claimed for the period preceding the 30th August, 1917. This, I take, would reduce the number of days for which the penalty can be claimed to 488, from August 31st, 1917 to December 31st, 1918, which, at $20.00 per day, would amount to $9,760, instead of $43,820.00, a difference in favour of the appellants of $33,860.00.\nThis statute of limitation applies to the double tax, also a penalty, so that this double tax can only be claimed for 488 days, that is to say for one year, four months and one day. I have not calculated the amount, but it can easily be determined.\nI am therefore of opinion that the taxes due the respondent are those which accrued from April 13th 1918 to December 31st, 1919, on the appellants' line of railway from Lloydminster to Edmonton, and on the other portion of the line which does not coma within the exemption clause, the taxes due are those which accrued from 1913 to 1919, both inclusive; that double taxes can only be demanded in this action from August 30th, 1917 to December, 31st, 1918; and that the penalty of $20.00 per day for the failure to deliver the statement required by section 4 can only be demanded from August 30th, 1917 to December 31st, 1918.\nThe appeal should be allowed in part and the judgment below varied. The respondent is entitled to recover taxes for the year 1918 on the footing of the valuation of the order in council of the 29th August, 1908 at the rate of 2% (this 2% comprising the double tax demanded as a penalty) of the value as fixed by such valuation of the railway in question and for the year 1919 at the rate of 1%. For the years preceding 1918, the respondent is entitled to recover taxes at the rate of 1% on the same valuation in respect of the line between Edmonton and Strathcona (7.23 miles) and is also entitled to recover a penalty of $20.00 a day for each day of the period from the 30th day of August, 1917 to the 31st day of December, 1918. The appellants are entitled to the costs of the appeal to this court. The respondents should have the costs of the action and of the appeal to the Appellate Division.\nAppeal allowed in part with costs.\n[1] [1921] 1 W.W.R. 1178.\n[2] [1920] 3 W.W.R. 283.\n[3] [1857] 6 H.

V., c. 10, s. 39\u2014(Q) 5 Geo. V, c. 108, s. 23. In 1912, the Quebec legislature authorized the town of Maisonneuve ([Q] 3 Geo. V. c. 58) to construct a highway outside its limits on the territories of the municipalities appellants. In accordance with the provisions of the statute, the town of Maisonneuve enacted a by-law, by which, after an estimate of the cost of the works had been given, liability was imposed on the appellant municipalities for the payment in cash of the cost of the highway within their limits \"as soon as the by-law shall have received the sanction \"of the Lieutenant-Governor in Council.\" On the 3rd of November, 1914, an Order-in-Council was passed approving the by-law but declaring that the payment to the town of Maisonneuve should be made by means of debentures, payable in forty years, bearing interest at a rate not exceeding 6% per annum, which the town of Maisonneuve was bound to accept at par, provided the cost should not exceed 5% of the estimate. In the same month, the appellant municipalities passed by-laws for the issue of debentures bearing date 1st of December, 1914, with interest coupons payable semi-annually. These by-laws also enacted that the councils of the municipalities might transfer the debentures and coupons to the City of Maisonneuve, \"upon a certificate \"of (the appellants') engineer and according to the progress \"made, in the territory of (each municipality) of such proposed\" highway. These by-laws were ratified by the legislature (5 Geo. V, c. 10, s. 34 and c. 108, s. 23). A contract for the construction of the highway was entered into between the town of Maisonneuve and the respondent company, by which the latter agreed to accept, in payment of the contract price for work done in their territory the debentures issued by the appellant municipalities. When these municipalities proposed to make their payment to the town of Maisonneuve, they passed a resolution in conformity with powers given by the order-in-council for the deposit of the debentures in a bank and giving directions to the bank that the contractor should be paid only upon the certificate of their engineer according to the progress of the work. They also instructed the bank to detach from the debentures such coupons as should have at the time of the delivery of the debentures entirely or partially matured. The respondent company received from the town of Maisonneuve debentures in payment of the work done on the territories of the appellant municipalities. The respondent company, by its action, claims the amount of the interest coupons accrued between the date of the issue of the debentures and the time when it became entitled to receive delivery of them on engineer's progress certificates. Held, Idington and Duff dissenting, that the respondent company was entitled to recover the amount of their interest coupons. APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King's Bench, appeal side, Province of Quebec, reversing the judgment of the Superior Court, Maclennan J. and dismissing the appellants' actions.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions in issue are fully stated in the above head-note and in the judgments now reported.\nL. E. Beaulieu K.C. for the appellants. The appellants, original owners of the coupons in dispute, never assented to their right of ownership being transferred to the respondent company.\nThe documents relied upon by the respondent company do not show that the latter was entitled to recover the amount of these coupons nor do they create any right of ownership in them.\nL. E. Beaulieu K.C. for the appellants.\nT. Rinfret K.C. for the respondent.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014I confess that at the close of the argument on this case I had some doubt as to the right of the appellant to succeed. Since then I have given the case much consideration and have had the opportunity of reading the reasons for judgment of my colleagues. In the result I have come to the conclusion that the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nI do not think it necessary to repeat the reasons advanced in the several judgments dismissing the appeal which I have read. They are quite satisfactory and have removed my doubts.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs. Idington J. (dissenting).\u2014These appeals are said by counsel to all turn upon the same or substantially the same or similar state of facts, with minor differences which should not affect the result. These facts are no doubt set forth in some of the records which are thrown together somewhat confusedly before us.\nIn the Superior Court the lengthy formal judgment sets forth all I intend to rely upon save what is set forth hereinafter and appears in the several opinions in the Court of King's Bench, appeal side, presenting what the learned judges respectively rely upon.\nI have read all said judgments and conclude that the substantial point of difference between the Superior Court and the Court of King's Bench, is that the latter considers that the terms and conditions upon which the Lieutenant-Governor in Council ratified by-law no. 143 of Maisonneuve are conclusive and binding upon all concerned.\nIn so holding I, with great respect, submit that they overlook a number of substantial later happenings.\nThey also overlook, I submit, the true nature of the following conditions imposed by the Lieutenant-Governor in Council in the first place. They read as follows:\u2014\nQue les travaux soient faits par contrats accord\u00e9s sur soumissions demand\u00e9es, en la mani\u00e8re usit\u00e9e par cette cit\u00e9.\nQue l'ing\u00e9nieur des deux municipalit\u00e9s int\u00e9ress\u00e9es soit adjoint \u00e0 celui de la cit\u00e9 de Maisonneuve pour la surveillance des travaux \u00e0 \u00eatre faits et pour le b\u00e9n\u00e9fice des municipalit\u00e9s qu'il repr\u00e9sente, sans aucune direction cependant dans l'ex\u00e9cution des dits travaux.\nQue le paiement de ce qui sera d\u00fb \u00e0 la cit\u00e9 de Maisonneuve \u00e0 ce sujet soit fait au moyen de bons ou d\u00e9bentures \u00e0 quarante ans et portent int\u00e9r\u00eat \u00e0 un taux n'exc\u00e9dant pas 6% par an payable semi-annuellement, que la cit\u00e9 de Maisonneuve devra accepter au pair, pour le montant du co\u00fbt r\u00e9el de cette ouverture et de cette construction du dit boulevard, \u00e0 condition que le co\u00fbt de ces travaux n'exc\u00e8de pas cinq pour cent des estim\u00e9s pr\u00e9par\u00e9s par les ing\u00e9nieurs de la cit\u00e9 de Maisonneuve. The appellant's council passed its by-law providing for the issue of the debentures in question.\nBy the seventh section thereof it is provided as follows:\u2014\nThe council of the corporation may at any time, and from time to time, issue, convey and transfer the said debentures and coupons, to the city of Maisonneuve, either directly or through a trustee, if necessary, chosen by resolution and into whose hands the same may be deposited and kept for the purposes aforesaid, after having been issued and signed as aforesaid but, in every case. upon a certificate of its engineer, and according to the progress made, in the territory of the municipality of Sault-au R\u00e9collet, of such proposed undertaking of the boulevard Pie IX, and the city of Maisonneuve shall take and receive them at par, and as such in payment, acquittance and extinction of the above obligation of the corporation with regard to such portion of the boulevard Pie IX.\nOther provisions conformable therewith follow and then by section 10 it provides as follows:\u2014\n10. Notwithstanding what is stated above, the said debentures shall not, directly or through a trustee chosen by resolution as aforesaid be surrendered by the corporation of the parish of Sault-au-R\u00e9collet to the city of Maisonneuve and be of any value in the hands of the latter except on condition that this by-law shall previously have been ratified and confirmed by the legislature of the Province of Quebec, and that it be enacted by the same Act of the legislature that such issue of debentures shall not affect the corporation's borrowing power.\nThe ratification took place by 5 Geo. V. c. 108, sec. 23.\nIn pursuance thereof the debentures were given to a bank as trustee with some specific instructions which I need not quote.\nI may observe here that in the case of the town of St. Michel de Laval a similar by-law was passed relative to its debentures with somewhat clearer language as to what was meant. And that by-law was validated by 5 Geo. V. c. 10, sec. 34.\nThe validation by the legislature of these respective by-laws containing provisions clearly conflicting with the earlier by-law no. 143 of Maisonneuve must, I submit, be held to govern so far as necessary to give effect thereto the legal relations of the parties concerned herein in question, instead of giving the predominant effect which the court below did in 1917, and in the case now in appeal herein.\nTurning to the contract of Maisonneuve with the respondent contracting company, which undertook the work, we find therein the following statement of the terms of payment:\u2014\nLa partie de seconde part acceptant d'\u00eatre pay\u00e9e par la partie de premi\u00e8re part, s'y engageant, pour les travaux plus haut mentionn\u00e9s, en d\u00e9bentures des dites municipalit\u00e9s de la paroisse du Sault-au-R\u00e9collet et de la paroisse de St-Michel de Laval pour les montants plus haut mentionn\u00e9s. Le tout suivant les termes, charges, clauses et conditions des plans, devis et sp\u00e9cifications pr\u00e9par\u00e9s par M. l'ing\u00e9nieur Marius Dufresne, comme susdit.\nIt is to be noted that it is the word \"debentures\" that is used, but no word of coupons is mentioned.\nThat could have been literally fulfilled by the delivery of debentures of either of said municipalities named bearing the respective dates of the engineers' certificate of progress, estimates and so on to the end had the parties chosen that course.\nAnd beyond any doubt I see no answer the respondent contracting company could have had hitherto or how it could pretend to have the right to get debentures of any earlier date.\nHowever that may be, I see no reason at all why the company should get interest antecedent to the time when the work was done, for that was not contemplated by the contract.\nThe debentures and cash were treated as equivalent. True I observe a remark in respondent's factum that the debentures would not be so, but I see no evidence to support the pretension. The truth seems to be that the usual business precautions do not seem to have been observed by those concerned. And hence I am led to conclude that cash and 6% debentures were looked upon as equivalent until some afterthought, possibly begotten by changed conditions, led to this contention.\nI am of the opinion therefore that the appellants never parted with their property and that each is respectively entitled to recover same or the value thereof.\nI cannot, with due respect to the court which decided otherwise in 1917, and whose finding seems to have bound its successors, though I see the late Mr. Justice Cross (whose opinion I always held in respect) had dissented, so hold. Whatever remedy the contractors may have had that, I am clear, was not open to it, in my opinion, on the foregoing facts.\nSupposing the contract had been delayed in its completion for a number of years and, rather than cancel it, Maisonneuve had forborne, could it be said that respondent should get all the arrears of interest for those years?\nIn such a case the legal consequences would have been more apparent but in principle I can see no difference.\nThere seems to be some question raised, but not very clearly put forward, that in any event the rule which I submit should govern, does not cover the actual rights as developed in the actual facts.\nIf there is any room for doubt in regard thereto I may say that in my opinion any coupon for current interest at the time when the respective certificates of the engineers were given, the coupon relative thereto should be allowed the respondent and, if parties cannot agree, the question should be referred to someone to take account thereof. Subject thereto I think the appeal should be allowed with costs of one appeal here and of costs of appeal to the court below.\nDuff J. (dissenting).\u2014This appeal, I think, should be allowed. Section 4 of the enabling statute, 3 Geo. V. c. 58 is in the following words:\u2014\n4. The Lieutenant Governor in Council may, after hearing the municipal corporations interested notice to that effect having been served by the city of Maisonneuve, and on such conditions as he may deem advisable, ratify the by-law mentioned in the foregoing article; and the municipalities through which the said boulevard runs, with the exception of the said city of Montreal, shall, after such sanction be liable for the payment of all sums both principal and interest, so expended for such expropriation, purchase, opening, macadamizing and maintenance in the same proportion and in the same way as if each had adopted such by-law.\nThe Order in Council by which the by-law of Maisonneuve was ratified contains this paragraph:\u2014\nQue le paiement de ce qui sera d\u00fb \u00e0 la cit\u00e9 de Maisonneuve \u00e0, ce sujet soit fait au moyen de bons ou d\u00e9bentures \u00e0 quarante ans et portant int\u00e9r\u00eats \u00e0 un taux n'exc\u00e9dant pas 6% par an payable semi-annuellement, que la cit\u00e9 de Maisonneuve devra accepter au pair, pour le montant du co\u00fbt r\u00e9el de cette ouverture de cette construction du dit boulevard, \u00e0 condition que le co\u00fbt de ces travaux n'exc\u00e8de pas cinq pour cent des estim\u00e9s pr\u00e9par\u00e9s par les ing\u00e9nieurs de la cit\u00e9 de Maisonneuve.\nThese provisions of the statute and the by-laws of Maisonneuve, as confirmed by the order in council, constitute, I think, the fundamental conditions by which any responsibility of the appellant municipality must be limited. The condition that the debentures shall be accepted at par is to be found also in the by-law of Montreal Nord, then Sault-au-R\u00e9collet, of the 27th Nov., 1914. What is the meaning of this provision? In order to determine this it is necessary to consider carefully the language of section 4 of the statute quoted above. That section makes the municipality responsible for moneys actually expended in the construction of the work provided for and for interest on such moneys. It was not within the authority of the Lieutenant Governor in Council to give validity to a by-law of Maisonneuve professing to impose upon the appellant municipality any more onerous responsiblity, and the by-law and order in council must be read subject to that condition. I may also add that the subsequent ratifying legislation in my judgment does not, when properly construed, enlarge this responsibility.\nNow one can quite understand that Maisonneuve might stipulate before undertaking the work for some sort of security over and above that derived from the terms of the statute itself. This no doubt accounts for the provision in the by-law that the total estimated cost is to be paid to Maisonneuve as soon as the by-law receives the sanction of the Lieutenant Governor in Council. Assuming payment in cash it would be utterly absurd to suppose that Maisonneuve was to enjoy the use of (or of the interest derived from) such moneys during the period elapsing between the payment of them to Maisonneuve and the actual disbursement of them under the statute and by-law. Precisely the same observation applies to the debentures which, by the provisions of the order in council above quoted, were to be substituted for cash. These debentures were not to become the property out and out of Maisonneuve but were to be placed in the hands of Maisonneuve to be used for a particular purpose, that is to say, to be applied in payment of liabilities incurred by Maisonneuve in the construction of the work. They were to be accepted by Maisonneuve at par, that is to say, they were to be treated as the equivalent of cash. Manifestly it results from this that interest was not to run upon them until the date arrived at which the principal moneys were applied to their destined purpose.\nThis is the construction which must be put upon the by-law and the order in council if they are to be read in such a way as to bring them within the authority conferred by the statute. So read they justify the contention of the appellant municipality that the bonds do not become the property of Maisonneuve or of the contractors until the time arrives when, conformably to the enactments of the statute, Maisonneuve is entitled to have them delivered in payment of its obligations to the contractors.\nI do not understand that the Court of King's Bench has held the decision in the former litigation between Quinlan-Robertson and the city of Maisonneuve to be binding on the appellant municipality. It was a decision which the Court of King's Bench felt itself bound to follow, being a decision of that court itself upon the identical facts and the identical transaction under consideration in the present case, but I do not understand that court to have held the present controversy to be chose jug\u00e9e by reason of the former decision. The appellant municipalities were no parties to the former litigation and in my opinion the previous judgment is not binding upon them.\nAnglin J.\u2014The material facts are fully stated in the opinion of my brother Mignault, which I have had the advantage of reading.\nAt the instance of the appellant municipalities their liabilty, under the statute of 3 Geo. V., e. 58, and by-law no. 143 of the city of Maisonneuve, to pay in cash their respective shares of the cost of the Boulevard Pie IX was commuted by order in council of the 3rd November, 1914, into payment by forty year debentures carrying interest at 6%. The debentures to meet these payments, as issued by the appellants, bore the date 1st of December, 1914, and carried interest from that date. It was these debentures that the city of Maisonneuve was required to accept as the equivalent of cash. I find nothing remarkable in the city of Maisonneuve stipulating for and being accorded the benefit of the interest to accrue between the date of the issue of the debentures and the time when it should become entitled to receive delivery of them on engineer's progress certificates. On the contrary such a premium might well be asked and given to compensate pro tanto for a probable difference between the actual market value of the bonds and their face value, at which the city of Maisonneuve was required to accept them in lieu of cash.\nNeither is there anything in the by-laws of the appellant municipalities authorizing the issue of these debentures at all inconsistent with this view. They merely provide that the debentures shall be handed over to the city of Maisonneuve by a trustee-depository from time to time as the works progress and as payment therefor shall be certified to be due by the engineer representing the obligor. There is nothing either in the by-laws or in the statute confirming them in the least inconsistent with the respondent's right to have the debenture bonds delivered to them in the form and condition in which the by-laws provide for their issue, i.e., with coupons attached carrying interest from the 1st December, 1914. That, as I read the relevant statutes, order in council and by-laws, was what the city of Maisonneuve agreed to take and was entitled to receive in lieu of the cash payments provided for in the original statute, 3 Geo. V., c. 58, and by-law no. 143 of the city of Maisonneuve enacted pursuant thereto.\nAs I appreciate the judgment of the Court of King's Bench, this was also the view which prevailed there.\nIn my opinion the appeal fails and should be dismissed with costs.\nBrodeur J.\u2014Ces trois causes soul\u00e8vent la m\u00eame question qui est de savoir si les municipalit\u00e9s appelantes sont tenues de livrer certains coupons de d\u00e9bentures.\nLa l\u00e9gislature de Qu\u00e9bec a, en 1913, autoris\u00e9 la cit\u00e9 de Maisonneuve \u00e0 construire un boulevard qui serait appel\u00e9 Pie IX sur le territoire des corporations appelantes qui \u00e9taient alors de simples corporations rurales de villages et de paroisses; et elle lui a en m\u00eame temps donn\u00e9 le pouvoir d'adopter un r\u00e8glement \u00e0 cet effet. Ce r\u00e8glement devait \u00eatre communiqu\u00e9 aux municipalit\u00e9s int\u00e9ress\u00e9es et le lieutenant-gouverneur en conseil, apr\u00e8s les avoir entendues, pourrait sanctionner ce r\u00e8glement. La loi d\u00e9clarait qu'apr\u00e8s cette approbation les municipalit\u00e9s appelantes deviendraient responsables envers la cit\u00e9 de Maison-neuve du co\u00fbt de ce boulevard.\nUn r\u00e8glement de la cit\u00e9 de Maisonneuve, qui porte le n\u00b0 143, fut d\u00fbment adopt\u00e9 par son conseil; il pourvoyait \u00e0 l'ouverture de ce boulevard \u00e0 travers les municipalit\u00e9s de Montr\u00e9al-Nord et de St-Michel et d\u00e9terminait le montant que chaque municipalit\u00e9 aurait \u00e0 lui payer comptant aussit\u00f4t que le r\u00e8glement serait sanctionn\u00e9 par le gouvernement. Le r\u00e8glement fut alors soumis aux autorit\u00e9s gouvernementales; et, le 4 novembre 1914, le r\u00e8glement \u00e9tait approuv\u00e9 avec quelques modifications; et entre autres, il \u00e9tait d\u00e9clar\u00e9\nque le paiement de ce qui sera d\u00fb \u00e0 la cit\u00e9 de Maisonneuve \u00e0 ce sujet, soit fait au moyen de bons ou d\u00e9bentures \u00e0 quarante ans et portant int\u00e9r\u00eat \u00e0 un taux n'exc\u00e9dant pas 6% par an payable semi-annuellement, que la cit\u00e9 de Maisonneuve devra accepter au pair, pour le montant du co\u00fbt r\u00e9el de cette ouverture et de cette construction du dit boulevard \u00e0 condition que le co\u00fbt de ces travaux n'exc\u00e8de pas cinq pour cent des estim\u00e9s pr\u00e9par\u00e9s par les ing\u00e9nieurs de la cit\u00e9 de Maison-neuve.\nEn d'autres termes, au lieu d'un paiement comptant ces municipalit\u00e9s auraient le pouvoir de payer la cit\u00e9 de Maisonneuve au moyen de d\u00e9bentures \u00e0 quarante ans, portant int\u00e9r\u00eat \u00e0 6% et la cit\u00e9 de Maisonneuve devait accepter ces d\u00e9bentures au pair.\nC'\u00e9tait l\u00e0 un avantage consid\u00e9rable pour les municipalit\u00e9s appelantes, si surtout l'on prend en consid\u00e9ration le fait que la grande guerre venait d'\u00eatre d\u00e9clar\u00e9e et que la n\u00e9gociation de d\u00e9bentures devait n\u00e9cessairement se faire \u00e0 sacrifice.\nLes deux municipalit\u00e9s appelantes ont \u00e9t\u00e9 apparemment heureuses de voir qu'elles n'\u00e9taient pas tenues de payer argent comptant comme la l\u00e9gislation et le r\u00e8glement municipal de Maisonneuve paraissait le d\u00e9cr\u00e9ter. Elles se sont mises de suite \u00e0 l'oeuvre pour adopter un r\u00e8glement les autorisant \u00e0 \u00e9mettre des d\u00e9bentures pour le co\u00fbt estim\u00e9 des travaux, lesquelles d\u00e9bentures devaient \u00eatre dat\u00e9es du 1er d\u00e9cembre 1914 et devaient porter int\u00e9r\u00eat \u00e0 compter de cette date, et devaient \u00eatre remises, comme dit le r\u00e8glement,\n\u00e0 la cit\u00e9 de Maisonneuve et servir ainsi \u00e0 payer et acquitter l'obligation qu'elle a ou aura vis-\u00e0-vis cette cit\u00e9 aux termes du susdit r\u00e8glement n\u00b0 143 de cette derni\u00e8re. Ce r\u00e8glement des municipalit\u00e9s appelantes, qui \u00e9tait en termes presque identiques, pourvoyait \u00e9galement \u00e0 ce que les d\u00e9bentures et les coupons fussent remis \u00e0 un fid\u00e9icommissaire qui en ferait la livraison \u00e0 la cit\u00e9 de Maisonneuve au fur et \u00e0 mesure que les travaux avanceraient. Le r\u00e8glement devait \u00eatre sanctionn\u00e9 par la l\u00e9gislature. C'est ce qui fut fait.\nLa cit\u00e9 de Maisonneuve se mit en frais de construire le boulevard et \u00e0 cette fin elle a fait un contrat avec Quinlan et Robertson Ltd., qui ont accept\u00e9 les d\u00e9bentures des municipalit\u00e9s appelantes en paiement de leur contrat.\nLes appelantes, apr\u00e8s avoir remis au fid\u00e9icommissaire les d\u00e9bentures et les coupons, lui ont ensuite donn\u00e9 instruction de ne pas livrer \u00e0 la cit\u00e9 de Maisonneuve ou aux entrepreneurs, Quinlan & Robertson, les coupons qui repr\u00e9sentaient les int\u00e9r\u00eats \u00e9chus avant l'\u00e9mission des certificats que les ing\u00e9nieurs devaient donner suivant le progr\u00e8s des travaux.\nCe refus de livrer les coupons avec les d\u00e9bentures a d\u00e9j\u00e0 fait le sujet d'un d\u00e9bat judiciaire entre la cit\u00e9 de Maisonneuve et Quinlan & Robertson; et ces derniers ont eu gain de cause et il a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que la cit\u00e9 de Maisonneuve \u00e9tait oblig\u00e9e de livrer non seulement les d\u00e9bentures mais les coupons qui y \u00e9taient attach\u00e9s.\nLe m\u00eame d\u00e9bat judiciaire se renouvelle aujourd'hui entre les municipalit\u00e9s appelantes et les constructeurs.\nPour le d\u00e9cider, il faut rechercher dans les lois et les r\u00e8glements la port\u00e9e de l'obligation des appelantes.\nPar le r\u00e8glement n\u00b0 143 de Maisonneuve, il \u00e9tait d\u00e9cr\u00e9t\u00e9 que les appelantes devaient payer aussit\u00f4t que le gouvernement l'aurait sanctionn\u00e9. Cette disposition du r\u00e8glement \u00e9tait apparemment conforme \u00e0 la loi elle-m\u00eame qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9e par la l\u00e9gislature en 1913. Le lieutenant-gouverneur en conseil avait apport\u00e9 un adoucissement \u00e0 cette disposition en disant que St-Michel et Montr\u00e9al-Nord pourraient se lib\u00e9rer en livrant des d\u00e9bentures avec int\u00e9r\u00eat de 6%. Ces derni\u00e8res ont naturellement accueilli cette concession avec plaisir et elles se sont empress\u00e9es quelques jours apr\u00e8s, soit le 1er d\u00e9cembre, 1914, d'\u00e9mettre leurs d\u00e9bentures avec les coupons et de les remettre au fid\u00e9icommissaire qu'elles avaient choisi.\nLa port\u00e9e de leur obligation consistait \u00e0 livrer \u00e0 la cit\u00e9 de Maisonneuve des d\u00e9bentures avec leurs coupons d'int\u00e9r\u00eat. C'\u00e9tait le contrat d'ali\u00e9nation d'une chose certaine et d\u00e9termin\u00e9e laquelle devait \u00eatre temporairement remise entre les mains d'un tiers qui la retiendrait jusqu'\u00e0 ce que les travaux fussent suffisamment avanc\u00e9s. Autrement, pourquoi les appelantes auraient-elles \u00e9mis des d\u00e9bentures avec coupons dat\u00e9s du 1er d\u00e9cembre 1914 quand elles savaient que ces travaux ne seraient pas termin\u00e9s plusieurs mois et peut-\u00eatre plusieurs ann\u00e9es plus tard? Elles ont par leurs r\u00e8glements qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 approuv\u00e9s par la l\u00e9gislature \u00e9mis ces d\u00e9bentures avec leurs coupons pour payer et acquitter l'obligation qui lui incombait envers la cit\u00e9 de Maisonneuve.\nSi ces municipalit\u00e9s voulaient garder certains coupons et faire la distinction entre les d\u00e9bentures et les coupons qu'elles essaient maintenant de faire, elles auraient d\u00fb alors faire une stipulation \u00e0 cet effet dans leur r\u00e8glement.\nLe paiement d'une obligation comprend non seulement la livraison d'une somme d'argent mais l'ex\u00e9cution de toute chose \u00e0 laquelle une partie est oblig\u00e9e.\nDans le cas actuel les appelantes ont compris que leur obligation consistait \u00e0 livrer des d\u00e9bentures et leurs coupons, et ils ont sans r\u00e9serve adopt\u00e9 des r\u00e8glements qui ont re\u00e7u une sanction l\u00e9gislative; elles ne pouvaient pas subs\u00e9quemment se lib\u00e9rer en retenant une partie de la chose certaine qu'elles avaient promis de remettre.\nLeur appel doit \u00eatre renvoy\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens.\nMignault J.\u2014Ces trois causes pr\u00e9sentent la m\u00eame question savoir, si les deux corporations municipales appelantes sont tenues de payer aux intim\u00e9s, Quinlan & Robertson Ltd., certains coupons d'int\u00e9r\u00eat sur des d\u00e9bentures \u00e9mises par elles.\nEn 1912, par la loi 3 Geo. V, ch. 58, la l\u00e9gislature de la province de Qu\u00e9bec ajoutait quelques dispositions assez extraordinaires \u00e0 une loi amendant la charte de la cit\u00e9 de Maisonneuve. On y validait le plan d'homologation du boulevard Pie IX qui devait s'\u00e9tendre depuis les limites nord de la cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al jusqu'\u00e0 la rivi\u00e8re des Prairies, traversant le village de St-Michel (maintenant ville St-Michel) et la paroisse du Sault au R\u00e9collet (maintenant ville de Montr\u00e9al-Nord). La cit\u00e9 de Maisonneuve fut autoris\u00e9e \u00e0 adopter un r\u00e8glement pour exproprier, acheter de gr\u00e9 \u00e0 gr\u00e9, ouvrir, macadamiser et entretenir ce boulevard \u00e0 travers ces municipalit\u00e9s, et il fut d\u00e9cr\u00e9t\u00e9 que le lieutenant-gouverneur en conseil, apr\u00e8s avoir entendu les corporations municipales int\u00e9ress\u00e9es, pourrait, aux conditions qu'il jugerait convenables, ratifier ce r\u00e8glement et que les municipalit\u00e9s travers\u00e9es par le boulevard, \u00e0 l'exception de la cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al, deviendraient, apr\u00e8s telle sanction, responsables pour le paiement de toutes sommes, tant en capital qu'en int\u00e9r\u00eat, qui seraient ainsi d\u00e9pens\u00e9es pour ces fins, et ce dans la m\u00eame proportion et de la m\u00eame mani\u00e8re que si elles eussent chacune d'elles adopt\u00e9 tel r\u00e8glement. La cit\u00e9 de Maisonneuve passa un r\u00e8glement conforme \u00e0 cette autorisation, portant le No. 143. Par ce r\u00e8glement on d\u00e9clara que les municipalit\u00e9s appelantes seraient responsables envers la cit\u00e9 de Maisonneuve pour le paiement de toutes sommes, tant en capital qu'en int\u00e9r\u00eat, qui seraient d\u00e9pens\u00e9es pour le boulevard, et apr\u00e8s avoir indiqu\u00e9 le co\u00fbt de la construction (on n'avait pas encore determin\u00e9 le montant requis pour l'achat de l'assiette du boulevard), on ajoutait que la somme totale serait pay\u00e9e aussit\u00f4t que le r\u00e8glement aurait re\u00e7u la sanction du lieutenant-gouverneur en conseil.\nCette sanction fut donn\u00e9e par un arr\u00eat\u00e9-en-conseil du 3 novembre 1914, comportant certaines conditions quant \u00e0 l'ex\u00e9cution du travail, et d\u00e9clarant que le paiement de ce qui serait d\u00fb \u00e0 la cit\u00e9 de Maisonneuve serait fait au moyen de d\u00e9bentures \u00e0 quarante ans, portant int\u00e9r\u00eat n'exc\u00e9dant pas 6% par an, que la cit\u00e9 de Maisonneuve accepterait au pair, pour le montant du co\u00fbt r\u00e9el de l'ouverture et construction du boulevard, \u00e0 condition que le co\u00fbt des travaux n'exc\u00e9d\u00e2t pas 5% des estim\u00e9s des ing\u00e9nieurs.\nChacune des corporations appelantes adopta alors, en novembre 1914, un r\u00e8glement pour l'\u00e9mission de d\u00e9bentures au montant de $373,000 pour St. Michel de Laval et de $210,000 pour le Sault au R\u00e9collet, ces d\u00e9bentures devant porter la date du ler d\u00e9cembre 1914, avec coupons d'int\u00e9r\u00eat payables semi-annuelle-ment le 1er juin et le 1er d\u00e9cembre de chaque ann\u00e9e. Chaque r\u00e8glement decr\u00e8te que le conseil pourrait c\u00e9der et transporter, soit directement, soit par l'entremise d'un fid\u00e9icommissaire, ces d\u00e9bentures et leurs coupons, mais dans tous les cas sur un certificat de l'ing\u00e9nieur de la corporation et au fur et \u00e0 mesure qu'avancerait l'entreprise, \u00e0 la cit\u00e9 de Maisonneuve qui les prendrait et recevrait au pair en paiement de l'obligation de la municipalit\u00e9 au sujet de la partie du boulevard traversant son territoire.\nCes deux r\u00e8glements furent approuv\u00e9s et ratifi\u00e9s par la l\u00e9gislature, celui du Sault au R\u00e9collet par la loi 5 Geo. V, ch. 108, art. 23, et celui de St. Michel de Laval par la loi 5 Geo. V, c. 109, art. 34.\nLe contrat de construction du boulevard fut donn\u00e9 par la cit\u00e9 de Maisonneuve \u00e0 Quinlan et Robertson Ltd., le 30 janvier 1915, et il fut stipul\u00e9 que ceux-ci accepteraient d'\u00eatre pay\u00e9s pour le montant du contrat en d\u00e9bentures des municipalit\u00e9s du Sault au R\u00e9collet et de St. Michel de Laval.\nIl est important de constater, avant de poursuivre le r\u00e9cit des faits, que l'obligation des corporations appelantes \u00e9tait envers la cit\u00e9 de Maisonneuve. Celle-ci aurait pu transporter \u00e0 n'importe qui les d\u00e9bentures qu'elle recevrait des appelantes. Elle s'en est servie pour payer les intim\u00e9s, et c'est comme porteurs de ces d\u00e9bentures et cessionnaires des droits de la cit\u00e9 de Maisonneuve que les intim\u00e9s sont devenus cr\u00e9anciers des appelantes.\nEn f\u00e9vrier et en mars 1915, les conseils des appelantes adopt\u00e8rent des r\u00e9solutions identiques donnant des instructions \u00e0 la banque d'Hochelaga, choisie comme fid\u00e9i-commissaire et d\u00e9positaire des d\u00e9bentures, de d\u00e9tacher, des d\u00e9bentures remises aux vendeurs des terrains ou constructeurs du boulevard, les coupons d'int\u00e9r\u00eat dont le terme serait totalement ou partiellement expir\u00e9 le 1er f\u00e9vrier 1915, pour les vendeurs des terrains, et \u00e0 la date des certificats des ing\u00e9nieurs, pour les montants dus aux constructeurs. Les intim\u00e9s pr\u00e9tendent avoir droit \u00e0 tous les coupons d'int\u00e9r\u00eat attach\u00e9s aux d\u00e9bentures qui leur ont \u00e9t\u00e9 remises en paiement de leur compte, m\u00eame ceux \u00e9chus avant l'acceptation des travaux par les ing\u00e9nieurs.\nCette pr\u00e9tention a \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9e par les intim\u00e9s dans une action intent\u00e9e par eux contre la cit\u00e9 de Maisonneuve et la banque d'Hochelaga, mise en cause, en d\u00e9cembre 1915. La banque avait remis aux intim\u00e9s des d\u00e9bentures pour le montant de leur compte, mais en avait d\u00e9tach\u00e9 les coupons d'int\u00e9r\u00eat \u00e9chus le premier juin et le premier d\u00e9cembre 1915 et les coupons \u00e0 \u00e9choir le 1er juin 1916, et l'action demandait que ces coupons fussent remis aux intim\u00e9s. La cit\u00e9 de Maisonneuve, d\u00e9fenderesse, appela en garantie les corporations appelantes et celles-ci contest\u00e8rent l'action en garantie qui, nous informe-t-on, est encore pendante. Sur l'action principale, la cour du Banc du Roi, en d\u00e9cembre 1917, condamna la cit\u00e9 de Maisonneuve \u00e0 remettre les coupons d\u00e9tach\u00e9s \u00e0 Quinlan & Robertson Ltd. o\u00f9 \u00e0 leur payer $12,420.00. Le motif sur lequel ce jugement est bas\u00e9 se lit comme suit:\nConsid\u00e9rant que la stipulation du contrat intervenu entre les parties que l'appelante serait pay\u00e9e en d\u00e9bentures au pair, comporte que des d\u00e9bentures et les coupons d'int\u00e9r\u00eat forment un seul tout, et que l'appelante a droit aux coupons attach\u00e9s \u00e0 ces d\u00e9bentures, m\u00eame pour ceux de ces coupons qui repr\u00e9sentent l'int\u00e9r\u00eat \u00e9chu avant l'ex\u00e9cution des travaux.\nApr\u00e8s la reddition de ce jugement, la cit\u00e9 de Maison-neuve remit aux intim\u00e9s 372 coupons d'int\u00e9r\u00eat qui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9tach\u00e9s des d\u00e9bentures de la paroisse du Sault au R\u00e9collet, et les intim\u00e9s ayant d\u00e9pos\u00e9 ces coupons entre les mains de la Banque de Toronto, la ville de Montr\u00e9al-Nord, mettant les intim\u00e9s en cause, revendiqua ces coupons comme sa propri\u00e9t\u00e9. Cette demande fut contest\u00e9e par les intim\u00e9s et nous est maintenant soumise. Il y a une deuxi\u00e8me action par les intim\u00e9s contre la ville St. Michel. Les intim\u00e9s avaient re\u00e7u de la cit\u00e9 de Maisonneuve, en vertu du jugement susdit, 776 coupons d'int\u00e9r\u00eat qui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9tach\u00e9s de d\u00e9bentures du village de St. Michel de Laval, et ils en demandent le paiement \u00e0 la ville de St. Michel, soit $26,449.78. Cette action fut contest\u00e9e par cette derni\u00e8re et nous est \u00e9galement soumise.\nIl appert aux proc\u00e9dures que dans cette deuxi\u00e8me action, la d\u00e9fenderesse produisit une confession de jugement pour $11,053.68, et jugement fut imm\u00e9diatement rendu en faveur des intim\u00e9s pour cette somme, r\u00e9servant tout recours aux intim\u00e9s pour la diff\u00e9rence; ce n'est que cette diff\u00e9rence qui soit maintenant en question.\nEnfin il y a une troisi\u00e8me action par les intim\u00e9s contre la ville de Montr\u00e9al-Nord, et contest\u00e9e par cette derni\u00e8re, demandant le paiement de $4,214.22, montant de 124 coupons d'int\u00e9r\u00eat provenant de d\u00e9bentures de la paroisse du Sault au R\u00e9collet.\nToutes ces actions, qui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9unies, ont \u00e9t\u00e9 jug\u00e9es en faveur des appelantes par la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure, mais sur appel la Cour du Banc du Roi a infirm\u00e9 ces jugements. Les honorables juges de cette cour ont accept\u00e9 l'autorit\u00e9 de la d\u00e9cision de la m\u00eame cour en d\u00e9cembre 1917, sans toutefois regarder cette d\u00e9cision comme chose jug\u00e9e \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard des deux municipalit\u00e9s, qui, bien qu'assign\u00e9es en garantie par la cit\u00e9 de Maisonneuve, n'\u00e9taient pas parties \u00e0 l'action principale contre cette derni\u00e8re. Je suis \u00e9galement d'avis pour ce motif qu'il n'y a pas chose jug\u00e9e ici, mais comme cette cour n'est pas li\u00e9e par la d\u00e9cision de la cour d'appel en d\u00e9cembre 1917 il faut juger la question soumise ind\u00e9pendamment de cet arr\u00eat. Les appelantes pr\u00e9tendent qu'elles ne devaient payer \u00e0 la ville de Maisonneuve que le montant que celle-ci a d\u00e9pens\u00e9 pour les boulevards, que ces d\u00e9penses n'ont \u00e9t\u00e9 encourues qu'apr\u00e8s l'\u00e9mission des d\u00e9bentures, que les appelantes ne pouvaient \u00eatre tenues de payer l'int\u00e9r\u00eat avant la naissance de leur dette, et qu'ainsi les coupons d'int\u00e9r\u00eat repr\u00e9sentant les int\u00e9r\u00eats \u00e9chus sur les d\u00e9bentures avant la cr\u00e9ation de cette dette de remboursement ne pouvaient \u00eatre r\u00e9clam\u00e9s, ni par la cit\u00e9 de Maisonneuve, ni par les intim\u00e9s qui les avaient recus en ex\u00e9cution du jugement qu'ils avaient obtenu contre cette cit\u00e9 dans une instance \u00e0 laquelle les appelantes n'\u00e9taient pas parties.\nA premi\u00e8re vue, on peut \u00eatre frapp\u00e9 par ce raisonnement; mais pour d\u00e9terminer s'il est bien fond\u00e9, il faut avoir \u00e9gard aux documents l\u00e9gislatifs et autres qui ont cr\u00e9\u00e9 la dette des appelantes envers la cit\u00e9 de Maisonneuve et pourvu au mode de paiement de cette dette.\nLa loi, 3 Geo. V. ch. 58, a commenc\u00e9 par cr\u00e9er une obligation \u00e0 la charge des deux municipalit\u00e9s de payer apr\u00e8s la sanction du r\u00e8glement de la cit\u00e9 de Maisonneuve par le lieutenant-gouverneur en conseil, aux conditions qu'il jugerait convenables, toutes sommes en capital et en int\u00e9r\u00eats qui seraient d\u00e9pens\u00e9es pour le boulevard Pie IX.\nD'apr\u00e8s le r\u00e8glement n\u00b0 143, adopt\u00e9 par la cit\u00e9 de Maisonneuve sous l'autorit\u00e9 de cette loi, la part de chaque municipalit\u00e9 dans l'achat des terrains et la construction du boulevard, devait \u00eatre pay\u00e9e aussit\u00f4t que le r\u00e8glement aurait re\u00e7u la sanction du lieutenant-gouverneur en conseil.\nIl n'\u00e9tait question jusqu'ici que d'un paiement \u00e0 \u00eatre effectu\u00e9 en argent. Mais, nous dit-on, les appelantes, forc\u00e9es ainsi de payer pour un ouvrage au sujet duquel elles n'avaient apparemment pas \u00e9t\u00e9 consult\u00e9es, ont plaid\u00e9 devant le gouvernement leur manque de moyens, et pour cette raison le gouvernement modifia leur obligation leur permettant de solder cette dette au moyen de d\u00e9bentures payables en quarante ans avec int\u00e9r\u00eat n'exc\u00e9dant pas 6% et que la cit\u00e9 de Maisonneuve devait accepter au pair.\nC'est pour solder cette dette que les corporations appelantes ont chacune d'elles adopt\u00e9 un r\u00e8glement qui fixe la date de ces d\u00e9bentures au 1er d\u00e9cembre 1914, \u00e0 partir de quelle date les coupons d'int\u00e9r\u00eat doivent \u00eatre pay\u00e9s, et ce r\u00e8glement d\u00e9clare (clauses l et 7 combin\u00e9es) que les d\u00e9bentures avec leurs coupons serontremises, soit directement ou par l'interm\u00e9diaire d'un fid\u00e9i-commissaire, \u00e0 la cit\u00e9 de Maisonneuve qui les acceptera au pair, aufuretmesure qu'avancera, sur le territoire de la municipalit\u00e9, l'entreprise du boulevard, et sur certificat de l'ing\u00e9nieur,\nen paiement, acquittement et extinction de l'obligation susdite de la corporation au sujet de cette partie du boulevard Pie IX.\nIl n'y a aucune r\u00e9serve ici des coupons d'int\u00e9r\u00eat qui pourraient \u00e9choir avant la construction du boulevard, mais on ordonne le paiement de la dette de la corporation au moyen de ces d\u00e9bentures \u00e0 \u00eatre accept\u00e9es au pair, quoique leur valeur r\u00e9elle puisse \u00eatre bien moindre.\nLes r\u00e8glements des corporations appelantes, je l'ai dit, ont \u00e9t\u00e9 confirm\u00e9s et ratifi\u00e9s par la l\u00e9gislature, et les appelantes ne pouvaient modifier leur obligation apr\u00e8s ces r\u00e8glements par les instructions qu'elles ont donn\u00e9es \u00e0 leur fid\u00e9icommissaire ou agent.\nEn d'autres termes, les appelantes ont obtenu la facult\u00e9 de solder une dette d'une somme d'argent au moyen de leurs d\u00e9bentures dont elles ont elles-m\u00eames fix\u00e9 la date et dont, par la teneur de ces d\u00e9bentures, elles ont promis payer l'int\u00e9r\u00eat \u00e0 compter de cette date. La cit\u00e9 de Maisonneuve, cr\u00e9anci\u00e8re de la dette des appelantes, a droit de recevoir ces d\u00e9bentures avec tous leurs coupons d'int\u00e9r\u00eat qui en font partie int\u00e9grante, et les intim\u00e9s, cessionnaires de cette cit\u00e9, y ont le m\u00eame droit.\nLa question de savoir si par suite de leurs r\u00e8glements, les appelantes se trouveront \u00e0 payer l'int\u00e9r\u00eat avant la confection du boulevard ou un int\u00e9r\u00eat exc\u00e9dant 6%\u2014mais les d\u00e9bentures ne comportent que cet int\u00e9r\u00eat\u2014ne peut donc pas \u00eatre soulev\u00e9e dans l'esp\u00e8ce. Les d\u00e9bentures \u00e9mises par les appelantes avec leurs coupons servent au paiement de la dette des appelantes, et la cit\u00e9 de Maisonneuve a droit \u00e0 ces d\u00e9bentures telles qu'\u00e9mises. Les appelantes ont promis d'en faire une dation en paiement, ce qui \u00e9quivaut \u00e0 la promesse de vendre ou transporter ces d\u00e9bentures, et il est clair que le d\u00e9biteur qui convient d'acquitter sa dette au moyen d'une dation en paiement ne peut, apr\u00e8s la convention stipulant cette dation en paiement, changer la chose qu'il a promis de donner en paiement ou en diminuer la valeur.\nPour ces raisons, qui ne diff\u00e8rent pas sensiblement du motif qui a d\u00e9termin\u00e9 le jugement de la cour du Banc du Roi, en d\u00e9cembre, 1917, je suis d'avis que les jugements dont on se plaint sont bien fond\u00e9s et que les appels doivent \u00eatre renvoy\u00e9s avec d\u00e9pens.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Letourneau, Beaulieu, Marin & Mercier.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Perron, Taschereau, Rinfret, Vall\u00e9e & Genest.\n",

P. Co., in 1903, gave a mortgage of all its property to a trust company and agreed to provide a fund to redeem said bonds by paying, on the first of July in each year from 1903, one dollar for each electrical horse power sold and paid for during the preceding calendar year. In 1906 it gave another mortgage to secure debentures and again agreed to provide a sinking fund on the same terms and conditions except that the rate was twenty-five cents per h.p. payable out of net earnings. In 1917 the Hy. EL Com. entered into a contract with A. (acting for himself and other shareholders) to purchase ninety per cent of shares in the Ont. P. Co. and as much of the remaining ten per cent as A. controlled when the sale was completed. In this contract A. covenanted that when the sale was completed he would leave with the Ont. P. Co. a sum estimated by him to be equal to \u201c** sinking fund payments on the bonds and debentures * * * which shall have accrued but shall not be due at the time for completion.\u201d The time for completion was fixed at Aug. 1, 1917. On that date A. left with Ont. P. Co. a sum representing the power sold and paid for during the preceding month of July. Held, Anglin J. dissenting, that the phrase \u201cpayments * * accrued but not due\u201d meant that the obligation to pay accrued (in the conventional sense meant by the parties) as soon as sufficient h.p. was sold and paid for and continued to accrue de die in diem so that A. was obliged to leave an amount equal to one dollar per h.p. sold and paid for from the first of Jan. the beginning of the calendar year 1917.\nPer Duff J. The interest and sinking fund payments under the second mortgage where payable out of net profits. As the existence of such profits has not been shown there is no liability to pay.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario reversing the judgment at the trial in favour of the defendant.\nThe material facts are sufficiently indicated in the above head-note.\nLafleur K.C. and Maclnnes K.C. (E.F. Newcombe with them) for the appellant.\nAnglin K.C. for the respondent.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014By agreement dated 12th April, 1917, the respondent (hereinafter called the vendor) entered into an agreement with the Hydro-Electric Power Commission of Ontario (hereinafter called the purchaser) to which The King, represented by the Lieutenant Governor of Ontario; The Ontario Power Company of Niagara Falls; The Ontario Transmission Company, Limited; and Niagara, Lockport & Ontario Power Company, were also parties, whereby the vendor agreed, by the first operative part thereof, as follows:\u2014\nFirst: Vendor agrees to sell to the purchaser and the purchaser agrees to purchase from the vendor, ninety thousand (90,000) shares of the par value of one hundred dollars ($100.00) each, of the capital stock of the Power Company and the remaining ten thousand (10,000,) of the par value of one million dollars ($1,000,000) to the extent that the holders thereof put the vendor in a position to make delivery of such shares to the purchaser prior to the time for completion as hereinafter denned. It is rendered clear by further parts of the agreement that the object of the purchaser was to acquire the practical ownership of the Power Company and certain other properties or assets set forth in a schedule, and that the Power Company had given mortgages by the terms of which certain debentures and interest were to be secured and further that to improve the security and reduce the amount of such liabilities certain sums were to be paid annually into a so-called sinking fund kept by the Trust Company holding said mortgage securities on behalf of the debenture holders secured by said mortgages.\nThe agreement provided that it should not become operative unless and until executed and delivered by all the parties.\nThe vendor agreed that neither the Power Company nor the Transmission Company would, before the the time for completion, create any further shares of their capital stocks respectively, or any bonds, debentures or like securities.\nThe time for completion was to be the first day of the calendar month that should fall next after sixty days from the execution and delivery of said agreement by all the parties thereto, which turned out according to the course of such events to be the 1st of August, 1917.\nThe agreement contained the following provisions:\nThe vendor agrees with the Power Company and the purchaser that in addition to the assets set out in said schedule \u201cC\u201d hereto, there shall be left in the hands of the Power Company at the time for completion a sum estimated by the vendor to be equal to\u2014\n(a) Interest and Sinking Fund payments on the bonds and debentures of the Power Company and the Transmission Company mentioned in the said Schedule \u201cD\u201d which shall have accrued but shall not be due at the time for completion, and (b) The proper proportion of all rentals and payments to the Commissioners of the Queen Victoria Niagara Falls Park, and of all unpaid rates, taxes and assessments for the year 1917, adjusted to the time for completion, and if such estimate shall, after completion, prove inaccurate, the excess of deficiency when determined shall be paid by the vendor to the Power Company, or by the Power Company or the purchaser to the vendor as the case may require.\nThe vendor and purchaser have disagreed over the construction of item (a) of the foregoing part of the agreement and hence this litigation over the correct computation of the amount to be left in the sinking fund.\nIt seems to me clear that the very nature of what the parties were contracting for was to get the stock and other assets at the actual value they had on the price basis of the stock purchased being fixed but subject to the encumbrances being increased by interest or being reduced by what had accrued in favour of the sinking fund, but not yet payable, and to be adjusted accordingly as if payable on the 1st of August.\nThey seem to have agreed to treat everything else mentioned but the sinking fund in that way.\nAnd, as an illustration of such mode of adjustment counsel for respondent told us in answer to a question I put that the taxes were computed up to the 1st of August and so agreed on.\nCounsel\u2019s suggestion about taxes being due in Ontario according to the statute declaring them so from the beginning of the year, does not, I respectfully submit, seem a very convincing reason for refusing to apply same rule to the sinking fund item.\nTo fall back upon the first of July pay day for the amount earned in the previous calendar year according to the agreement with the Trust Company does not seem to me any more convincing. The respondent allowed for the month of July and paid accordingly, but refuses to pay for the six previous months.\nI cannot follow the reasoning which allows for July but refuses that which in like manner had accrued in the sense the parties so evidently used the word in relation to the words following it \u201cbut shall not be due at the time for completion\u201d.\nThe argument founded on the terms of one or more of the mortgages to the Trust Company seems rather far afield.\nAnd supposing the agreement had been fully executed by all parties on its date, and thus the 1st of July had become the date for adjustment, some of the arguments would, so far as founded on these incidents, have to be changed somewhat.\nPerhaps then it would have been argued that the sum to be left in the sinking fund being due but unpaid need not be paid at all because it was in regard only to what \u201cshall have accrued but shall not be due\u201d that this provision was applicable.\nI must say that I fully agree with the reasoning of the learned trial judge as applied when correcting in the formal judgment the amount recoverable as being what was within the reasonable contemplation of the parties.\nAgreeing as I do with that and the reasoning of the Chief Justice of the Exchequer Court, presiding in the second Appellate Division when the further documents in evidence were presented for the first time, I need not repeat what has been well said.\nI am of the opinion that the appeal should be allowed with costs and the judgment of the learned trial judge be restored with costs throughout. DUFF J.\u2014The majority of the Appellate Division has held that the sinking fund payments are, for the purposes of the agreement of April, 1917, to be treated as accruing de die in diem between the dates fixed for payment and as apportionable accordingly. This, it is not seriously disputed, involves the attribution to language giving rise to the dispute of an unusual and unnatural meaning. It is the basis, indeed, of the respondent\u2019s argument that these payments accrue due as an entirety on the date of payment and that there is not in the interval any accrual in any sense known to the law and that accordingly, apart from some special understanding that they should be considered apportionable for the purposes of the agreement out of which the dispute arises, they are not apportionable. I am convinced that the language of the clause in question is perfectly sensible with reference to the subjects to which it relates, the interest and sinking fund payments dealt with, and applying the language of the clause in its ordinary and well understood meaning the appellants have established their contention with reference to the first trust deed but have failed to establish it with reference to the second.\nThe controversy concerns the effect of the words\ninterest and sinking fund payments on the bonds and debentures of the Power Company and the Transmission Company mentioned in Schedule D which shall have accrued but shall not be due at the time for completion\nI agree with the argument presented on behalf of the respondent that we must be informed of the provisions of the instruments dealing with the payments for interest and sinking fund here referred to in order to ascertain the meaning and effect of the words \u201cshall have accrued but shall not be yet due\u201d. But the object of looking at these instruments, it must be observed, is to ascertain the meaning expressed by the words themselves in the context in which they appear having regard to the particular circumstances with reference to which they are used. The subjects of this provision are such interest and sums payable for the purpose of a sinking fund as shall have accrued but shall not be due at the time mentioned; and in order to apply the provision you must ascertain what interest and what sums of the character mentioned fall at the specified time within the described category\u2014the category defined by the words\ninterest and sinking fund payments * * * accrued * * but not yet due.\nThe word \u201cdue\u201d in relation to moneys in respect of which there is a legal obligation to pay them may mean either that the facts making the obligation operative have come into existence with the exception that the day of payment has not yet arrived, or it may mean that the obligation has not only been completely constituted but is also presently exigible. That it is used in the latter sense in the present instance is perfectly clear\u2014otherwise the contrast expressed between payments \u201caccrued\u201d and payments \u201cdue\u201d would, especially in the case of interest, be patent nonsense. The most natural meaning of such a phrase as \u201caccrued payments\u201d would be, and standing alone it would prima facie receive that reading, moneys presently payable; but the word \u201caccrued\u201d according to well recognized usage has, as applied to rights or liabilities the meaning simply of completely constituted\u2014and it may have this meaning although it appears from the context that the right completely constituted or the liability completely constituted is one which is only exercisable or enforceable in futuro\u2014a debt for example which is debitum in praesenti solvendum in futuro. It is in this sense that it has been widely applied to express the fact that such a liability has been created in relation to a sum of money, part of a whole (made up of an accumulation of such parts) which is not to be payable until a later date, and it is in this sense that it seems to be used in the clause before us.\nI fear I must, in view of the arguments advanced on behalf of the respondent and of the opinions expressed in the Appellate Division to which I shall refer with more particularity later, elaborate a little this point as to the meaning of the word \u201caccrued.\u201d Generally sums received as rent, for example, and other sums of money payable periodically at fixed times are not, apart from statute, apportionable unless by reason of express provision or by implication an intention is manifested that they should become due pro rata from day to day. This intention is sometimes implied from the purpose of the payment as for instance in the case of charges for the maintenance of children which, though payable at fixed times, are considered to accrue from day to day because intended for the daily maintenance of the children. Hay v. Palmer[1]. So in the case of interest where the interest payable on money lent was payable at fixed periods, it was held none the less to become due de die in diem and this upon the ground that the creditor might call in his capital at any time and interest was considered to be earned and to become due each day as the price of the creditor\u2019s forbearance. Wilson v. Harman[2]; Hay v. Palmer1; Pearly v. Smith[3]; Ex parte Smyth[4]. And this conception of the contract to pay at a specified date interest on money lent\u2014that the sum payable on the date fixed was an accumulation of sums which had accrued de die in diem (a day according to a familiar notion being treated for this purpose as an indivisible unit)\u2014came to be accepted as corresponding with the true nature of such a contract even when the principal, being itself payable at a fixed date, would not be called in at the discretion of the creditor. In In re Rogers Trusts[5] Kindersley V.C. declined, after investigating the practice in the master\u2019s office, to give effect to an argument that the principle was confined to those cases where the creditor was entitled to recall his principal at pleasure.\nAnd the form of words employed to express the idea that interest reserved as payable on a fixed date becomes due from day to day (because earned by forbearance of principal) has varied little since Lord Hardwicke\u2019s time. Lord Hardwicke himself used the phrases \u201caccrues every day\u201d in Pearly v. Smith[6] and \u201cbecomes due from day to day\u201d in Wilson v. Harman[7]; Mr. Swanston in his note to Ex parte Smyth[8] \u201caccruing de die in diem\u201d and \u201cbecomes due de die in diem\u201d; and Kindersley V.C. at page 340 in Re Rogers Trusts6, says\nthe interest payable on the debentures though payable half yearly is not an entirety but an accumulation of each day\u2019s interest which accrues de die in diem and which though not presently payable is still due.\nAn accurate writer, Mr. Leake, speaking of interest upon debts payable at fixed periods says it is considered to \u201caccrue due\u201d. Leake, Uses and Profits of Land, page 447. The same phraseology appears in the Apportionment Act of 1870, which provides that certain\nperiodical payments in the nature of income * * * shall, like interest on money lent, be considered as accruing from day to day\nalthough it is at the same time provided that the apportioned part of such payment shall only be payable or recoverable when \u201cthe entire portion * * * shall become payable,\u201d And in the judgments applying the Apportionment Act there are many illustrations of this use of the word \u201caccrue\u201d. One or two examples will suffice.\nIn In re Howell[9] the court of Queen\u2019s Bench had to consider the question whether, a tenant having become bankrupt during the currency of a quarter, that part of the quarter\u2019s rent apportionable to the part of the quarter before the order of adjudication should be held to be rent \u201caccrued due\u201d, within section 42, s.s. 1 of the Bankruptcy Act of 1883. Such apportionable part of the quarter\u2019s rent was of course not recoverable from the tenant until the expiry of the quarter; but it was held, nevertheless, that is to say, notwithstanding the fact that it was not payable until the end of the quarter, to have \u201caccrued due\u201d within the meaning of section 42, from day to day. In other words, the effect of the Apportionment Act was held to be that, rent accruing de die in diem, the part attributable to the time elapsed must be considered as \u201caccrued due\u201d for the purpose of applying a statute passed before the Apportionment Act itself.\nAgain in In re Lucas[10], the Court of Appeal had to consider the construction and effect of a will by which a testator had directed his executors to \u201cforgive to\u201d a certain tenant all rent or arrears of rent which may be due and owing from him to me at the time of my decease.\nThe court differed as to the construction of the phrase but there appears to have have been no difference of opinion upon the point that rent, although payable at a fixed date, becomes, by force of the language of the Act \u201cconsidered as accruing from day to day\u201d, due from day to day, the amount so due being debitum in praesenti solvendum in futuro; as Fry L.J. says at page 32, section 2 of the Apportionment Act\naltered the Common Law of England, and whereas before the Act rent only, (unless of course it is otherwise specially reserved) became due when it became payable after the Act it became due from day to day\nI will not multiply examples. Where, as Kindersley V.C. says, a lump sum is made payable on a specified date and where, having regard to the purposes of the payment or to the terms of the instrument, this sum must be considered to be made up of an accumulation of sums in respect of which the right to receive payment is completely constituted before the date fixed for payment, then it is quite within the settled usage of lawyers to describe each of such accumulated parts as a sum accrued or accrued due before the date of payment. Sums of money so divisible are to be distinguished from sums which, payable at a fixed date, are so payable as an entirety and not divisible at all. Such as, for example, rent before the Apportionment Act unless a contrary intention appeared from the manner in which it was reserved; and wages unless (as where the sum payable periodically is made up of moneys due for piece work 6 Q.B.D. 1) the terms or circumstances of the hiring express or imply another intention. These (rent and wages are selected by the respondents as typical illustrations of their proposition that \u201ca debt accrued only when due\u201d) are not apportionable because, as Littledale J. said in Slack v. Sharpe[11] (a case cited by Riddell J. and relied upon by the respondents here)\nalthough the time in respect of which the rent becomes due goes on accumulating the rent is an entire thing and becomes due all at once.\nLet us consider then the application of the contractual clause in question to the sinking fund payments in respect of which the dispute arises. And first of the earlier series of debentures secured by the Trust Deed of the 2nd Feb., 1903.\nThe language of the trust deed which describes the obligation, and the conditions of it, to pay into a sinking fund or rather to pay to the trustee for the purposes of a sinking fund is far from precise. The company is to\npay * * the sum of $1.00 for each electrical horse power sold by the company and paid for by the purchasers thereof during the preceding calendar year.\nThe expression \u201celectrical horse power\u201d denotes, of course, a rate, an engineer\u2019s unit for measuring the time rate of expenditure of electrical energy in doing mechanical work. Obviously this eliptical language must have been employed with reference to some words or some business practice known to the parties. Its real import would appear to be sufficiently ascertained from the subsequent course of business, followed by common consent, in which \u201celectrical horse power\u201d in this clause was treated by both parties as denoting an electrical horse power \u201cyear\u201d an aggregate of 8760 or 8784 electrical horse power hours according to the year. The electrical horse power hour means, for all pertinent purposes, electrical energy supplied for one hour and always capable on expenditure of performing mechanical work at the rate of one horse power; and as the practice of the parties shews, for the purpose of computing the sinking fund payments, it was of course immaterial whether horse power hours were supplied simultaneously or in succession, the method adopted having been to ascertain the aggregate number of horse power hours for a year from half hour readings, and then to divide that number by 8760 or 8784, as the case might be. The quotient would give the number of dollars payable on the 1st of July succeeding the end of the calendar year.\nIt was assumed on the argument and appears to have been assumed throughout the litigation that the amount of the sinking fund payment was determined by the number of horse power hours sold during the specified period, i.e., the preceding calendar year. According to the true meaning of the deed (see also the form of the bond, in the record) it may very well be that this sum is a function of the number of horse power hours paid for during the year, not of the number sold, but the admissions as well as the course of litigation entitle us to proceed upon the assumption above mentioned; and indeed it is immaterial, in so far as regards the effect of the agreement of 1917, which construction be followed. According to this construction, just as soon in the month of January as, according to the readings of the company\u2019s meters, it appeared that 8760 or any multiple of 8760 horse power hours (or the equivalent in kilowatt hours) had been supplied a liability arose to pay to the trustee the sum of $1.00 or the corresponding multiple of that sum, for the purpose of the sinking fund and a like additional liability arose at every successive point of time when the aggregate number of horse power hours, so supplied, reached 8760 or a multiple of 8760. The liability was then fully constituted but the obligation was not to pay at once, it was to pay in the future.\nIf on the true construction of the sinking fund clause in the trust deed the amount of the sinking fund payments depends upon the amount paid during the calendar year for sales whenever made, then an obligation to pay accrues the moment the price of a horse power year is paid to the company.\nTo these facts the application of the clause under discussion seems to present little difficulty. The sum of one dollar becomes due to the trustee for sinking fund as each \u201chorse power year\u201d, in the sense above described, is sold or paid for according to the proper construction of the contract in the sense that there is an indefeasible obligation then and there constituted to pay on the 1st of July succeeding the termination of the current calendar year. The aggregate of these sums of $1.00 due in this sense during the current calendar year constitutes the totality of the payment which becomes exigible on the date named for payment. Therefore it would be strictly in accordance with the usage illustrated above to apply to these several sums of $1.00, the phrase \u201cshall have accrued but shall not be due\u201d on the several dates on which the duty to pay them arose.\nI have dwelt upon this at some length because of some observations in the leading judgment in the court below which appear to indicate that the position of the appellants at this point has been misapprehended. Riddell J. says:\nIt is common ground that there is no accrual under the mortgages and independently of the sale contract\u2014in the absence of statutory provision, a debt only accrues when it is due\u2014Patteson J. in Slack v. Sharye[12]. The appellants maintained most explicitly before the trial judge as well as in this court, that under both trust deeds of the Power Company there was accrual in the manner above mentioned, and there was no admission that the principle of the case cited by Riddell J. (which applies only as explained above to periodical payments becoming due as entireties such as wages and rent when not otherwise reserved) had any sort of application to the sinking fund payments in question. Indeed Riddell J. himself says in a later passage of his judgment:\nIt is argued that the payments must be considered as accruing by wording of the mortgages\u201d.\nAnd the learned judge then proceeds to illustrate the appellants\u2019 contention by a useful analogy.\nI can see, (he says) no difference between such a provision\u2014(speaking of the sinking fund clause) and a provision that a coal mining company should pay $1.00 for each ton of coal sold and paid for during the preceding calendar year.\nSubstitute \u201chorse power year\u201d for \u201cton of coal\u201d and this sentence accurately paraphrases the clause in question from the appellants\u2019 point of view\u2014with the consequence under the appellants\u2019 argument, that on receipt of payment of the price of one ton of coal a liability to pay the sum specified would at once be indefeasibly constituted, in other words, such a sum would accrue due though not yet payable.\nIt is suggested moreover by the learned judge that the sinking fund payments accruing during the seven months period ending on the 1st of August could not be accurately ascertained until after the expiry of the whole year, but this is not in accordance with the admitted facts as the following passage from the respondent\u2019s factum shews:\u2014 79. On the other hand the appellants say that sinking fund payments had accrued on August 1st, 1917, in respect, and only in respect, of power sold and paid for between January 1st, 1917, and July 31st, 1917, inclusive. It is clear that on any day the power which had actually been generated and disposed of down to midnight of the preceding day could be easily and accurately ascertained. Indeed it could be so ascertained to within half an hour of ascertainment, the readings of the integrating meters being taken and recorded half hourly. On the appellants\u2019 contention, therefore, the provision for estimating was unnecessary and senseless. The exact payments could have been readily ascertained and made on August 1st, 1917.\nAnother view expressed in the court below may perhaps be noticed here. It is this. The sinking fund clause, it is said, creates an obligation to pay a sum of money for the sinking fund on a specified date and for the rest that clause only prescribes a method of ascertaining the amount which is to be paid; and counsel for the respondent urges that for all relevant purposes the effect would be just the same if the obligation was to pay the sum of $1.00 for every $10.00 of principal secured by the bonds. The answer to this seems to be that under the clause in controversy there is no liability to pay any sum for sinking fund purposes until electrical energy is sold according to the terms of the clause; then and then only the constitutive elements of the liability come into existence. But when that occurs the liability is created and is indefeasible\u2014although it is a liability only to pay in the future. The facts which determine the extent of the liability, in other words, are those which determine its existence; and it is not an unnatural but a strictly accurate use of language to describe such a liability as a liability \u201caccrued\u201d.\nThe respondent\u2019s chief contention expressed in a variety of forms has two branches. 1st, that the sinking fund payments under all three series of debentures are entire payments and consequently that in respect of such payments or any part of them there could not in any sense known to the law, be an accrual before the day on which they became exigible; and 2nd, that the words under consideration can have no operation unless some special meaning calculated to serve the purposes of the parties in framing this clause be ascribed to them, and they should therefore be read in a sense which makes the sinking fund payments under all three series apportionable. This sense, it is argued, is supplied by the analogy of interest which accrues de die in diem between the dates upon which it becomes periodically payable.\nMy reasons for rejecting this contention will perhaps sufficiently appear from what I have said. But to summarize briefly what has already been expressed\u2014the office of a court of law called upon to construe a written document is to ascertain the intention of the parties from the meaning of the words used and when such language is fairly capable of more than one construction, to determine that construction from the context, the subject matter and the facts in reference to which it is used; but it is no part of the function of a court in construing such instruments to endeavour to ascertain the intention of the parties from the circumstances by ascribing to words the parties have selected a non-natural meaning\u2014a signification which they will not fairly bear. Great Western Ry. Co. v. Bristol[13]. On the theory of the respondent all the sinking fund payments to which the agreement applies are non-apportionable because they accrue as entireties. The argument assumes an agreement by the parties that these payments shall for the purposes of the clause in question, be considered to accrue de die in diem. No such agreement is expressed and I can discern no good ground for assuming it. The analogy appealed to with so much emphasis\u2014the analogy of interest\u2014does not support it. In truth the argument rejects the analogy of interest, for interest as above mentioned is apportionable precisely because it does not become payable as an entirety but is considered for the reasons mentioned an accumulation of segregable elements. Nor can it be urged that on the appellants\u2019 construction the clause is without application to the Transmission Company\u2019s bonds for the clause deals with interest as well as with sinking fund payments. This implied term that all sinking fund payments, though in truth payable as entireties, are for the purposes of the agreement to be treated as accruing de die in diem, cannot, I am convinced, be deduced from the language of the clause construed in light of context and object; it can only be arrived at\u2014if at all\u2014by the inadmissible process of attributing to the parties an intention they have not expressed and bringing the documents into conformity with the assumed intention by imparting to its words a colour which does not belong to them.\nThe points raised by the appeal case have, I think, been sufficiently discussed, but I think an observation is necessary upon the attempt of the respondent to give weight to his contentions by reference to the Transmission Company\u2019s agreement. By that agreement a sum of $30,000 is payable on the 1st of July in each year for sinking fund purposes. It appears that the respondent agreeably to his construction of the apportionment clause of the agreement of April, 1917, left with the Power Company the sum of $2,500, one-twelfth of the sum of $30,000 due July 1st, 1917. The argument is now pressed upon us with not a little fervour that the failure on the part of the Power Company to return this sum was an acceptance by conduct of the respondent\u2019s interpretation of the clause in dispute.\nThe Transmission Company\u2019s agreement was not before the trial judge. It was admitted in the Appelate Division on the application of the present respondent, on the ground no doubt that the agreement being one of the instruments contemplated by that clause should be before the court, and the propriety of referring to the agreement itself does not admit of doubt. But the agreement alone was admitted, and we have no evidence before us of any of the circumstances touching the retention of the sum mentioned or of any of the communications between the parties relating to the construction of the disputed clause and whether repayment was or was not offered does not appear. The matter is not touched upon in the pleadings.\nThe question therefore whether the conduct of the parties in relation to this sum of $2,500 amounts to a construction by conduct of this agreement is obviously not a question that can be raised in this court and speculation as to that conduct can, in the absence of evidence, have no effect unless it be to becloud the real issues to be decided on the appeal.\nStill less is it permissible to assume that this court, in the absence of any issue of estoppel or the like, is bound to construe and apply the disputed clause upon the hypothesis that such construction and application are fixed and determined by something which happened between the parties of which it is not informed judicially. The respondent naturally recognized, when he decided upon his course, that a decision making all payments apportionable de die in diem would be more favourable to him than one based upon the principle for which the appellants now contend. What the respondent did in pursuance of his own interests is of no bearing upon the question before us; nor in the way in which these questions are presented is the conduct (so far as disclosed) of the appellants.\nThe respondent advances an argument founded upon the adjustment clause which he says has no office under the construction of the appellants. The argument ignores the fact that the adjustment clause applies to taxes and other matters not affected by the questions now agitated; and in relation to them I am unable to say on the material before us what practical operation or importance it may have.\nAs to the payments for sinking fund under the second trust deed of the Power Company I have reached the conclusion that the appellants must fail. It may be that the sinking fund clause creates a charge upon the net profits; but whether it creates such a charge or not there is no liability to, pay unless there are net profits. I am not sure that the appellant\u2019s contention upon this point has not eluded me. In so far as I have succeeded in apprehending it, it appears to be that the existence of net profits is a divestitive condition. I cannot agree with that. The obligation is an obligation to pay out of net profits; that is the only obligation. I think the existence of net profits is one of the constitutive elements of liability.\nIn the result the judgment of Orde J. should be varied by reducing the amount awarded by one-fifth.\nANGLIN J. (dissenting)\u2014The plaintiffs appeal from the judgment of an Appellate Divisional Court[14], reversing the judgment of Mr. Justice Orde[15] and dismissing their action. Their claim is to compel the defendant to provide a sum of $93,359.95 (and $14,579.49 interest thereon) for which Mr. Justice Orde gave them judgment, to be paid to the Toronto General Trusts Corporation as the mortgagee\u2011trustee for the holders of debenture bonds of the Ontario Power Company and to be applied by the trustee towards the redemption of such bonds. The sum awarded by the judgment of the trial court approximately represents $1.25 for each electrical horse power sold by the Power Company from the 1st of January to the 30th of June, 1917. The defendant left with the Power Company (for payment to the mortgagee-trustee on the 1st of July, 1918) the sum of $15,637.54, being an amount estimated to be equivalent to $1.25 for every electrical horse power sold by the Power Company between the 1st of July and the 1st of August, 1917, which he asserts is all that he was required so to provide under his contract with the plaintiffs.\nThe question for decision arises out of a provision in an agreement for the sale by the respondent Albright to the appellant, the Hydro-Electric Power Commission, of 90% of the shares of the stock of its co-appellant, the Ontario Power Company, and of so much of the remaining 10% of such shares as he should be able to acquire. By the provision in question (set out in full below) the vendor promised to leave with the Power Company inter alia a sum equal to so much of the sinking fund payments upon three specified mortgages as\nshall have accrued but shall not be due at the time for completion,\ni.e., of the sale contract. The Ontario Power Company also owned the stock of the Ontario Transmission Company, a subsidiary corporation. The purpose of the sale from Albright to the Hydro-Electric Power Commission was to vest in that body complete control of the Ontario Power Company, its assets and undertaking and of the Transmission Co., its assets and undertaking. It is common ground that the vendor in fact delivered to the purchaser appellant substantially all the shares of the Ontario Power Co.\nThe assets and undertaking of the Power Company were subject to two mortgages dated February, 1903, and June, 1906, respectively, made to a trustee to secure two debenture bond issues. The bonds outstanding in respect of these two mortgages on the 1st of August, 1917, when they were assumed by the purchaser, amounted respectively to $9,984,000 and $2,880,000. The assets and undertaking of the Transmission Company were likewise subject to a mortgage made to a trustee to secure bonds issued by it, dated August, 1905. This mortgage was also assumed by the purchaser and the amount outstanding in respect of the bonds secured by it was $1,805,000.\nInterest on the bonds secured by the first mortgage of the Power Company was payable half-yearly on the 1st of February and the 1st of August. The Power Company by that mortgage also undertook to pay to the mortgagee-trustee on the 1st of July in each year\u2014commencing on the 1st of July, 1909\u2014a sum of money for the purpose of a fund, called a sinking fund, to be applied towards the redemption of the bonds secured by the mortgage. The sum so to be paid on the 1st of July, 1909, and that to be paid on each subsequent anniversary of that date during the currency of the mortgage, which is to expire in 1942, was to be the equivalent of $1 for each electrical horse power sold by the company and paid for by the purchasers thereof during the preceding calendar year. The parties are agreed that \u201ccalendar year\u201d means the year from the 1st of January to the 31st of December. The trustee was required to use the money so to be paid and any interest arising therefrom while in its hands, in purchasing in the open market at the lowest price for which they should be obtainable\u2014but not exceeding par and a premium of 10% thereon and accrued interest\u2014any of the bonds secured by the mortgage that could be so purchased. The parties are in entire accord as to the mode in which the sum to be paid annually on account of the sinking fund so called should be computed. It is accurately stated in the judgment of Mr. Justice Riddell, who spoke for the majority in the Appellate Divisional Court.\nThe second mortgage, which matures in 1921, contains a like provision for sinking fund payments except that the amount to be paid on the 1st of July in each year\u2014commencing on the 1st of July, 1912\u2014is to be a sum equal to 25 cents for each electrical horse power sold and paid for during the preceding calendar year. The obligation in this instance, however, is only to pay out of \u201cnet earnings\u201d after providing for operating expenses, taxes, and interest and sinking fund payments in respect of the bonds secured by the first mortgage. Interest on the bonds secured by the second mortgage is payable half-yearly on the 1st of January and July.\nInterest on the bonds secured by the Transmission Company\u2019s mortgage, which matures in 1945, is payable half-yearly on the 1st of November and the 1st of May. By a contemporaneous agreement the Transmission Co. undertook to pay to the mortgagee\u2011trustee named in its mortgage as and for a sinking fund for the redemption of its bonds the sum of $30,000 on the 1st of July in each year, commencing on the 1st of July, 1911. There is a provision that the moneys so to be paid shall be used in purchasing the bonds of the Transmission Company outstanding similar to that in the Power Company\u2019s mortgages.\nThe scheme of the three debenture bond mortgages appears to be identical. A lump sum is to be paid by the mortgagor towards a so-called sinking fund on the 1st day of July in each year, commencing in each instance on the 1st of July which occurs approximately six years after the issue of the debenture bonds. Each of these annual payments may, in a sense, be regarded as a payment in respect of the year which expires on the day before it falls due and in that sense as accruing during that year. The sum so payable under each of the two Power Company mortgages is to be, in the case of the first mortgage, as many dollars, and, in the case of the second mortgage, as many quarter dollars, as the company shall have sold electrical horse power during the preceding calendar year; but it is none the less a lump sum payable on a fixed date and having no other relation to, or connection with, the Power Company\u2019s earnings during such preceding calendar year. Computation on the basis of sales made during the year ending on the day before that fixed for payment, or on that of sales during the year ending 12, 18 or 24 months before that date, or on any other basis which would have suited the purposes of the parties, might quite as well have been stipulated for. The character of the sum to be paid and its relation to the earnings during the \u201ccomputation period,\u201d if I may so term it, would in each case be precisely the same. In no case, except perhaps where the computation period should coincide with the year in respect of which the payment is to be made, could such payment be said to be accruing in any sense whatever during that period. In the case of the mortgage of the Transmission Company, which did not sell electrical power, a lump sum payment of a fixed amount is stipulated for in lieu of the lump sum the amount of which is to be arrived at by the computation provided for in each of the other two mortgages. This is the only difference between them; and I cannot regard it as material.\nIt is common ground that under none of these three mortgages was there any accrual in a legal sense of any part of the moneys payable towards the several sinking funds before the date on which they fell due. The entire liability for each of the three sums payable on the first of July in each year (after 1911) under the respective mortgages, and every part of it, accrued only on the day when such payment actually fell due.\nBut the sale agreement from the respondent Albright to the appellant, the Hydro Electric Commission, dated the 12th of April, 1917, contains a covenant by the vendor Albright, that at the time for completion (August 1st, 1917, i.e., 60 days after the execution and delivery of the agreement was completed) there should be\nleft in the hands of the Power Company * * * a sum estimated by the vendor to be equal to\u2014\n(a) Interest and Sinking Fund payments on the bonds and debentures of the Power Company and the Transmission Company which shall have accrued but shall not be due at the time for completion, and\n(b). The proper proportion of all rentals and payments to the Commissioners of the Queen Victoria Niagara Falls Park, and of all unpaid rates, taxes and assessments for the year 1917, adjusted to the time for completion, and if such estimate shall, after completion, prove inaccurate, the excess or deficiency when determined shall be paid by the Vendor to the Power Company, or by the Power Company or the Purchaser to the vendor as the case may require. All adjustments as to interest, rentals, taxes, etc., have been agreed upon. The parties are also at one as to the amount left by Albright with the Power Company in respect of the next sinking fund payment under the Transmission Company\u2019s mortgage. The last payment of $30,000 on that account was made by the Power Company, while still under the control of Albright, to the trustee-mortgagee on the 1st of July, 1917. The sum of $2,500, one-twelfth of the $30,000 which would become payable on the 1st of July, 1918, was left with the Power Company on that account and both parties are in accord that this was the sum which under the sale agreement the vendor covenanted should be left with the Power Company on account of that item as an amount \u201caccrued but not due\u201d at the time of completion of the sale.\nAs already stated it is common ground that nothing had legally accrued at that date in respect of the three sinking funds. Moreover, the parties are agreed that the term \u201caccrued\u201d was meant to have some conventional meaning; and as to the Transmission Company\u2019s mortgage, they both say that it was intended to designate that part of the next maturing payment of $30,000 which bears to it the same proportion as the one month elapsed since the date of the last payment bears to the 12 months which would elapse between that date and the date on which such next naturing payment would fall due. The respondent Albright contends that the word \u201caccrued\u201d bears precisely the same conventional meaning in regard to the sinking fund payments to be made under the two Power Company mortgages. The appellants, on the other hand, maintain that, as to these two payments, not one-twelfth but seven-twelfths of the next maturing payments had \u201caccrued\u201d on the 1st of August, 1917, notwithstanding that the amount due in respect of sinking fund payment under the two Power Company mortgages on the 1st of July, 1917, had been fully paid by that company to the mortgagee-trustee on that date.\nCounsel for the appellants base their contention on the fact that the amount of each of the two payments made on the 1st of July, 1917, was equivalent to $1 in the case of the first mortgage and 25 cents in the case of the second mortgage for each electric horse power sold by them during the calendar year 1916 and that the corresponding sums to be paid by the purchaser (appellant) on the 1st of July, 1918, would be similarly computed on the sales of electrical horse power made and paid for between the 1st of January and the 31st of December, 1917. They maintain that the payments made on the 1st of July, 1917, were of the amounts which had accrued under the Power Company mortgages in respect of sinking funds up to the 31st of December, 1916, and not up to the date when they fell due and were paid. They add\u2014at first blush plausibly enough\u2014that, inasmuch as the vendor has received the earnings of the Power Company from the electrical horse power sold by it between the 1st of January and the 30th of June, 1917, he should provide the money requisite to meet the corresponding portions of the sinking fund payments to be made in July, 1918, which the agreement provides should be computed on the basis of the electrical horse power sold and paid for during the whole calendar year of 1917, and that such corresponding portions of the sinking fund payments due on the 1st of July, 1918 should be deemed to have \u201caccrued\u201d de die in diem up to the 31st of December, 1917, within the meaning of that term as conventionally used in the sale agree- ment. No doubt that would be the case if it had been stipulated that the moneys to be paid on sinking fund account on the 1st of July, 1918, should be paid out of, or had in any way been made a charge upon, the proceeds of the sales of electrical horse power during the year 1917.\nBut, admittedly, the annual sinking fund instalments were not payable out of the earnings of the preceding calendar year and were in no sense a charge upon those earnings. Any view, however presented, that there was in any sense an accrual of each of such instalments during the whole calendar year preceding that in which it was made payable rests, unconsciously it may be, but nevertheless necessarily, upon the idea that the earnings of that calendar year were so charged. That idea involves a fallacy, subtle and seductive no doubt, but nevertheless a fallacy.\nSo far as they can be said to represent, or be in any way referable to, a period of elapsed time, the instalments on sinking fund accounts due on the 1st of July of any year were payments in respect of the 12 months which had then elapsed since the last previous instalments fell due. These payments may thus in a conventional sense be regarded as having accrued de die in diem during those 12 months. That, in my opinion, is the correct interpretation of the word \u201caccrued\u201d as used in regard to the sinking fund payments in clause (a) of the sale agreement above quoted. It gives to that word the same meaning when applied to each of the three mortgages in regard to which it is used, as in my opinion the parties almost certainly intended. It accords due recognition to the collocation of the words \u201cinterest and sinking fund payments\u201d; sinking fund payments are treated as accruing, like interest, from gale day to gale day. Finally, it does not ignore the fact that it is of a proportionate part of the \u201cpayments\u201d next to mature, alike on interest account and on sinking fund account, that the parties speak and apparently were contemplating the accrual.\nBut the fundamental error in the appellant\u2019s application of the word \u201caccrued\u201d is that, from whatever point of view it is considered, it necessarily involves the idea that the annual payments on account of sinking funds provided for in the two Power Company mortgages are either to be made out of the proceeds of the sales of power during the preceding calendar year or, in some way undefined and undefinable, constitute a charge on such proceeds, whereas in point of fact the number of electrical horse power sold during the preceding calendar year is introduced merely as the factor by which the number of dollars or quarter dollars that shall make up each annual instalment payable towards the respective sinking funds under the Power Company mortgages is to be determined.\nOther formidable difficulties which the appellants encounter in the application of the word \u201caccrued\u201d for which they contend suggested at bar, I find it unnecessary to discuss.\nI should perhaps allude, however, to the fact that under the second Power Company mortgage sinking fund instalments are payable only out of \u201cnet earnings\u201d after the payment inter alia of the instalment of sinking fund under the first mortgage. The existence of such \u201cnet earnings\u201d can be ascertained only on or after the date when the sinking fund payment fell due. It is therefore difficult to appreciate in the case of the bonds secured by the second mortgage how any sinking fund payment not already due can in any sense be said to have \u201caccrued\u201d. I am for the foregoing reasons of the opinion that the construction placed upon the provision of the sale agreement under consideration by the majority of the learned judges of the Appellate Divisional Court was correct and that this appeal therefore fails.\nBRODEUR J.\u2014We have to determine in this case the respondent Albright\u2019s liability concerning certain sinking fund payments under the agreement for sale by him of the 12th\u2011April, 1917 to the appellant, the Hydro Electric Commission.\nBy this agreement Albright was selling ninety per cent of the shares of a company called the Ontario Power Company. The contract dealt also with the assets and liabilities of the company and provided that these assets and liabilities were mostly transferred and assumed by the purchaser, the Hydro Electric, from the date of the completion of the contract, which was to be the first of August, 1917.\nAlbright claims that he was bound under the contract to make these sinking fund payments from the first of July to the first of August, which represented a sum of about $15,000. On the other hand, the Hydro Electric Commission contends that Albright should also provide for these sinking fund payments from the first of January, 1917, to the first of July, 1917, which would represent a sum of about $90,000.\nThe trial judge decided in favour of the Hydro Electric Commission but his judgment was reversed by the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court.\nThe case turns mostly upon the construction of the following clause of the agreement of sale.\nThe vendor agrees with the Power Company and the Purchaser that in addition to the assets set out in said schedule \u201cC\u201d hereto there shall be left in the hands of the Power Company at the time for completion a sum estimated by the vendor to be equal to (a) Interest and sinking fund payments on the bonds and debentures of the Power Company and the Transmission Company mentioned in the said schedule D which shall have accrued but shall not be due at the time for completion.\nSchedule C referred to in this clause gave a description of the assets of the Ontario Power Company and of the Transmission Company, the latter being a subsidiary company of the big corporation, the Ontario Power Company.\nSchedule D mentioned in the above clause gave a list of the liabilities due by the Ontario Power Company and the said subsidiary company. Among these liabilities were bonds and debentures due by the Power Company to the extent of nearly $13,000,000, under two mortgages dated respectively the 2nd of February, 1903, and the 30th of June, 1906, between the Power Company and the Toronto General Trust Company.\nBy these mortgages, the Ontario Power Company agreed to pay to the Toronto General Trusts for the purpose of a sinking fund for the redemption of its bonds a certain sum of money payable on the first of July of each year\nfor each electrical horse power sold by the company and paid for by the purchasers thereof during the preceding calendar year.\nIn the second of these mortgages, it was provided that the sum stipulated for the sinking fund was to come out of the net earnings of the company after payment of certain obligations therein stipulated.\nThere was also amongst the liabilities mentioned in schedule D a sum of about $2,000,000 due by the Transmission Company for bonds it had issued. But the sinking fund provided for the redemption of its bonds was a fixed sum of money. It is important to state for the purpose of giving us a correct view of the agreement for sale of the 12th of April, 1917, that the assets of the Ontario Power Company did not include any rentals or sums of money payable for power supplied which had been earned but would not be due on the first of August, 1917.\nThere was then, until the contract would be completed, an understanding that these assets earned but not paid should belong to the vendor. It is also contended with a great deal of force that the payments on the sinking fund should be treated in the same way viz: that the vendor should take care of these payments.\nBeing entitled by the agreement to receive the income earned but not paid before its completion the vendor must be supposed to take on his shoulders the responsibility for the sinking fund then accrued but not due. The time of payment which is stipulated on the first of July each year is in respect of money earned during the previous calendar year. At the beginning of each year the company binds itself to take out of its sales of horse power a certain sum of money which, on the first of July of the next year, will have to be paid to its creditors for the maintenance of the sinking fund. The accrual takes place from the first of January of each year. The sale of horse power did not provide a basis for calculating the payments. It is the condition of the liability; when the sale of a horse power is made and when the payment for it has taken place the liability arises and accrues.\nThe fact that a specific sum of money is to be paid for the sinking fund in connection with the last mortgage does not, in my opinion, alter the situation. I have come to the conclusion then that the accrual begins on the first of January, 1917 and not on the first of July.\nThe appeal should be allowed with costs of this court and of the court below and the judgment of the trial judges should be restored.\nMIGNAULT J.\u2014By agreement dated April 12th, 1917, the appellant purchased from the respondent 90,000 shares out of 100,000, the total share capital of the Ontario Power Company of Niagara Falls, and the remaining 10,000 shares to the extent that the holders thereof would put the respondent in position to make delivery, the price being 80% of the par value ($100.00) of the shares, so that if all the shares were transferred to the appellant the total price amounted to $8,000,000. The Ontario Power Company then owned the shares of a subsidiary company, the Ontario Transmission Company, Limited, which was also a party to the contract. It had entered into two mortgage agreements with the Toronto Trust Corporation, as trustee, to secure the repayment of two issues of its bonds.\nBy the first mortgage agreement, besides the payment of interest semi-annually on February 1st and August 1st, the Power Company promised to pay to the trustee on the 1st of July, 1909, and on the 1st of July in each year thereafter.\nfor the purpose of a sinking fund for the redemption of the said bonds the sum of one dollar for each electrical horse power sold by the company and paid for by the purchasers thereof during the preceding calendar year.\nBy the second mortgage agreement the Power Company in addition to the interest on its bonds payable on January 1st and July 1st, obliged itself to pay to the trustee out of its net earnings and after the payment of its operating expenses and taxes and the interest upon its first mortgage bonds and the constitution of the sinking fund in its first mortgage provided, on the 1st of July, 1912 and on the 1st of July in each year thereafter.\nfor the purpose of a sinking fund for the redemption of the said debentures the sum of twenty-five cents for each electrical horse power sold by the company and paid for by the purchasers thereof during the preceding calendar year.\nThe Transmission Company had also mortgaged its assets to secure a bond issue, and had agreed with the trustee to pay to the latter, as and for a sinking fund for the purchase of outstanding bonds, the sum of $30,000 on the 1st of July, 1911 and a like sum on the same date in succeeding years. The interest on its bonds was payable on the 1st of May and the 1st of November in each year.\nTo return to the sale agreement between these parties the third clause is of importance in view of the present controversy. Its effect, so far as it need be stated, is that the respondent agreed that he would do all things necessary to be done so that the respective assets of the Power Company and the Transmission Company should at the time for completion consist of those described in schedule \u201cC\u201d to the agreement, that their respective liabilities should at the time for completion be those described in schedule \u201cD\u201d and in default of so doing or in so far as he should not so do, the respondent would pay or settle all such liabilities. The respondent also agreed that in addition to the assets set out in schedule \u201cC\u201d there should be left in the hands of the Power Company at the time for completion a sum estimated by him to be equal to: (a) Interest and Sinking Fund payments on the bonds and debentures of the Power Company and the Transmission Company mentioned in the said Schedule \u201cD\u201d which shall have accrued but shall not be due at the time for completion, and\n(b) The proper proportion of all rentals and payments to the Commissioners of the Queen Victoria Niagara Falls Park, and of all unpaid rates, taxes, assessments for the year 1917, adjusted to the time for completion, and if such estimate shall after completion prove inaccurate, the excess or deficiency when determined shall be paid by the vendor to the Power Company, or by the Power Company or the purchaser to the vendor as the case may require.\nThe clause went on to say:\u2014\nThe assets of the Power Company at the time for completion are not intended to include any rentals, sums of moneys payable or to be become payable for power supplied or otherwise, under any lease or contract which shall have accrued or shall have been earned, but shall not be due or payable at the time for completion, and if they do include any such items the purchaser shall use every reasonable effort to collect such items, and if when collected shall pay, or procure to be paid, to the vendor, the amount thereof adjusted to the time for completion, and the purchaser shall also at the time for completion pay or procure to be paid to the vendor the value of all prepaid insurance, rentals, taxes, rates (including local improvement rates), assessments and payments for telephone services adjusted to the time for completion.\nThe parties agree that the time for completion was August 1st, 1917. The difference between them is as to the sum which the respondent should have left in the hands of the Power Company for sinking fund payments on the bonds and debentures of the Power Company. As to the bonds of the Transmission Company there is no difficulty; $30,000 was to be payable on the 1st of July, 1918 and $2,500, one-twelfth of that sum is admitted to be the proper amount. The respondent contended that one-twelfth of the estimated sinking fund payment due on the 1st of July, 1918, on the bonds of the Power Company was all that he had to provide for, while the appellant claimed that it was entitled to seven-twelfths of that sum or the amount representing the period between the 1st of January and the 1st of August 1917, calculated in the manner and according to the formula adopted by the parties. The learned trial judge took the latter view, the Appellate Division, Mulock C.J. Ex., dissenting, the former one.\nEverything turns on the meaning of the words\nsinking fund payments * * which shall have accrued but shall not be due at the time for completion.\nI have cited the clause in the mortgage agreements which provides for these sinking fund payments. It obliges the Power Company to pay on the 1st of July in each year\nfor the purpose of a sinking fund for the redemption of the said bonds the sum of one dollar (in the case of the second issue of bonds, twenty-five cents) for each electrical horse power sold by the company and paid for by the purchasers thereof during the previous calendar year.\nThe respondent contends that these so-called sinking fund payments are prepayments of capital to be made on the first of July each year, and that the sum of one dollar or twenty-five cents, for each electrical horse-power, etc., is merely the measure of the amount to be paid. If this were the case, the word \u201caccrued\u201d would be meaningless, for periodical payments on capital cannot be said to accrue while they are not yet due.\nThe appellant claims that the sale and the receipt of the sale price of electrical horse-power is the condition of the obligation to make a sinking fund payment. That appears to result from the language of the mortgage agreement and if it can further be said that, on these sales of electrical horse-power being made and paid for, the sum of one dollar or twenty-five cents for each electrical horse power is to go to form the next sinking fund payment, there is, in that sense, something that can be said to accrue. It seems obvious, and the parties admit, that the word \u201caccrue\u201d was used by them in a conventional sense, so we have to look at clause three of the sale agreement to discover what this conventional sense really is.\nThis clause appears to me to be an adjustment clause. It must be remembered that at the date of the sale agreement the parties could not know precisely what would be the time for completion, which was the time for adjusting everything between them, and they provided for this adjustment at that uncertain date by a very detailed clause. The interest payments on the bonds, which fell due at different dates, are dealt with in the same manner as the sinking fund payments and the taxes, rates, asssessments, payments for telephone services, rentals, and the value of all prepaid insurance were to be paid by the purchaser to the vendor, adjusted to the time for completion. Similarly with respect to any rentals, sums of moneys payable or to become payable for power supplied or otherwise, under any lease or contract, which should have accrued or should have been earned, but should not be due or payable at the time for completion, and which the purchaser should collect, it promised to pay the same to the vendor adjusted to the time for completion. The vendor was also to leave in the hands of the Power Company the proper proportion of all rentals and payments to the Commissioners of the Queen Victoria Niagara Falls Park adjusted to the time for completion.\nIt is therefore clear that this clause is an adjustment clause and it would be singular if the sinking fund payments were not also to be adjusted to the time for completion. Indeed the respondent admits that they must be since he has paid a twelfth of the estimated sinking fund payment to become due on the 1st of July, 1918, but his difficulty is that the parties clearly looked on these payments as accruing from day to day and from month to month, and from his point of view it is difficult to find any accrual.\nThe appellant\u2019s contention, to my mind, is more consistent with the clearly expressed intention of the parties to adjust everything to the date for completion, and to treat these sinking fund payments as if they accrued from day to day. For if the respondent is to keep the full amount received for each electrical horse-power sold and paid for from January 1st to August 1st, 1917, and the appellant is to pay to the trustee one dollar and twenty-five cents for each electrical horse-power so sold and paid for to the respondent (and it would be paid to him by the appellant under the clause concerning collections of amounts due for previous sales of power if the respondent had not already received it from the purchasers) the parties have not adjusted everything at the time for completion and the respondent would receive without obligation to pay and the appellant would pay without having received. I hesitate to place such a meaning on this clause unless I am forced to do so by its language.\nIn his factum, the respondent says:\nThe obvious purpose of taking the Power Company\u2019s sales during the preceding calendar year as the basis for calculating or computing the sinking fund payment due on a stated day in the next year was simply that periodical repayments of principal should be in proportion to revenue previously received. The words quoted had to do with the ascertainment of the amount of each payment but with nothing else.\nI would think that if periodical repayments of principal should be in proportion to revenue previously received they should, as between vendor and purchaser, be borne by the one by whom the revenue was received, otherwise the adjustment which is so minutely provided for as to everything else, fails in respect of these sinking fund payments.\nAnd it must not be forgotten that the parties treat these payments as accruing before they become due. The word \u201caccrue\u201d can have some meaning, at least a conventional one, if applied to the dollar for each electrical horse-power sold and paid for, which goes to form the next sinking fund payment and in a sense is appropriated thereto, for the fund which is to form the next sinking fund payment grows thus from day to day, and whether it is put aside for that purpose or not is immaterial. We have therefore something which accrues in connection with these payments and that something appears to me to have been within the contemplation of these parties when they signed the sale agreement.\nThe respondent says that the payment is for the preceding calendar year, that on the 1st of August, 1917, anything due for the previous calendar year had been paid for a month previous and that the language of all these agreements cannot be applied to something accruing from January 1st to August 1st, but merely and at the most to something which accrued during the previous year.\nBut here the vendor is to leave with the Power Company a sum estimated by him to be equal to sinking fund payments which shall have accrued but shall not be due at the time for completion. This is a provision made for the next payment on account of the sinking fund due the 1st of July, 1918, and then there would be something due for each electrical horsepower sold and paid for during the preceding calendar year. This sinking fund payment, due in eleven months, can be equitably adjusted between the parties only by making the respondent pay for the sales made and paid for during the first seven months of 1917 according to the mode of calculation adopted by the parties, and if the clause has not really this meaning the parties have failed to express what I must consider was their intention. But I have no difficulty in placing this meaning on the adjustment clause.\nThe respondent argued that the payment and acceptance of $2,500.00 paid by him on account of the sinking fund payment due on the 1st of July, 1918, by the Transmission Company, shewed that the sinking fund payments on the bonds of the Power Company should be similarly dealt with. This payment, however, is not made by the Transmission Company for the preceding calendar year, nor is it based on sales or receipts, and the mortgage deed shows that it is made for the year computed from the 1st of July each year.\nI have given my best consideration to this case and my conclusion is that the appeal should be allowed and the judgment of the trial judge restored with costs here and in the Appellate Division.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: W.W.

C. died in 1897 leaving as heirs three minor children, the widow being a creditor of the estate to an amount of $6,000. When living, he used to buy goods at the appellants' general store. After his death their mother, living with her children, continued to buy whatever was necessary for her own use for their maintenance, with the authorization of the tutor R., a credit account being then opened under the name of \"Estate O. C\". In September, 1911, the appellants ceased to supply goods and the account then amounting to $1,705.53 was closed. On the 1st of August, 1912, the mother was appointed tutrix and, at that time, being requested to pay the account she promised to do so as soon as a valuable claim by the estate would be settled. On the 30th July, 1915, payment being again insisted upon by the appellants, the tutrix consented to sign a promissory note for $2,413.56, being $1,705.53 for the account due and $708.03 for interest at 7%, the said note bearing also the same rate of interest. In May, 1920, the appellants brought action against the respondents, the three children then of age, for $3,030.67 being the amount of the note with interest accrued. Before filing their plea the respondents asked for particulars as to the consideration of the note and the appellants produced a detailed account of the merchandise sold and delivered. Held, Idington J. dissenting, that the respondents were liable, each for one-third, for the payment to appellants of the sum of $2,195, being the amount of the account with interest at 5%.\nHeld, also, that the tutrix had not the authority to bind the estate for a rate of interest above the legal rate of 5%, Idington J. expressing no opinion.\nPer Duff, Anglin and Brodeur JJ.\u2014Such interest is to be computed from the demand of payment made in 1912 and per Mignault J. from the date of the signing of the note.\nHeld, also, that prescription of the appellants' account was interrupted by the promise to pay made by the tutrix in 1912, evidence of which, though illegal, had not been objected to; and it was further interrupted by the signing of the promissory note, Idington J. expressing no opinion.\nPer Duff and Brodeur JJ.\u2014Under special circumstances, such as in this case, the tutrix acted as a prudent administrator in signing a promissory note in acknowledgment of a debt legally owed by the estate and not prescribed, so as to obtain delay for payment to the benefit of the estate.\u2014Mignault J. contra.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King's Bench, Appeal side, Province of Quebec, reversing the judgment of the Superior Court, which had maintained the appellant's action, and maintaining said action for $192.91 only.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions in issue are fully stated in the above head-note and in the judgments now reported.\nJolicoeur for the appellants.\nGetty K.C. for the respondents.\nIdington J. (dissenting).\u2014The legal consequences of our allowing this appeal would lead to very remarkable results in law and be most unjust.\nI think the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDuff J.\u2014I concur with the judgment of Mr. Justice Brodeur. Anglin J.\u2014With some hesitation I accept the views of my brothers Brodeur and Mignault that the defendants are liable each for an equal part of the indebtedness of the plaintiffs.\nI have no difficulty in finding that there was an interruption of prescription in 1912 for the reasons fully stated by my brother Mignault and I also agree that there was a second interruption when the 1915 note was given.\nOn the question of interest, unless we impute to the tutrix an intention to do a distinctly unwarranted act in including arrears of interest in the note which she gave in 1915, it would seem to be a reasonable implication from her having done so that she then recognized liability for such arrears either because of a demand for payment having been made in 1912 (Arts. 1067 and 1077 C.C.), or because of a promise then given to pay interest in consideration of the creditors' forbearance. I am, therefore, disposed to assent to the view of my brother Brodeur, shared by Mr. \"Justice Martin, and, as I read his opinion, by the learned Chief Justice of Quebec, that interest at the legal rate of 5% should run from the date of the acknowledgement of 1912.\nBrodeur J.\u2014Il s'agit d'une action sur billet promissoire sign\u00e9 le 30 juillet 1915 par Madame Carrier comme tutrice aux trois d\u00e9fendeurs-intim\u00e9s, qui \u00e9taient alors mineurs mais qui \u00e9taient en majorit\u00e9 au moment de l'institution de l'action.\nLe p\u00e8re des d\u00e9fendeurs, Orner Carrier, est d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9 en 1897 laissant une femme et trois enfants.\nOn ne sait pas s'il y avait communaut\u00e9 de biens ou s\u00e9paration de biens entre Orner Carrier et sa femme. A tout \u00e9v\u00e9nement, cette derni\u00e8re avait une r\u00e9clamation de $6,000.00 contre la succession de son mari. Joseph-Edmond Roy, notaire, fut nomm\u00e9 en 1897 tuteur \u00e0 ces trois enfants qui ont continu\u00e9 \u00e0 vivre avec leur m\u00e8re. Avec l'autorisation de leur tuteur, un compte a \u00e9t\u00e9 ouvert en faveur de ces mineurs sous le nom de \"Succession Orner Carrier\" chez les demandeurs-appelants, qui sont marchands de nouveaut\u00e9s \u00e0 Qu\u00e9bec et qui font affaires sous le nom de Faguy & L\u00e9pinay. Il para\u00eet que la succession avait des embarras financiers et que son principal actif consistait en une r\u00e9serve foresti\u00e8re qui n'aurait pu alors \u00eatre vendue qu'\u00e0 sacrifice, et qu'il fallait s'endetter pour obtenir des fournisseurs les articles n\u00e9cessaires pour la subsistance des enfants et de leur m\u00e8re.\nLa veuve Carrier aurait bien pu prendre jugement contre les h\u00e9ritiers de son mari et faire vendre cette r\u00e9serve foresti\u00e8re; mais cela n'aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 l'avantage de personne, car il est fort possible que cette r\u00e9serve n'aurait pas r\u00e9alis\u00e9 suffisamment pour payer sa cr\u00e9ance de $6,000.00 et qu'il valait mieux attendre des jours meilleurs et pour elle et pour ses enfants.\nLe tuteur Roy, charg\u00e9 d'administrer la succession, a cru devoir faire acte de bon administrateur en ouvrant un compte chez les demandeurs et en payant \u00e0 ces derniers des acomptes de temps en temps \u00e0 m\u00eame les revenus qu'il percevait par ailleurs. Il para\u00eet avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 aussi l'administrateur des biens de Madame Carrier, et il utilisait l'argent de cette derni\u00e8re pour faire des, versements sur ce compte des appelants. Dans ce compte entraient les articles n\u00e9cessaires \u00e0 l'entretien du m\u00e9nage commun de la m\u00e8re et des enfants, et les effets dont Madame Carrier et les enfants avaient besoin pour leur usage personnel.\nEn septembre 1911, les demandeurs cess\u00e8rent de faire des avances de marchandises, et le compte fut apparemment ferm\u00e9 avec une balance de $1,705.53. Environ un an apr\u00e8s, soit le 1er ao\u00fbt 1912, M. Joseph-Edmond Roy, qui \u00e9tait employ\u00e9 \u00e0 Ottawa, d\u00e9missionnait comme tuteur et Madame Carrier \u00e9tait nomm\u00e9 tutrice pour le remplacer.\nLes demandeurs auraient, peu de temps apr\u00e8s, demand\u00e9 \u00e0 la tutrice de r\u00e9gler et payer ce compte de $1,705.53 d\u00fb par la succession; mais elle leur a demand\u00e9 du d\u00e9lai et elle dit dans son t\u00e9moignage:\nIl y avait une entente avec chez Monsieur L\u00e9pinay que le compte serait r\u00e9gl\u00e9 lorsque la succession serait rentr\u00e9e dans leur argent, chose qui ne pouvait pas se r\u00e9gler \u00e0 cause des proc\u00e8s que la succession avait avec la Banque de Montr\u00e9al.\nEn juillet 1915, la succession \u00e9tant encore incapable de payer son compte, la tutrice, Madame Carrier, a \u00e9t\u00e9 oblig\u00e9e de demander aux demandeurs de nouveaux d\u00e9lais; et alors ces derniers ont pris d'elle le billet qui fait la base de la pr\u00e9sente action et qu'elle a sign\u00e9 comme tutrice \u00e0 ses trois enfants mineurs.\nCe billet \u00e9tait pour une somme de $2,413.56 et couvrait la balance du compte ci-dessus mentionn\u00e9, $1,705.53, et des int\u00e9r\u00eats \u00e0 7%, soit $708.03. Il \u00e9tait stipul\u00e9 sur le billet qu'il porterait int\u00e9r\u00eat au taux de 7%.\nLes d\u00e9fendeurs Carrier \u00e9tant devenus majeurs et ayant refus\u00e9 de payer ce billet avec int\u00e9r\u00eat, ils ont \u00e9t\u00e9 poursuivis en mai 1920 par les appelants Faguy et al. qui ont r\u00e9clam\u00e9 d'eux la somme de $3,030.67, montant du billet ci-dessus en capital et int\u00e9r\u00eats.\nLes d\u00e9fendeurs ont alors demand\u00e9 des particularit\u00e9s qui montreraient la consid\u00e9ration du billet, et les demandeurs ont produit le compte qui accusait une balance de $1,705.53 en 1911, qui, avec les int\u00e9r\u00eats accrus, formaient le montant du billet base de l'action. Les points en litige sont de savoir\n1\u00b0 si la tutrice pouvait signer ce billet;\n2\u00b0 si les d\u00e9fendeurs ont eu bonne et valable consid\u00e9ration;\n3\u00b0 s'ils peuvent \u00eatre condamn\u00e9s solidairement \u00e0 payer cette dette.\nI.\nCapacit\u00e9.\nSur le droit de signer un billet promissoire, je r\u00e9f\u00e8re d'abord \u00e0 la section 47 de \"l'Acte des Lettres de Change\" qui d\u00e9clare que la capacit\u00e9 de s'engager a titre de partie \u00e0 une lettre de change est corr\u00e9lative \u00e0 la capacit\u00e9 de contracter. Il me semble qu'un tuteur a parfaitement le droit de signer un billet en reconnaissance de l'existence d'une dette et pour obtenir du d\u00e9lai.\nC'est un acte de bonne administration pour un tuteur que de donner des billets lorsque l'actif de son pupille ne peut pas \u00eatre facilement r\u00e9alis\u00e9 et qu'il vaut mieux ajourner \u00e0 plus tard la vente de ces biens. Dans le cas actuel, nous avons une succession dont le principal actif faisait l'objet d'un litige devant les tribunaux. Je consid\u00e8re alors que la tutrice, Madame Carrier, n'exc\u00e9dait pas ses pouvoirs en signant un billet qui lui permettrait de faire attendre son cr\u00e9ancier jusqu'\u00e0 ce que des jours meilleurs aient fait leur apparition.\nL'article 290 du code civil impose au tuteur l'obligation d'administrer les biens de son mineur en bon p\u00e8re de famille et de faire enregistrer sur ses immeubles l'hypoth\u00e8que l\u00e9gale dont ils sont affect\u00e9s pour la protection de son pupille (arts. 2030 et 2117 C.C.); et si sa gestion est mauvaise, il r\u00e9pond des dommages int\u00e9r\u00eats qui peuvent en r\u00e9sulter. Le tuteur a dans l'exercise de ses fonctions une certaine latitude sur laquelle peuvent compter ceux qui font affaires avec lui comme tuteur. L'article 52 de \"l'Acte des lettres de change donne implicitement au tuteur le droit de se servir du billet promissoire si c'est l\u00e0 un acte dont un bon p\u00e8re de famille ferait usage dans des circonstances semblables.\nLa preuve que nous avons devant nous n'est pas tr\u00e8s compl\u00e8te, mais elle est certainement suffisante pour dire que la tutrice pouvait parfaitement donner un billet en reconnaissance de la dette due aux demandeurs. Il en aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 autrement si la dette e\u00fbt \u00e9t\u00e9, en 1915, prescrite. Elle n'aurait certainement pas eu le droit de faire revivre une dette \u00e9teinte. Cela n'aurait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 un acte d'administration, mais la reconnaissance que Madame Carrier avait faite de cette dette peu de temps apr\u00e8s qu'elle e\u00fbt \u00e9t\u00e9 nomm\u00e9e tutrice \u00e9tait valable et avait eu pour effet d'interrompre la prescription (art. 2227 C.C.).\nII.\nConsid\u00e9ration.\nLe billet a-t-il \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9 pour bonne et valable consid\u00e9ration?\nCeci nous am\u00e8ne \u00e0 examiner si le tuteur Roy a agi en bon p\u00e8re de famille en ouvrant ce compte chez les demandeurs, Faguy & L\u00e9pinay. Si nous avions devant nous tous les documents qui ont trait \u00e0 l'administration de cette succession ou de cette tutelle, comme le contrat de mariage, les inventaires, les faits et les circonstances affectant l'actif et le passif de cette administration, les autorisations qui ont pu \u00eatre donn\u00e9es sous l'article 290a du code civil, nous serions peut-\u00eatre en meilleure position pour juger si le tuteur Roy a agi en bon p\u00e8re de famille en ouvrant un compte chez les demandeurs pour fournir \u00e0 ses pupilles et \u00e0 leur cr\u00e9anci\u00e8re, leur m\u00e8re, les choses n\u00e9cessaires \u00e0 la vie. Mais nous ne saurions bl\u00e2mer les demandeurs de ces lacunes dans la preuve de la pr\u00e9sente poursuite, vu que toutes les circonstances seront plus faciles \u00e0 \u00e9tablir sur la reddition de compte du tuteur ou de la tutrice \u00e0 leurs pupilles; si ce tuteur ou cette tutrice leur ont de fait occasionn\u00e9 des dommages par une mauvaise gestion, ces enfants auront respectivement les recours que la loi leur accorde. Ce d\u00e9bat pourra se faire plus facilement et plus \u00e9quitablement sur la reddition de compte entre la tutrice et les pupilles que sur une poursuite institu\u00e9e par leur cr\u00e9ancier contre les pupilles devenus majeurs.\nLe tuteur \u00e9tait un homme de grande r\u00e9putation et de grand savoir. Il para\u00eet avoir agi dans le meilleur int\u00e9r\u00eat de ses pupilles; et alors les pupilles devraient faire leurs d\u00e9bats de compte avec lui ou avec leur tutrice et non pas avec les demandeurs qui avaient bonne raison de croire que ce tuteur et cette tutrice agissaient dans la limite de leur mandat.\nLe tuteur Roy devait payer \u00e0 Madame Carrier les $6,000.00 que ses pupilles lui devaient; et s'il a jug\u00e9 plus avantageux de la payer partiellement au moyen de ce compte ouvert chez les appelants Faguy et autres, il me semble que ces derniers ne devraient pas souffrir de ce qui pourrait \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme un bon acte d'administration, si surtout, comme le pr\u00e9tend Madame Carrier dans son t\u00e9moignage, une grande partie de son actif a \u00e9t\u00e9 absorb\u00e9 pour le b\u00e9n\u00e9fice des mineurs.\nOn peut dire la m\u00eame chose pour la reconnaissance de la dette que la tutrice aurait faite vers 1912 et qui aurait interrompu la prescription. Mais si elle pouvait valablement reconna\u00eetre au moyen d'un billet l'existence de ces dettes et en interrompre par l\u00e0 m\u00eame la prescription, pouvait-elle s'obliger de payer un taux d'int\u00e9r\u00eat plus \u00e9lev\u00e9 que celui \u00e9dict\u00e9 par la loi. Pouvait-elle leur cr\u00e9er une obligation nouvelle ou une dette pour laquelle ses pupilles ne recevaient aucune consid\u00e9ration?\nDu moment qu'il y avait mise en demeure par la demande de paiement (articles 1067 et 1077 C.C.), les d\u00e9fendeurs devaient l'int\u00e9r\u00eat l\u00e9gal sur leur compte; mais leur tutrice ne pouvait pas s'obliger de payer plus que l'int\u00e9r\u00eat l\u00e9gal, \u00e0 moins de certaines circonstances qui feraient de cette obligation un bon acte de gestion; mais ces circonstances n'apparaissent pas au dossier.\nJ'endosse sur ce point l'opinion exprim\u00e9e par l'honorable juge Lamothe et par l'honorable juge Martin. Le billet n'aurait pas d\u00fb \u00eatre sign\u00e9 par la tutrice que pour la somme de $1,961.28.\nIII.\nReste la question de solidarit\u00e9.\nLes trois d\u00e9fendeurs peuvent-ils \u00eatre tenus conjointement et solidairement au paiement de ce compte de $1,705.53 avec int\u00e9r\u00eat \u00e0 5% depuis qu'il y a eu demande de le payer. Je ne le crois pas.\nCe compte ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 contract\u00e9 au nom de la succession d'Orner Carrier, cela comporte pour les membres de cette succession obligation conjointe et non solidaire.\nEn principe g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, les dettes d'une succession n'obligent les h\u00e9ritiers que fractionnairement. Tous les h\u00e9ritiers contribuent \u00e0 l'acquittement des dettes chacun en proportion de sa part dans la succession (art. 736 C.C.). Les trois h\u00e9ritiers que nous avons devant nous \u00e9taient tous h\u00e9ritiers au m\u00eame degr\u00e9; alors ils doivent acquitter cette dette par parts \u00e9gales. Il est fort possible cependant que tous n'aient pas retir\u00e9 de cecompte chacun un montant absolument \u00e9gal. Mais cela pourra \u00eatre l'objet de d\u00e9bats de compte entre eux. Quant aux demandeurs, ils peuvent retirer de chacun des trois h\u00e9ritiers un tiers de leur cr\u00e9ance.\nMaintenant la solidarit\u00e9 ne se pr\u00e9sume pas (art. 1105 C.C.). Elle s'applique, il est vrai, aux affaires du commerce; mais les ventes par un commer\u00e7ant \u00e0 une succession laisse pr\u00e9sumer que le commer\u00e7ant a voulu faire de sa cr\u00e9ance une dette conjointe seulement mais non solidaire.\nPour ces raisons l'appel devrait \u00eatre maintenu avec d\u00e9pens de cette cour et de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure. Les frais de la Cour du Banc du Roi pourraient \u00eatre accord\u00e9s aux d\u00e9fendeurs Carrier parce qu'ils avaient eu \u00e0 porter leur cause devant ce tribunal pour se lib\u00e9rer de la solidarit\u00e9 prononc\u00e9e contre eux en Cour Sup\u00e9rieure. Il devrait y avoir jugement en faveur des demandeurs contre les d\u00e9fendeurs conjointement pour la somme de $2,195.00 avec int\u00e9r\u00eat depuis l'institution de l'action, laquelle somme serait calcul\u00e9e comme suit:\nBalance de compte\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\n$ 1,705.53\n30 juillet, 1915, int\u00e9r\u00eat \u00e0 5% lors de la signature du billet\u2026\u2026\n255.75\n$ 1,961.28\n25 octobre, 1919, int\u00e9r\u00eat depuis la date du billet jusqu'\u00e0 date\n362.45\n$ 2,323.73\nCr. par argent\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..\n200.00\n$ 2,123.73\n27 mai, 1920, int\u00e9r\u00eat \u00e0 date\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026...\n71.27\n$2,195.00 Mignault J.\u2014On soul\u00e8ve un assez grand nombre de questions l\u00e9gales dans cette cause, mais je pense qu'il est possible, comme Ta dit l'honorable juge en chef Lamothe, de la juger d'apr\u00e8s ses circonstances d'esp\u00e8ce et sans porter atteinte aux principes.\nLes appelants sont des marchands de nouveaut\u00e9s de Qu\u00e9bec et, de son vivant, feu Orner Carrier avait un compte chez eux. Orner Carrier est d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9 en 1897, laissant trois enfants en bas \u00e2ge, et sa femme, Dame Corinne Hamel. Cette derni\u00e8re, qui ne s'est pas remari\u00e9e, a continu\u00e9, apr\u00e8s la mort de son mari, \u00e0 tenir maison avec ses enfants. Le tuteur des enfants \u00e9tait feu le notaire J.-E. Roy que rempla\u00e7a Madame Carrier elle-m\u00eame le 1er ao\u00fbt, 1912. Pendant quelque temps la famille recevait des revenus de l'usine Carrier & Laine de L\u00e9vis, et la succession avait des limites \u00e0 bois dont elle ne pouvait disposer \u00e0 cause d'un proc\u00e8s avec la Banque de Montr\u00e9al. Il n'appert pas clairement que ce soit M. Roy, le tuteur, qui a continu\u00e9, chez les appelants, le compte qu'avait ouvert feu Orner Carrier, mais \u00e0 partir de la mort de ce dernier le compte a \u00e9t\u00e9 continu\u00e9 au nom de la succession Orner Carrier, 33 rue Fraser, L\u00e9vis. C'\u00e9tait Madame Carrier qui faisait les achats; le notaire Roy payait de temps \u00e0 autre, mais la plupart des achats \u00e9taient pour Madame Carrier elle-m\u00eame ou pour la maison, les effets achet\u00e9s pour l'usage des enfants \u00e9tant assez peu de chose. Madame Carrier ne para\u00eet pas avoir eu de biens personnels, mais son contrat de mariage lui assurait $6,000.00, et elle croit que le notaire Roy payait les comptes avec son argent parce qu'elle avait cette cr\u00e9ance encore impay\u00e9e contre la succession de son mari. Le compte dont il s'agit ici (mais il y avait eu d'autres comptes auparavant qui ont d\u00fb \u00eatre pay\u00e9s par M. Roy) commence \u00e0 la date du 11 novembre, 1907 et a \u00e9t\u00e9 clos le 30 septembre, 1911, avec un d\u00e9bit de $1,705.53, sans qu'on paraisse avoir fait des paiements en acompte durant ces quatre ann\u00e9es. Le 30 juillet, 1915, Madame Carrier, comme tutrice d\u00e9 ses trois enfants mineurs, signa en faveur des appelants un billet \u00e0 demande pour $2,413.56, soit le d\u00e9bit de $1,705.53 avec $708.03 d'int\u00e9r\u00eats, le billet portant lui-m\u00eame int\u00e9r\u00eat \u00e0 sept pour cent. Le 25 octobre, 1919, un acompte de $200.00 fut pay\u00e9 par Mde Carrier, et le 27 mai, 1920, les appelants poursuivirent les intim\u00e9s, qui sont les trois enfants de Mde Carrier devenus majeurs, leur r\u00e9clamant conjointement et solidairement le montant du billet, $2,413.56, avec en sus int\u00e9r\u00eat \u00e0 7%, lequel int\u00e9r\u00eat, lors de l'action, s'\u00e9levait \u00e0 la somme de $816.61, et sur demande de particularit\u00e9s, ils produisirent le compte dont je viens de parler. Analysant cette demande, nous trouvons que le montant des marchandises achet\u00e9es est de $1,705.53 et celui des int\u00e9r\u00eats r\u00e9clam\u00e9s $1,524.64.\nVoil\u00e0 en traits bien rapides l'esp\u00e8ce que nous avons \u00e0 juger, la cour sup\u00e9rieure ayant accord\u00e9 aux appelants le montant entier de leur r\u00e9clamation, et la cour d'appel ayant r\u00e9duit la condamnation aux montants suivants: $22.68, $76.41 et $93.82, avec int\u00e9r\u00eat du 30 juillet, 1915, dus respectivement par Camille Carrier, El\u00e9onore Carrier et Florence Carrier pour des marchandises fournies pour leur usage respectif et dont le montant n'\u00e9tait pas prescrit lors de la signature du billet. Les honorables juges Lamothe et Martin, dissidents, auraient accord\u00e9 aux appelants le montant de leur compte, avec int\u00e9r\u00eat depuis la demande de paiement au taux de cinq pour cent.\nLa premi\u00e8re question, c'est de savoir si Mde Carrier, comme tutrice, avait le droit de signer le billet sur lequel l'action est bas\u00e9e. Cela \u00e9quivaut \u00e0 se demander si la signature de ce billet est un acte d'administration permis \u00e0 la tutrice, et elle ne l'\u00e9tait pas si par l\u00e0 la tutrice rendait pire la condition de ses pupilles. C'est pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment ce qui est arriv\u00e9 ici, car le billet porte int\u00e9r\u00eat \u00e0 sept pour cent et entra\u00eene obligation solidaire. Je serais donc d'avis que ce billet ne peut servir de base \u00e0 l'action des appelants, mais, heureusement pour eux, ils conservent leur cr\u00e9ance \u00e0 laquelle le billet n'a pas fait novation. C'est donc ce compt\u00e9 qu'il va falloir discuter.\nReste la question de prescription, et si les appelants ne peuvent invoquer le billet sign\u00e9 par Mde. Carrier, ils sont en mauvaise posture pour la discuter. A la date du billet, 30 juillet, 1915, s'il n'y avait pas eu interruption de prescription en temps utile, une grande partie du compte se serait trouv\u00e9e prescrite, et la tutrice n'aurait pas eu le droit de renoncer \u00e0 la prescription acquise, car elle ne pouvait ali\u00e9ner les droits de ses pupilles (art. 2186, code civil). Cependant Mde Carrier dans son t\u00e9moignage reconna\u00eet qu'apr\u00e8s sa nomination comme tutrice, en ao\u00fbt, 1912 (il n'y avait pas alors prescription), elle avait promis de payer le compte des appelants aussit\u00f4t que les affaires de la succession seraient r\u00e9gl\u00e9es. Cette preuve a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite sans objection de la part de la d\u00e9fense et malgr\u00e9 le droit que l'article 1233 du code civil lui donnait de s'y opposer. Il faut donc prendre cette preuve sous consid\u00e9ration (Schwersenski v. Vineberg) [1], et il en r\u00e9sulte qu'il y a eu reconnaissance de la dette et promesse de la payer. Et je crois qu'il a toujours \u00e9t\u00e9 entendu que la succession payerait les appelants quand elle aurait dispos\u00e9 de sa r\u00e9serve foresti\u00e8re.\nAdmettant donc comme interruptive de prescription la promesse faite par Mde Carrier en ao\u00fbt, 1912, il y a encore un laps de temps de pr\u00e8s de huit ans, car l'action n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 institu\u00e9e qu'en mai, 1920. Il est vrai qu'en octobre, 1919, Mde Carrier a pay\u00e9 aux appelants un acompte de $200.00, mais alors tous ses enfants \u00e9taient majeurs et Mde Carrier ne pouvait plus les lier. Si le billet \u00e0 demande sign\u00e9 par elle est non avenu \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard des intim\u00e9s comme titre de cr\u00e9ance, ne peut-il au moins valoir comme reconnaissance de la dette et interrompre ainsi la prescription?\nIl est de principe que le billet donn\u00e9 pour une dette existante ne comporte pas novation. La dette continue d'exister et peut servir de base \u00e0 une action en justice. Et indubitablement le billet sert de reconnaissance de la dette et le fait qu'il ne peut valoir comme titre contre l'une des parties ne le prive pas d'effet interruptif si la reconnaissance de la dette n'est pas elle-m\u00eame nulle. Car on enseigne que l'aveu r\u00e9sultant d'un acte juridique peut produire son effet interruptif alors m\u00eame que cet acte serait entach\u00e9 de nullit\u00e9, si la nullit\u00e9 n'entache pas l'aveu lui-m\u00eame et lui est \u00e9trang\u00e8re. (Baudry-Lacantinerie et Tissier, Prescription, n\u00b0. 529). Il y aune d\u00e9cision int\u00e9ressante au m\u00eame effet dans notre jurisprudence o\u00f9 la cour de revision \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al a jug\u00e9 qu'une donation r\u00e9mun\u00e9ratoire, nulle comme faite \u00e0 cause de mort, pouvait cependant servir d'interruption de la prescription d'un compte de services que la donation avait voulu r\u00e9mun\u00e9rer: Boucher v. Morrison[2]. Je crois donc que le billet en question a interrompu la prescription du compte.\nCela \u00e9tant, les trois intim\u00e9s sont-ils responsables seulement des effets achet\u00e9s pour leur usage personnel, comme la majorit\u00e9 de la cour d'appel l'a d\u00e9cid\u00e9? Repr\u00e9sentons-nous bien la situation de cette famille au d\u00e9c\u00e8s d'Orner Carrier. Il y avait trois jeunes enfants, le dernier posthume, h\u00e9ritiers de leur p\u00e8re d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9 sans testament. La veuve n'avait pas de biens personnels, mais seulement une cr\u00e9ance contre la succession de son mari. Les enfants avaient d'abord des revenus qui provenaient de l'usine \u00e0 L\u00e9vis et ensuite il ne leur restait que la perspective de disposer des r\u00e9serves foresti\u00e8res de leur p\u00e8re. Pour tenir la jeune famille ensemble avec la m\u00e8re et avoir un toit pour l'abriter, il fallait obtenir du cr\u00e9dit. Le compte en question a \u00e9t\u00e9 ouvert au nom de la succession parce que c'est la succession qui devait le payer;. et la succession, ce sont les enfants. Dans ces circonstances, les enfants devenus majeurs sont-ils responsables d'un compte fait par leur tuteur pour leur b\u00e9n\u00e9fice commun et pour celui de leur m\u00e8re avec qui ils vivaient et dont les soins leur \u00e9taient indispensables?\nJe suis d'opinion que les enfants en sont responsables. Ils devaient des aliments \u00e0 leur m\u00e8re qui \u00e9tait sans biens. Leur tuteur pouvait reconna\u00eetre cette obligation sans attendre qu'elle pr\u00eet la forme d'une demande en justice, car le tuteur a le droit de payer les dettes de ses pupilles. C'est une obligation assez semblable qu'envisage Demolombe quand il dit (tome 7, n\u00b0. 692):\u2014\nMais nous avons vu aussi qu'il appartient au tuteur d'acquitter les dettes l\u00e9gitimes du mineur; et si le tuteur reconna\u00eet en effet que l'ascendant de celui-ci est dans le besoin, il pourra d'autant mieux acquitter, au nom du mineur, cette dette d'aliments, qu'une demande judiciaire pourrait \u00eatre infiniment p\u00e9nible pour toutes les parties et qu'il serait m\u00eame du devoir du tuteur de la pr\u00e9venir.\nAu reste, en pareil cas, il fera bien d'en r\u00e9f\u00e9rer au conseil de famille.\nLe conseil de famille dans la province de Qu\u00e9bec n'a pas les pouvoirs de contr\u00f4le du conseil de famille en France, et il serait bien inutile de le consulter. La seule alternative dans un tel cas serait de mettre les enfants \u00e0 l'hospice, et de condamner la m\u00e8re \u00e0 gagner sa vie. Je n'\u00e9prouve aucune h\u00e9sitation \u00e0 croire que, dans un cas comme celui que j'envisage, c'est le devoir des enfants, lorsqu'ils ont des biens, d'assumer, chacun pour sa part, la charge qui incombait \u00e0 leur m\u00e8re, et que si leur tuteur a fait des comptes chez les fournisseurs pour les besoins de la famille, les enfants en sont responsables.\nMais comme il s'agit ici d'un compte ouvert au nom d'une succession, je condamnerais les intim\u00e9s \u00e0 le payer tout comme si c'\u00e9tait une dette h\u00e9r\u00e9ditaire, c'est-\u00e0-dire par parts et portions \u00e9gales et non conjointement et solidairement.\nJe maintiendrais donc l'appel et j'accorderais jugement aux appelants contre chacun des intim\u00e9s pour un tiers du d\u00e9bit du compte, $1,705.53, avec int\u00e9r\u00eat \u00e0 cinq pour cent \u00e0 partir du 30 juillet, 1915.\nJe crois devoir motiver ma condamnation quant aux int\u00e9r\u00eats. L'int\u00e9r\u00eat peut \u00eatre r\u00e9clam\u00e9 soit en vertu d'une convention, soit comme dommages pour le retard de payer une somme d'argent. Il n'y a pas de preuve de convention ici. Mde Carrier a reconnu devoir le montant du compte et a promis de le payer, sans qu'op paraisse avoir mentionn\u00e9 l'int\u00e9r\u00eat. Et si le billet sign\u00e9 par elle ne peut servir de base \u00e0 l'action des appelants, il ne peut certainement prouver une convention de payer les int\u00e9r\u00eats \u00e0 compter de la cl\u00f4ture du compte ou d'aucune autre date. Si on r\u00e9clame les int\u00e9r\u00eats comme dommages, alors ils ne sont dus qu'\u00e0 compter de la mise en demeure (art. 1077 C.C.). Il n'y a pas de preuve directe de mise en demeure, mais on peut probablement inf\u00e9rer que Mde Carrier a sign\u00e9 le billet apr\u00e8s une mise en demeure de payer. Cela donne la date du 30 juillet, 1915, et c'est \u00e0 partir de cette date que la majorit\u00e9 des juges de la cour d'appel font courir les int\u00e9r\u00eats. Je suis dispos\u00e9\u2014non sans une certaine h\u00e9sitation, car lorsque j'\u00e9tais au barreau les juges ne faisaient courir les int\u00e9r\u00eats sur un compte courant que de la signification de l'action\u2014\u00e0 accepter le 30 juillet, 1915 comme point de d\u00e9part des int\u00e9r\u00eats.\nIl faut toutefois d\u00e9duire du chiffre global des int\u00e9r\u00eats l'acompte de $200.00 pay\u00e9 par Mde. Carrier en octobre, 1919, qui doit s'imputer de pr\u00e9f\u00e9rence sur les int\u00e9r\u00eats (art. 1159 C.C.). Les frais de la cour sup\u00e9rieure et de cette cour, que les intim\u00e9s devront payer aux appelants, se diviseront entre eux comme la dette. Ils avaient raison d'appeler du jugement de la cour sup\u00e9rieure qui les a condamn\u00e9s \u00e0 plus qu'ils ne devaient, et ils conserveront en cons\u00e9quence contre les appelants la condamnation aux d\u00e9pens que la cour du Banc du Roi leur a accord\u00e9e.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Gingras & Jolicoeur.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Gelly & Dion.\n[1] [1890] 19 Can.

[1906] c. 139, s. 41\u20148-9 Geo. V. c. 7 s. 2\u2014R.S.O. [1914] c. 195, s. 80 [6], Assessment Act.\nOn appeal in a case of assessment on land for 1921, the District Court Judge reduced the valuation on the land to an amount which would make the tax to be levied $800. On further appeal the Ry. and Mun. Board restored the valuation of the Court of Revision, making the tax $2,050. The owner of the land appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada asking to have the judgment of the District Court Judge restored.\nHeld that the amount in controversy on the appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada is not $2,050, but the difference between that and $802 the tax as fixed by the decision of the District Judge. Therefore, as such amount does not exceed $2,000 and no leave to appeal has been obtained the court has no jurisdiction, under the Act of 1920, to entertain the appeal.\nThe Ontario Assessment Act provides that \"an appeal shall lie from the decision of the (Ry. and Mun.) Board * * to a Divisional Court upon all questions of law\". Prior to the Act of 1920 an appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada could only come from the Court of last resort in the Province and on a question of law. On appeal from the Ry. and Mun. Board as to the assessment for 1920.\nHeld, that the board was not the court of last resort in the Province and the Supreme Court had no jurisdiction. APPEAL from a decision of the Ontario Railway and Municipal Board reversing the judgment of the District Court Judge in a matter of assessment of land in Port Arthur.\nTwo appeals are brought and consolidated for hearing. One is an appeal from the decision of the board on the assessment of 1920. This was before the court in 1920 and was sent back to the board for re-consideration the court holding that the actual value of the land assessed had not been determined as required by the Assessment Act.[1] The board maintained its former valuation. The other appeal was from a decision on the assessment of 1921 which increased the tax to be levied under the judgment of the District Court Judge by over $1,200. In each case the appellant seeks the restoration of the Judgment by the District Judge.\nChrysler K.C. for the appellant.\nGeo. F. Henderson K.C. for the respondent.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014This is a consolidated appeal from the judgments or orders of the Ontario Railway and Municipal Board upon appeals to that Board under the provisions of the Assessment Act. c. 195, R.S.O. 1914.\nThe first order was on a reference back by this court on the hearing of a formal appeal to it, the reasons for which reference back are reported at 61 Can. S.C.R. 326.\nThe matter in question was the amount of the assessment for the year 1920 upon certain lands in the City of Port Arthur belonging to the present appellant. The second appeal is from the judgment or order -of the board upon the assessed value of the same lands for the year 192L As to this second appeal we are unanimously of opinion that the appeal must fail for want of jurisdiction in this court to hear it, under the amended Supreme Court Act of 1920, no leave to appeal having been obtained and the matter in controversy being only about $1,200.00.\nThe remaining question is as to the assessment for the year 1920 and the substantial contention at bar was that the board had disregarded the provision of the Assessment Act which enacts that land shall be assessed at its \"actual value\", and the directions of this court in that regard in remitting the case back to the board for further evidence and hearing. It was because this court was not satisfied on the first appeal that the board had fully complied with the direction of the statute as regards the finding of the actual value of the land, that we referred the case back to them for further evidence and consideration.\nI have fully considered the evidence taken on the rehearing and reasons for the finding of the board given by the Chairman. I think the evidence taken before the board fully justifies the conclusion reached by it as to the actual value of the lands assessed,.\nI do not believe and cannot find any evidence whatever of any attempt by the board to evade the directions given by this court when on the previous appeal the case was remitted back to the board for further consideration and the taking of further evidence.\nI am of the opinion that in a question of this kind as to the \"actual value\" of lands for purposes of assessment this court would not and should not interfere with the finding of fact as to such \"actual value\" if there was any evidence to sustain that finding. The board is constituted of men of experience on questions of this character. They have the great advantage of visiting and viewing the lands in question, and of seeing and hearing the witnesses who may be called to speak to its value. Unless, therefore, the board misdirected themselves on the proper principles which should govern them in determining this \"actual value\", or obviously reached their conclusions as to such value by adopting and following some wrong or improper principle, this court would not and should not interfere with their findings.\nIn the case before us, I find nothing of the kind to justify us in interfering with the findings of \"actual value\" of the lands in question in this appeal.\nSo far as I am concerned I not only fail to find that the board erred in adopting a wrong or improper principle in reaching the conclusion they did, but I go further and say that the evidence given before them, in my judgment, amply justified their conclusion.\nIt is in many cases no easy matter to determine the \"actual value\" of lands in many unsettled parts of Canada. Lands which a few years ago were in great demand and could easily be sold are now a drug on the market. In many cases they cannot be sold at all, and in such cases where there is practically no market or other equivalent tests of the actual value, it is plain that it is no easy matter to determine what the \"actual value\" of the land is. It is plain, land cannot be treated as valueless because there are no purchasers to be found for it when assessed for taxes, and equally plain to my mind that in such cases the probabilities of a reasonably early return of a \"market\" must be considered and weighed. Expert evidence on this point may be given and must be fairly weighed. This was done in the case before us after we had remitted it back. Under all the circumstances of this case and holding that we have no jurisdiction to hear the appeal from the assessment of 1921 and finding that the board did not proceed upon any wrong or improper principle in reaching its finding on the 1920 assessment, I would dismiss both appeals with costs throughout.\nIdington J.\u2014These are assessment appeals against the assessment of property in Port Arthur in Ontario. No objection was taken by counsel in either case to our jurisdiction.\nIn the first case I had, after considering the evidence, come to the conclusion that the appeal should be allowed, but the majority of the court came to the conclusion that the case should be referred back to the Ontario Railway and Municipal Board to be re-heard as appears from the report of the case in 61 Can. S.C.R. 326.\nThat board meantime had got seized of another appeal against the assessment for the year following that of the first of said assessments.\nThe parties concerned proceeded with the said rehearing of the first case upon the understanding that the evidence so taken and judgments of the learned District Judge should be considered in the second case as if given therein.\nThe said board having proceeded accordingly came to the conclusion to render judgment in each case restoring their original judgment in the first case and allowing the appeal from the learned District Judge in the second case and restoring the assessment.\nThe curious result was an assessment of the same property for the first year in question of $60,000, and for the next year of $49,750.00, the assessor, the respondent, having apparently become convinced that he had erred, but the board holding it had not. Thereupon these two appeals from said judgment of the board came before us as a consolidated appeal and argument thereupon was heard.\nThe curious result above stated led me to consider (what I, by reason of the view I had taken, had not before occasion to do) the power of the court to refer back such an appeal to an intermediate appellate court.\nNot being able to find any precedent as authority for such a reference induced me to go farther and consider the second assessment and the right in either case to come here instead of going to the court of appeal for Ontario.\nIncidentally to that investigation I found a reference by the Chief Justice of the Common Pleas Division in the course of disposing of a stated case in an assessment appeal heard by the Appellate Division, to an amendment in 1916 to the Assessment Act as it appeared in R.S.O. 1914. On referring thereto and calling the attention of my colleagues thereto it was decided to ask counsel to explain, if possible, how we could have jurisdiction to hear an assessment appeal in regard to a mere question of law when the parties concerned could appeal by virtue of said amendment which makes section 80, sub-section (6) which read as follows\n(6) an appeal shall lie from the decision of the Board under this section to a Divisional Court upon all questions of law, but such appeal shall not lie unless leave to appeal is given by the said court upon application of any party and upon hearing the parties and the Board\nby virtue of the amendment contained in the Assessment Act of 1916, section 6, sub-section (2), now read as follows:\u2014\nAn appeal shall lie from the decision of the Board under this section to a Divisional Court upon all questions of law, or the construction of a statute, a municipal by-law, any agreement in writing to which the municipality concerned is a party, or any order of The Municipal Board. By 8-9 Geo. V., c. 7, s. 2, section 41 of the Supreme Court Act is amended by adding thereto the following:\u2014\nProvided that the valuation of the property assessed shall not be varied by the Court unless it is satisfied that in fixing or affirming it such Court of last resort in the province has proceeded upon an erroneous principle; and, instead of itself fixing the amount of an assessment which in its opinion should be varied, the Court may remit the case to such court of last resort in the province, to fix the same in accordance with the principle which the Court declares to be applicable.\nI am unable to distinguish the jurisdiction given above to a Divisional Court for Ontario to hear any appeal on a question of law, from that to which our court is restricted by this amendment.\nThe principle referred to in this amendment to the Supreme Court Act must, I think, be taken to be a principle of law and thus substantially the same kind of jurisdiction as was given to the Divisional Court for Ontario as a court of last resort in the province. Therefore until that court has passed upon the principle of law involved herein it seems to me we have no jurisdiction.\nIt seems to be rather unfortunate that counsel concerned in the case before the board in appealing here had not observed this change in the law and, on the other hand, equally unfortunate that counsel when the case was before us in the first instance did not call our attention to the amendment. I see no way out of the difficulty except to declare that we never had jurisdiction in either of these cases. The appellant should have gone to the Divisional Court for Ontario, and then possibly either party might have found his way to coming here.\nThere should be no costs to either party in all the proceedings that have been taken, in the way of appealing here or proceeding on the reference back. Duff J.\u2014The appeals should be quashed.\nAnglin J.\u2014The owner appeals against the confirmation by the Ontario Railway & Municipal Board of assessment of lands in the City of Port Arthur for the years 1920 and 1921. The order of the board reversed the decision of the learned District Court Judge and restored the original assessments, which had been confirmed by the Court of Revision. Although consolidated by order of the registrar for convenience in the preparation of the case and for hearing, there are two distinct appeals, one for each year, which must be separately considered.\nAt the threshold of the 1921 appeal we encounter a question of jurisdiction. This appeal falls within the amendments to the Supreme Court Act made in 1920 and, special leave to appeal not having been obtained, our jurisdiction to hear it depends upon whether\nthe amount or value of the matter in controversy in the appeal exceeds the sum of $2,000 (s. 39).\nThe total assessment of the appellant's property for the year 1921, as fixed by the Ontario Railway and Municipal Board, is $50,000; the rate of taxation for the year was 41 mills, as appears by the affidavit of Malcolm A. McKay, filed on the motion made to the registrar to affirm jurisdiction; the total taxes for the year 1921 were therefore $2,050. If the appellant sought to have his lands declared non-assessable or entirely valueless, $2,050 would be the amount in controversy in the appeal. But he does not ask this. On the contrary, he submits to the assessment as fixed by the learned District Court Judge, on appeal from the Court of Revision, at $100 per acre, making a total assessment of $20,000. The matter in controversy on the present appeal is therefore not the entire amount of the taxes for 1921, but the difference between $2,050 (taxes on an assessment of $50,000) and $802 (taxes on an assessment of $20,000) i.e., $1,248. It follows that this appeal fails for want of jurisdiction.\nThe appeal against the assessment of 1920 falls under the former sec. 41 of the Supreme Court Act, R.S.C. 1906, c. 139. The assessment for that year being $60,000, no difficulty arises on the score of the amount involved. But the right of appeal conferred by former s. 41 is\nfrom the judgment of any Court of last resort created under provincial legislation to adjudicate concerning the assessment of property for provincial or municipal purposes.\nBy s. s. 6 of s. 80 of the Ontario Assessment Act (R.S.O. 1914, c. 195) as amended by s.s. 2 of s. 6 of the Assessment Amendment Act, 1916, c. 41, it is provided that\n(6) An Appeal shall lie from the decision of the Board under this section to a Divisional Court upon all questions of law, or the construction of a statute, a municipal by-law, any agreement in writing to which the municipality concerned is a party, or any order of the Municipal-Board.\nThe appellant comes directly to this court without having appealed to the Appellate Divisional Court and his appeal is in respect of two alleged errors of law on the part of the board, viz., (a) misconstruction of s. 40 (1) and s. 69 (16) of the Assessment Act and (b) the absence of any evidence that the actual value of the lands in question exceeds the $100 per acre fixed by the learned District Court Judge.\nUnder these circumstances it seems reasonably clear that the Ontario Railway and Municipal Board cannot be said to have been \"the court of last resort created under provincial legislation\", within the meaning of former s. 41 of the Supreme Court Act. The question of jurisdiction was not raised or discussed at bar either on the original argument of the present, or on the hearing of the former, appeal in this case[2] and it then escaped the attention of the court.\nWhen the amendment to the Assessment Act made in 1916 came to our notice during the consideration of the present appeal the court directed that counsel should be heard on the question of jurisdiction which it raises. This hearing took place on the first day of the present term. As already stated, I am satisfied that we are without jurisdiction in regard to the assessment for 1920 as well as to that of 1921. But as I had already considered the appeal on the assessment of 1920 on its merits, I shall shortly state the reasons why, in my opinion, it could not succeed.\nOn examining the judgment of the board I find that it professedly disposed of the appeal to it in accordance with the decision of this court on the former appeal. I am not convinced that the tenor of that decision was not correctly appreciated by the board. Observations of the Chairman made in the course of the hearing indicate that it was.\nIn the judgment itself the board bases its finding on the oral evidence and appeals to the assessed value of adjacent lands under s. 69 (16) merely for \"confirmation of its conclusion\". I find nothing to warrant an assumption that the avowed adherence of the board to the principle of assessment defined by this court was merely colourable. Such a view of the board's action would be justifiable only on a record admitting of no doubt. I am therefore unable to hold that there was on this occasion a repetition of the misconstruction or misapplication of s. 40 (1) and s. 69 (16) of the Assessment Act which we were of the opinion had influenced the board's former decision. I am not prepared to find that in reaching its conclusion upon the case now before us the board proceeded upon a mistaken view of the meaning and effect of the statutory provision that \"land shall be assessed at its actual value\" (s. 40(1)). While, if weighing the evidence before the board, I should quite probably have reached the conclusion that it was insufficient to warrant disturbing the valuation made by the learned District Court Judge, it is not the function of this court to interfere in matters of assessment merely because in its opinion the valuation of the property has upon the weight of evidence been placed at too high a figure. We may vary the valuation made by the court of last resort in the province only if satisfied that in arriving at it that court \"has proceeded upon an erroneous principle,\" (s. 41 Supreme Court Act, as amended by 8 & 9 Geo. V., c. 7).\nAn entire absence of evidence to sustain the valuation of the court a quo may warrant our intervention on the ground that in making it that court must have proceeded upon some erroneous principle. But in the case at bar I am not satisfied that there was not some evidence, given by Lionel C. S. Hallam, T. D. Roberts, J. A. Rapsey and W. F. Trenks, on which the board might base a valuation of $300 per acre. Personally I might not\u2014probably would not\u2014have accepted that evidence as sufficient to warrant setting aside the judgment of the learned District Court Judge. But without finding error in principle on the part of the board, which in my opinion has not been shewn, we are not entitled to review the valuation made by it.\nThe appeals fail and should be dismissed with costs as of a motion to quash. Brodeur J.\u2014I am of opinion that the appeal should fail for want of jurisdiction as to the assessment for 1921 for the reason stated by my brother Anglin. As far as the assessment for 1920 is concerned, I am of the view that the appeal should be dismissed on the ground that there was evidence to justify the Ontario Railway & Municipal Board in reaching the conclusion at which they have arrived, and that then we should not interfere with their decision because the members of the board were in a better position than we are to determine the actual values of the properties assessed.\nA question has been raised as to whether we had jurisdiction as to this latter assessment,\nThis question of jurisdiction should be determined by the Supreme Court Act existing before the amendment of 1920. By the law then in force there is an appeal from the judgment of any court of last resort.\nThe provisions of the Ontario Assessment Act shew conclusively that the Ontario Railway & Municipal Board was not a court of final jurisdiction.\nIt is enacted in this Assessment Act that an appeal lies from the decision of the board to a divisional court upon all questions of law.\nIn view of these provisions, the decision of the Municipal Board is not a final judgment of the highest court of last resort (sec. 41 Supreme Court Act).\nFor these reasons the appellant fails and his appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nMignault J.\u2014There are two appeals here, the first from the order or judgment of the Ontario and Municipal Board fixing the assessment on the appellant's two properties in Port Arthur at $60,000.00 for the year 1920, and from the order of the board fixing the assessment for 1921 on the same properties at $49,750. Our jurisdiction over the 1920 appeal is governed by section 41 of the Supreme Court Act as in force before July 1st, 1920, and over the 1921 appeal by the new provisions enacted by chapter 32 of the statutes of 1920 (Can.).\nAt the hearing, doubts were expressed from the bench as to the right to appeal from the order respecting the 1921 assessment and further consideration has only confirmed these doubts. What is really in controversy in the appeal, is the difference between the amount of the taxes for 1921 at the valuation fixed by the Board and the amount of these taxes at the valuation contended for by the appellant, and this is less than $2,000.00.\nThere was no suggestion from counsel that there was any possible question as to the jurisdiction of this court to deal with the appeal from the order of the board concerning the 1920 assessment, which, as I have stated, is governed by section 41 of the Supreme Court Act before its amendment in 1920, for under that section the right of appeal exists when the judgment involves the assessment of property at a value of not less than $10,000.00. This court, without any doubt having been expressed as to its jurisdiction, dealt with the 1920 assessment in December of that year and referred back the matter to the Ontario Railway and Municipal Board for the reasons stated in its judgment.[3] And this appeal is from the order of the board on the reference back from this court. During the consideration of this case, however, a new difficulty was encountered as to our jurisdiction, a difficulty which none of the counsel had ever even hinted at. It is obvious that the court must look to counsel who come before it to draw its attention to any statutory provision bearing on a case which is being argued by them. Of course, there was no intention here to mislead the court\u2014the professional standing of the learned counsel in the present case would render any such suggestion entirely out of the question\u2014but all the same there is a material statutory provision in the Ontario Assessment Act which was never referred to, either now or during the hearing on the first appeal.\nBy section 41 of the Supreme Court Act, before the 1920 amendment, an appeal lay from the judgment of any court of last resort created under provincial legislation to adjudicate concerning the assessment of property for provincial or municipal purposes, but the valuation of the property assessed could not be varied by this court unless it was satisfied that such court of last resort in the province had proceeded upon an erroneous principle. The appellant here assumed, and the respondent did not dispute, that the Ontario Railway and Municipal Board was a court of last resort in municipal matters.\nWhen, however, the Assessment Act and its amendments were examined, it appeared that under subsection 6 of section 80 of the Act an appeal from the board on any question of law was possible, by leave obtained, to a Divisional Court. There might have been a question whether the necessity of obtaining such leave prevented the board from being normally the court of last resort in the province on such matters. But by chapter 41 of the statutes of 1916, section 6, subsection 2, (Ont.), the provision in subsection 6 requiring leave was struck out, so that now, under subsection 6 as amended, there is an absolute right of appeal on a question of law (and our appeal under section 41 of the Supreme Court Act is only on a question of law) from the order of the Ontario Railway and Municipal Board to a divisional court. It follows that the Board can no longer be said to be the court of last resort in the province empowered to adjudicate concerning the assessment of property for municipal purposes.\nIt was decided to hear the parties on this question of jurisdiction, and this was done on the first day of the present term. Nothing said by the learned counsel for the appellant has convinced me that we have any jurisdiction to hear the 1920 appeal. I would therefore quash it for want of jurisdiction.\nAppeal quashed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: Malcolm A. McKay.\nSolicitor for the respondent: D. J. Cowan.\n[1] 61 Can. S. C.

The testator himself sold the farm and took a mortgage for part of the purchase money. This mortgage he held unimpaired at his death and it formed part of his estate. The executors applied by originating summons to the Supreme Court of Ontario for construction of this clause in the will.\nHeld, affirming the judgment of the Appellate Division (51 Ont. L.R. 278) that the trust declared by the will in respect to the proceeds of sale of the farm applied to the mortgage which passed to the testator\u2019s sons in the proportions he indicated.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario[1] affirming the judgment at the hearing on an originating summons for construction of a will.\nThe question raised on the appeal was whether the devise in the will of William McClure of the proceeds of sale of a farm by the executors to the respondents applied to the mortgage taken by the testator when he himself sold the farm or such mortgage fell into the residue of the estate. The courts below held that it passed to the respondents.\nProudfoot K.C. for the appellants. By the Ontario Wills Act a will speaks as if executed immediately before death. Applying that rule here there was nothing when the testator died for the devise of respondents to operate on. See In re Dods[2]; In re Clowes[3].\nThe executors were directed to sell \u201cmy farm\u201d which the testator made impossible. No \u201ccontary intention\u201d to this direction can be found and the will must speak from the death. The \u201ccontrary intention\u201d in sec. 26 of the Wills Act can only be looked for in cases of error by the testator where the intention is clear. See In re Clifford[4].\nNesbitt K.C. and J.H.G. Wallace for the respondents. The devise was of the proceeds from the sale of the farm and these proceeds have not lost their identity. The intention of the testator is clear and must govern. See In re Carter[5]; In re Bick[6].\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014For the reasons stated by my brother Anglin J. with which I fully concur, I would dismiss this appeal with costs.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014Having considered the cases cited by appellant, as well as those by the learned judges below, I agree with the reasons assigned by the latter in support of the judgment appealed from. It seems to me that the cases of clear ademption relied upon in appellant\u2019s factum are beside the real question in issue.\nThat question is whether or not the testator, having bequeathed to the respondents the proceeds of the sale of his farm, directed by him to be effected by his executors, can be carried out by them, when he anticipated their selling by acting himself as seller, and took the mortgage now left in their hands as part of the purchase money so clearly designed by the terms of the will to become theirs.\nI may add to those cited below and herein the decision in Morrice v. Aylmer[7], as in line with a mode of thought more liberal than some earlier decisions and worth looking at in such a case as this.\nThis appeal should be dismissed with costs and in any event the executors to have their costs out of the estate.\nDUFF J.\u2014This appeal presents a question of will construction which is one of not a little difficulty. The testator William McClure, by his will directed that the executors should sell his farm and that the proceeds should be divided in a certain way. By another clause he disposed of cash on hand or securities for money and \u201call other property and estate\u201d. Before his death he sold the farm which was the subject of the above mentioned trust and at his death part of the purchase money remained unpaid secured by a mortgage on the farm.\nThe question is whether the trust declared in respect of the farm applies to the mortgage. My conclusion is that the judgment of the Appellate Division should be maintained. The question may fairly, I think, be stated by an adaptation of the language of Farwell J. cited by Mr. Justice Hodgins from In re Dowsett[8]. Has the testator manifested his intention that his gift is not of the particular property only but of the proceeds of the property so long as the proceeds retain a form by which they can be identified as such? I think such an intention is manifest by the terms of the will.\nANGLIN J.\u2014The circumstance that the devise to the respondent is not of the farm in specie but of the proceeds of the sale of it directed to be made by the executor distinguishes this case from In re Clowes[9] where the devise was of land in specie, subsequently sold by the testator (who had, as in the case at bar, taken a mortgage on it to secure payment of part of the purchase money), sufficiently to afford opportunity for the application of s. 26 of the Wills Act and to bring this case within the principles of such decisions as In re Clifford[10]; In re Leeming[11]; In re Carter[12]; and In re Johnstone\u2019s Settlement[13].\nThere seems to be enough in the devise here in question to indicate an intention that the funds representing the property dealt with should go to the beneficiary in whatever form they might be found at the testator\u2019s death. The \u201ccontrary intention\u201d of s. 27 of the Wills Act therefore appears. Morgan v. Thomas[14] shews that in a case such as this a broad and even a lax construction of the terms of the will should prevail if thereby effect will more probably be given to the testator\u2019s intention. That case and Manton v. Tabois[15] establish that partial ademption owing to a portion of the property which is the subject of the devise being unavailable or to its identity having been lost will not prevent the devise taking effect as to so much of it as still forms part of the testator\u2019s available estate and can be fully identified. Looking at the substance of the devise in question and giving effect to what appears to have been the probable intention of the testator, I am of the opinion that the mortgage in question passed to the respondents in the proportions indicated by the testator. Passages from the judgment delivered in the House of Lords in Beddington v. Baumann[16], quoted by Mr. Justice Hodgins, confirm this view. Adapting the language of Lord Davey the testator\u2019s will is\nexpressed in such language and in such large terms as to carry not only the property as it then existed, but also this property which has arisen from the particular dealings with it.\nBRODEUR J.\u2014This is an appeal concerning the construction of a will. William McClure had by his will directed his executor to sell his farm and to divide the proceeds between his two sons. Before his death he sold the farm himself and part of the purchase price was secured by a mortgage thereon.\nThe question is whether the devise fails because the farm had already been sold.\nIf the farm itself had been devised to the legatees, the solution might be different; Gale v. Gale[17]; Farrar v. Winterton[18]; Blake v. Blake[19]; In re Clowes[20]; In re Dods[21]. But the testator\u2019s executor was called upon to distribute the proceeds of the farm. There is nothing to shew that the testator did intend in selling his farm himself to prevent his beneficiaries under the will from having the proceeds of the mortgage handed over by the executor to his legatees. In re Graham[22].\nThe appeal should be dismissed. As there is some diversity of opinion as to the construction of such a will the costs of all parties should be paid out of the estate.\nMIGNAULT J.\u2014The question here is whether a bequest, whereby the testator directed his executors to sell his farm and divide the net proceeds among the respondents in the proportions therein stated, took effect the testator having himself sold the farm and taken a mortgage for the balance of the purchase price. The mortgage was still unpaid at the testator\u2019s death.\nIn my opinion, the bequest was of the proceeds of the farm and not of the farm itself, and it is not defeated because the testator anticipated the sale which he had ordered his executors to make.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellants: William A.

It was shipped over the C.P. Ry. and arrived at Windsor where part of it was stolen before delivery. M. brought action for the value of the portion not delivered.\nHeld, affirming the judgment of the Appellate Division (51 Ont. L.R. 370) that whether the action is one ex contractu or ex delicto it is based on a breach of the obligation to deliver the goods and the plaintiff must fail as he has to rely on his own illegal act. The carrier being innocent of the offence against the law may set up this illegality as a defence.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario[1] affirming the judgment at the trial in favour of the respondent.\nThe facts are sufficiently stated in the above head-note. The question for decision on the appeal is\u2014Can a plaintiff who has induced an innocent defendant to enter into a contract, involving violation of a positive statute, recover damages from that defendant for failure to complete the contract, or, in tort, for anything arising out of the illegal transaction? Geo. F. Henderson, K.C. for the appellant. The plaintiff could legally import the liquor for sale outside the province. See Hals. Laws of England, vol. 4, page 8, as to common carriers.\nThe action is not based on contract. The carrier is liable at common law for loss of the goods. Hals. ib.\nWhere the alleged intention is only collateral to the contract it does not defeat a claim in tort. Gordon v. Chief Commissioner Metropolitan Police[2].\nMacMurchy K.C. for the respondent. Ex turpi causa oritur non actio. See Brown v. Moore[3]; 7 Hals. Laws of England, page 408, sec. 845.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014For the reasons stated by my brother Anglin J. with which I fully concur, I would dismiss this appeal with costs.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014The appellant, through his agents in Montreal, induced the respondent to accept at Montreal a shipment of intoxicating liquor to be carried by it to Windsor in Ontario to be delivered through appellant at the latter place, by assuring it in the shipping bill as follows:\u2014\nWe hereby undertake and declare that this shipment is of a class and shipped under conditions permitted by law.\nThe learned trial judge finds that the said shipment of liquor was in fact intended by the appellant to be used by him in way of selling same in Ontario in violation of the statutes then in force prohibiting such re-sale, and hence also in violation of 6-7 George V., (1916) c. 19, sections 1 and 2, designed to aid then existing prohibition enactments in force in Ontario. Part of the goods so shipped were stolen in Windsor from the respondent\u2019s car wherein same had been shipped, and the appellant seeks to hold the respondent as a common carrier liable for such loss.\nThis pretension has been rejected both by the learned trial judge and the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario.\nHence this appeal to us.\nThe relevant law is as was stated by Lord Mansfield in Holman v. Johnson[4] as follows:\u2014\nThe principle of public policy is this: ex dolo malo non oritur actio. No court will lend its aid to a man who founds his cause of action upon an immoral or an illegal act. If, from the plaintiff\u2019s own stating or otherwise, the cause of action appears to arise ex turpi causa, or the transgression of a positive law of this country, there the court says he has no right to be assisted. It is upon that ground the court goes; not for the sake of the defendant but because they will not lend their aid to such a plaintiff.\nThat remains good law to the present, seems most aptly to answer the claim herein of the appellant, and should not be frittered away by any nice distinctions.\nThis statement of the law is none the less applicable though not applied therein to defeat the claim made because the contract there in question was one made abroad and violated no English law; yet the principles so enunciated have been adopted and applied in a long line of cases since.\nIf the goods in question had been stolen in the Province of Quebec and there had been no such Dominion Act as relied upon, possibly the respondent might have been liable, but who can question the intention of the law applicable to sale, or intention to re-sell, in Ontario, and the Dominion Act being prohibitive of such traffic unless for the private consumption by the consignee. I need not follow the history of the application of the law so declared by Lord Mansfield.\nThe appellant seeks to apply the exceptional cases cited in Broom\u2019s Legal Maxims, where only a penalty was attached to the act, and prohibition was not intended.\nIt is quite true that there are many cases which have arisen, under some Revenue Acts for example, when it was held that the purview of the Act not being prohibition, therefore the turpitude of which the court must take notice did not exist.\nI am afraid that is asking us to go blind in this case. In like way conversely the case law relative to the results arising out of the Gaming Acts and other such Acts do not help much unless to confuse one and so mislead.\nAgain it is suggested that this action is founded on tort and not on contract.\nI cannot so hold for it clearly is founded on the contractual relation between the appellant and respondent as a common carrier, though these relations are so often changed by statutory provisions.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nANGLIN J.\u2014In my opinion, however the plaintiff\u2019s case is put, upon the pleadings and facts in evidence his claim must be for breach by the defendant of its obligation to deliver certain of his goods to him at Windsor, Ontario. His sole cause of action consists of the duty so to deliver and its breach. To establish that duty he is obliged to shew the placing of his goods with the defendant for delivery as alleged. But the placing of the goods with the defendant for that purpose was, upon the evidence, a contravention of the Dominion statute 6-7 Geo. V., c. 19, sec, 1 (a), inasmuch as it was a step in causing them to be sent or carried from one province of Canada into another province of Canada with the intention of there dealing with them in violation of the law of such latter province. The plaintiff is, therefore, in establishing his cause of action, obliged to invoke an illegal act in which he participated and consequently cannot maintain his action; Simpson v. Bloss[5]; Taylor v. Chester[6]; Scott v. Brown. Doering, McNab & Co.[7] The illegality is not in a collateral matter but in the very transaction out of which the alleged duty arose of the non-fulfilment of which the plaintiff complains.\nThe defendant being itself innocent in the matter, is not precluded from setting up as a defence the illegal intent of the plaintiff.\nThe statute 6-7 Geo. V., c. 19 (D.), was passed in aid of provincial Temperance Acts. Its penalizing clauses were enacted not merely for the purpose of revenue but to supplement and render more effective certain prohibitory provisions of such provincial enactments. They therefore impliedly prohibit and render illegal the acts they penalize. Broom\u2019s Legal Maxims, 8th ed., page 579.\nI have no doubt that the judgment appealed from is right and should be affirmed.\nBRODEUR J.\u2014In 1916 the Province of Ontario passed a law by which no person could sell liquor without a licence. In the same year the Federal Parliament, for the evident purpose of reinforcing the temperance sentiment of the provinces, passed a law declaring that any person who sends, ships, etc. into any province from any other province any intoxicating liquor\nknowing or intending that such intoxicating liquor will or shall be thereafter dealt with in violation of the law of the province into which such intoxicating liquor is sent, shipped * * * shall be liable * * * to a penalty.\nIn March, 1920, the appellant Major, who had been for years connected with the liquor trade in Ontario, bought in Montreal 100 cases of liquor from Law, Young & Co. and had them shipped by the Canadian Pacific Railway to Windsor, Ontario. The railway company would not undertake to carry these goods without having from the shipper a written guarantee that the liquor was\nof a class and shipped under conditions permitted by law.\nThe goods arrived at their destination in Windsor but a part of the shipment was stolen in the yards of the railway company. There is no evidence that this robbery had been rendered possible by the negligence of the company in not properly guarding the yards or in not maintaining therein sufficient police protection. Major now sues the company to recover the value of the cases which have been stolen.\nI should state also that in the month of May, 1920, Major was convicted under the Ontario Temperance Act for having sold in breach of the Act all the liquor he had received from that shipment and from other similar shipments. The irresistible inference from this conviction is that Major was still busily engaged in the liquor business but was now carrying out that business illegally without having the required licence. The railway company pleaded in answer to Major\u2019s action that the liquor had been purchased by Major with the intent of violating the Ontario Temperance Act; that he was in bad faith when he represented through his agents that the shipment was made for legal purposes; that the contract to carry that liquor was illegal and that he could not recover under it.\nThe trial judge found that these goods had been bought by Major for illegal purposes. The latter tried to establish that the liquor had been imported in Ontario for his own personal use but the trial judge did not believe him.\nIt is evident that he was engaged in an illicit trade and that when he shipped these goods he knew and intended that such liquor was to be dealt with in violation of the law of Ontario.\nThis finding of the trial judge was concurred in by the Appellate Division and there is certainly no justification for us to interfere with this finding.\nAs far as he was concerned the contract of carriage which Major made with the Canadian Pacific Railway of that liquor was illegal.\nThen could Major, who has induced an innocent defendant to enter into a contract involving a violation of law, recover damages from that defendant for failure to complete the contract?\nAs I have already said, no negligence is charged against the defendant railway company. I am of opinion that the plaintiff, having delivered these goods under an unlawful agreement, could not recover them back. Taylor v. Chester[8]. No action (says Halsbury Laws of England, vol. 7, page 408),. can be brought for the purpose of enforcing an illegal contract whether directly or indirectly, or of recovering a share of the proceeds of an illegal transaction, by any parties to it. Where the object of a contract is illegal the whole transaction is tainted with illegality, and no right of action exists in respect of anything arising out of the transaction. In such a case the maxim in pari delicto, potior est conditio defendentis applies, and the test for determining whether an action lies is to see whether the plaintiff can make out his claim without relying on the illegal transaction to which he was a party.\nApplying those principles as laid down in Taylor v. Chester8 and in Halsbury to the facts of this case, I consider that the plaintiff Major made an illegal contract when he shipped his liquor to Windsor with the intent of violating the Ontario Temperance Act.\nMr. Henderson, in his able argument, stated that the action was in tort and that in such a case the principles above quoted would not apply. Whether his claim is for the recovery or delivery of the goods or whether it is for damages arising out of non-delivery, the plaintiff has to rely on the contract of carriage which he made with the company; and, as this contract is illegal, he could not recover whether his action is in tort or ex contractu. In such cases the courts cannot lend their assistance to an action which appears to arise ex turpi causa, or the transgressing the laws of this country. Holman v. Johnson[9].\nFor those reasons, I am of opinion that this appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nMIGNAULT J.\u2014Notwithstanding Mr. Henderson\u2019s very ingenious argument for the appellant, I cannot escape from the conclusion that to succeed he must rely on an illegal contract, although an innocent one in so far as the respondent is concerned. Mr. Henderson argued that the shipment of liquor was not prohibited by the statute 6-7 Geo. V., ch. 19, but that the person shipping it, with the intention that it be thereafter dealt with in violation of the law of the province into which the liquor was sent, merely incurred a penalty. I cannot so read the statute; it is clearly prohibitive as the context shews. So the intention of the appellant, when he made the shipment, to deal with the liquor when it reached him in Windsor, Ont., in violation of the Ontario Temperance Act rendered the shipment an illegal one.\nMr. Henderson also argued that he could claim damages from the respondent for non-delivery of the liquor without relying at all upon an illegal contract of shipment, but on the ground that the defendant having come into possession of the appellant\u2019s property, and having by its negligence suffered it to be stolen, the appellant could proceed against the defendant in tort and not upon any contract of shipment. The refinement of this distinction shews the ingenuity of the learned counsel, but to my mind it is utterly impossible to get away from the contract. The appellant had the liquor shipped to him, and a portion of it was lost or stolen before it reached him. The liability clearly arises here out of the contract. The respondent, acting as a common carrier of goods, was in possession of this liquor by virtue of a contract of carriage. It was liable without proof of negligence, this liability being one at common law. It is true that an action of tort lies against a common carrier without proof of any contract (Halsbury, vo. Carriers, no. 13), but it is impossible to disregard the contract in a case like this one, where it was made in violation of the law. Even if the plaintiff could state a cause of action without referring to any contract\u2014on the contrary, in his statement of claim he expressly alleges the contract of carriage\u2014still if it appears from the evidence that there has really been an unlawful contract between the parties, the court would be bound of its own motion to take the objection that the contract is void.

Brodeur J. dissenting.\nThe levying of customs duties on the goods in question is not \"taxation\" on \"property\" belonging to a province within the purview of section 125 of the B.N.A. Act. Brodeur J. dissenting.\nJudgment of the Exchequer Court (21 Ex. C.R. 281) affirmed, Brodeur J. dissenting.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada[1] dismissing appellant's action.\nThis action has been taken by the Crown in right of the province of British Columbia to have it declared that it could import liquors into Canada for purposes of sale pursuant to the provisions of the \"Government Liquor Act\" ([B.C.] 11 Geo. V. c. 30) without paying the customs duties imposed by the Crown in right of the Dominion of Canada upon the importation thereof.\nEug. Lafleur K.C. for the appellant: The word \"taxation\" in section 125 of the B.N.A. Act includes the imposition of customs duties. Bank of Toronto v. Lambe[2]; Cotton v. The King[3].\nThe word \"property\" in section 125 includes moveable property, is not restricted to property within the province and is not limited to such property as may be incident to the administration of the provincial government.\nThe taxation in question is imposed upon the property by the terms of the taxing statutes.\nBayly K.C. for the Attorney-General for the province of Ontario, intervenant.\nNewcombe K.C. and Plaxton for the respondent. The customs duties imposed in respect of the importation of liquors by the province do not violate either the letter or the spirit of section 125 of the B.N.A. Act.\nThese duties do not constitute \"taxation\" in the sense in which that term is used in section 125, but are merely in the nature of regulations of trade and commerce.\nThese duties, even supposing them to be in the nature of \"taxation\" do not constitute taxation on \"property\" within the meaning of section 125. Attorney General of New South Wales v. Collector of Customs[4]. The case of liquor which has been imported by the province is not within the connotation of the word \"property\" in section 125.\nThe exemption from taxation provided by section 125 does not extend to goods which, though belonging to the province, are not intended to be used in the execution of the ordinary functions of government or for the purposes of the provincial government as these were understood at the time of the Union.\nThe word \"taxation\" in section 125 was not intended to comprehend customs duties, for the reason that the prohibition enacted by this section was intended to be a reciprocal prohibition and therefore does not extend as regards the Dominion to indirect taxation.\nThe word \"property\" must be held to be limited, in accordance with the episdem generis or noscitur a sociis rule of construction, to species of property of the same nature or description as \"lands\", that is to say, to things arising out of, or incident or appurtenant to lands.\nEug. Lafleur K.C. for the appellant:\nNewcombe K.C. and Plaxton for the respondent.\nIdington J.\u2014The government of the province of British Columbia having embarked in the business of dealing in intoxicating liquors and thereby found itself under the necessity of importing \"Johnnie Walker Black Label\" whiskey, claims that it is exempt from the payment of the usual customs duties imposed by the Dominion Parliament upon such like importations, and rests its claim upon section 125 of the British North America Act, 1867, which reads as follows:\u2014\nNo lands or property belonging to Canada or any province shall be liable to taxation. This section falls under the caption \"VIII.\u2014Revenues; Debts; Assets; Taxation\"; in that Act, and is the last but one of the twenty-five sections thereunder devoted to the said several subject matters\u2014the last one dealing with a subject which does not concern us herein.\nI am of the opinion that this exemption only relates to such lands and property as fall within the purview of some one or other of the sections preceding it under said caption and of those specifically set forth in the third and fourth schedule of the Act or by implication resting upon those or other provisions of the said B.N.A. Act and which may thereby reasonably be held to have been within the contemplation of the framers of the Act.\nThe Intercolonial Railway agreed by the terms of the said Act to be built by the Dominion Government would seem to me to be of such lastly suggested character.\nThe mere mention of the possibility of any province embarking upon such an enterprise as the province of British Columbia has done, and is now in question, I venture to think would have surprised any one in the far off day when the B.N.A. Act was enacted after much public discussion.\nHence it seems to me that the said section 125, above quoted, cannot reasonably be extended to cover any such case as now presented.\nIndeed if any regard is had to the nature of the legislation in the immediate context where the section is found, and to the exclusive powers given by the items 2 and 3 of the 91st section of the Act, and the implication therein, the appellant's contention seems to me hardly arguable.\nI do not propose dealing with the over refinements put forward in regard to the meaning of taxation. The consideration of this instrument of government presented to us to interpret, should be approached and construed in the wide comprehensive spirit in which it was framed and the means of destroying its efficacy should not be furnished by such a new departure as we are invited to take.\nIt is in that regard that the language of the late Mr. Justice Brewer in the case of South Carolina v. United States[5], quoted in respondent's factum, may help our range of vision herein; though of course, the decision of the courts of that country upon a constitution fundamentally different from the conception embodied in the B.N.A. Act in reserving for the Dominion what is not expressly given exclusively to the provinces, instead of the converse conception found in the said constitution, cannot help us very much.\nI think this appeal should be dismissed with costs if asked.\nDuff J.\u2014The second of the enumerated heads of sec. 91 \"Regulation of Trade and Commerce\" has been the subject of much controversy, but there has not been I think any difference of opinion upon the point that the amplest authority in relation to the subject of external trade is vested in the Dominion. By sec. 91 to the Dominion is committed exclusive authority over the \"regulation of trade and commerce\" over navigation and shipping, over the postal service and external communications as well as over aliens and naturalization; and by section 132 full authority is given to the Dominion in relation to the enforcement of treaty obligations. The statute itself, I think, gives abundant evidence that control over external trade by the central authority is an integral part of the confederation scheme. The importance of the customs duties as an instrument for the regulation of external trade is too obvious to require comment. At the date of confederation there was probably only one country\u2014The United Kingdom\u2014in which such duties were resorted to for the exclusive purpose of raising a revenue and prima facie plenary authority in respect of them would seem to be an adjunct of exclusive authority to regulate foreign trade.\nI have no difficulty in point of legal construction in holding that this authority is given by sec. 91 (2), that is to say that the authority to levy customs duties for trade purposes is embraced in the authority thereby conferred, \"the regulation of trade and commerce\". Mr. Newcombe in his valuable argument has collected a mass of evidence which conclusively establishes that it is strictly in accordance with legislative as well as judicial usage so to read the words of the second head of section 91. It is unnecessary to review that evidence. The language used for defining the authority of the Dominion on the subject of taxation\u2014the \"raising of money by any mode or system of taxation\"\u2014 seems to distinguish between taxation for trade purposes and taxation for the purpose of raising money. Since the imposition of customs duties (as being indirect taxation) is excluded from the provincial jurisdiction, the words of the last mentioned heading suggest that such duties except where imposed primarily at all events for purposes of revenue are treated as falling within the \"ambit\" of the power given to the Dominion in relation to \"Trade and Commerce\".\nThe effect of the contention of the province is that by force of section 125 the control over foreign trade entrusted to the Dominion is subject to the limitation that goods imported by a provincial government are not subject to customs duties. It requires little reflection to enable one to realize that this would be a restriction upon the Dominion authority of wide scope and of the greatest importance and it cannot be assumed, if the unrestricted right of free importation is given to the provinces, that it is a right which the provinces are not entitled (without incurring the reproach of abusing a constitutional power) to exercise to the fullest extent which the interests of the province may demand; and the proposition stated above as to the place which the constitutional scheme accords to the Dominion control of foreign trade must receive very serious qualification. Indeed the theory of Dominion primacy must on such a construction of section 125 postulate a theoretical application of the power of disallowance with a freedom which could hardly have been contemplated by the founders of a permanent federal system.\nOf course, if the language of section 125 is quite unequivocal effect must be given to its plain meaning. But on the other hand the Act does, in my opinion (sec. 125 apart) contemplate so clearly the existence of this primacy of Dominion authority in the matter of external trade and control of customs as so clearly essential to the maintenance of this primacy that I must, I think, reject a construction of that section which would obviously render that control insecure, unless the language is too inflexible to enable me to do so.\nIt is indubitable that the word \"taxation\" in itself denotes a class of operations which includes the raising of moneys for public purposes by the imposition of customs duties. But that is not of much assistance. Our first duty in construing the section is, of course, to ascertain the ordinary and grammatical meaning of the words but it is with the ordinary and grammatical meaning of the words in the setting in which they are found and as applied to the subject matter that we are concerned. What the section is dealing with is not taxation in general but the liability of \"property\" to \"taxation\" and the word taxation when used in this association has, I think, prima facie a much less comprehensive import than that which would be ascribed to it standing by itself or in some other connections. Customs duties when levied for the purpose of raising a revenue are, speaking broadly and in the general view of them, taxes on consumable commodities, taxes on consumption; while the taxation of capital, of assets, of property is a very different matter. And I think the distinction affects the use of language to this extent at least that neither in popular speech nor in more deliberate discussion would the phrase taxation used in connection with capital or property, \"taxation of property\", for example, suggest the operation of levying customs duties. It is quite true that such a use of the phrase \"taxation of property\" if anybody chose to employ it in that sense might be justified because the levying of customs duties is \"taxation\" and customs duties are commonly spoken of as levied on goods (see e.g. sec. 123 B.N.A. Act) that is to say on property, and therefore such a use of the phrase would be capable of logical defence. But \"taxation\" when used in such a context has not, I think, prima facie so broad a significance.\nIn this view the words of sec. 125 are not apt words to express an intention to exempt the provincial governments from the operation of the customs laws, that is to say, such is not their necessary effect. My opinion therefore is, in view of the considerations mentioned above, that the more limited construction for which Mr. Newcombe contends must be ascribed to that section. But there is one other consideration which I think has some bearing upon the point in dispute which it may be worth while to mention. The group of sections in which sec. 125 appears, beginning that is to say with sec. 102, deals principally with the distribution of Crown property between the provinces and the Dominion. The Crown property is distributed between the two authorities in the sense that in part it is delivered over to the custody of the Dominion and in part to the custody of the provinces. But it is a distribution of property as assets; the control thus acquired by the provinces in respect of the assets assigned to them is not a control which excludes the operation of Dominion laws made in exercise of competent authority affecting the use of such property; provincial public fisheries e.g. are subject to regulations enacted by Parliament in the execution of its legislative authority in relation to fisheries. In re Provincial Fisheries[6]. The provinces are to keep the property assigned to them and enjoy the fruits oft hat property free from any right of the Dominion to assume it except for the purposes of defence (sec. 117) and they have the further protection of section 125; a provision suggested, it may well be, by Marshall's famous dictum adapted from Webster's argument \"a power to tax is a power to destroy\"; but there is nothing in any of these clauses suggesting that the legislator is aiming at a limitation of Dominion authority in such matters as e.g. shipping and external trade.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs. Anglin J.\u2014The case at bar is, in my opinion, not distinguishable in principle from that which came before the High Court of Australia in Attorney General for N.S.W. v. Collector of Customs[7]. Section 114 of the Australian Constitution and s. 125 of the B.N.A. Act are substantially the same. The powers of the Commonwealth Parliament in regard to the regulation of trade and commerce and the raising of money by taxation are practically the same as those of the Parliament of Canada. In the Australian case customs duty was claimed upon the importation of steel rails by a state government for use upon a state railway; in the case at bar the importation by the provincial government of British Columbia is of a case of whiskey admittedly intended to be resold in the Government liquor stores of that province established under the authority of a provincial statute.\nWhile, at first blush, we would seem to be confronted with a case of federal taxation of property belonging to a province in contravention of s. 125 of the B.N.A. Act, I am so thoroughly convinced that the exemption from customs duties claimed by the appellant was not intended to be given by that section that I am satisfied that some reasonably admissible construction which would exclude such exemption should be given to it.\nThe question at issue has been exhaustively considered and all aspects of it thoroughly discussed in the Australian case. Agreeing, as I do, with the result there reached, I shall merely indicate the ground on which, in my opinion, it should be held that the levying of customs duties on the goods in question is not taxation on property belonging to a province within the purview of s. 125 of the B.N.A. Act. Customs duties are, no doubt, in at least one aspect \"taxation\" within the meaning of that term as ordinarily used and, I think, as used in the B.N.A. Act, s. 91 (3). They are a mode or system of taxation for the raising of money and are a typical form of indirect tax. But they are, it seems to me, something more\u2014they are tolls levied at the border as a condition of permission to import goods into the country being granted by the governmental authority clothed with jurisdiction either entirely to prohibit their entry, or to prescribe conditions on which such entry may be effected. In legislating for such prohibition or for permission to enter conditional upon payment of certain duties, Parliament is exercising its authority for \"the regulation of trade and commerce\" (s. 91 (2), as well as its right to provide for \"the raising of money by any mode or system of taxation\". In their aspect as tolls imposed in exercise of the power to regulate trade and commerce customs duties are not \"taxation\".\nAlthough Australian customs duties, like those of Canada, are in terms imposed \"on\" or \"upon\" the goods imported, four of the eminent judges who sat in the High Court of Australia held that the subject of these tolls\u2014 the thing in respect to which they are levied\u2014is rather the exercise of the right of importation\u2014the movement of the goods over the border\u2014their entry into the country\u2014than the goods themselves in their character as property belonging to their owner. Another view is that they are a tax on the importer, whether owner or not of the goods, imposed in respect of the importation. In either veiw they do not constitute a tax on property belonging to the province in the sense in which that phrase is used in s. 125. There is also something to be said for the contention that, inasmuch as taxation can be levied only on goods subject to the jurisdiction of the authority which imposes them, \"property\" in s. 125 of the B.N.A. Act must mean property within Canada and does not include property about to be brought into the country which is, theoretically at least, held at the border until payment has been made of the customs duties.\nOther reasons indicated in Attorney General of N.S.W. v. Collector of Customs for N.S.W.[8], for holding that the imposition of customs duties in respect of importations belonging to a provincial government is not taxation of property belonging to a province within the meaning of s. 125 were urged by Mr. Newcombe. I prefer, however, to rest my opinion upholding the judgment of the Exchequer Court on the grounds that customs duties are not \"taxation\" and that they are not imposed upon \"property\" within the meaning of those terms as used in s. 125 of the B.N.A. Act.\nBrodeur J. (dissenting).\u2014The question in this case is whether the imposition by Dominion legislation of customs duties on goods imported by a province is constitutionally valid.\nThe Exchequer Court has pronounced such legislation intra vires and this is an appeal from the Exchequer Court's judgment.\nThe question is a new one as far as Canada is concerned but it has been raised in the United States and in Australia; and it was decided in those two countries that such legislation by the central authority did not violate the provisions of the constitution of the United States nor of the Commonwealth of Australia. The facts are very simple: The government of British Columbia purchased in Great Britain and imported a certain quantity of liquor for the purpose of re-sale under their \"Government Liquor Act\".\nWhen the liquor arrived in Canada it was taken possession of by the Collector of Customs in the ordinary course of business. The provincial authorities then made a written demand on the Collector for delivery of the goods, but he refused to do so unless customs duties were paid.\nThe present action, which is a test case, was instituted to have a declaration that the Province was entitled to delivery or possession of that liquor free from the payment of any customs duty.\nThe Province relies on section 125 of the B.N.A. Act which is as follows:\u2014\nNo lands or property belonging to Canada or any province shall be liable to taxation.\nThe Dominion authorities claim that they are entitled to the possession of the goods until the customs duties are paid and that the Dominion laws authorizing them to claim these duties are not in violation of this section 125 of the B.N.A. Act.\nThere is no question in this case as to the validity of the power of British Columbia to pass their Government Liquor Act. It was the subject of controversy in the case of Canadian Pacific Wine Co. v. Tuley[9], and the Privy Council decided that such legislation was intra vires. We are then concerned only with the question as to whether liquor belonging to a province is free from customs duties. It is contended first on the part of the Dominion authorities that the customs duties do not constitute taxation but are merely in the nature of regulation of trade and commerce under the provisions of art. 91-2 of the B.N.A. Act. I may say that the imposition of customs duties might be in some respect considered as regulation of the trade of the country, and that the imposition of import duty may be resorted to to regulate commercial intercourse with foreign countries. Discriminating duties, prohibitory duties, protecting duties are so many commercial regulations. But I am strongly of the view that our customs duties are also imposed for the purpose of revenue in the exercise of the power of the federal authorities to raise money by taxation. Nobody will deny that the customs duties in the case of liquor are mainly imposed for revenue purposes. They then constitute the raising of money by taxation and should not be considered as merely in the nature of regulations of trade and commerce.\nI may quote in support of my contention the declaration of Attorney General of New South Wales v. Collector of Customs[10], where the Australian High Court stated that the imposition of customs duties is a mode of regulating trade and commerce as well as an exercise of the taxing power.\nThe court below relied on a decision of the United States Supreme Court in a case of South Carolina v. United States[11], where it was stated that the exemption of state agencies from federal taxation should be limited to those which are of a strictly governmental character and does not extend to those which are used by the state in the carrying on of an ordinary private business The legislation of the province of British Columbia is passed with the evident purpose of dealing with this very serious evil of intemperance. Several laws, federal and provincial, have been passed since Confederation for the purpose of remedying this evil. The licensing system was tried and found wanting. The local option was resorted to by provincial and federal legislation but did not bring about all the good results that were expected. During the great war attempts were made to enact total prohibition laws but the results in the opinion of a great many were not satisfactory. Then some provinces, amongst which was British Columbia, decided to put the sale of liquor under their direct control. In doing so nobody can deny that they exercised functions which are of a governmental character. I cannot then accept the view to the contrary expressed in that American case.\nI may add that this American decision was not a unanimous one and that Mr. Justice White, who became later on Chief Justice, was dissenting with two of his colleagues, and his reasoning seems to me a very strong one.\nIt is contended also by the federal authorities that the duties claimed do not constitute taxation of \"property\" within the meaning of section 125 of the B.N.A. Act, and that the tax is levied in respect of the importation of goods and not upon the goods themselves; and they rely on the Steel Rails Case(1) decided by the Australian courts.\nThere is no doubt that what the Imperial Parliament had in mind to prohibit by that section 125 is taxation upon the beneficial ownership, possession or enjoyment of land or property. Then customs duties\n(1) 5 Com. L.R. 818. on liquor are certainly intended by Parliament to constitute taxation of property. Besides, the provisions of the Customs Act declare formally that the duties are \"on or upon\" imported goods; that these goods might be seized and sold for the payment of these duties. Consequently the beneficial ownership or enjoyment of these goods by the owner is affected, and I cannot agree with the respondent's proposition that customs duties do not constitute a tax.\nThe decision of the Australian courts in the Steel Rails Case[12] has been rendered under a constitution and under customs laws which differ to a certain extent from our own constitutions and our own customs law. There is however such a similitude in the principles of these constitutions and of these laws that we should not ignore the importance of this decision of the Australian court.\nThe authority of this Australian case is affected by the fact that the judges do not agree in their reasons. Two of them Justices Isaacs and Higgins made a distinction between the words tax and taxation and give to the word taxation a wider meaning than to the word tax. Their opinions support the view that when the word taxation is used it can cover customs duties.\nThe word taxation is the one used in our constitution. Moreover, section 125 of the B.N.A. Act is placed under the heading of the 8th paragraph which is titled \"Revenues, debts, assets and taxation\" and is in the group of sections having reference to taxation; and section 123, which deals with customs duties as being leviable on goods, belongs to the group of sections dealing with taxation. In Clements' Constitution of Canada, p. 643, section 125 is examined and it is stated that this section\nwould operate no doubt to exempt from Customs duties goods purchased abroad by a provincial government, though there is no reported case on this point.\nIt has been contended also that the word \"property\" in section 125 of the B.N.A. Act does not include moveable property.\nIt seems that such a contention is erroneous. The word property is used there in the same sense as it is used in the section 91 (1) and 108 and the third schedule where the word property cannot clearly be restricted to lands or immoveable property.\nFor these reasons I am of the opinion that the government of British Columbia is entitled to a declaration that the goods in question were free of duty.\nThe appeal should be allowed.\nMignault J.\u2014The broad question involved in this appeal is whether the importation into Canada of goods belonging to the government of a province, and imported for purposes of trade, is subject to the usual custom duties imposed on similar goods by the Parliament of Canada.\nBy section 125 of the British North America Act, 1867, which applies to the province of British Columbia as well as to the other provinces of the Dominion, it is provided that\nno lands or property belonging to Canada or any province shall be liable to taxation.\nAnd it is argued that custom duties are taxation and therefore no such duties can be imposed on any goods belonging to a province when imported into Canada. It is contended that the authority of Parliament to levy custom duties is conferred by subsection 3 of section 91 of the British North America Act, which grants the power to raise money by any mode or system of taxation, and that custom duties must therefore be considered as taxation, otherwise the authority to levy them would not belong to the Parliament of the Dominion.\nNo doubt duties of this description are often referred to as being indirect taxation, but the respondent argues that it is not necessary to go to subsection 3 of section 91 to find the authority for their imposition, but that they could equally be exacted under the power of Parliament to regulate trade and commerce conferred by subsection2.\nThe ground on which, I think, the judgment appealed from can be sustained, is that the custom duties are not a tax imposed upon property as such but are levied on the importation of certain goods into Canada, or as a condition of their importation. The authority of Parliament to regulate importation for purposes of trade or otherwise cannot be doubted, and it follows that it can exact the payment of a duty or rate as a condition of the importation of goods into the Dominion. That the amount of the duty or rate may be based on the value of the goods, and it is not necessarily so based, appears to me immaterial. The property belonging to a province while within or without Canada is not subjected to any tax. What the province contends is that it can bring its property into Canada from other countries without paying the duties charged on the importation of similar goods when brought into Canada by other persons. I cannot agree with this contention and I think it cannot be based on the clause exempting from taxation the lands or property belonging to a province. I would dismiss the appeal, but without costs, the controversy being between the Dominion and a province on a matter of public interest. No costs should be payable on the intervention of the attorney general of Ontario.\nAppeal dismissed without costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: A. V. Pineo.\nSolicitor for the respondent: E. L.

McKillop (Plaintiffs) Respondents.\n1922: May 9, 10; 1922: October 10.\nPresent: Idington, Duff, Anglin, Brodeur and Mignault.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR BRITISH COLUMBIA\nSale\u2014Vendor and purchaser\u2014Contract\u2014Sale by vendor through third party to real purchaser\u2014Increase of price\u2014Difference to be paid by vendor to real purchaser\u2014Concealment from third party\u2014Fraud\u2014Advance in cash by purchaser to vendor\u2014Conditions of agreement not fulfilled\u2014Claim for reimbursement\u2014Indivisibility of transaction.\nThe respondents were owners of timber licences and timber lands, standing in the name of McKillop, which the appellant wished to purchase and for which the respondents asked $165,000. The appellant, being unable to make the cash payment required by the respondents, suggested that the transaction could be financed through one Rounds. It was finally agreed between the appellant McKillop that the respondents should sell to Rounds for $230,000 and that the appellant should receive in cash the difference of $65,000. The respondents were to be paid by Rounds $100,000 in cash, $90,000 in shares belonging to Rounds of the par value of $80,000 in a lumber company in Maine and $40,000 in five yearly instalments. The appellant was to buy the property from Rounds at the same price, $230,000. The appellant also agreed to purchase the shares from the respondents within four years at $85,000 with interest at 6% the respondents agreeing to pay the appellant in advance $65,000 in cash out of the $100,000 received from Rounds. The respondents consented to the increase in the price of sale and to conceal the fact from Rounds. The latter was also kept in ignorance of the payment of $65,000 by respondents to appellant and of the agreement by appellant to purchase the shares. These trans- actions being all carried through, the respondents paid the appellant $65,000 in cash. At the end of four years, the respondents called upon the appellant to purchase the shares. The appellant repudiated the transaction as ultra vires and on that ground successfully defended an action for specific performance. The respondents then brought this action to recover the $65,000 advanced to the appellant, with interest.\nHeld, Idington J. dissenting, that the payment of the $65,000 cannot be separated from the rest of the transaction; and, such transaction being infected with fraud in which McKillop participated, the respondents cannot recover.\nJudgment of the Court of Appeal ([1922] 2 W.W.R. 549,556) reversed, Idington J. dissenting.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1] reversing the judgment of Gregory J. at the trial and maintaining the respondents' action.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions in issue are fully stated in the above head-note and in the judgments now reported.\nThe trial judge dismissed the respondents' actions; but on appeal, it was held, Macdonald C.J.A. dissenting, that the fact that the agreement was ultra vires of the company was not a defence to the action, since the $65,000 had been used by the company for its benefit in paying debts.\nThe respondents, by their action, also claimed interest on the $65,000. The Court of Appeal[2] held that the respondents were not entitled to the interest. A cross-appeal was taken to the Supreme Court of Canada by the respondents against this ruling.\nCraig K.C. for the appellant.\nMartin K.C. and Lafleur K.C. for the respondents. IDINGTON J. (dissenting):\u2014This is an appeal from the Court of Appeal for British Columbia which reversed the judgment of the learned trial judge dismissing the action and gave judgment for the respondents for sixty-five thousand dollars without interest, but with costs in both of said courts.\nThe case is rather remarkable in many ways and if I were to attempt to follow and write its full history in all its varied sinuosities I fear the true aspects of law and fact, upon which the appeal should turn, would be lost sight of.\nThe respondent McKillop being possessed of timbered lands in British Columbia, the appellant entered into negotiations with him for the purchase thereof. His price was finally put at $165,000 cash, or such a large part thereof in cash as to render it if carried out practically a cash transaction.\nThe appellant could not raise the necessary cash and in the last resort the unhappy thought struck someone connected with the management of appellant company that it might induce a relation of his named Rounds to help the appellant to finance the transaction if some shares held by him in another company were taken into consideration as apparently part payment of the price.\nTo make that scheme practically operative, and satisfy the respondent McKillop's firm demands as to price of sale by him, the officer of the appellant, who unfolded it, suggested calling the price two hundred and thirty thousand dollars instead of the $165,000 dollars price which the said respondent, McKillop, was determined to adhere to and be paid. This was acted upon, but it required the said McKillop's assent as the conveyance must come from him and,\n[Page 399.]\nafter some hesitation, and doubts expressed by him to the parties acting for the appellant as to the propriety of such an expedient, he reluctantly assented.\nIt seemed from the way it was presented to him that he would be amply protected for the shares at par value of $80,000 would be, for the most part at least, covered by the increase of price. And so he should have been if such a devious scheme had been honestly observed by its inventor the appellant or its officers.\nIt had been promised McKillop by those acting for appellant that a mortgage would be given him by appellant on a valuable mill the company had recently erected, as well as other property to cover the balance that would be due him, after crediting the money he would receive, apart altogether from the shares Rounds was to assign him.\nThe first result was a transfer by him to the said Rounds expressed on its face to be for the said consideration of $230,000, of which $100,000 was to be in cash and $90,000 in said shares of the par value of $80,000 and $40,000 in five yearly instalments.\nAnd then a re-transfer was made by Rounds to appellant on terms which do not seem identical but may work out the same result in price. The friend Rounds had got rid of his stock by the first step in the deal.\nThe adroit management which brought that result about was successful in so handling McKillop as to get by one excuse or another a large share of the cash part of the said price which he was to be paid by Rounds, to be advanced by him to the company, and then when it came to the execution of the promised mortgage which was to be the last step in the plan or programme, the further excuse was set up that a mortgage would so impair the appellant's credit at the bank that some other agreement equally assuring McKillop of the payment of the balance due him should be substituted for the promised mortgage.\nHe was induced by such blandishments to modify the promise of a mortgage into accepting the following agreement:\nThis agreement made and entered into this twenty-fourth day of April, in the year of our Lord one thousand nine hundred and fourteen by and between:\nAlbert McKillop of the city of Vancouver, in the province of British Columbia, lumber merchant, hereinafter called the party of the first part\nand\nCampbell River Lumber Company Limited, a company duly incorporated under the \"Joint Stock Companies Act\" of the province of British Clumbia, and with its head office at White Rock in the said province.\nWhereas the said Albert McKillop is the owner of 800 shares of the capital stock of the North American Lumber Co. a corporation duly incorporated under the laws of the State of Maine and with its head office at the city of Portland in the said state of Maine, of the par value of $100.00 per share, and the said Albert McKillop has agreed to sell the same to the party of the second part and the said party of the second part pursuant to a resolution of the Directors thereof has agreed to purchase the same,\nNow this indenture witnesseth that the said Albert McKillop for and in consideration of the sum of one dollar of lawful money of Canada to him paid this day by the party of the second part (the receipt whereof is hereby acknowledged) agrees to sell to the party of the second part the eight hundred shares of the capital stock of the said North American Lumber Company and the said party of the second part agrees to purchase the same and pay therefore the sum of eighty-five thousand ($85,000) dollars within four years from the date of this indenture with interest thereon from this date until paid at the rate of 6 1\/2% per annum, payable half yearly, all payments to be made to the Royal Bank of Canada, east end, to the credit of the said Albert McKillop, and upon completion of the said payments of $85,000.00 and interest as aforesaid the said Albert McKillop agrees to transfer the said stock to the said party of the second part.\nAnd it is further agreed between the parties hereto that the said party of the second part shall not sell, mortgage or dispose in any way of their lumber mill and premises at White Rock, B.C. until the said $85,000.00 and interest shall have been fully paid without the consent in writing of the said Albert McKillop thereto. In testimony whereof the parties hereto have hereunto set their hands and seals the day and year first above written.\nALBERT McKILLOP (Seal)\nCampbell River Lumber Co. Ltd.\nSigned, sealed and delivered in the presence of\n\"N.A. McKinnon,\nH.W. Hunter, Pres.\nF.G. Fox, V. Pres.\nThe appellant having got into financial difficulties after the respondent McKillop had transferred said agreement to the said respondent, McKinnon, and the former had gone as a volunteer to do service in the recent war, some litigation took place in his absence between the assignee of appellant and McKinnon whereby the last named sought a declaration against the estate, but that was dismissed, the court holding, it is said, that the bargain in said agreement was ultra vires the appellant.\nThat case does not seem to me to present the actual case which should have been made, as I view the transaction in light of the history which I have outlined, and hence is not though pleaded along with everything else imaginable as res judicata, actually such, so far as McKillop and said agreements are concerned, as to govern the decision herein.\nIndeed it is hardly argued that it does, but is only faintly suggested.\nWhat is set up by way of argument in appeal may be fairly treated as presenting two legal problems.\nOn the one hand it is said that there was no total failure of consideration and hence no action can lie to recover the consideration.\nThe other branch is that this agreement was but part of a whole transaction involving much else and the doctrine of total failure of consideration is not applicable. With great respect the view taken that on the latter ground the respondent must fail seems obviously to rest upon a failure to grasp the actual situation created by the parties, or rather by the appellant, which was the purchase by it of the respondent's, McKillop's, property at a price named and never departed from by him, and cannot be heard to set up, after contriving all the machinery its officers invented as means of financing and carrying out the bargain made with him for the purchase thereof, to defeat his recovery of the balance of the price agreed upon.\nThe subterfuge appellant resorted to and induced respondent McKillop to assent to, did not prove injurious to Rounds or we should likely have had another aspect presented, certainly not to the credit of the inventor thereof.\nHence nothing herein can turn upon its peculiarities in such a way as to defeat the respondents. Nothing in the scheme or the mode of its execution can change the actual bargain between the parties thereto now concerned herein.\nAll the documents executed were, so far as honestly intended, but a means of securing payment to the respondent McKillop of the balance of the purchase money which is yet due. The covenant by appellant in the said agreement to pay the sum of $85,000 is absolute in terms and still stands good and respondents entitled to recover thereon notwithstanding the obvious incorrect recitals.\nBut it is contended that cannot be because it would be ultra vires the appellant's corporate powers to take shares. So much the worse for it if it entered into a scheme involving the existence of such a power. That scheme was its own and it is now too late to set up such a pretence as means of cheating the respondent McKillop of the balance of his price. Moreover I do not agree that it cannot obtain all the expected benefit of the shares even if it cannot vote as share-holder.\nIt was, I repeat, the clear intention of the parties to secure the balance of the purchase money and the solicitor who drew the agreement having suggested the question of ultra vires was answered by appellant's agent that the appellant had the power.\nHence such a mistake cannot be allowed to frustrate what was the actual purpose of the parties.\nI agree with the contention of the appellant that this agreement was only part of the whole. The pretence of want of power in the appellant to carry out the ultimate intention of the parties reminds one of the analogous pretence set up in the case of Brown v. Moore[3], wherein the majority of this court held that such pretence should not avail and against the judgment so declared the pretending party sought leave to appeal to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, but was refused leave.\nThe foregoing was, together with my conclusion that the appeal herein should be dismissed with costs, and cross appeal allowed with costs, written last June shortly after argument. I was surprised to learn, some three months later, that the majority of the court had agreed to allow the appeal on the ground of the illegality of the conduct of appellant's officers in inducing Rounds to believe that the lowest price respondents would take was $230,000, instead of $165,000, and, which I am unable to understand, so tainted the later dealing now in question as to render it impossible for the respondents, or either of them, to recover. Such a defence was not pleaded, nor, so far as I can see, argued, either at the trial or in the Court of Appeal; or before us, if my memory serves me.\nThe appellant's factum, which relates the facts in the way it contends they are, incidentally thereto refers to some of the history of the rise in purchase price but not in any way does it make the point now made by the majority of this court.\nI, most respectfully, therefore, submit such a view should not now be entertained.\nThe erroneous allegation that all these agreements were in fact one, has been the source of much confusion.\nIt is not correct. It is correct that all three in a sense arise out of the same subject matter, but the actual consideration involved in each is not the same. And the taint that may have existed in the consideration of the agreement with Rounds, cannot extend to the future of any dealing with the fruits or resultant assets derived therefrom.\nWe must bear in mind that the learned trial judge expressly and decidedly accepted in its entirety the evidence of respondent McKillop and his story is that he assented to the part he took in the bargain with Rounds on the distinct understanding that he was not to have any stock given him as part of the price; that the sixty-five thousand dollars of the cash to be got from Rounds was to be handed over to the appellant upon a mortgage for that amount being given by it to McKillop upon the appellant's mill.\nThat was the basis upon which the parties worked pending the closing of the deal with Rounds which, as already stated, took place on the 31st of March, and results turned over by him on the 3rd of April to the appellant on terms agreed to between them and with which he had nothing to do and was no party to. Three weeks or more later, on the 24th April, the appellant, by a separate and different transaction entirely, was induced to abandon his right to a mortgage, as promised on appellant's mill, and to give the $65,000 he held of the cash to appellant in consideration of the agreement sued on.\nThe appellant's officers and counsel sometimes seem to me to try to make out that the $65,000 was paid before the new agreements, respectively between the appellant and Rounds, and between appellant and respondent McKillop now in question, but fortunately respondent McKillop was able conclusively to prove by the production of the cheques making such payments of the said sum, that they were paid after the deal between appellant and Rounds had been closed on the 3rd of April; one for $15,000 on the 14th of April, apparently pending negotiations for the abandonment of the right to a mortgage; and the other for $39,939.00, after the agreement now in question was executed.\nThe balance apparently was accounted for by a transfer of a cheque given by them to Rounds and handed back by McKillop to the appellant.\nIn lieu of all these the abortive sale of the stock to the appellant was substituted, and that has failed on the ground of its being ultra vires and hence a complete failure of consideration.\nHow then can it be said this collateral or supplemental contract is tainted with any illegality of which Rounds alone could complain?\nIt was a quite independent contract with which he had nothing to do and could not have complained of in any way. He alone could have complained of the imposition practiced upon him, and he has neither done so nor been injured in any way, but, on the contrary, got a bonus out of his dealing.\nIn short, he has got (what he wanted) rid of his stock as he desired, at a price, I suspect, far beyond its value; and succeeded in helping the boys (as he expressed it) to finance the deal, which were his two objects.\nSo long as he acquiesed in the results no one else has a right to complain.\nThis is not a case of contravention of a statute in which resultant contracts in the promotion of an illegal purpose might be such as to render it the duty of the court to intervene, even if the parties concerned should refrain from pleading its violation.\nAs to the merits of the case as between the parties hereto, I imagine that if respondents had found the stock to be double the estimated value instead of only 25% thereof, and had attempted to hold on to it as their own, in disregard of their duties as trustees, and retain also the cash got, we would have heard some exclamations of surprise if told the law such as about to be declared.\nI submit, most respectfully, that is not the law, and that the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nA cross-appeal is taken by respondents as to interest disallowed below. I cannot help thinking that the actual terms of the above agreement, as well as what led up to it, overcome the objection taken below, and that interest was specifically agreed upon. And hence I think that the cross-appeal should be allowed and interest added to the $65,000.00 at 6 1\/2%, in accordance with the terms of the agreement. DUFF J.\u2014In 1914 the plaintiff, McKillop, was the holder of certain timber licences in which his co-plaintiff McKinnon had some interest and which they wished to sell at the price of $165,000. Through Hunter and Fox, who may be considered as the owners of the capital stock of the appellant company, McKillop had negotiations with the company with a view to a sale. The company was not financially in a position to purchase on the terms upon which McKillop was willing to sell; but a relative of Hunter by marriage, Rounds, was approached by Hunter and found willing to assist Hunter and Fox by providing the necessary financial assistance to enable the company to acquire the property. With this in view Rounds consented, if the property on examination should be equal to expectations, to become (as he ultimately became) intermediary in an arrangement by which he should purchase from McKillop and in turn sell the property to the company for the same price but upon terms suitable to the company's position\u2014substantially upon the condition that the purchase price should be paid out of the proceeds of the timber as sold.\nTwo features of the arrangement in which Rounds was willing to participate and which was substantially put into effect are of capital importance. Rounds was interested in a lumber concern in Maine, The North American Lumber Co., and held shares in it of the nominal value of $80,000 and it was a condition of Rounds' participation as well as an inducement that in the purchase from McKillop, these shares should be accepted approximately at their face value. The other feature was this. Hunter and Fox, pressed by the embarrassments of very limited working capital, conceived the idea that Rounds should pay $230,000 for the property and that they should exact from McKillop a cash payment of $65,000 as their remuneration for bringing about the sale. McKillop eventually agreed to the proposal that the shares should be accepted as part payment of the purchase money to the extent of $85,000 on the understanding that he should be satisfactorily protected against the risk of loss by the shares proving to be worth less than that sum and he at the same time agreed to pay to the company out of the purchase money the commission excated by Hunter and Fox.\nRounds believed that McKillop's price was $230,000. This he was told by Hunter and Fox and their statement was confirmed explicitly by McKillop. He was in truth kept in ignorance both of the fact that a substantial part of the cash he handed to McKillop ($100,000) was in turn to be passed over to Hunter and Fox and of the fact that the shares which he supposed he was disposing of to McKillop were to be taken off McKillop's hands by the company. Both facts were from the business point of view of the most obvious materiality. The timber was Rounds' security; he was virtually advancing for the benefit of Hunter and Fox the sum of $230,000 in the belief that this was the price that was demanded for it, when in truth the owners were willing to sell and in fact were selling it for $165,000. The borrower (virtually from his point of view the transaction was an advance) was at the same time assuming a contingent obligation of $85,000 of which he was not informed.\nIt is impossible, I find, to acquit McKillop of complicity in the manoeuvres of Hunter and Fox. He admits that he assured Rounds in express terms that his price was $230,000 while at the request of Hunter he carefully avoided any reference to the collat- eral arrangements. Further he did this after being informed by Hunter that knowledge of the facts on Rounds' part would be disastrous to their plans. He says, indeed, that he protested, thinking their conduct was \"not straight\" but played his part in the plot under the belief that Rounds would suffer no detriment.\nI do not in the least doubt that McKillop's assent to the sale was procured by the promise that he would be satisfactorily secured in relation to that part of the purchase money which was represented by the shares; and that he was to be indemnified fully in respect of any difference between the sum named ($85,000) and their actual selling value when he came to realize upon them; that is made very plain and indeed is overwhelmingly established by the admissions of Hunter and Fox.\nWere it not that the respondents have disqualified themselves from maintaining this action by their co-operation in the machinations of Hunter and Fox there would, I think, be no difficulty whatever in sustaining the judgment in their favour. It is really not disputed that an undertaking was given to them in consideration of the sale and of the payment to the appellant company of its share of the proceeds that they should receive, after all deductions were made, the sum of $165,000 as their purchase price. Their acceptance of the shares was only a temporary measure; it was distinctly understood that they were to be relieved of the shares and the sum of $85,000 with interest substituted for them. This I say is not disputed, the agreement prepared by Mr. Carter took the form of a sale because for some reason which I cannot profess to understand he supposed the company to be incapable of binding itself in the manner the parties intended. The execution of that document is no obstacle in the way of the respondents; it has been conclusively held as between the parties to be inoperative. It was not an instrument executed by the company and consequently as a bilateral instrument it can have no effect whatever. Nor is the judgment in the action in which the respondents sought to enforce that instrument an obstacle. There is no estoppel because the cause of action arising under the actual oral agreement is not the cause of action asserted in the action in which judgment was given. That was an action brought upon the supposed written agreement. In that action evidence proving the oral agreement would not have been admissible. In form therefore the two causes of action are not the same nor are they the same in substance. The former action was an action upon an agreement held to be ultra vires; the oral undertaking deposed to was certainly not ultra vires and the proposition that the oral undertaking was within the powers of the company is in no way inconsistent with the allegation affirmed by the former judgment, namely, that the agreement embodied in the writing sued upon was beyond their powers.\nBut there is a fatal obstacle to the respondent's success in the action. Look at the whole transaction from any point of view and it is impossible to escape the hard fact that it all hinged upon getting Rounds to pay to McKillop and McKinnon $65,000 more than McKillop and McKinnon were to receive as the selling price of the property and getting him to do this under the belief that he was paying the vendors their price and nothing more than their price. In order to accomplish this there was the agreement which was actually executed that the parties to this litigation should co-operate in the deception of Rounds. The case is within the principle that the courts will not enforce an agreement involving the perpetration of a fraud such, for example, as an agreement forming part of a scheme for promoting a company in which the object of the promoters is to defraud the shareholders. Begbie v. Phosphate Sewage Co.[4]. An apt illustration of the principle is to be found in the decision of the Court of King's Bench in Jackson v. Duchaire[5]. There the defendant had applied to his friend to advance certain moneys, the price of goods which he intended to buy of the plaintiff. The friend arranged with the plaintiff for the sale and paid the sum agreed upon. Secretly it was agreed between the plaintiff and the defendant that the defendant should pay an additional sum. This last agreement the court refused to give effect to as a fraud upon the third party whose intention, known to all parties, was to relieve the defendant from paying any part of the price.\nThe facts disclosed in the present appeal shew a state of circumstances in which all parties would naturally, on the assumption that they were acting honestly with one another give and expect to recieve the fullest disclosure with regard to the character of the transaction. Rounds no doubt had a monetary interest to serve in the transaction as he desired to dispose of his shares; but one of his actuating motives unquestionably was the desire to assist his relative; and he would naturally expect, and this was quite understood by McKillop as well as by Hunter and Fox, to be dealt with in a manner befitting the circumstances and character of his intervention in the business. All parties fully realized that in the concealment of the facts concerning the collateral dealings in relation to the shares and to the purchase money Rounds was misled in a manner savouring of dishonesty though no doubt they all fully believed that in the end Rounds would lose nothing. It is impossible to escape the conclusion that the parties united to commit a fraud upon Rounds, a fraud which at Rounds' instance would have nullified the whole transaction. That being so, it follows that the company's undertaking with regard to the shares which was integral part of the entire transaction and was given in consideration in part at least of McKillop's undertaking to divide the price with the company is an unenforceable undertaking.\nI have very carefully considered the question whether it is possible to separate this undertaking from the rest of the transaction but, as intimated above, I am forced to a negative conclusion. Had the agreement drawn by Mr. Carter been operative it, is possible that the sale might have been enforced on the principle of the Odessa Tramways Co. v. Mendel[6]; but as the respondents must rely upon the oral agreement it is essential to their case to prove the consideration for it which necessitates examining its relation to the transaction as a whole. It is at least gravely questionable whether the respondent can support the judgment on the ground that the consideration has wholly failed for the payment of the moneys they seek to recover; but it does not improve their position to put their claim in that form. In substance they are seeking to enforce the agreement that they were to receive no less than $165,000 as the net selling price of their property. See Begbie v. Phosphate Sewage Co.[7].\nThe appeal must be allowed. ANGLIN J.\u2014I have had the advantage of reading the opinion of my brother Duff.\nWith some regret because in the deception practised on Rounds the directors of the defendant company, Hunter and Fox, were in my opinion distinctly more culpable than the plaintiff McKillop, I have come to the conclusion that the transaction out of which the plaintiffs' claim arises is so infected with fraud, in which McKillop participated, that this action cannot succeed. Whether that transaction should be regarded as evidenced exclusively by the instrument prepared by Mr. Carter and as involving the taking over of the shares in the North American Lumber Co. by the defendant company, or should be deemed open to proof in the somewhat different terms of the oral testimony, including an undertaking that the plaintiff McKillop would be indemnified against loss in respect of these shares if their value should prove to be less than the $85,000 at which he accepted them from Rounds on account of the purchase price of the timber, the contamination by fraud is the same. The payment of $65,000 by McKillop to the defendant company and its undertaking either to take over the North American Lumber Co. shares or to indemnify him against loss in respect thereof cannot be segregated from the purchase of McKillop's timber by Rounds at the price of $230,000. It was all one scheme\u2014all one transaction\u2014and the fraudulent taint affects every element of it.\nAlthough McKillop, Hunter and Fox all believed that Rounds would ultimately sustain no loss\u2014as proved to be the fact\u2014he was none the less induced by the misrepresentation to which they were all privy, that McKillop's price for his timber amounted to $65,000 more than it actually was, to assume the risk that the moneys which the defendant company would realize out of the sale of that timber would be sufficient to enable it to repay his advances.\nI incline to think that the defence that the failure of consideration alleged as its basis was partial only would also be fatal to the plaintiff's claim. I deem it better, however, to rest my judgment on the effect of the deceit practised on Rounds.\nFor these reasons I am, with respect, of the opinion that the judgment dismissing this action was well founded and should be restored.\nBRODEUR J.\u2014I am of the opinion that this appeal should be allowed and I concur with my brother Duff.\nMIGNAULT J.\u2014A brief statement of the facts in this case will naturally lead up to the conclusion I have adopted.\nThe respondents held certain timber rights of which they were anxious to dispose and their last price was $165,000 on which they required a substantial payment to be made in cash. They stated this price to one Harold W. Hunter and to one F. G. Fox, respectively president and vice-president of the appellant company, who were very desirous of purchasing these timber rights for the company, but the latter, being financially embarrassed, could not make the cash payment required and could only purchase the timber on a logging basis, which the respondents would not accept. Hunter appears to have been an adroit and certainly not over scrupulous schemer, and in effect told the respondents that he could get a relative of his to purchase the timber and re-sell it to the company on easy terms. But this relative was to pay $230,000 instead of $165,000, the respondent's price, and the respondents were told by Hunter that as part of this price they would have to accept, as cash for $90,000, eight hundred shares of the North American Lumber Company (a Maine corporation) of the par value of $80,000. The respondents demurred at this, saying that they wanted money and not shares, but Hunter told them that the deal could not otherwise be carried through. And he added that his company would agree to purchase the shares from the respondents in four years for $85,000 (the difference, $5,000, Hunter was to apply to pay the commission of the agent who had brought the parties together) at six and one-half per cent interest, and would give a mortgage on its mills to secure the payment of the $85,000 and interest. Although the purchase price for the sale proposed by Hunter was to be $230,000, the respondents were not to receive more than their own price, $165,000; the difference, $65,000, they were to hand over to the appellant company. To carry out this transaction Hunter went to Kansas and returned with one Rounds, an uncle of his wife, but he cautioned the respondents against letting Rounds know that their price was only $165,000, whereas he was being made to pay $230,000, adding that if Rounds ever found it out both he and Fox would go to jail. The respondents weakly consented to this scheme, which was a palpable fraud on Rounds, relying on getting rid of the stock which Rounds insisted they should accept as part of the purchase price by selling it to the appellant company. And when Rounds stated that he understood that their price was $230,000, McKillop replied that it was the price that had been arranged.\nBy a first agreement dated March 31st, 1914, the respondents, acting by Albert McKillop, sold the timber rights to Rounds for $230,000 of which $100,000 was paid in cash or equivalent, $90,000 in the shares of the North American Lumber Company, and the balance $40,000 Rounds was to pay within five years.\nBy a second agreement of April 3rd, 1914, Rounds agreed to sell these timber rights to the appellant company for $180,000, which was to be paid within a term of years on a logging basis, and for $40,000 which was to be paid by the assumption of the payment of the like sum to the respondents for the balance of price due to them by Rounds. The latter was also to receive a bonus on the lumber cut by the appellant company.\nI have said that Hunter had promised the respondents to give them a mortgage on the company's mills to secure the payment of the shares which the company was to take over from the respondents at the price of $85,000. Subsequently he represented to McKillop, with whom he dealt, that to grant a mortgage on the mills would injure the company's credit, and he proposed instead that the company should guarantee to the respondents the value of the shares, and McKillop allowed himself to be persuaded to accept this change in Hunter's proposal. With matters in this state, McKillop, Hunter and Fox went to a solicitor in Vancouver, Mr. Carter, to have an agreement drafted and signed. Mr. Carter inquired whether the appellant company had the power to purchase the shares of another company and was assured that this was all right. He, however, raised the objection that even if the company could purchase the shares, it might not have the power to guarantee their value, and McKillop thereupon consented to accept a straight agreement to purchase the shares, without any guarantee of their value, but with a stipulation that the company would not mortgage its property until the $85,000 was paid, and this third agreement whereby the company undertook to purchase these shares within four years for $85,000, with interest at six and a half per cent, was signed by McKillop and by the company acting by Hunter and Fox on April 24th, 1914.\nAfter this last agreement, McKillop, who had previously paid over a portion of the $65,000 to the company, completed the full payment, so that the respondents had received $100,000 in cash or equivalent, the obligation of Rounds to pay them $40,000 and the 800 shares of the North American Lumber Company, accepted for $90,000, and which the appellant company was to take over from them for $85,000, and they had paid to the appellant company $65,000. This left them in money $140,000, less $65,000, to wit $75,000, and in order to get their full price of $165,000, less the $5,000 commission, they relied on the promise of the appellant company to take over for $85,000 the shares they had received from Rounds.\nBut it turned out that the appellant company had not the power to make this promise or to purchase these shares, and this was determined in a previous suit between the parties. As a consequence, the appellant company has the $65,000 it had received from the respondents and it has the timber rights sold to it by Rounds whom it has now fully paid. The respondents have $75,000 in money and the shares which are testified to be now worth only 25 per cent of their face value, and they cannot force the appellant to take and pay for these shares.\nUnder these circumstances, the respondents seek in this action to recover from the appellant company the $65,000 paid to it, placing their case on the basis of a total failure of consideration for the agreement of the appellant company to purchase the shares. But it must be observed that the payment of the $65,000 was in no wise the consideration of the agreement to purchase the shares. McKillop admits in his testimony that there was but one transaction carried out by means of the three agreements I have mentioned. It may well be that McKillop would not have paid the $65,000 to the company had he not relied on its promise to take over the shares he had unwillingly accepted from Rounds and to pay $85,000 therefor. But I am forced to the conclusion that the real transaction between the parties was that the respondents would agree to make Rounds pay for the timber rights $65,000 more than their price and hand over this money to the company whose officers, Hunter and Fox, had practised this fraud on Rounds. And as to the shares, the respondents had accepted them from Rounds as representing $90,000 in money, and these shares were to be purchased by the appellant for $85,000. It is true that the respondents are now saddled with these shares, and cannot force the appellant to take them off their hands, but this is because they made an ultra vires contract with the company, for which they are surely to blame, for they should have obtained their solicitor's advice as to the appellant's right to purchase the shares, the more so as Mr. Carter put them a question which he would have no doubt solved for himself had not his clients assured him that there was no doubt as to the company's power to hold the shares of another company. It is impossible for me to think for a moment that there was a failure, total or otherwise, of consideration for the transaction between the parties, which was one transaction carried out by three agreements, and had not one of these agreements been void this controversy would probably not have arisen. And I must find that in truth and in fact a fraud was practised upon an innocent purchaser who was induced to pay, over and above the real selling price of the respondents, this sum of $65,000, which McKillop handed over to the instigators and perpetrators of this fraud. I cannot come to the conclusion that because one of the agreements entered into to carry out this fraudulent design is now found to be ultra vires, the respondents can recover the illegal premium which they exacted from Rounds and paid to the company. And as I am clearly of opinion that they cannot place their case on the basis of a total failure of consideration, but that they allowed themselves to be drawn into a fraudulent transaction at the suggestion of Hunter and Fox, my conclusion is that this Court should not assist the respondents in their attempt to recover a sum which they should never have demanded from Rounds and which they paid over to the appellant company merely, as I must hold, in furtherance of the fraudulent scheme concocted by Hunter and Fox.\nI would allow the appeal and restore the judgment dismissing the respondents' action, but in my opinion, and speaking for myself alone, in view of the fraudulent character of the transaction, there should be no costs either here or in the court below.\nThe cross appeal of the respondents against the refusal of the Court of Appeal to grant them interest must of course be dismissed, but I would grant no costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nCross-appeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Mayers, Stockton & Smith.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Martin & Murray.\n[1] [1922] 2 W.W.R. 549, 556.\n[2] [1922] 2 W.W.R. 549, 556.\n[3] 62 Can.

Anglin and Mignault JJ. dissenting.\nIf a valuation roll has been made within the powers of a municipal corporation and in the absence of fraud, the party assessed cannot invoke the supervising control given to the Superior Court (Art. 50 C.P.C.) in order to set aside the roll, when other relief is provided by way of appeal to the Circuit Court. Anglin and Mignault JJ. dissenting.\nPer Anglin and Mignault JJ. (dissenting).\u2014As the overvaluation constituted such an illegality that it must be considered as an absolute nullity ab initio, the Superior Court has jurisdiction to annul the roll under the authority of Art. 50 C.P.C. Per Davies C.J. and Brodeur J.\u2014Moreover, the respondent's right to take a direct action before the Superior Court, if existing, would have been prescribed, as not having been exercised within three months from the date the roll had been in force. (Art. 5624 R.S.Q. (1909)). Anglin and Mignault JJ. contra.\nPer Duff j.\u2014Although article 5696 R.S.Q. (1909) expressly provides that taxable property shall be assessed \"according to its real value,\" a departure from this statutory mandate does not constitute legal incompetency rendering the acts of the corporation ultra vires and ab initio null, as the statutory law provides a means for complaining against such a valuation and correcting it.\nJudgment of the Court of King's Bench (Q.R. 32 KB. 520) reversed, Anglin and Mignault JJ. dissenting.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King's Bench, appeal side, Province of Quebec[1], affirming the judgment of the Superior Court, Maclennan J., and maintaining the respondent's action.\nThe appellant had instituted a suit, on the 18th of September, 1917, in the Superior Court, to recover from the respondent the taxes in arrear for the years 1913, 1914, 1915 and 1916, making, with interest thereon, the sum of $9,697.60. On the 20th of February, 1920, the respondent instituted the present action whereby it seeks to have the first action joined and that the assessment rolls and collection rolls for the years 1913, 1914, 1915, 1916, 1918 and 1919 be held illegal, irregular, null, ultra vires, quashed and annulled. At the trial, the case as to the rolls for the years 1913 and 1914 was abandoned, as the taxes for these years had been prescribed. For the year 1917 the respondent had taken an appeal to the Circuit Court against the valuation roll and had succeeded in obtaining a reduction of the valuation.\n(1) Reporter's Note.\u2014Special leave to appeal to the Privy Council was granted, December 8th, 1922. L. E. Beaulieu K.C. for the appellant. The valuation of the respondent's property was not excessive.\nAssuming that the property was over-valued, the respondent having neglected to avail itself, within the time prescribed, of the statutory remedy by way of appeal to the Circuit Court, was debarred from complaining by way of a direct action before the Superior Court under Art. 50 C.P.C. Bain v. City of Montreal[2]; Municipality of Macleod v. Campbell[3].\nRespondent's only available remedy was the setting aside of the collection rolls as regards its own property.\nG. H. Montgomery K.C. and A. Mailhiot K.C. for the respondent. The finding of fact as to overvaluation is unanimous in the courts below.\nThe collection rolls are ultra vires and in violation of 5 Geo. V., c. 109, s. 28; and further as resting upon valuation rolls themselves ultra vires and made in violation of Art. 5696 R.S.Q. (1909).\nL. E. Beaulieu K.C. for the appellant.\nG. H. Montgomery K.C. and A. Mailhiot K.C. for the respondent.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014I am of the opinion that this appeal should be allowed with costs here and in the Court of King's Bench and the action dismissed with costs.\nHad I been able, as one of my colleagues has, to reach the conclusion that the valuation of the plaintiff's lands in question for the years 1915, 1916, 1918 and 1919 were merely \"fictitious valuations\" and fraudulent exercises of the power to make assessments conferred on the assessors, I might have reached the conclusion that the Superior Court had the power, under Art. 50 C.P.C. to set them aside as void and illegal.\nBut I have not, on the record before me, been able to reach any such conclusion. On the contrary, I think such valuations were made honestly and without fraud in the light of the boom which existed with regard to lands within the municipality of St. Michel during the years mentioned, and before that boom had actually, as it is said, \"burst.\"\nA long experience in this court in dealing with the \"real value\" of lands in towns and municipalities where a boom in land prices had existed has taught me how difficult it is to reach a conclusion of what the \"real value\" is. Experts giving their evidence on the question differed widely and their various opinions were reflected frequently in the opinions of the several courts called upon to review the assessments made by those whose duty it was in the first instance to make them. These differences of opinion were very pronounced and very great and convinced me that it is difficult indeed during the existence of boom periods, and before the boom has \"burst\" to reach anything like a unanimous opinion.\nIn the case now before us I think it fair, on the facts, to conclude that notwithstanding an appeal was made successfully by the plaintiffs in one year, 1917, to reduce the valuation in that year; and as in each and all the years 1915, 1916, 1918 and 1919 no action at all was taken by the plaintiff's respondents to call the valuations for those years in question, they may well be held to have acquiesced in those valuations on the ground that it would or might assist them in selling their lots to prospective purchasers at a very high figure.\nHowever that may be the facts are that in all those years, and until the present action was taken, no steps at all were taken by the plaintiff respondent to appeal from the valuations or to call in question the fairness or unfairness of these valuations. The law has provided a very simple method of their doing so, first, by an appeal to the municipal council and then from the determination of that body to the Circuit Court whose judgment was to be final and binding. As I have said, no such appeal was ever taken in the years I have mentioned.\nSubject to what I have said in the foregoing reasons, I think the Superior Court had no power under art. 50 C.P.C. to entertain the plaintiff respondents' application to set aside the valuations.\nI concur generally in the reasons and conclusions of Brodeur J.\nIdington J.\u2014The respondent is the owner of a farm of nearly eighty acres which was subdivided, in 1913 or thereabouts, into lots each of about a tenth of an acre in size and possibly by reason of the subdivision having proved an unprofitable venture, for only some thirty lots were sold, the tenant who had long carried on the farm has been induced to continue farming there despite the subdivision.\nThe market value of the property seems to have increased so rapidly for some years that from haying been bought in July 1911 for the price of $1,000 per arpent, it passed to the respondent in May, 1914, for the price of $2,200 per arpent\nThe assessor or succession of assessors seem to have been induced thereby, and by the price list of the respondent, to raise the assessed value of the whole to the total sum of $528,104.00, in the years 1915, 1916, 1917 and 1918.\nThe respondent never, until 1917, took any of the regular and proper steps provided by statute for complaining against over assessment. In 1917 it did take some steps provided, but what is not clear, for there is nothing relative thereto presented in the case before us, save a certificate of judgment in the Circuit Court, whereby it appears that the learned judge had reduced the assessment to $500.00 per arpent.\nAs the result of that it is argued that the said assessors should have adopted that very low figure for the rolls of 1918 and 1919.\nA very obvious answer seems to be that, as to 1918, the roll probably was completed by the assessors before the 9th July, 1918, when that judgment was delivered.\nI am unable to say why, under such circumstances, the respondent did not avail itself of the means provided by law for appealing to the court of revision for the roll was not homologated until the 11th September, 1918.\nThe assessment roll of the assessor for 1919 fixed the entire valuation of said property for that year at $347,578. The respondent does not seem to have taken any appeal against that assessment.\nThe appellant had instituted a suit on the 18th of September, 1917, in the Superior Court, to recover from respondent the taxes in arrear for the years 1913, 1914, 1915 and 1916, making, with interest thereon, the sum of $9,697.60.\nOn the 20th February, 1920, the respondent instituted this action whereby it seeks to have said action lastly referred to joined and that the assessment rolls and collection rolls for the year 1913, 1914, 1915, 1916, 1918 and 1919, be held illegal, irregular and null, ultra vires, and be quashed and annulled.\nWhen the case came before Mr. Justice Maclennan for trial in the Superior Court, the case as to the rolls for the years 1913 and 1914, was abandoned, and after hearing the evidence adduced, he maintained the action and adjudged and declared that the valuation and collection rolls of the defendant, appellant, for the years 1915, 1916, 1918 and 1919 are, and each of them is and always has been illegal, irregular, null and ultra vires and are set aside and annulled.\nUpon appeal therefrom the Court of King's Bench by a majority upheld the said judgment in its entirety, though Mr. Justice Guerin, one of that majority, seems to have had some doubts as to going further than dealing with the claim of partial exemption of the respondent, by reason of the lands in question being farm lands.\nThe said courts seem, as to the facts, to found said judgments upon the excessive valuation by the assessor and as to the law upon the power given by article 50 of the Code of Procedure.\nAs to the facts I cannot, after a perusal of the entire evidence, agree that there is therein anything to support such a drastic judgment which if upheld must lead to great confusion; indeed so great as probably to require legislation to carry on the affairs of the appellant as is intimated by the learned Chief Justice.\nI, with respect, cannot agree that the article 50 of the Code of Civil Procedure, which reads as follows\n50.\u2014Excepting the Court of King's Bench, all courts, circuit judges and magistrates, and all other persons and bodies politic and corporate, within the province, are subject to the superintending and reforming power, order and control of the Superior Court and of the judges thereof in such manner and form as by law provided,\napplies where there is a specific power given elsewhere, in the statutes relevant to the subject matter involved, supplying an adequate remedy, and indeed evidently intended to be the only remedy to rectify any wrong doing on the part of the assessor of a municipal corporation in the way of under or over valuation. I cannot think that in such like cases resort to this article was ever intended, unless possibly in the cases of actual fraud or ultra vires.\nAnd especially would that seem to be the case when, as here, the roll is declared binding when homologated, presumably after hearing any appeals tendered, as they were in some other cases, and the more so when that homologated roll in turn seems to be subject to an appeal to the Circuit Court.\nI cannot help thinking that this specific code, as it were, eliminates any ground for the interference of the Superior Court under Art. 50, unless in the possible exceptions I have referred to, and by no means do I hold that these exceptions either in law or fact apply to such a case as presented herein.\nThere is no evidence herein to support any charge of fraud relative to the assessment of respondent's property, much less that the whole of these rolls as to every ratepayer were fraudulent. Indeed fraud is not seriously argued. Illegality may cover that or, in a sense, over or under assessment.\nI will deal presently with the other of said possible exceptions confining myself to the only one that appears herein arguable on the facts.\nI find the cases relied upon by the court below and counsel before us are as follows:\u2014\nThe case of La Corporation Archi\u00e9piscopale Catholique de St. Boniface v. The Town of Transcona[4], was an ordinary appeal to us from the courts below in due course of executing the specific remedy given for just such cases as presented here, If that course had been followed herein, possibly the essence of all involved might have come here if not duly and properly settled by the court of last resort in the province.\nLa Compagnie d'Approvisionnement d'Eau v. La Ville de Montmagny[5]; Rivard v. Corporation de Wickham[6], are, so far as I can see, the only cases in which the court below has ever acted upon such ground as exists herein.\nIn the former case the course of events was rather provoking, for the party aggrieved pursued his specific remedies without desirable results, but that furnishes no foundation for the assertion of a jurisdiction which a court has not.\nIn the latter case the reasoning in the judgment of Pouliot J., who dismissed the application and rested upon a long line of authorities followed up to that time, has my assent as correct.\nAnd when we come to the case of Laberge v. La Cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al[7], we find another basis of right asserted by the appellant, namely the general exemption. In joining in that judgment the late Mr. Justice Cross expressly excludes the case of a mere error in the amount of assessment, and rests his judgment upon the case therein presented of partial exemption created by a statutory provision for a term of years which seems to have arisen out of circumstances very similar to those which gave rise to the partial exemption in question herein.\nThese three cases being all so recent as five or six years before the respondent launched this case, and no prior decisions expressly in point having been cited, has induced me to try and trace, if possible, any previous exercise of the power asserted in them, but I have been unable to find any. I find many cases asserting authority over municipal corporations in many ways, by virtue of said article 50 C.P.C., reaching back for fifty years or more, but nothing analogous to what is involved in that presented by this appeal.\nThe excessive valuation in question herein reminds me of a recent case before us in which judicial authorities passing upon valuation by assessors of a certain property in a city suffering from the same causes as appellant, were found to differ as much as four or five times in regard to the value to be placed upon a certain property.\nOne court thought one hundred dollars an acre excessive, and another thought four or five hundred dollars an acre was not.\nI cannot, for my part, accept such excessive valuations even if they are the aftermath of a mad race in speculation.\nBut it comes with an ill grace, I submit, on the part of those who have done their part to develop the situation, to refrain from discharging the duty of trying to rectify the results apparent in the assessor's roll year after year and then seeking to overturn the whole basis of the financial structure upon which the affairs of the municipality rest.\nI do not think, even if the supervising jurisdiction of the courts could be extended so far, it should be exercised under such circumstances as presented.\nUnless in the cases of fraud or what falls properly within the ultra vires rule, no relief should, I submit, be given to suitors so acting, for in such cases a wise discretion may be properly exercised. However all that may be, I still adhere to the principles upon which we proceeded in the case of Municipality of Macleod v. Campbell[8], cited in argument herein. In that case I expressed my own view that to hold a mere excess of value an illegality such as to render a roll void is quite impracticable. Indeed it would surprise a great majority of rural municipalities to be told that taxes could not be collected because the assessor had assessed far below the actual value. Yet that is, in strict law, quite as illegal as assessing too high.\nThe doing so in either case does not give rise to any application of the doctrine of ultra vires unless in the case of him entitled to claim an exemption.\nThe duty of him claiming it is to bring the claim before the courts entrusted with the jurisdiction of settling the roll or correcting it.\nBut if he fail to do so I am of the opinion that he can resist the collection of taxes imposed in violation of his exemption and that he does not need such relief as sought herein for his protection.\nThe respondent has, I think, on the evidence before us, shewn it is entitled to be taxed on the basis of such exemption, and can insist thereon without being given any such relief as sought herein.\nI was at first inclined to agree with Mr. Justice Rivard's suggestion in his well considered judgment, if I may be permitted to say so, with which I almost entirely agree, but on reflection I do not think the application of his solution of the problem is necessary herein, though the principle thereof must be observed in determining the amount the appellant is entitled to recover in the suit it has taken.\nI would therefore allow this appeal and dismiss the respondent's action with costs throughout. Duff J.\u2014The-finding of the learned trial judge is in the following words:\nConsidering that the valuation of the plaintiff's property on the basis of over $6,000 per arpent is and was a fictitious valuation far in excess of its actual or real value and the assessors of the defendant in so valuing plaintiff's property proceeded upon a wrong principle and ignored the real or actual value of said property and thereby exceeded the powers given to said assessors and to the said defendant by its charter and by-law.\nI am not quite sure whether the learned judge means that for ulterior purposes the assessors and the municipal council had deliberately combined to assess the property in the municipality at a grossly excessive valuation.\nIf this is the proper construction of the finding then I think the evidence is inadequate to support it. There is nothing to shew that either the assessors or the council were actuated by any specific improper motive, such for example, as that suggested in the pleadings, namely, that the statutory limit of the municipal indebtedness should be illegally elevated. An inference that there was such wrongdoing would necessarily be an inference based upon the conclusion reached by the learned trial judge that the valuation was grossly excessive. I am not sure that in this sense the finding is concurred in by more than one of the learned judges of the Court of King's Bench; but assuming that in this sense there are concurrent findings of two courts I should still be forced to the conclusion from a perusal of the evidence and the reasons that there are no adequate grounds for such a conclusion. The question whether or not there has been such impropriety must always be a very delicate one. We have had in this court a very wide experience of the divergent views which people honestly entertain (valuators and the professional men of unquestioned integrity charged with official responsibilities in the matter of valuation for taxation purposes) as to the proper method in particular circumstances of ascertaining \"actual value;\" and it must be obvious to anybody who gives the matter a moment's thought that the whole subject, both in theory and in practice, is beset with difficulties. The questions, is current price an exclusive test? is a great augmentation or diminution in the number of transactions a merely temporary aberration or the result of factors likely to be permanent? and others of a like nature are questions which may well give officials trying to do their duty the most anxious concern. Everybody knows how tenaciously at the close of a period of inflation people cling to their faith in a restoration of price levels after all legitimate grounds for such faith have disappeared.\nThe respondent's property was in a suburb of Montreal which began to receive the attention of speculators in land as early at least as 1911. Prices had risen with great rapidity and during the years in respect of which the questions agitated in this litigation arise, lands were assessed by the municipality at values based largely upon an estimate made in the years 1913 and 1914. The evidence is that the prices fetched from time to time by sales of small areas formed a starting point from which the valuations were made. It now seems to be quite clear that everybody (the respondent and other speculators and those who purchased lots from them, as well as the officers of the municipality) was over-sanguine and held absurdly extravagant ideas as to the value of the property. But while it may very well be that, as a result of the evidence now offered, the proper conclusion is that $500 an acre was the real value of the property assessed at the rate of $6,000 an acre, it would be quite unfounded to suppose that anybody, the respondent or anybody else, had a suspicion that there was any such disparity between the real value and the assessed value. Indeed property which is now said to have been worth $500 an acre was admittedly sold in 1914 at the price of about $2,500 an acre.\nA circumstance to which I think weight has not been sufficiently attached in the court below is the circumstance that these valuations which are now attacked were not during all these years impeached by the ratepayers affected by them in appeal to the Circuit Court as provided by the statute. The Court of King's Bench, it may be observed, has concurred with the trial judge in setting aside the rolls in toto. They have proceeded, so the respondents argue, upon the assumption that conscious and intentional overvaluation and violation of duty governed the municipal officers in respect of all the valuations in the municipality. No appeal has been taken against these valuations which are now attacked. No evidence was given of such appeals and I assume that the decisions of the Circuit Court are not impugned. It is not only a fair deduction, it is I think the only legitimate inference, that the views of the municipal officers as indicated by the valuation were not grossly inconsistent with the values which would have been ascribed to the properties affected by the general opinion of those most concerned, namely, the owners who by statute were made personally responsible for the payment of taxes. I do not suggest that it would be fair to infer that a particular assessment was always accepted as a perfectly just assessment but the inference is, I think, a plain one that there was no such disparity between the general opinion as to value and the assessment of the properties as in itself would justify the inference that the municipal officers were consciously departing from their duty and improperly fabricating an assessment roll with fictitious valuations for an ulterior improper purpose.\nI repeat, that having read with care the evidence and the reasons given by the learned judges in the court below I see no escape from the conclusion that (if the respondents rightly construe the findings of fact) the consideration which in my opinion is the predominant consideration arising from the undisputed facts of this case is one to which sufficient weight has not been attached. It might be that a case of actual fraud would afford an answer to an action for the recovery of taxes. I desire to make it quite clear that I reserve entirely any question as to the right of the respondents if such a case of actual fraud had been established. I observe only that if such a question were raised it would be necessary to consider whether, by the law of the province of Quebec, a plaintiff who had declined to avail himself of the statutory remedy by way of appeal could lie by for years while all sorts of rights were being created on the faith of the assessment roll and then demand as of right that the roll should be set aside in toto without any sort of excuse or explanation of his quiescence. For the present I give no opinion upon the point, nor upon the question whether a finding of actual fraud such as that suggested might not afford an answer to a claim for the payment of taxes.\nI am, however, unable to say that there is not evidence to support the conclusion of the learned trial judge that the assessors have not observed the principle laid down by the statute, and by that I mean this. I think there is evidence to justify the conclusion that the valuation was so excessive that if competent valuers and a competent municipal council applied their minds to the question of the actual value of the property with anything like a correct appreciation of what is implied in \"actual value\" they would not have made an assessment in the figures actually arrived at. That is a result quite consistent with the assumption of an absence of bad faith. Such being the state of the facts it is convenient first to address oneself to the question whether you have here a case of legal incompetence. The \"Cities and Towns Act,\" secs. 5256 to 5288 includes provisions dealing with the subject of the values and assessments. Secs. 5696, 5707 and 5708 deal with the authority of the assessor and of the council in relation to the valuation roll. To the assessors is committed the duty of assessing the taxable property of the municipality and to the municipality is committed the duty of hearing and deciding all complaints against valuations made by the assessors and to consider whether or not the roll should be maintained or altered, and authority to revise the same whether complained of or not. It is clearly within the authority of the assessors and the council to consider and to decide upon the valuation of property for the purposes of taxation and to record the result in the valuation roll. Now the Act by art. 5696 expressly provides that the taxable property shall be assessed \"according to its real value.\" It is argued that where there is a departure from this statutory mandate there is a case of want of competence, that the acts of the assessor and the council are ultra vires and ab initio null. That is a conclusion to which I cannot agree. All through the law there runs a distinction between incompetent acts and acts which though competent are wrongful or it may be illegal. Where you have authority to do a certain class of acts coupled with a rule prescribing the manner in which the act is to be done or prohibiting the doing of it in a given way, you may always have the question whether the rule imports a limitation of authority; and whether it does or does not import a limitation of authority is a question to be decided on the construction of the instrument creating the authority viewed in light of the circumstances and the object and purpose for which the authority is given. Now it is quite clear that this statute does not treat as a nullity (it is almost too obvious for remark) a valuation which in fact is not based upon the actual value of the property. The statute does not treat it as a nullity because the statute provides a means for complaining against such a valuation and correcting it. First, there is the right to complain before the municipal council and then from the decision of the municipal council there is a right of appeal to the Circuit Court. If the valuation were a nullity there would be nothing upon which either appeal could operate. I think this applies whatever be the circumstances under which the irregular and wrongful valuation is made. Even if it were shewn that an assessor had overvalued property in consequence of corrupt influence I cannot doubt that it would still be open to the municipality to correct the valuation by resorting to the statutory appeal. It is not conclusive of course on the point of competency or no competency to say that such a valuation is not a nullity because an incompetent act may be only relatively null. For the present I am concerned only in making it clear that there is no case of nullity ab initio, and that, I think, is plain. I think it is also quite clear that there is no case of incompetency because it was the duty of the assessor in the first place to enter the valuation in the valuation roll and in the second place it was the duty of the council to revise it; that is the very thing committed to them by statute. If in performing that duty the statutory rule were consciously disregarded that would be an illegality of a very grave kind. If there is incompetence or negligence such that in effect the statutory mandate is disregarded there may be illegality also, but in neither of these cases is there for that reason alone incompetency in the legal sense. I can entertain no doubt that giving due weight to the provisions for correcting wrong and improper valuations it is quite impossible to hold that in any of these cases there is either legal incompetency or nullity ab initio.\nThe point has been the subject of so much discussion that I think it worth while to refer to a single case to shew the view which heretofore has been taken upon this distinction between incompetency and illegality as these words are found embodied in Quebec legislation. In D\u00e9ch\u00e8ne v. City of Montr\u00e9al[9], the Privy Council had to consider a resolution of the corporation of Montreal under sec. 101 of the Montreal charter which authorized the corporation to make an annual appropriation of an amount necessary to meet the expenses of municipal administration during the current year. The self same clause which authorized the appropriation imposed a restriction that such appropriation should never exceed an amount to be ascertained in a manner prescribed by the section. The council of the corporation made an appropriation in excess of the maximum fixed by the section. Proceedings were taken to set aside the resolution and the corporation answered that the proceedings were prescribed in three months by force of a certain statutory provision, sec. 12 of 42-43 Vict., c. 53, which gave to a municipal elector the right in his own name to procure a judicial annullment of municipal proceedings on the ground of illegality and imposed a prescription of three months where the proceeding was within the competence of the corporation. It was contended among other things that the resolution in question being incompetent the prescription did not apply. The promoters of the litigation insisted that the resolution was incompetent at least in so far as the amount of the appropriation exceeded the statutory maximum. By both the Quebec courts and the Judicial Committee it was held that the complaint was a complaint of illegality and not of incompetence. Lord Watson said at p. 644 of the report that the resolution\nwas plainly within their competence, seeing that it exclusively relates to matters committed to the council by statute.\nIn the Court of Queen's Bench Mr. Justice Blanchet, delivering the judgment of the court[10], said:\u2014\nL'appelant a pr\u00e9tendu de plus, que la prescription de trois mois ne s'applique pas au cas actual parcequ'en adoptant sa r\u00e9solution l'intim\u00e9 avait exc\u00e9d\u00e9 sa jurisdiction. L'article suscit\u00e9 de la charte dit, en effet, que le droit de se plaindre sera prescrit par trois mois et que la r\u00e9solution sera tenue pour valide pourvu qu'elle soit de la comp\u00e9tence de la corporation. Il ne faut pas confondre ici la question de pouvoir avec la question de comp\u00e9tence; le conseil avait \u00e9videmment le droit de fixer son budget, en y portant les sommes n\u00e9cessaires pour les d\u00e9penses de l'ann\u00e9e alors prochaine. Ce sujet \u00e9tait enti\u00e8rement de sa comp\u00e9tence. De ce qu'il aurait inclus une somme qu'il n'avait pas le droit d'y mettre, il ne s'en suit pas que la resolution n'est plus de sa comp\u00e9tence. Il y a bien l\u00e0 une ill\u00e9galit\u00e9 qui permettrait au tribunal d'intervenir et de retrancher ce qui est ill\u00e9gal de ce qui est l\u00e9gal, mais non pas de mettre de cot\u00e9 toute la r\u00e9solution. Les ill\u00e9galit\u00e9s ou les irr\u00e9gularit\u00e9s commises \u00e0 ce sujet peuvent \u00eatre attaqu\u00e9es par les contribuables dans les trois mois fix\u00e9s par le statut, \u00e0 l'aide d'un mode sp\u00e9cial de proc\u00e9dure; mais ce d\u00e9lai pass\u00e9, ces derniers sont absolument d\u00e9chus de ce droit. La loi leur a donn\u00e9 un control sommaire et efficace sur les actes de leurs mandataires. Mais, comme il est de l'int\u00e9ret public que les proc\u00e9des des corporations soient, apr\u00e8s un certain temps, tenus pour valides, la l\u00e9gislature a voulu que ce d\u00e9lai une fois expir\u00e9, il en r\u00e9sulte une d\u00e9ch\u00e9ance compl\u00e8te, quant au rem\u00e8de sp\u00e9cial qu'elle fournit, puisqu'elle d\u00e9clare valide et obligatoire tout ce qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait, dans les limites de la comp\u00e9tence du conseil, laissant aux int\u00e9ress\u00e9es le recours ordinaire, aux autres rem\u00e8des qui peuvent exister.\nI come now to article 50 C.P.C. This article is one that confers jurisdiction, a jurisdiction which, by the terms of the article itself, is to be exercised subject to the special provisions of the law. It does not profess to give, and it would be an unwarrantable extension of its purport to read it as giving, an unrestricted and unqualified right to any subject of the realm to require the Superior Court to review the proceedings of public and private corporations; nor can it properly be read as giving to each elector or ratepayer in a municipality without regard to the qualifications and conditions laid down by the statutes dealing with municipal institutions the right to invoke such jurisdiction in relation to the proceedings of the municipality; and I think that where in relation to a given municipal proceeding or even a given class of municipal acts a special recourse is given to a specified class of persons as affording a remedy for error or illegality then the Superior Court, in exercising its jurisdiction under Art. 50, is governed by the conditions and the qualifications attached by law to that right of recourse. At all events I think it is quite clear that where a special remedy is given by statute if that remedy sufficiently appears, either from the express terms of the statute creating it or from the nature of the case, to be intended to be the exclusive remedy for those to whom it is given then the jurisdiction of the Superior Court is limited accordingly. It is not necessary, as I have already said, to consider what the remedy of the aggrieved owner may be in a case of actual fraud and I put that case aside. In all other cases whether the valuation be the result of error of judgment or of negligence or of reckless inattention or incompetence the statutory remedy is, in my judgment, the exclusive remedy unless it be, and that is the point to which I will come in a moment, that a right to impeach the assessment is given under Art. 5591 R.S.Q. I think this follows from a consideration of the nature and objects of the procedure itself. The object is to get a valuation of the taxable property of the community for the purpose of enabling the tax rate for special taxes as well for general municipal taxes to be struck as the school rate. Once the roll is complete, that is to say, once all appeals and complaints provided for by statute have been disposed of, the roll becomes the foundation upon which the levying and the collecting of taxes proceeds. It is also that basis which determines the limit placed by the law upon the municipal indebtedness. Now if it be open to any owner of property who has allowed the roll to be closed without taking advantage of the statutory procedure to complain of excessive valuation it is obvious that a very wide door to uncertainty and confusion is opened up. Cases of fraud being eliminated if an assessment is open to attack upon the ground that the assessor \"has proceeded upon a wrong principle\" it will in practice be a hopeless task to assign a limit to the class of cases which might be entertained by the courts. I think when the legislature provides for the making of a valuation roll and a special procedure for disposing of complaints and then makes the valuation roll the basis of taxation it is implied that all questions of valuation as such are, as between the owner and the municipality, to be considered set at rest when the express statutory remedies made available have been exhausted.\nI come now to Art. 5591. I am disposed to think than an overvaluation or an undervaluation made through sheer negligence in the sense of neglect on the part of the assessors and of the council to give any consideration to the question of actual value might not improperly be described as an instance of \"illegality.\" I do not think, however, that in such a case of improper valuation the remedy given by Art. 5591 is available to an aggrieved owner because his remedy is explicitly provided for by the section of the \"Cities and Towns Act\" already referred to and the operation of 5591 for his benefit is excluded impliedly by those provisions.\nIf I am wrong in this however I concur with my brother Brodeur in thinking, as I have already said, that the complaint preferred is a complaint of illegality rather than incompetency and that in so far as the respondent prefers its complaint qua ratepayer that article applies. The conditions governing proceedings under that article would not, however, affect any right the aggrieved owner might otherwise have to resist a claim for taxes on the ground of fraud nor would non-compliance with such conditions be an answer to a proceeding by the Crown in the public interest on the same ground.\nThere remains the argument based upon the municipal charter, s. 28. This section deals with the subject of taxation rather than the subject of valuation. It can afford no basis for impeaching the assessment roll. Nor do I think it is a ground for impeaching the collector's roll except as an answer to a claim for taxes. The contention now raised will be open to the respondents in answer to such a claim.\nThe appeal should be allowed and the action dismissed with costs.\nAnglin J. (dissenting)\u2014I have had the advantage of reading the carefully prepared opinions of my brothers Brodeur and Mignault. After full consideration of the record, factums and oral argument I am satisfied to accept my brother Mignault's conclusions that the valuations of properties on the impugned assessment rolls were purely fictitious and were made in utter disregard of real value.\nThe case presented is not one merely of excessive valuation, the result of mistake of judgment in endeavouring to exercise the powers conferred by the law. It is a case of flagrant and wilful abuse of those powers for an ulterior purpose. It is not a case of mere irregularity but one of absolute nullity ab initio, resulting from the attempt to do what the statute not only does not permit, but clearly forbids.\nThe evidence fully warrants this view which prevailed in the Superior Court and with a majority of the judges in the Court of King's Bench. On this aspect of the case I cannot usefully add to the opinions of my brother Mignault and of the learned Chief Justice of Quebec and Mr. Justice Martin in the Court of King's Bench.\nI also accept the statement of my learned brother as to the scope and operation of Art. 50 C.C.P. Its purview and the limitations upon its application were stated by the Chief Justice of Quebec in the passages quoted by my brother from his judgment in La Tuque v. Desbiens[11], and were briefly reiterated by Mr. Justice Greenshields in the recent case of Neville v. School Trustees of New Glasgow[12].\nI agree that the remedies afforded by Arts. 5707 and 5715 and by Art. 5591 R.S.Q. are not, under the circumstances of the case, exhaustive, and that the right to invoke Art. 50 C.P.C. remains unaffected by the three months prescription which Art. 5634 R.S.Q. imposes. Where an assessment is void ab initio, the tribunals provided by Arts. 5707 and 5715 have no jurisdiction to deal with it. They can neither amend nor confirm it or give it validity. Toronto Railway Co. v. City of Toronto[13]. No doubt it is in the public interest that ratepayers should ordinarily be restricted to the method prescribed by the \"Cities and Towns Act\" for obtaining redress in cases of over assessment or of irregularities. But this is not an ordinary case; it is a most extraordinary case of deliberate abuse of a statutory power amounting to a fraud upon such power. The supervising control conferred by Art. 50 C.P.C. on the Superior Court is designed to provide for such cases.\nI do not overlook the restrictive words \"in such manner and form as by law provided,\" which are appended to \"the superintending and reforming power, order and control of the Superior Court\" conferred by Art. 50 C.P.C. But those concluding words of the article do not import that resort to it cannot be had wherever a special means of redress of limited scope is afforded by the statute which confers the power the exercise of which the court is asked to supervise\u2014at all events where, as here, it is established that the impugned act was beyond the competence of the corporation. D\u00e9ch\u00e8ne v. La Cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al[14]. No question of the sufficiency of the plaintiffs' interest under Art. 77 C.P.C., such as was dealt with in Robertson v. City of Montreal[15], arises in this case. I cannot assent to the suggestion that in every case of ultra vires action under Art. 50 C.P.C. must be at the instance of the Attorney General.\nThe only serious difficulty that I perceive arises from the plaintiffs' delay in seeking relief, which, it is urged, warrants an inference of acquiescence by them in the assessment of which they complain. But such an inference should not be drawn merely from failure to take advantage of the special means afforded by the \"Cities and Towns Act\" for obtaining relief against irregularities in the preparation of the rolls or in a case of mere overvaluation. If it should, Art. 50 C.P.C. could never be invoked in such cases.\nApart from the failure to proceed either under Arts. 5707 and 5715 or under Art. 5591 I do not find in the record anything to sustain the plea of acquiescence. While high assessments may have tended to improve the plaintiffs' prospects of selling their lots, there is no proof of such collusion on their part as might have amounted to a fin de non recevoir, or have precluded them from averring that the defendant had committed an abuse of its statutory power or a fraud upon it. An absolute nullity does not acquire life and vigour because it is not attacked. Enforcement of it may be successfully resisted when the attempt to enforce it is made. To allow mere delay without proof of collusion or acquiescence to defeat the plaintiffs' demand for action under Art. 50 C.P.C., which neither rests on equitable grounds nor involves the exercise of discretionary power, would be to introduce a prescription for which the law does not provide.\nBut, with respect for the contrary opinion of my learned brother Mignault, I prefer the view, which prevailed in the Court of King's Bench, that the relief to be granted the plaintiffs should not be restricted to avoidance of the assessments of their own properties. Their claim rests on nullity of the assessment roll resulting from the utter disregard of the requirement of the statute that property shall be assessed at its true value (Art. 5696), which the evidence, notably that given by the appellant's secretary-treasurer, Joseph A. Pesant, and by Fran\u00e7ois C. Laberge, shows prevailed generally in the preparation of it by the municipal authorities. Excessive valuation in violation of Art. 5696 renders futile the provision limiting the annual rate of taxation to 2% (Art. 5730 R.S.Q.) La Corporation Archi\u00e9piscopale Catholique Romaine de St Boniface v. The Town of Transcona[16].\nIf the excess in valuation had merely affected the plaintiffs' subdivision I should have had some difficulty in holding that the case did not fall exclusively within Arts. 5707 and 5715, or within Art. 5591 R.S.Q., and that it was not merely a case of mistaken overvaluation. It is because gross overvaluation is shewn by the defendant's plea and by the evidence to have been systematic that a case of flaunting restrictions on a statutory power such as results in absolute nullity has been clearly established. In such a case a plaintiff in my opinion is entitled to invoke the supervising control conferred by Art. 50 C.P.C. As put by Lamothe C.J. in La Tuque v. Desbiens[17],\"c' est l'action populaire.\" The collection rolls, of course, fall with the assessment rolls. I also concur, however, in the view that as to the respondents the collection rolls are invalid because clearly in contravention of Art. 28 of the statute, 5 Geo. V., c. 109.\nI would for these reasons dismiss the appeal with costs.\nBrodeur J.\u2014Par son action institu\u00e9e le 25 f\u00e9vrier 1920, I'intim\u00e9e, la compagnie Shannon Realties, demande que les r\u00f4les d'\u00e9valuation et de perception pour les ann\u00e9es 1915, 1916, 1918 et 1919 qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 homologu\u00e9s par le conseil municipal de la ville de St-Michel soient d\u00e9clar\u00e9s irr\u00e9guliers, ill\u00e9gaux et ultra vires.\nLa ville de St-Michel plaide la l\u00e9galit\u00e9 de ces r\u00f4les et elle all\u00e8gue que la compagnie Shannon y a acquiesc\u00e9 et que cette action est institu\u00e9e trop tard.\nL'action de la compagnie Shannon a \u00e9t\u00e9 maintenue par les tribunaux inf\u00e9rieurs, les honorables juges Allard et Rivard \u00e9tant cependant dissidents en cour d'appel.\nLa ville de St-Michel est r\u00e9gie par la loi des cit\u00e9s et villes (Art. 5256 et suivants, S.R.P.Q. 1909). Elle est aussi r\u00e9gie par une charte sp\u00e9ciale o\u00f9 il est d\u00e9cr\u00e9t\u00e9 que les terres en culture seront tax\u00e9es sur la base d'un quart de la valeur port\u00e9e au r\u00f4le d'\u00e9valuation.\nLes \u00e9valuateurs de la municipalit\u00e9 ont pour les ann\u00e9es en question pr\u00e9par\u00e9 annuellement le r\u00f4le d'\u00e9valuation (art. 5696 S.R.P.Q.). Les avis requis ont \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9s, mais la demanderesse n'a pas jug\u00e9 \u00e0 propos de porter plainte et n'a pas non plus appel\u00e9 \u00e0 la cour de circuit qui avait juridiction, suivant les dispositions des articles 5715 et suivants des statuts refondus de la province de Qu\u00e9bec, pour faire modifier l'\u00e9valuation qui frappait ses propri\u00e9t\u00e9s. Elle a laiss\u00e9 \u00e9couler plusieurs ann\u00e9es sans payer ses taxes; et maintenant, apr\u00e8s avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 poursuivie par la ville de St-Michel pour ses taxes, elle prend la pr\u00e9sente poursuite pour faire annuler tous ces r\u00f4les d'\u00e9valuation et de perception, en disant que les estimateurs et le conseil municipal ont sur\u00e9valu\u00e9 les propri\u00e9t\u00e9s de la municipalit\u00e9 et que les r\u00f4les de perception n'ont pas respect\u00e9 cette disposition de sa charte qui exige que les terres en culture ne soient pas tax\u00e9es pour un montant plus \u00e9lev\u00e9 qu'un quart de leur valeur.\nLa question qui se pr\u00e9sente est de savoir si la compagnie demanderesse peut exercer maintenant ce droit d'action et s'il n'est pas prescrit.\nSi nous consultons la loi des cit\u00e9s et villes, nous voyons que le l\u00e9gislateur a indiqu\u00e9 avec soin la marche \u00e0 suivre pour la confection des r\u00f4les d'\u00e9valuation et pour la sauvegarde des droits des int\u00e9ress\u00e9s. Les estimateurs sont tenus de faire au temps ordonn\u00e9 par le conseil le r\u00f4le d'\u00e9valuation des biens imposables (art. 5696 S.R.P.Q.). Apr\u00e8s que le r\u00f4le est termin\u00e9, ils le d\u00e9posent au bureau du conseil, avis public de ce d\u00e9p\u00f4t est donn\u00e9 par le greffier dans les deux jours suivants, et les int\u00e9ress\u00e9s sont avertis que ce r\u00f4le restera ouvert \u00e0 leur examen durant les trente jours qui suivent celui du d\u00e9p\u00f4t (art. 5705 S.R.P.Q.). Alors si quelqu'un a \u00e0 se plaindre du r\u00f4le, il peut en appeler au conseil durant ces trente jours (art. 5706 S.R.P.Q.), et le conseil, \u00e0 sa premi\u00e8re assembl\u00e9e g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, entend ces plaintes et les d\u00e9cide (art. 5707). Cependant les plaignants peuvent se pourvoir en appelant devant la cour de circuit contre la d\u00e9cision du conseil. Et l\u00e0, devant la cour de circuit, la proc\u00e9dure doit \u00eatre faite avec la plus grande c\u00e9l\u00e9rit\u00e9 (art. 5715-5716-5717-5720). Comme je l'ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 dit, la demanderesse-intim\u00e9e se plaint que ses propri\u00e9t\u00e9s ont \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9valu\u00e9es \u00e0 un prix trop \u00e9lev\u00e9, et c'est le motif qui l'a incit\u00e9e \u00e0 instituer sa pr\u00e9sente action en cour sup\u00e9rieure; et elle invoque \u00e0 cette fin l'article 50 du Code de Proc\u00e9dure Civile, que les corporations sont soumises\nau droit de surveillance et de r\u00e9forme, aux ordres et au contr\u00f4le de la cour sup\u00e9rieure.\nCe pouvoir de la cour sup\u00e9rieure n'est pas absolu, car l'article 48 du code de proc\u00e9dure nous d\u00e9clare que la cour sup\u00e9rieure\nconna\u00eet en premi\u00e8re instance de toute demande ou action qui n'est pas exclusivement de la juridiction de la cour de circuit.\nL'article 54 du code de proc\u00e9dure qui parle de la juridiction de la cour de circuit, nous indique certaines causes o\u00f9 la cour de circuit\nconna\u00eet en dernier ressort et privativement \u00e0 la cour sup\u00e9rieure.\nLa juridiction de la cour sup\u00e9rieure n'est donc pas absolue; d'ailleurs l'article 50 C.P.C. \u00e9nonce formellement que ce droit de surveillance et de contr\u00f4le sur les corporations et les tribunaux inf\u00e9rieurs doit s'exercer\nen la mani\u00e8re et forme prescrite par la loi.\nDans la cinqui\u00e8me partie du code de proc\u00e9dure nous trouvons les proc\u00e9dures relatives aux corporations et aux fonctions publiques. L'article 978 donne au procureur-g\u00e9n\u00e9ral le droit de poursuivre une corporation qui viole les actes qui la r\u00e9gissent. L'article 987 donne \u00e0 toute personne int\u00e9ress\u00e9e le droit de porter plainte lorsqu'un individu exerce ill\u00e9galement une charge publique. Les tribunaux inf\u00e9rieurs qui exc\u00e8dent leur juridiction sont soumis au bref de prohibition (art. 1003 C.P.C.). Le chapitre 65 nous donne les moyens de se pourvoir contre la proc\u00e9dure et les jugements des tribunaux inf\u00e9rieurs et dit les cas o\u00f9 le bref de certiorari peut \u00eatre \u00e9mis (art. 1292 et suivants, C.P.C.).\nVoil\u00e0 comment au code de proc\u00e9dure le l\u00e9gislateur a d\u00e9termin\u00e9 la juridiction de la cour sup\u00e9rieure.\nNous avons cependant dans notre droit statutaire des dispositions formelles sur la juridiction des tribunaux. Ainsi, par exemple, la loi des cit\u00e9s et villes donne en mati\u00e8re d'\u00e9valuation municipale juridiction au conseil municipal et \u00e0 la cour de circuit (art. 5706, 5709, 5715 S.R.P.Q.).\nCette juridiction est-elle exclusive et la cour de circuit a-t-elle le droit d'en conna\u00eetre en dernier ressort et privativement \u00e0 la cour sup\u00e9rieure?\nCette question de la juridiction respective de la cour sup\u00e9rieure et de la cour de circuit a fait le sujet de nombreuses discussions devant nos tribunaux, surtout au sujet des municipalit\u00e9s rurales qui, comme on le sait, sont r\u00e9gies par le code municipal.\nLa cour de circuit avait, sous les dispositions de l'article 100 du vieux code municipal, le droit de casser tout r\u00e8glement ou toute r\u00e9solution. Mais cet article ajoutait:\nCet article n'est pas exclusif du droit de faire mettre de c\u00f4t\u00e9 par la cour sup\u00e9rieure une r\u00e9solution ou un proc\u00e8s-verbal d'un conseil municipal, pourvu que les frais encourus dans l'instance ne puissent pas d\u00e9passer les frais et d\u00e9bours\u00e9s qui auraient \u00e9t\u00e9 payables si la cause e\u00fbt commenc\u00e9 sous la Cour de Circuit.\nCette derni\u00e8re disposition a donn\u00e9 lieu \u00e0 une grande incertitude dans la jurisprudence. Mais tout de m\u00eame il ne peut pas y avoir de doute que sous le code municipal la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure et la Cour de Revision ont juridiction sur les r\u00e9solutions du conseil municipal.\nOn a dans la pr\u00e9sente cause cit\u00e9 grand nombre de ces d\u00e9cisions qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 rendues sous le code municipal. Je crois qu'elles ne doivent pas \u00eatre invoqu\u00e9es, pour l'excellente raison que notre loi des cit\u00e9s et villes n'a pas la m\u00eame disposition que celle que nous trouvons dans l'article 100 du code municipal.\nDans la cause qui nous est soumise, la compagnie Shannon avait le droit, sous les dispositions de l'acte des cit\u00e9s et villes, de porter une plainte contre le r\u00f4le d'\u00e9valuation dans les d\u00e9lais d\u00e9termin\u00e9s par les statuts refondus. Elle pouvait \u00e9galement appeler de la d\u00e9cision du conseil \u00e0 la cour de circuit. Elle n'a pas jug\u00e9 \u00e0 propos de le faire.\nCette juridiction qui est donn\u00e9e par le statut \u00e0 la cour de circuit me para\u00eet \u00eatre absolue et ne peut pas faire l'objet d'un litige devant la cour sup\u00e9rieure, sous les dispositions de l'article 50 du code de proc\u00e9dure civile. Il me para\u00eet \u00e9vident que la proc\u00e9dure qui est indiqu\u00e9e dans l'acte des cit\u00e9s et villes pour l'\u00e9valuation des propri\u00e9t\u00e9s et pour la contestation du r\u00f4le d'\u00e9valuation demande \u00e0 \u00eatre aussi sommaire que possible afin de ne pas paralyser le pr\u00e9l\u00e8vement des imp\u00f4ts et la marche r\u00e9guli\u00e8re de l'administration municipale.\nIl me para\u00eet \u00e9vident aussi que dans le cas actuel l'acte des cit\u00e9s et villes, en donnant \u00e0 la cour de circuit la juridiction qu'elle lui a donn\u00e9e quant \u00e0 l'\u00e9valuation de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9, manifeste clairement l'intention du l\u00e9gislateur d'enlever \u00e0 la cour sup\u00e9rieure sa juridiction de droit commun pour la donner \u00e0 la cour de circuit. La demanderesse, la compagnie Shannon, se plaint que sa propri\u00e9t\u00e9 est sur\u00e9valu\u00e9e. Elle aurait d\u00fb alors porter sa plainte devant le conseil municipal et ensuite en appeler \u00e0 la cour de circuit. Or n'ayant pas fait cela, elle se trouve priv\u00e9e du droit de saisir la cour sup\u00e9rieure de son grief.\nIl est de principe que la juridiction de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure n'est pas enlev\u00e9e par un statut, \u00e0 moins d'un texte positif ou par des expressions qui manifestent clairement l'intention du l\u00e9gislateur ou par la cr\u00e9ation d'un nouveau tribunal dont la juridiction serait incompatible avec la juridiction de droit commun.\nJ'en suis donc venu \u00e0 la conclusion que la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure n'avait pas le pouvoir de rouvrir cette question d'\u00e9valuation de terrain qui \u00e9tait du ressort exclusif de la cour de circuit.\nMais la demanderesse plaide en outre que le r\u00f4le d'\u00e9valuation et le r\u00f4le de perception n'ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 faits suivant la loi et qu'alors elle a le droit de s'adresser \u00e0 la cour sup\u00e9rieure pour les faire casser.\nIl est incontestable que si les r\u00f4les sont ill\u00e9gaux la demanderesse aurait pu demander \u00e0 ce qu'ils soient cass\u00e9s et qu'elle aurait pu s'adresser \u00e0 la cour sup\u00e9rieure \u00e0 cette fin. L'article 5591 des statuts refondus dit:\nLes proc\u00e8s-verbaux, r\u00f4les, r\u00e9solutions ou autres ordonnances du conseil peuvent \u00eatre cass\u00e9s par la cour sup\u00e9rieure du district dans lequel est situ\u00e9 en tout ou en partie la municipalit\u00e9 pour cause d'ill\u00e9galit\u00e9 de la m\u00eame mani\u00e8re, dans le m\u00eame d\u00e9lai et avec les m\u00eames effets qu'un r\u00e8glement du conseil et sont sujets \u00e0 l'application des articles 5603 et 5633.\nLes articles 5623 et suivants des statuts refondus de la province de Qu\u00e9bec indiquent la mani\u00e8re dont on peut contester ces r\u00e8glements, et l'article 5624 d\u00e9clare positivement que le droit de faire cette demande se prescrit par trois mois. La demanderesse n'a pas jug\u00e9 \u00e0 propos de se plaindre dans ce d\u00e9lai que lui indiquait le l\u00e9gislateur. Je suis m\u00eame port\u00e9 \u00e0 croire qu'elle \u00e9tait satisfaite que son \u00e9valuation municipale f\u00fbt port\u00e9e \u00e0 un prix aussi \u00e9lev\u00e9 que possible afin de lui permettre de vendre cette propri\u00e9t\u00e9 plus cher. Mais maintenant que le \"boom\" qui existait dans le temps pour les immeubles a cess\u00e9, elle veut mettre de c\u00f4t\u00e9 les r\u00f4les d'\u00e9valuation dont elle se servait probablement dans le temps pour trouver des acheteurs \u00e0 un prix tr\u00e8s \u00e9lev\u00e9.\nCette question de prescription a fait l'objet d'une d\u00e9cision importante dans la cause de D\u00e9ch\u00e8ne v. La Cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al[18]. Le conseil priv\u00e9, appel\u00e9 dans cette cause \u00e0 examiner la disposition de la charte de la cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al qui d\u00e9clarait qu'un \u00e9lecteur municipal pouvait demander l'annulation d'une appropriation pour d\u00e9pense d'argent dans les trois mois pour cause d'ill\u00e9galit\u00e9 mais qu'apr\u00e8s ce d\u00e9lai le droit \u00e9tait prescrit et l' appropriation \u00e9tait valide, a jug\u00e9\nthat on the expiration of the three months the elector's statutory right was at an end, and could not be extended by any procedure clause (see sec. 3 of the Civil Procedure Code) which presupposed an existing right of action and regulated its exercise.\nLord Watson, en rendant le jugement, dit de ces dispositions de la loi:\nThey confer upon each and every municipal elector the right, which he had not at common law, to challenge on the score of illegality, any corporate appropriation of money to meet the expenses of the current year, subject to the condition that the right shall prescribe, if not exercised within three months from the time when the appropriation comes into force. They also confer upon the corporation an absolute immunity from liability to have the legality of the appropriation questioned, at the instance of any person whatsoever, after the lapse of these three months. Voice que dans la cause actuelle la loi des corporations de villes d\u00e9clare express\u00e9ment que des r\u00f4les peuvent \u00eatre contest\u00e9s pour ill\u00e9galit\u00e9 dans les trois mois qui suivent leur mise en force. La demanderesse a donc exerc\u00e9 tardivement son action qui aurait d\u00fb \u00eatre renvoy\u00e9e. Le droit de faire une chose et l'exercice de ce droit ne doivent pas \u00eatre confondus. Lorsque la loi dit qu'un droit sera perdu faute de l'exercer dans le d\u00e9lai qu'elle fixe, elle \u00e9tablit une d\u00e9ch\u00e9ance. Dalloz, R\u00e9pertoire, verbo D\u00e9lai, no. 63. Merlin, R\u00e9pertoire, verbo Prescription, sect. 1\u00e8re, par. 1, no. 3.\nCette question de prescription a donn\u00e9 lieu \u00e0 une jurisprudence assez incertaine. Ainsi en 1907 la cour de revision, compos\u00e9e des honorables juges Tellier, Hutchison et Lafontaine, a confirm\u00e9 le jugement de l'honorable juge Curran dans la cause de Emard v. Boulevard de St-Paul[19], et a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que l'action en nullit\u00e9 ne peut \u00eatre intent\u00e9e trente jours apr\u00e8s la mise en force d'une r\u00e9solution d'un conseil municipal que par un contribuable ayant un int\u00e9r\u00eat direct et sp\u00e9cial.\nEn 1909, dans la cause de Allard v. Ville de St-Pierre[20], quatre juges de la cour sup\u00e9rieure se sont \u00e9galement divis\u00e9s sur cette question, la majorit\u00e9 de la cour de revision \u00e9tant d'opinion que tout contribuable peut demander par action directe la cassation d'un r\u00e8glement municipal ultra vires nonobstant le recours sp\u00e9cial par voie de requ\u00eate pr\u00e9vu dans l'acte.\nDans une cause de Aubertin v. Ville de Maisonneuve (1905) les juges se sont l\u00e0 aussi \u00e9galement divis\u00e9s sur la question de savoir si l'action directe pouvait s'exercer par un contribuable. La cour d'appel a dans ces derniers temps d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que la cour sup\u00e9rieure avait juridiction dans une action pour faire d\u00e9clarer ill\u00e9gaux les r\u00f4les d'\u00e9valuation, m\u00eame apr\u00e8s les d\u00e9lais, et que cette action \u00e9chappe \u00e0 la prescription de trois mois \u00e9dict\u00e9e au sujet des requ\u00eates en cassation pour cause d'ill\u00e9galit\u00e9.\nLa Compagnie d'approvisionnement d'eau v. La ville de Montmagny[21]; La ville de La Tuque v. Desbiens[22]; Northern Lands Co. v. La ville de St-Michel[23]; Laberge v. Cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al[24].\nCette jurisprudence r\u00e9cente de la cour d'appel me para\u00eet contraire \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 rendue dans la cause de D\u00e9ch\u00e8ne v. Cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al[25]. Il est n\u00e9cessaire, dans l'int\u00e9r\u00eat de l'administration municipale, que ceux qui ont \u00e0 se plaindre des d\u00e9cisions des conseils municipaux le fassent dans les d\u00e9lais prescrits par la loi. Ils ne doivent pas attendre des ann\u00e9es et des ann\u00e9es avant de demander aux tribunaux d'intervenir.\nJe consid\u00e8re que l'action intent\u00e9e par la demanderesse dans la pr\u00e9sente cause est tardive et que le jugement qui l'a maintenue doit \u00eatre renvers\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens.\nMignault J. (dissenting).\u2014Peu de dispositions l\u00e9gislatives sont invoqu\u00e9es plus souvent que l'article 50 du code de proc\u00e9dure civile, surtout en mati\u00e8res tombant sous l'empire soit du code municipal, soit de l'acte des corporations de ville.\nDans une d\u00e9cision r\u00e9cente (La Ville de La Tuque v. Desbiens[26]), l'honorable juge-en-chef Lamothe a fait une d\u00e9claration de principes qu'il est important de citer textuellement: Deux grands principes ont \u00e9t\u00e9 affirm\u00e9s dans des d\u00e9cisions ant\u00e9rieures; ce sont les deux phares qui doivent nous guider. Quand il s'agit d'une nullit\u00e9 absolue, on peut toujours recourir \u00e0 l'article 50 C.P.C. Quand il s'agit d'ill\u00e9galit\u00e9s provenant d'informalit\u00e9s, ou d'irr\u00e9gularit\u00e9s, il faut recourir au mode sp\u00e9cial indiqu\u00e9 par la loi.\nPlus loin, l'honorable juge-en-chef dit:\nLes tribunaux ont souvent annul\u00e9 des d\u00e9cisions municipales comportant une injustice criante \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard d'un ou de plusieurs contribuables; le fait qu'une d\u00e9cision appara\u00eet arbitraire, oppressive et abusive, peut porter les tribunaux \u00e0 la consid\u00e9rer comme nulle ab initio. La tendance de la jurisprudence a \u00e9t\u00e9 de consid\u00e9rer un abus criant de pouvoir comme \u00e9quivalent \u00e0 un exc\u00e8s de pouvoir. Les mots ultra vires ont re\u00e7u par l\u00e0 une signification plus large.\nL'article 50 C.P.C. est toujours le texte que l'on invoque lorsque l'on attaque de telles d\u00e9cisions.\nPour se pr\u00e9valoir de l'article 50 C.P.C., faut-il qu'un demandeur d\u00e9montre un int\u00e9r\u00eat sp\u00e9cial, diff\u00e9rent de l'int\u00e9r\u00eat des autres contribuables? Si la d\u00e9cision attaqu\u00e9e est atteinte de nullit\u00e9s absolues, le demandeur n'a pas \u00e0 all\u00e9guer ni \u00e0 d\u00e9montrer un int\u00e9r\u00eat sp\u00e9cial. C'est l'action populaire. Si cette d\u00e9cision est oppressive, injuste et abusive \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de quelques contribuables, il faut que ce soit l'un de ces derniers qui se plaigne.\nTout ce que je dis ci-dessus a \u00e9t\u00e9 sanctionn\u00e9 par maints arr\u00eats. La jurisprudence \u00e9tablie par ces arr\u00eats n'est plus contestable.\nA ne consid\u00e9rer que la jurisprudence de la cour d'appel, je crois que la d\u00e9claration de principes de l'honorable juge-en-chef r\u00e9sume fid\u00e8lement cette jurisprudence.\nJe ne mentionnerai que quelques causes; on en trouvera beaucoup d'autres dans une note \u00e0 l'opinion de l'honorable juge Martin dans Les Commissaires d'\u00e9coles de St-F\u00e9licien v. H\u00e9bert[27]. Voyez aussi; Carpentier v. La Corporation de St-Pie[28], o\u00f9 on a fait la distinction entre la nullit\u00e9 relative et la nullit\u00e9 absolue des actes municipaux. Dans deux causes que l'intim\u00e9e nous cite, La Compagnie d'approvisionnement d'eau v. La ville de Montmagny[29], et Rivard v. La Corporation de Wickham-Ouest[30], il a \u00e9t\u00e9 jug\u00e9 qu'un r\u00f4le d'\u00e9valuation municipal dans lequel les propri\u00e9t\u00e9s imposables sont dans leur ensemble \u00e9valu\u00e9es au-dessous de leur valeur r\u00e9elle, est ill\u00e9gal et nul; que le pourvoi dans ce cas est l'action en cassation et non l'appel \u00e0 la cour de circuit; et que tout contribuable, \u00e0 ce seul titre, a un int\u00e9r\u00eat suffisant pour intenter l'action.\nDans Laberge v. La Cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al[31], on a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que la cour sup\u00e9rieure a juridiction dans une action pour faire d\u00e9clarer ill\u00e9gale l'\u00e9valuation municipale d'un immeuble par les estimateurs de la cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al, lorsque l'objet de l'action n'est pas seulement de faire diminuer le montant port\u00e9 au r\u00f4le d'\u00e9valuation, mais aussi de faire d\u00e9clarer que le principe de l'\u00e9valuation elle-m\u00eame est erron\u00e9, comme dans le cas o\u00f9 les estimateurs municipaux ont mis de c\u00f4t\u00e9 le droit que le propri\u00e9taire avait d'avoir son immeuble \u00e9valu\u00e9 comme terre en culture et l'ont \u00e9valu\u00e9 comme lots \u00e0 b\u00e2tir.\nDans Northern Lands Co. v. Ville St-Michel[32], la cour d'appel a jug\u00e9 que le recours donn\u00e9 par la loi des cit\u00e9s et villes contre un r\u00f4le d'\u00e9valuation n'est pas limitatif et que la cour sup\u00e9rieure a juridiction pour annuler un r\u00f4le d'\u00e9valuation lorsque dans son ensemble il est fait sur une base ill\u00e9gale.\nEnfin, dans La Corporation de St-Alexis des Monts v. McMurray[33], on a \u00e9cart\u00e9 la prescription de trois mois (art. 433 C.M.) dans le cas d'une poursuite devant la cour sup\u00e9rieure pour faire annuler un r\u00e8glement municipal intent\u00e9e par une personne qui avait un int\u00e9r\u00eat sp\u00e9cial et direct \u00e0 attaquer ce r\u00e8glement, et on a pos\u00e9 le principe suivant que je cite du sommaire:\u2014\nAlthough the courts should abstain from interfering with municipal matters, it is their duty to interfere with the exercise of powers conferred upon municipal councils where the latter acts are so unreasonable, unfair or oppressive as to constitute an abuse of those powers.\nVoli\u00e0 assur\u00e9ment une jurisprudence solidement assise et elle ne faisait doute \u00e0 personne lorsque je pratiquais comme avocat au barreau de Montr\u00e9al.\nReste \u00e0 savoir si elle est conforme \u00e0 la loi.\nL'article 5591 des statuts refondus de Qu\u00e9bec (Acte des cit\u00e9s et villes) dit que les proc\u00e8s-verbaux, r\u00f4les, r\u00e9solutions ou autres ordonnances du conseil peuvent \u00eatre cass\u00e9s par la cour sup\u00e9rieure, pour cause d'ill\u00e9galit\u00e9, de la m\u00eame mani\u00e8re et dans le m\u00eame d\u00e9lai et avec les m\u00eames effets qu'un r\u00e8glement du conseil.\nEt l'article 5623 porte que tout \u00e9lecteur municipal peut, par une requ\u00eate pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e en son nom \u00e0 la cour sup\u00e9rieure, ou \u00e0 un juge de ce tribunal, demander et obtenir, pour cause d'ill\u00e9galit\u00e9, la cassation de tout r\u00e8glement de conseil avec d\u00e9pens contre la municipalit\u00e9. Le droit de demander cette cassation se prescrit par trois mois \u00e0 compter de l'entr\u00e9e en vigueur du r\u00e8glement (art. 5643).\nSi nous comparons ces dispositions \u00e0 celles du code municipal, nous trouvons que c'est \u00e0 la cour de circuit du comt\u00e9 ou du district ou \u00e0 la cour de magistrat de district qu'on demande, \"pour cause d'ill\u00e9galit\u00e9,\" la cassation des r\u00e8glements ou autres actes municipaux (art. 430). La poursuite pour obtenir la cassation est institu\u00e9e par action ordinaire, et tout \u00e9lecteur ou tout int\u00e9ress\u00e9 est habile \u00e0 l'intenter (art. 431). Le droit de poursuite se prescrit par trois mois \u00e0 compter de la passation de l'acte ou de la proc\u00e9dure que l'on attaque pour ill\u00e9galit\u00e9 (art. 433, al. 1), et le recours sp\u00e9cial donn\u00e9 par ces articles n'exclut pas l'action en nullit\u00e9 dans les cas o\u00f9 elle peut avoir lieu en vertu de l'article 50 du code de proc\u00e9dure civile, mais les frais de l\u2019action en nullit\u00e9 ne peuvent, en aucun cas, \u00eatre plus \u00e9lev\u00e9s que ceux d'une action de quatri\u00e8me classe en cour sup\u00e9rieure (art. 433, al. 2).\nLa disposition du deuxi\u00e8me alin\u00e9a de l'article 433, qui vient de l'article 100 de l'ancien code municipal, ne se trouve pas \u00e0 l'Acte des cit\u00e9s et villes, mais la cour sup\u00e9rieure, dans le cas des cit\u00e9s et villes comme des autres municipalit\u00e9s, a toujours accueilli l'action en nullit\u00e9, en s'autorisant de l'article 50 C.P.C., sans \u00e9gard \u00e0 la prescription de trois mois, lorsqu'il s'agissait d'un acte municipal radicalement nul, ou adopt\u00e9 sans juridiction, ou constituant un abus de pouvoir ou une oppression. Et bien que l'Acte des cit\u00e9s et villes et le code municipal parlent de la cassation pour cause d'ill\u00e9galit\u00e9, on a entendu par l\u00e0 des vices qui n'entra\u00eenent qu'une nullit\u00e9 relative et partant susceptibles d'\u00eatre couverts par l'inaction pendant le d\u00e9lai prescrit pour le recours en nullit\u00e9.\nIl me para\u00eetrait impossible de condamner cette jurisprudence sans m\u00e9conna\u00eetre la port\u00e9e g\u00e9n\u00e9rale et absolue de l'article 50, qui mentionne, entr' autres personnes sujettes au droit de surveillance et de contr\u00f4le de la cour sup\u00e9rieure, les corps politiques et corporations dans la province. Il est vrai que le droit de contr\u00f4le s'exerce, aux termes de cet article, \"en la mani\u00e8re et forme que prescrit la loi,\" mais cela ne veut pas dire, dans le cas des corps municipaux, qu'il n'y a d'autre recours que la requ\u00eate en cassation. Ce pouvoir de contr\u00f4le, je le crois, vise cependant les cas non pr\u00e9vus ou non suffisamment couverts par les dispositions sp\u00e9ciales que j'ai cit\u00e9es, mais s'il y a nullit\u00e9 absolue, s'il y a d\u00e9faut ou exc\u00e8s de juridiction, s'il y a abus de pouvoir ou oppression, la cour sup\u00e9rieure sera dans les limites de sa juridiction en accueillant l'action en nullit\u00e9, et lui d\u00e9nier ce droit \u00e9quivaudrait \u00e0 biffer du code de proc\u00e9dure civile l'article 50 qui, avant ce code, et il remonte au 12 Victoria, ch. 38, art. 7 (1849), \u00e9tait toujours regard\u00e9 comme une r\u00e8gle fondamentale de la juridiction de la cour sup\u00e9rieure.\nJe puis ajouter que dans la cause de D\u00e9ch\u00e8ne v. La cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al[34], bien qu'on n'e\u00fbt pas cit\u00e9 l'article 2329 S.R.Q. (1888), maintenant l'article 50 du code de proc\u00e9dure civile, le conseil priv\u00e9 a reconnu que les dispositions de la charte de Montr\u00e9al permettant \u00e0 un \u00e9lecteur municipal d'attaquer, dans les trois mois, pour cause d'ill\u00e9galit\u00e9, un vote d'argent\ndo not interfere with any right existing by law to impeach the appropriation, after the expiry of the three months, upon the ground that it was beyond the competence of the corporation.\nJe n'ai pas perdu de vue la d\u00e9cision de cette cour dans Robertson v. City of Montr\u00e9al[35]. Il s'agissait l\u00e0 d'une demande en nullit\u00e9 d'une r\u00e9solution adopt\u00e9e par le conseil municipal de Montr\u00e9al et qui autorisait la passation d'un contrat avec une compagnie d'autobus lui conf\u00e9rant le privil\u00e8ge exclusif de faire circuler ses autobus dans certaines rues de la cit\u00e9. Cette r\u00e9solution \u00e9tait attaqu\u00e9e par un contribuable qui pr\u00e9tendait avoir le droit d'intenter l'action par le fait qu'on lui avait transport\u00e9 quelques actions dans la compagnie des tramways pour lui permettre de l'instituer, mais qui, au cours de l'instance, avait renonc\u00e9 \u00e0 se pr\u00e9valoir de sa qualit\u00e9 d'actionnaire de cette compagnie. Il fut jug\u00e9, confirmant en cela la d\u00e9cision des cours provinciales, qu'en l'absence de preuve d'un int\u00e9r\u00eat sp\u00e9cial l\u00e9s\u00e9 par la r\u00e9solution attaqu\u00e9e, Robertson ne pouvait intenter l'action. Dans cette cause, l'opinion a \u00e9t\u00e9 exprim\u00e9e qu'un rem\u00e8de efficace dans un tel cas serait une poursuite prise par le procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral en vertu de l'article 978 du code de proc\u00e9dure civile. Je ne crois pas que cette d\u00e9cision suffise pour mettre de c\u00f4t\u00e9 la jurisprudence que j'ai cit\u00e9e. Et en supposant que l'article 978 C.P.C. autoriserait le procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral \u00e0 poursuivre une corporation qui agirait contrairement \u00e0 sa charte ou qui abuserait de ses pouvoirs corporatifs\u2014et cet article n'a jamais, que je sache, \u00e9t\u00e9 invoqu\u00e9 dans la pratique pour obtenir l'intervention de la cour sup\u00e9rieure dans les cas que pr\u00e9voit l'article 50\u2014rien ne me para\u00eet emp\u00eacher une personne d\u00fbment int\u00e9ress\u00e9e de demander elle-m\u00eame \u00e0 la cour sup\u00e9rieure d'exercer le pouvoir de surveillance et de contr\u00f4le qui lui appartient aux termes de l'article 50. Et certainement la d\u00e9cision dans Robertson v. City of Montreal[36] ne condamne pas la jurisprudence solidement \u00e9tablie de la province de Qu\u00e9bec que j'ai rapport\u00e9e plus haut.\nJ'ai cru que cet expos\u00e9 de principes serait utile pour mieux juger l'esp\u00e8ce qui nous est soumise. La demanderesse intim\u00e9e, s'autorisant de son titre de propri\u00e9taire d'immeubles dans la cit\u00e9 de St-Michel, a saisi la cour sup\u00e9rieure, en 1920, d'une action se plaignant de l'\u00e9valuation, dans le r\u00f4le d'\u00e9valuation municipal, de ses immeubles pour les ann\u00e9es 1913, 1914, 1915, 1916, 1918 et 1919, et elle a all\u00e9gu\u00e9 de plus que cette \u00e9valuation avait \u00e9t\u00e9 faite contrairement \u00e0 l'article 28 de la loi 5 Geo. V., ch. 109, les propri\u00e9t\u00e9s de l'intim\u00e9e \u00e9tant des terres en culture ou afferm\u00e9es ou servant au p\u00e2turage des animaux; que dans le but de se cr\u00e9er un pouvoir d'emprunt que la loi lui d\u00e9niait et de tromper les porteurs de ses obligations comme ses autres cr\u00e9anciers, l'appelante avait port\u00e9 l'\u00e9valuation g\u00e9n\u00e9rale des propri\u00e9t\u00e9s dans la municipalit\u00e9 au multiple de leur valeur r\u00e9elle, contrairement \u00e0 l'article 5696\/?\/ S.R.Q., \u00e0 tel point que les tribunaux avaient r\u00e9duit les \u00e9valuations faites \u00e0 $6,000.00 et $3,000.00 l'arpent \u00e0 $500.00, et que la confection des r\u00f4les suivant cette m\u00e9thode \u00e9tait un abus et un exc\u00e8s de pouvoir de la part de l'appelante. L'intim\u00e9e a conclu \u00e0 l'annulation des r\u00f4les d'\u00e9valuation et de perception.\nL'\u00e9valuation des immeubles de la municipalit\u00e9 dans le but de faire le r\u00f4le d'\u00e9valuation rentre dans les attributions de la corporation municipale et doit se faire d'apr\u00e8s la valeur r\u00e9elle (art. 5696 et suiv.). Le conseil municipal revise le r\u00f4le d'\u00e9valuation et entend les plaintes des int\u00e9ress\u00e9s (art. 5707), et de sa d\u00e9cision il y a appel \u00e0 la cour de circuit du comt\u00e9 ou du district ou \u00e0 la cour de magistrat de district (art. 5715).\nL'intim\u00e9e a pris un semblable appel contre l'\u00e9valuation de ses propri\u00e9t\u00e9s en 1917 et a r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 faire r\u00e9duire cette \u00e9valuation \u00e0 $500.00 l'arpent, mais la valeur mentionn\u00e9e au r\u00f4le, dans les ann\u00e9es suivantes, n'en a pas moins \u00e9t\u00e9 port\u00e9e \u00e0 un chiffre exc\u00e9dant de beaucoup ce montant. Il convient d'ajouter que l'intim\u00e9e s'est d\u00e9sist\u00e9e de son attaque contre les r\u00f4les d'\u00e9valuation et de perception de 1913 et 1914, pour la raison, nous a-t-on dit, que les taxes de ces ann\u00e9es \u00e9taient prescrites.\nLa cour sup\u00e9rieure en est venue \u00e0 la conclusion que l'\u00e9valuation des propri\u00e9t\u00e9s de l'intim\u00e9e \u00e9tait une \u00e9valuation fictive (fictitious valuation); que les estimateurs avaient \u00e9valu\u00e9 ces propri\u00e9t\u00e9s \"upon a wrong principle\", m\u00e9connaissant leur valeur r\u00e9elle, et avaient ainsi exc\u00e9d\u00e9 leurs pouvoirs; et que les r\u00f4les d'\u00e9valuation de 1915, 1916, 1918 et 1919 avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 faits en exc\u00e8s et par abus des pouvoirs de l'appelante, et \u00e9taient ultra vires, ill\u00e9gaux, nuls et non avenus. Ce jugement a \u00e9t\u00e9 confirm\u00e9 par la cour du Banc du Roi, les honorables juges Allard et Rivard \u00e9tant dissidents quant \u00e0 l'annulation des r\u00f4les d'\u00e9valuation, mais \u00e9tant d'avis que le r\u00f4le de perception devait \u00eatre cass\u00e9 \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de l'intim\u00e9e pour cause de violation de la r\u00e8gle de l'article 28 de la loi 5 Geo. V., ch. 109.\nS'il est vrai que l'\u00e9valuation de l'immeuble de l'intim\u00e9e est fictive, je n'aurais aucune h\u00e9sitation \u00e0 dire que la cour sup\u00e9rieure pouvait l'annuler. Pour d\u00e9terminer ce fait capital, j'ai lu bien attentivement toute la preuve. Se basant sur la subdivision de cet immeuble en lots de ville, bien que sa destination agricole n'e\u00fbt pas \u00e9t\u00e9 chang\u00e9e, les estimateurs de l'appelante, avec l'approbation du conseil qui a homologu\u00e9 le r\u00f4le, ont \u00e9valu\u00e9 des lots de 25 pieds de front par 95 pieds de profondeur \u00e0 des prix variant de $365.00 \u00e0 $600.00, ce qui fait pour toute la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 une \u00e9valuation d'environ $6,685.00 l'arpent. A part de cela, les estimateurs ont \u00e9valu\u00e9 les rues montr\u00e9es sur le plan de subdivision \u00e0 10 cents du pied et les ruelles \u00e0 5 cents du pied. L'\u00e9valuation pour 1919 est un peu moindre, soit $347,578.00 pour toute la propri\u00e9t\u00e9, alors que dans les ann\u00e9es pr\u00e9c\u00e9dentes elle \u00e9tait \u00e9valu\u00e9e \u00e0 $528,104 pour 1918, $523,529.00 pour 1917, $526,085.00 pour 1916 et $528,011.00 pour 1915. Cette propri\u00e9t\u00e9, lorsque la sp\u00e9culation immobili\u00e8re \u00e9tait \u00e0 sa plus forte hausse, avait \u00e9t\u00e9 achet\u00e9e, avec une partie vendue depuis quelques ann\u00e9es aux commissaires d'\u00e9coles, au prix de $207,-500.00. Il est prouv\u00e9 que depuis plusieurs ann\u00e9es on ne trouve pas d'acheteurs pour les lots de subdivision; \u00e0 part la partie vendue aux commissaires d'\u00e9coles, il n'y a eu que six lots, sur neuf cents environ, qui aient \u00e9t\u00e9 vendus \u00e0 des acqu\u00e9reurs qui paient le prix d'acquisition. Les rues et ruelles montr\u00e9es sur le plan \u00e9taient, depuis deux ou trois ans avant l\u2019action, cultiv\u00e9es comme le restant de la terre, car le tout, \u00e0 l'exception de ce qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 vendu, est lou\u00e9 au fermier, un nomm\u00e9 Scott, qui l'occupe et le cultive depuis une trentaine d'ann\u00e9es, pour un loyer annuel de $225.00. Dans ces circonstances, \u00e9valuer une terre en culture, bien qu'elle ait \u00e9t\u00e9 sub-divis\u00e9e au temps de la hausse sp\u00e9culative et purement fictive, \u00e0 plus de $6,000.00 l'arpent, ce n'est pas faire une \u00e9valuation r\u00e9elle comme le veut l'article 5696 S.R.Q., c'est faire une \u00e9valuation purement fictive et qui n'a aucun rapport quelconque avec la valeur r\u00e9elle. La cour de circuit a r\u00e9duit l'\u00e9valuation de 1917 \u00e0 $500.00 l'arpent, et l'ann\u00e9e suivante, en 1918, les estimateurs et le conseil reviennent \u00e0 l'\u00e9valuation fantastique de plus de $6,000.00 l'arpent. Je ne crois pas qu'il soit possible de trouver dans la jurisprudence un abus de pouvoir et une oppression aussi flagrante.\nSi dans les circonstances la cour sup\u00e9rieure ne peut exercer le pouvoir de surveillance et de contr\u00f4le que lui donne l'article 50 du code de proc\u00e9dure civile, il vaudrait autant, je l'ai dit, biffer cet article du code. On objecte que l'intim\u00e9e aurait pu faire en 1915, 1916, 1918 et 1919 ce qu'elle a fait en 1917, en appeler \u00e0 la cour de circuit. La preuve constate qu'il y a eu des n\u00e9gociations entre les parties pour t\u00e2cher d'en arriver \u00e0 une entente, mais ces n\u00e9gociations ont \u00e9chou\u00e9. Il n'y a certainement pas eu d'acquiescement de l'intim\u00e9e. Et le recours de l'appel \u00e0 la cour de circuit suppose qu'il y a eu une \u00e9valuation s\u00e9rieuse, o\u00f9 on all\u00e8gue qu'il y a eu erreur de jugement des estimateurs. Mais si on s'est moqu\u00e9 de la loi, si, au lieu d'\u00e9valuer s\u00e9rieusement l'immeuble de l'intim\u00e9e, les estimateurs lui ont attribu\u00e9 une valeur purement fantastique et arbitraire, s'ils ont abus\u00e9 de leurs pouvoirs, je ne puis, pour ma part, laisser subsister cet abus de pouvoir et cette \u00e9valuation fictive pour la raison qu'il n'y a pas eu d'appel \u00e0 la cour de circuit. Dans de telles circonstances, c'est \u00e0 la cour sup\u00e9rieure qu'il appartient de prot\u00e9ger les citoyens contre l'oppression et l'arbitraire. Comme je l'ai dit, la jurisprudence de la province de Qu\u00e9bec depuis de nombreuses ann\u00e9es reconna\u00eet cette juridiction \u00e0 la cour sup\u00e9rieure, et je crois tr\u00e8s respectueusement que cette jurisprudence doit \u00eatre accept\u00e9e par cette cour.\nD'ailleurs il y a eu violation de l'article 28 de la loi 5 Geo. V., ch. 109, dont la premier alin\u00e9a se lit comme suit:\nToute terre en culture ou afferm\u00e9e ou servant de p\u00e2turage pour les animaux, de m\u00eame que toute terre non d\u00e9frich\u00e9e ou terre \u00e0 bois dans les limites de la municipalit\u00e9, est tax\u00e9e pour un terme de dix ann\u00e9es \u00e0 un montant proportionnel au quart de sa valeur r\u00e9elle telle qu'inscrite au r\u00f4le d'\u00e9valuation, \u00e0 la condition que tel montant proportionnel n'exc\u00e8de pas cent cinquante piastres par arpent y compris les b\u00e2tisses dessus construites.\nL'immeuble en question est indubitablement une terre en culture ou servant au p\u00e2turage pour les animaux, et on ne pouvait taxer les intim\u00e9s pour une valeur de plus de $150.00 l'arpent.\nOn dit que cela n'entra\u00eenerait la nullit\u00e9 que du r\u00f4le de perception. Pour les raisons que j'ai donn\u00e9es, je crois que le r\u00f4le d'\u00e9valuation lui-m\u00eame doit \u00eatre mis de c\u00f4t\u00e9.\nCependant je n'annulerais ce r\u00f4le qu'en tant que l'intim\u00e9e est concern\u00e9e. Celle-ci a pris son action \u00e0 titre de propri\u00e9taire d'immeubles dans la municipalit\u00e9 et son int\u00e9r\u00eat se borne \u00e0 faire r\u00e9duire l'\u00e9valuation de sa propri\u00e9t\u00e9. Elle ne me para\u00eet pas exercer l'action populaire, malgr\u00e9 ses conclusions qui d\u00e9passent son int\u00e9r\u00eat, et les autres propri\u00e9taires de la municipalit\u00e9, dont quelques-uns ont pris des appels \u00e0 la cour de circuit, ne sont pas en cause et ne se plaignent pas des r\u00f4les d'\u00e9valuation. Nous n'avons pas devant nous les r\u00f4les d'\u00e9valuation de l'appelante, mais seulement des extraits qui concernent l'intim\u00e9e, et les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve quant aux autres \u00e9valuations ne me paraissent pas suffisants pour annuler tout le r\u00f4le. Je modifierais donc le jugement de la cour sup\u00e9rieure et je n'annulerais que l'\u00e9valuation des propri\u00e9t\u00e9s de l'intim\u00e9e; et il s'ensuit que les r\u00f4les de perception qui imposent des taxes \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e bas\u00e9es sur cette \u00e9valuation doivent \u00e9galement \u00eatre annul\u00e9s \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de l'intim\u00e9e. Ce changement est assez important pour donner \u00e0 l'appelante la moiti\u00e9 de ses frais en cette cour et dans la cour du Banc du Roi.

In short, as the entire estate (except a trifling five hundred dollars of personalty) consisted of real estate, the appellant was not liable at all, according to that contention. If we apply a little general knowledge of the world and the business therein, we must assume that the appellant was paid on the basis of the amount involved in this bond as guarantor and not otherwise, and that it certainly did not intend to be taking the money paid it for doing nothing but writing out the bond and application therefor, which would be the case if its present contention that there never was any liability incurred be correct.\nI hold that all parties concerned, by their conduct towards each other, agreed that the amount determined by the Auditor General was to be and consequently remained the correct amount of succession duty as intended by the Act that it should, unless and until otherwise determined by one or other proceeding which the Act furnishes as a means of substituting another amount.\nIn the first place the Crown is sometimes imposed upon by a fraudulent or mistaken estimate leading up to the consent to granting of probate.\nThere is given by the 29th and following sections of the \"Succession Duty Act\" a means of rectifying this by appointment of a commissioner to inquire and proceed as directed under the \"Public Inquiries Act\" and the relevant sections of the \"Succession Duty Act.\"\nNo occasion has arisen therefor herein, hence all argument based thereon is, I respectfully submit, but idle confusion.\nIt matters not whether the party called in to assist the Auditor General is, in the ordinary speech of those concerned, called a commissioner or agent, or aught else. That furnishes no excuse for the pretension that the power of the Crown to so investigate must be invoked and exercised by it as a necessary preliminary to any liability upon the bond in question herein. The converse case of an executor or administrator having been misled into an over estimate, or having misunderstood the operation of the Act, or of any other person concerned being erroneously held by the executor, or others concerned, the proper party to pay any part of the duty is amply provided for by section 43 of the Act, which reads as follows:\u2014\n43.A judge of the Supreme Court shall also have jurisdiction upon motion or petition, to determine what property is liable to duty under this Act, the amount thereof, and the time or times when the same is payable, and may himself or through any reference exercise any of the powers which by sections 29 to 31, both inclusive, of this Act are conferred upon any officer or person.\nThis never was invoked by the parties concerned herein though it was the proper remedy if any unjustifiable mistake made as against the executor or his surety the appellant.\nIf there is anything in the pretension set up in the defence, that seems to have been the proper and only mode of relief and enables the resort to all the powers conferred on the Crown as already pointed out when it has ground of complaint.\nIndependently of either of these proceedings the respondent is enabled by section 42 to sue as has been done herein. And in the event of doing so the proceedings authorized by sections 29 to 32 seem to be excluded from operation by the latter part of the section, which reads as follows:\n42.Any sum payable under this Act shall be recoverable with full costs of suit as a debt due to His Majesty from any person liable therefor by action in the Supreme Court, and it shall not in any case be necessary to take the proceedings authorized by sections 29 to 32, both inclusive, of this Act.\nUnless and until the amount determined by the Auditor General and in compliance therewith made the condition upon which probate was granted, has been displaced by either of the said proceedings provided by the Act, I hold it is conclusively established.\nThe contention that the executor as such, or his surety, is not liable because the executor has, as such, only to deal with personalty, seems wholly unfounded in face of the express language of the bond and manifold provisions in the \"Administration Act,\" extending his powers and duties beyond those originally devolving on him, and especially sections 74 and 75 cited in illustration of what he can do as pointed out by Mr. Lafleur in relation to the law created by the \"Succession Duty Act.\"\nI am, however, of the opinion that the plain meaning of the bond in question made it the duty of the executor to exercise his powers of devisee and meet thereby the obligations he entered into and that the appellant surety could at any time have insisted upon his furnishing the means thereby to relieve it.\nI do not think it necessary or indeed quite proper to express herein any opinion as to the rights of the Crown to assert at any time and stage the lien declared by the Act.\nIf the contention made in that regard be correct, the right of subrogation given by the judgment appealed from can be attempted by appellant thereunder.\nI think this appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDUFF J.\u2014The bond is the bond required by the statute. The registrar has no authority to exact and the applicant was under no obligation to give a security of wider limits than required by the law. I agree with the view of the Court of Appeal that sec. 24 in prescribing that the bond shall be conditioned for the due payment to His Majesty of any duty to which the property coming into the hands of the applicant * * * may be found liable\nis imposing a condition which must be observed before the application is granted and since that is the subject of this provision the words \"coming into the hands of the applicant\" must be read as coming into his hands under the authority with which he is petitioning the court to clothe him. The condition of the bond is that as regards property acquired by him under the authority vested in him by the probate or the letters of administration, as the case may be, he is to be responsible for the payment of all duty to which that property is liable under the Act.\nThe sole remaining question is that arising under the contention of the respondent that this property came \"into the hands\" of the executor within the meaning of the condition.\nNow it is quite clear that as executor he acquired no title to the testatrix' real estate. In that sense it did not come into his hands. But there is, it is contended, an authority conferred upon him\u2014an authority (under sec. 37) to sell the real estate of the testatrix, for the purpose of paying the duty to which the property itself is liable\u2014and that circumstance, it is argued, is sufficient to bring that property within the category of property to which the condition applies.\nThe construction of sec. 37 of the Act is not, I think free from doubt. But for the purpose of deciding the question now raised I shall assume that it has the scope ascribed to it by the judgment of the Court of Appeal. It does then, we may assume, give authority to the executor to sell for the purpose mentioned. But it is surely a non-natural construction of the language to hold that property has come \"into the hands\" of an official or a person charged with the performance of duties merely because by statutory enactment he has been endowed with authority to sell for the purpose of paying a public charge upon it, an authority which has never been exercised. I think the construction is not an admissible one.\nThe appeal should be allowed and the action dismissed with costs.\nANGLIN J.\u2014Having regard to the terms in which the statute (R.S.B.C., c. 217, s. 24) directs that the bond (to be furnished by the personal representative applying for probate or letters of administration) to secure payment of succession duties shall be conditioned, I agree with the interpretation put upon the bond of the appellant by the Court of Appeal, namely, that it secures payment of succession duties only upon property which came into the hands of its co\u2014obligor in his quality as executor of his deceased wife. As real estate, the property in question came into the hands of Quagliotti not as executor but only as devisee of his wife. In interpreting the statute and the bond, in my opinion, the adventitious circumstance that Quagliotti was both executor and devisee must be put aside and the position of the executor and his surety considered as if the devise of the property had been to another person.\nI incline to accept the contention of Mr. Tilley that the words \"the said duty\" in sec. 37 of the statute refer to the duty which a personal representative or trustee is by sec. 36 required to deduct, i.e., duty on \"any estate, legacy or property in (his) charge or trust\" which is subject to duty. I am, moreover, with great respect, unable to assent to the view that because the power to sell conferred on the executor by s. 37 (assuming its applicability) would empower him to sell so much of the real estate devised as would enable him to pay the duty on it, that property can be said to have come in (or into) his hands as executor within the meaning of the bond sued upon and s. 24 of the statute. Ianson v. Clyde et al.[3], cited by Mr. Justice Galliher, seems to me to be clearly distinguishable. Although only for the purpose of enabling the personal representative to sell it to pay the debts of the de cujus the effect of the Ontario legislation there dealt with was to vest in him the title to the decedent's real estate ad interim and to postpone the vesting of it in the devisees or next-of-kin until the right of the personal representative thereto was determined. Sec. 37 of the British Columbia \"Succession Duty Act\" has no such effect.\nThere is no doubt force in the contention that ss. 23-4 prescribe that the security to be given shall be\nin a penal sum equal to ten per centum of the sworn value of the property of the deceased person,\nincluding his real estate. Prima facie the object would seem to be to secure payment of succession duties on the real estate as well as on the personal property of the decedent. But we are here dealing with the obligation of the executor and his surety and it is trite law that the surety is entitled to the benefit of the most favourable construction of its obligation which the instrument embodying it reasonably admits of. Section 24 of the statute and the terms of the bond itself, as already indicated, in my opinion entitle the appellant to maintain that its obligation is restricted to the satisfaction of the respondent's claim for unpaid succession duties in respect of such of the property of the de cujus as came into the hands of Quagliotti in his capacity as executor of his deceased wife. The real estate devised to him did not come into his hands in that quality.\nI would therefore allow this appeal with costs here and in the Court of Appeal and would direct the entry of judgment dismissing the action with costs.\nBRODEUR J.\u2014This is an appeal concerning a bond given under the provisions of sec. 23 of the \"Succession Duty Act\" of British Columbia as security for the payment of succession duty.\nMrs. Quagliotti died in 1913 and by her will she gave all her real and personal estate to her husband and appointed him her executor.\nHaving applied for letters probate Quagliotti filed an affidavit of value and relationship required by the \"Succession Duty Act\" in which it is shown that the estate was estimated at nearly a million dollars and was, with the exception of $500 of personal estate, composed of lands situated in the city of Victoria.\nThis inventory was accepted by the provincial authorities and Quagliotti gave a bond of the United States Fidelity and Guarantee Co. as security for the payment of the succession duty to which the property of the deceased might become liable.\nThe condition of the bond was that Quagliotti\nthe executor of all the property of Petronilla Quagliotti * * * do well and truly pay * * * to the Minister of Finance of the Province of British Columbia for the time being representing His Majesty the King in that behalf any and all duty to which the property estate and effects of the said Petronilla Quagliotti coming into the hands of Laurenzo Joseph Quagliotti may be found liable under the provisions of the Succession Duty Act.\nIt is contended by the appellant company that the real estate never came in the hands of L.J. Quagliotti as executor but was in his hands as devisee. The bond given was made according to the provisions of the Act. It is true that at first the bond describes Quagliotti as executor; but the condition is that payment be made \"of all duty to which the property, estate and effects of the said Petronilla Quagliotti coming into the hands of her husband may be found liable.\" Whether this estate came into the hands of L.J. Quagliotti as executor or devisee does not make any difference, because the intention of the Act is that the security should cover all succession duties to which the estate might be liable.\nBesides, by section 37 of the \"Succession Duty Act\" it is formally enacted that an executor has the power to sell so much of the property of the deceased as will enable him to pay the duty, and by section 2 the word property is defined as including real property of every description. Some similar powers are to be found in sections 74 and 75 of ch. 4 of the Revised Statutes of British Columbia, and show that the executors exercise authority with regard to both personal and real estate. If the executor, Quagliotti, had been only liable for succession duty on $500 for the personal estate, why should he and the appellant company give a bond for nearly $100,000?\nThe appellant also contended that the trial judge should have revalued the assets.\nThe value of those assets was declared by the affidavit of value and relationship filed by the applicants for letters probate. The Government authorities were satisfied with such a value and the bond was given in conformity with the decision of the authorities. In these circumstances, there was virtually an agreement which relieves us from reconsidering this question of value. It is to be expected, however, that the provincial authorities, when they come to consider the case, will not forget the suggestion which has been made by the court below as to the advisability, in view of the peculiar circumstances of the case, of reducing the amount for which they obtained judgment.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nMIGNAULT J.\u2014The action of the respondent is on a bond for succession duties given by the defendant, now appellant, and by one Lorenzo Joseph Quagliotti, who was also a defendant. The respondent sets up the bond and alleges that the succession duties have not been paid and asks for judgment for $44,287.50, being the succession duties due the province of British Columbia on an estate of which Quagliotti was sole devisee and testamentary executor under the will of his wife, and which estate Quagliotti, in his affidavit, accompanying his application for probate, valued at $885,750.00. Among other defences, the appellant alleges that the property never came into the hands of Quagliotti as executor of his wife's estate, and further, in the alternative, that the valuation was made by Quagliotti by mistake and inadvertence, that the property was valueless or its value was grossly exaggerated, and asks that the amount of the duty be ascertained by the court.\nAs briefly as possible, I will say that the \"Succession Duty Act\" of British Columbia requires that an applicant for probate shall make and file with the registrar of the court two duplicate original affidavits of value and relationship, with inventories annexed. One of these originals is sent by the registrar to the Minister of Finance at Victoria, who authorizes the Auditor General to determine the amount of succession duty and forwards a statement of the same to the registrar. The latter then requires immediate payment of the amount due or security therefor to be given by bond. This bond, as stated by section 24 of the Act, is in a penal sum equal to 10% of the sworn value of the property of the deceased liable to succession duty; it must be executed by the applicant or applicants and two or more sureties to be approved by the registrar, and is conditioned for the due payment to His Majesty of any duty to which the property coming to the hands of the said applicant or applicants may be found liable.\nThe bond sued on is by its terms a promise to pay $88,575.00, which is 10% of $885,750.00, the valuation mentioned in the affidavit, and the condition of the obligation is that if Lorenzo Joseph Quagliotti, the executor of all the property of Petronilla Quagliotti, pays to the Minister of Finance the duty to which the property, estate and effects of the said Petronilla Quagliotti coming to the hands of the said Lorenzo Joseph Quagliotti may be found liable under the provisions of the \"Succession Duty Act\" within two years from the death of Petronilla Quagliotti, or such further time as may be given, the obligation shall be void and of no effect, otherwise the same to remain in full force and virtue. This bond follows the statutory form.\nAlthough the non-payment of succession duty by Quagliotti, by the terms of the bond, renders the sum of $88,575.00 payable, the claim of the Crown is for $44,287.50, the alleged amount of the succession duty, with interest, the respondent stating, in the indorsement on the writ, that the bond was entered into to secure the succession duty. This construction of the bond carries out the intention of the statute which, when the applicant for probate does not immediately pay the succession duty, requires this security as to all property coming to the hands of the applicant liable for the payment of the succession duty. I will therefore treat this bond as being security for the payment of the succession duty. This payment, as I have said, is all that the respondent demands. The main ground of defence of the defendant is that Quagliotti, as executor of his wife's estate, was the applicant for probate, that this bond was given by him and the appellant to secure the payment of any duty to which the property coming to the hands of the applicant, i.e., Quagliotti as executor, might be found liable, that none of this property came to the hands of Quagliotti, as executor, and consequently the condition of the bond was not fulfilled.\nThe Court of Appeal construed the bond as being conditioned on the property coming to the hands of Quagliotti as executor. The learned trial judge found that Quagliotti, who was devisee of the property which principally consists in real estate, took possession of the property, managed it and received the profits. He was, however, not registered as owner.\nThe question is whether, assuming, as I think we must assume, that the condition of the bond was that the property should come to the hands of Quagliotti qua executor, this possession by Quagliotti as devisee fulfils this condition.\nUndoubtedly the appellant, being a surety under this bond, is entitled to the most favourable construction which can be placed on its bond. The construction which I adopt conforms strictly to section 24 of the statute which must govern the interpretation of the bond it requires from the applicant, and it is only when the property comes to the hands of the applicant that the amount of the bond becomes payable. Here it never came to the hands of the applicant, the executor, for, as Mr. Justice Galliher, who rendered the judgment for the Court of Appeal, states:\nunder our law in British Columbia real estate did not, at the time of Mrs. Quagliotti's death, devolve upon the executor.\nThe possession taken by Quagliotti therefore was and could only be as devisee under the will. It is true the executor and the devisee were in fact the same person but, in law, the situation is the same as if the devisee and the executor were different persons. And although, as Mr. Justice Galliher observes, the executor had the power to sell the lands of the testator to pay the succession duty, I do not think that the mere existence of this power would warrant us in saying that this property came to his hands. The learned judge cites the case of Ianson v. Clyde[4], where Chancellor Boyd explains the meaning of the words \"in the hands of the executors,\" but the learned Chancellor was not construing a statute like the one in question but merely discussing the effect of a judgment which had been rendered by the county court against the property in the hands of the executors, and I do not feel bound by his definition.\nI may add that were I convinced that any obligation arises under this bond, I would not grant the respondent the amount of succession duty demanded. The learned trial judge found that the gross value of the property was $500,000, the valuation in the affidavit being the result of the boom in the real estate prevailing in 1913. The learned judge, if the bond was obligatory on the appellant, should, in my opinion, have based the amount of the succession duty on this value and not on the value stated by obvious mistake by Quagliotti's affidavit. Both courts were under the erroneous impression that a commissioner was appointed under the Act to value this property and that Quagliotti had failed to appeal from his award. No commissioner, the parties admit, was ever named. Under all the circumstances, I think the learned trial judge could fix the valuation of the property notwithstanding the valuation in the affidavit, and the least that can be said is that no higher valuation should have been considered than $500,000.00.\nBut, in my opinion, no obligation exists under the bond and I would allow the appeal with costs throughout and dismiss the respondent's action.\nAppeal dismissed without costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Robertson, Heislerman & Tait.\nSolicitor for the respondent: W.D.

Sharpe (Defendant) Respondent.\n1922: May 18, 31.\nPresent: Sir Louis Davies C.J. and Idington, Duff, Anglin, Brodeur and Mignault JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF KING'S BENCH, APPEAL SIDE, PROVINCE OF QUEBEC.\nLease\u2014Notice to vacate premises\u2014Absence of judicial proceedings or physical act of eviction\u2014Damages to lessee\u2014Liability of lessor\u2014Arts. 1612, 1616, 1617, 1618, 1663, 2128 C.C.\nA lessee, who vacates the leased premises upon a simple notice by the owner to whom these premises have been sold by the lessor, that proceedings in eviction will be taken against him, is not entitled to claim damages against his lessor. There must be either judicial proceedings in eviction or some physical act of eviction by the owner.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King's Bench, appeal side, Province of Quebec, affirming the judgment of the Superior Court and dismissing the appellant's action.\nThe appellant had leased from the respondent for the term of three years, from the 1st of May, 1918, the second flat of a building in Montreal. On the 24th of June, 1919, the respondent gave to one C. an option on the property, which was accepted the same day, with the condition that \"the buyer (was) to respect and assume all existing leases on the said premises,\" which clause was by inadvertence omitted in the deed of sale passed on the 24th of July, 1919. At this last day, C. gave appellant a notice that he must vacate the premises on the 1st of May, 1920; and C. having re-sold the property to T., T. also gave to the appellant a similar notice on the 30th of July, 1919. On the 5th of August, 1919, the appellant notified C., T. and the respondent that it intended to occupy the premises until the expiration of the term of the lease. On the 9th of August, C. and T. reiterated their intention to institute proceedings in ejectment on the 1st of May, 1920, if the premises were not then vacated. On the 5th of November, 1919, the respondent instituted an action against C. and T., in order to correct the deed of sale and have inserted into it the clause omitted from the option. On the 18th of March, 1920, the latter action being still not adjudicated upon, the appellant notified the respondent that the sale of the premises has caused the appellant to be \"ejected from the premises before the expiration of his lease according to the terms of legal notices duly served on the appellant by said purchasers,\" and that the appellant had succeeded in finding other premises at a loss of $6,443.75. On the 23rd of March, 1920, the respondent answered this protest by reciting the above facts, advised the appellant that it had the right to remain in the premises and notified it that it would vacate them at its own risk and peril. On the 19th of April, 1920, the appellant leased other premises, vacated the premises leased from the respondent and instituted an action against the respondent to recover $6,443.75 damages. Subsequently, on the 7th of October, 1920, C. and T. acknowledged that there was an error in the deed of sale; and they consented that it be corrected accordingly.

Montreal. Telegraph Co.[1], cited by Mr. Geoffrion.\nBrodeur J.\u2014Il s'agit d'une action en dommages institu\u00e9e par un locataire contre son locateur dans les circonstances suivantes.\nSharpe avait lou\u00e9 pour trois ans, \u00e0 partir du 1er mai 1918, \u00e0 la compagnie Galibert, une propri\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al. Ce bail ne fut pas enregistr\u00e9.\nLe 24 juin 1919, Sharpe fit une promesse de vente \u00e0 Creelman de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 lou\u00e9e; et il \u00e9tait stipul\u00e9 dans cette promesse de vente que le promettant acheteur aurait \u00e0 maintenir les baux existants. Le 24 juillet 1919 l'acte de vente \u00e9tait fait devant notaire; mais, par erreur ou autrement, l'obligation pour l'acheteur de maintenir les baux n'y fut pas stipul\u00e9e.\nLe m\u00eame jour Creelman faisait enregistrer son acte de vente; et il donnait avis par \u00e9crit \u00e0 la compagnie Galibert d'avoir \u00e0 d\u00e9laisser cette propriet\u00e9 au 1er mai 1930.\nPeu de jours apr\u00e8s, Creelman qui \u00e9videmment s'\u00e9tait port\u00e9 acqu\u00e9reur de cette propri\u00e9t\u00e9 pour la compagnie Tuckett, signait une vente, en faveur de cette derni\u00e8re, de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 lou\u00e9e; et, le 30 juillet 1919, la compagnie Tuckett notifiait la compagnie Galibert d'avoir \u00e0 d\u00e9guerpir le 1er mai 1920.\nCet avis d'expulsion a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9videmment d\u00e9nonc\u00e9 au bailleur Sharpe par son locataire: car, peu de temps apr\u00e8s, savoir le 5 novembre 1919, Sharpe poursuivait Creelman et la compagnie Tuckett pour faire condamner ces derniers \u00e0 reconna\u00eetre que la compagnie Galibert avait le droit de rester sur les lieux lou\u00e9s jusqu'au 1er mai 1921, et il invoquait \u00e0 cette fin la convention sp\u00e9ciale qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 ins\u00e9r\u00e9e dans la promesse de vente.\nCette action fut contest\u00e9e par Creelman et la compagnie Tuckett en disant que leur contrat de vente ne contenait aucune obligation de respecter le bail de la compagnie Galibert et qu'ils n'\u00e9taient pas alors tenus de garder cette derni\u00e8re comme locataire apr\u00e8s le 1er mai 1920.\nLa situation devenait tr\u00e8s embarrassante pour la compagnie Galibert, vu que l'industrie qu'elle exploitait demandait une propri\u00e9t\u00e9 difficile \u00e0 se procurer, et qu'elle ne pouvait pas s'exposer \u00e0 \u00eatre oblig\u00e9e de d\u00e9guerpir \u00e0 quelques jours d'avis au cas o\u00f9 Sharpe ne r\u00e9ussirait pas dans son action contre ces tiers acqu\u00e9reurs. La demanderesse s'est alors mise \u00e0 chercher \u00e0 louer une autre propri\u00e9t\u00e9; mais elle n'a pas pu r\u00e9ussir qu'en payant un loyer et des taux d'assurance plus \u00e9lev\u00e9s. Elle a alors laiss\u00e9 les lieux lou\u00e9s le premier mai, ainsi qu'elle en avait \u00e9t\u00e9 notifi\u00e9e par les tiers acqu\u00e9reurs et, en juin 1920, elle a poursuivi son bailleur Sharpe en dommages pour r\u00e9clamer de lui le surplus de loyer et d'assurances qu'il lui fallait payer.\nSharpe a plaid\u00e9 que dans les circonstances il n'y avait pas de responsabilit\u00e9 de sa part et que la menace d'\u00e9viction qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 faite contre la compagnie Galibert ne la justifiait pas de poursuivre en dommages.\nPendant l'instance sur la pr\u00e9sente cause, soit le 11 octobre 1920, Sharpe, Creelman et Tuckett ont r\u00e9gl\u00e9 leur poursuite. Et ces deux derniers ont reconnu qu'ils \u00e9taient tenus de maintenir les baux affectant la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 qu'ils avaient achet\u00e9e de Sharpe.\nLa Cour Sup\u00e9rieure, dans ces circonstances, a renvoy\u00e9 l'action de la compagnie Galibert, et ce jugement a \u00e9t\u00e9 confirm\u00e9 en appel, les honorables juges Allard et Rivard dissidents. La compagnie Galibert porte maintenant cette cause devant nous.\nPour d\u00e9cider cet appel, il convient d'examiner les obligations et les droits respectifs des locateurs et locataires.\nLe locateur est oblig\u00e9 de procurer au locataire la jouissance compl\u00e8te et paisible de la chose lou\u00e9e (art. 1612-3, C.C.). En d'autres termes il est oblig\u00e9 de la garantir contre le vice de la chose lou\u00e9e et contre les troubles apport\u00e9s \u00e0 la jouissance.\nLes troubles sont de deux sortes; ils sont de fait ou de droit. Les troubles de fait sont r\u00e9gis par les articles 1616 et 1617 du code civil. Les troubles de droit. c'est-\u00e0-dire ceux qui consistent dans la pr\u00e9tention \u00e9lev\u00e9e par un tiers d'avoir sur la chose lou\u00e9e un droit de propri\u00e9t\u00e9, de servitude ou tout autre, sont r\u00e9gis par l'article 1618 du code civil.\nNous sommes dans la pr\u00e9sente cause en pr\u00e9sence d'un trouble de droit, c'est-\u00e0-dire d'une pr\u00e9tention \u00e9lev\u00e9e par Creelman et Tuckett que la compagnie Galibert ne pouvait pas occuper la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 lou\u00e9e apr\u00e8s le 1er mai 1920. Nous devons alors examiner l'article 1618 C.C. qui d\u00e9clare que\nsi le trouble est caus\u00e9 par suite d'une action concernant la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 ou tout autre droit dans et sur la chose lou\u00e9e, le locateur * * * est oblig\u00e9 de payer des dommages-int\u00e9r\u00e9ts suivant les circonstances, pourvu que le trouble ait \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9nonc\u00e9 par le locataire au locateur.\nDans le cas actuel, le trouble a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9nonc\u00e9 par le locataire, et le locateur a institu\u00e9 une action pour le faire cesser.\nJe comprends la situation difficile et dangereuse o\u00f9 se trouvait Galibert. Je reconnais que Creelman et Tuckett arm\u00e9s d'un acte de vente qui ne les obligeait pas de reconnaitre les baux existants, avaient apparemment le droit d'expulser la compagnie Galibert au 1er mai 1920 (art. 1663 & 2128 C.C.) et cette derni\u00e8re n'ayant pas un bail enregistr\u00e9 ne pouvait pas pr\u00e9tendre y rester jusqu'au 1er mai 1921. Je reconnais \u00e9galement que les exigences de son commerce lui imposaient l'obligation de se chercher un nouveau local si elle ne voulait pas s'exposer \u00e0 d\u00e9guerpir d'un jour \u00e0 l'autre et \u00e0 \u00eatre incapable de se trouver un logement convenable pour le maintien de son commerce et que c'\u00e9tait dangereux pour elle de s'en rapporter aux hasards d'un proc\u00e8s.\nMais tout cela la justifiait-elle de poursuivre son bailleur en dommages? Elle \u00e9tait menac\u00e9e d'\u00e9viction par Creelman et Tuckett. Ces derniers, au m\u00e9pris de leur convention avec Sharpe, ainsi que la preuve nous le rev\u00e9le maintenant, sont apr\u00e8s tout la cause de tout ce trouble. Leur pr\u00e9tention qu'ils avaient le droit de chasser la compagnie Galibert apr\u00e8s le 1er mai 1920 ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 mise \u00e0 n\u00e9ant sur leur propre aveu, je serais port\u00e9 \u00e0 croire qu'ils seraient eux responsables des dommages qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 caus\u00e9s. (Labori, vo. Bail, no. 144).\nLe bailleur Sharpe a fait tout son possible pour \u00e9carter la cause du trouble. Il a pris une action pour la faire cesser. Il est bien vrai qu'il n'avait pas dans son contrat de vente formellement stipul\u00e9 que ses acheteurs maintiendraient les baux, mais ces derniers s'\u00e9taient tout de m\u00eame oblig\u00e9s de le faire; et s'ils ont viol\u00e9 leurs obligations et s'ils ont expos\u00e9 par leur mauvaise foi la demanderesse, la compagnie Galibert, \u00e0 des dommages, Sharpe ne devait pas en \u00eatre tenu responsable, du moment qu'il a pris les proc\u00e9dures n\u00e9cessaires pour r\u00e9parer l'oubli qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 fait dans l'acte de vente.\nLes honorables juges Allard et Rivard sont d'opinion que le trouble a \u00e9t\u00e9 caus\u00e9 par le locateur lui-m\u00eame et que l'article 1618 ne doit pas s'appliquer au cas actuel. Le trouble a \u00e9t\u00e9 caus\u00e9 par Creelman et Tuckett. Il est vrai qu'ils se sont autoris\u00e9s d'une lacune dans leur acte de vente pour faire cette menace d'\u00e9viction. Mais il n'en reste pas moins av\u00e9r\u00e9 que Creelman et Tuckett sont les v\u00e9ritables auteurs du trouble.\nPour ces raisons l'appel doit \u00eatre renvoy\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens.\nMignault J.\u2014L'appelante avait lou\u00e9 un \u00e9tage d'une b\u00e2tisse appartenant \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9, et son bail devait encore durer un an et neuf mois environ quand, le 24 juillet 1919, l'intim\u00e9 vendit la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 Monsieur J. J. Creelman, C.R. qui la revendait ensuite \u00e0 The Tuckett Tobacco Company Limited. Les deux acheteurs donn\u00e8rent imm\u00e9diatement avis \u00e0 l'appelante qu'il lui faudrait \u00e9vacuer l'\u00e9difice le 1er mai 1920. La compagnie Galibert r\u00e9pondit que son bail lui donnait le droit d'occuper l'\u00e9tage en question pour une autre ann\u00e9e \u00e0 partir de cette derni\u00e8re date; mais les acheteurs pr\u00e9tendirent en retour qu'on ne pouvait invoquer contre eux ce bail puisqu'il n'avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 enregistr\u00e9. L'acte de vente ne mentionnait pas que la vente \u00e9tait sujette aux baux existants, bien que l'option qui en \u00e9tait la base cont\u00eent cette condition; et plus tard l'intim\u00e9 prit une action contre les acheteurs pour faire amender l'acte en y ins\u00e9rant l'obligation de respecter les baux et il obt\u00eent jugement en ce sens au mois d'octobre 1920.\nDans l'intervalle cependant l'appelante para\u00eet avoir omis de notifier l'intim\u00e9, son locateur, de l'avis qu'elle avait re\u00e7u des acheteurs et se mit en qu\u00eate d'un autre local. Ce n'est que le 18 mars 1920 que l'appelante fit servir un prot\u00eat \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9 d\u00e9clarant que les acheteurs l'avaient \u00e9vinc\u00e9e de la b\u00e2tisse, qu'elle s'\u00e9tait procur\u00e9 un autre local et qu'elle r\u00e9clamait $6,443.75 de dommages. L'intim\u00e9 r\u00e9pondit par un autre prot\u00eat \u00e0 l'effet que l'appelante n'\u00e9tait pas et ne pouvait pas \u00eatre \u00e9vinc\u00e9e de la b\u00e2tisse, que la vente avait r\u00e9ellement \u00e9t\u00e9 faite sujette aux baux, et que l'intim\u00e9 avait pris une action contre les acheteurs pour faire modifier l'acte de vente en y ins\u00e9rant cette condition qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 omise par oubli dans l'acte. Le 19 avril 1920, l'appelante loua un autre local d'un nomm\u00e9 Valiquette et y d\u00e9m\u00e9nagea. Elle prit alors cette action contre l'intim\u00e9, demandant jugement pour le montant ci-dessus mentionn\u00e9 pour dommages. Cette action a \u00e9t\u00e9 renvoy\u00e9e par la cour sup\u00e9rieure, et la cour du Banc du Roi a confirm\u00e9 le jugement, les honorables juges Allard et Rivard diff\u00e9rant. L'appelante en appelle maintenant \u00e0 cette cour.\nLa question \u00e0 d\u00e9cider est de savoir si dans les circonstances l'appelante a un droit d'action contre l'intim\u00e9.\nIl est hors de doute que le locateur doit procurer au locataire la jouissance paisible de la chose lou\u00e9e pendant la dur\u00e9e du bail (art. 1612). Mais apr\u00e8s avoir pos\u00e9 ce principe, le code distingue entre le trouble de fait, dont le bailleur n'est pas garant (art. 1616), et le trouble de droit dont il est responsable envers le locataire (art. 1618). Ce trouble de droit peut donner lieu soit \u00e0 une r\u00e9duction du loyer, soit \u00e0 une demande de dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats, suivant les circonstances, pourvu, dit l'article 1618, que le trouble ait \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9nonc\u00e9 par le locataire au locateur.\nLe locataire, n'\u00e9tant qu'un simple d\u00e9tenteur, n'a jamais qualit\u00e9 pour discuter le bien fond\u00e9 d'une action concernant la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 ou tout autre droit dans ou sur la chose lou\u00e9e. Cette action doit \u00eatre dirig\u00e9e contre le bailleur, propri\u00e9taire de la chose. Si le locataire prenait sur lui de contester cette action quand elle est \u00e0 tort dirig\u00e9e contre lui, il le ferait \u00e0 ses risques et p\u00e9rils. Du reste la loi lui fournit un moyen bien plus simple de s'en d\u00e9barrasser, car il peut demander cong\u00e9 de la demande en faisant conna\u00eetre au poursuivant le nom de son locateur (art. 1618). C'est ce dernier, je le rep\u00e8te, qui doit \u00eatre poursuivi quand il s'agit d'une telle action. Pothier (Louage, no. 91), parlant de l'action en garantie du locataire contre le bailleur, dit:\nIl y aura lieu \u00e0 cette action de garantie lorsque, sur la condamnation intervenue contre le locateur contre qui le tiers a \u00e9t\u00e9 renvoy\u00e9 \u00e0 se pourvoir, ou sur l'acquiescement donn\u00e9 par le locateur \u00e0 la demande de ce tiers, le locataire ou le fermier aura \u00e9t\u00e9 contraint de quitter la jouissance de l'h\u00e9ritage qu'il tenait \u00e0 ferme ou \u00e0 loyer, ou de partie d'icelui ou d'y souffrir l'exercice du droit de servitude pr\u00e9tendu par le demandeur.\nCe n'est que de ce jour, ou tout au plus du jour de la sommation de vider les lieux, faite au fermier ou locataire par ce tiers, en ex\u00e9cution de la sentence de condamnation intervenue contre le locateur au profit de ce tiers, ou de l'acquiescement du locateur \u00e0 la demande de ce tiers, que na\u00eet l'action ex conducto qu'a le fermier ou locataire contre le locateur, aux fins que le locateur soit tenu de le faire jouir, et que, faute par lui de le pouvoir faire, le dit locataire ou fermier sera d\u00e9charg\u00e9 de la ferme pour le restant du temps du bail, et le locateur condamn\u00e9 envers lui en ses dommages et int\u00e9r\u00eats.\nVoil\u00e0 la v\u00e9ritable doctrine de notre droit. La menace d'un trouble de droit ne suffit pas pour donner ouverture \u00e0 un recours en dommages du locataire contre le bailleur et sous ce rapport le louage et la vente sont soumis aux m\u00eames r\u00e8gles. Il faut qu'il y ait \u00e9viction consomm\u00e9e, ou au moins, dit Pothier, sommation au locataire de vider les lieux apr\u00e8s condamnation intervenue contre le bailleur.\nIci l'appelante, apr\u00e8s avoir re\u00e7u avis des acheteurs qu'ils l'expulseraient au 1er mai suivant, aurait d\u00fb d\u00e9noncer cet avis \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9 et le mettre en demeure d'\u00e9carter la menace d'\u00e9viction qui lui \u00e9tait faite.

Upon the insolvency of the bank the respondent, the Bank Commissioners of the State, sued the appellant upon the renewal note for the benefit of the bank's creditors.\nHeld, Idington J. dissenting, that under the law in force in the State of Washington, as proved by experts who referred to American statutes and precedents in support of their evidence, the appellant was estopped from raising a plea of want of consideration.\nPer Duff J.\u2014If such evidence is conflicting or obscure the court may examine and construe for itself the passages cited by the experts.\nJudgment of the Court of Appeal ([1922] 1 W.W.R. 646) affirmed, Idington J. dissenting.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1], affirming the judgment of Macdonald J. at the trial[2], and maintaining the respondent's action on a promissory note. The material facts of the case and the questions in issue are fully stated in the above head\u2014note and in the judgments now reported.\nCraig K.C. for the appellant.\u2014The appellant is not estopped from alleging want of consideration.\nThe fact that the appellant did not pay the note sued on is not a sufficient prejudice to create an estoppel.\nThe question of estoppel is to be decided by the law of British Columbia and not by the law of the State of Washington.\nThe trial judge did not accept the evidence of experts as it was, but made his own investigation of the American authorities and misconstrued the effect of some of them.\nD. L. McCarthy K.C.\u2014The appellant is estopped from denying liability according to the law of the State of Washington, as put in evidence by the experts.\nIDINGTON J. (dissenting).\u2014Respondent sued in his capacity of Bank Commissioner of the State of Washington upon a promissory note for $10,521.00 given by the appellant to the Northern Bank & Trust Company of which and by virtue of statutory enactments of said state the said respondent has become by reason of its insolvency the administrator and as such entitled, instead of said bank, to sue upon said promissory note.\nThere never was any consideration for said promissory note. It therefore never was a valid security. This is established by the evidence of appellant and a memorandum of agreement given by the president of the bank cotemporaneously with the giving of the said note. It is sought, and so far successfully, before the learned trial judge and in the Court of Appeal, to overcome that difficulty be virtue of the law, it is said, estopping the appellant from setting up any such defence under the circumstances in question which are alleged to have constituted fraud on the part of the appellant.\nTo render such an estoppel in pais an effective answer to the defence of no valuable consideration, there must be shown on the part of the party setting up such an estoppel, not only the existence of actual misrepresentation or fraud, but also that the party contracted with was ignorant thereof and was thereby induced to change his position on the faith of it.\nSuch, as I understand the evidence of the expert giving the law of the State of Washington, is the law of that state on the issue thus raised herein, as it is our law on the subject.\nThe only doubt created as to such statement of the law was the hesitation of the witness as to the effect of the decision by the Supreme Court of that state in the case of Moore v. Kildall[3], to which he referred the learned trial judge for his consideration.\nI find, on reading it for myself therefore, that the court found and, as I agree, correctly so, if I may be permitted to say so, that there was in fact valuable consideration for the note in question therein.\nI am unable, therefore, to attach much importance to that case for what we are concerned with herein.\nThe estoppel, as pleaded in some of the pleas, sets up the misleading of the state examiner as something the respondent can rely upon.\nThere seem to be several answers thereto. It is the claim of the bank that is here in question. And there is no evidence that the bank was either misled or that it was induced in any way to change its position by reason of the alleged fraud.\nThe evidence in support of the claim of the respondent so far as the evidence before us goes, proves that he, by virtue of his taking over the administration of the assets, stands on no higher ground than that of the bank itself.\nAnd if the evidence of such officers as had the duty at various times of examining the bank's assets is to be considered at all, it falls very far short of maintaining any such pretension as set up. Indeed on the contrary, it shews for the most part that the result would have been the same.\nAnd if the suggestion in respondent's factum that Moore was only the examiner and not the commissioner is worth considering, we have no evidence of that officer who was then the superior of Moore.\nIn short, despite what counsel sets up that the burden of proof is on the appellant, I submit it clearly is upon him pleading any defence to prove it, and this has not been done, or pretended to have been done, by anything presented in this case.\nTo render the contention, if possible, more absurd this note was given before the statute law was changed, as it was in 1917, to render it more drastic, and there is no pretence that it was retroactive so far as the evidence goes. The references in same and in respondent's factum to Remington's Code are not very helpful as these books are not available.\nIndeed we have cases cited to us from American authorities, in other jurisdiction than Washington State, which are of no more binding force on the Washington courts than they would be on us. We are asked to extend the law of estoppel in pais beyond anything sworn to be the law of Washington, and far beyond anything in our own law, in a way that we should not for a moment countenance.\nThe conduct of the appellant may have been the result of crass stupidity, or of deliberate fraud, but that is, I most respectfully submit, no reason for our departing from the principle of the law, which is to take the law of a foreign state from the sworn evidence of expert witnesses testifying thereto, and so far as that is not established thereby relying upon our own law.\nTo confuse the duty towards the party to the contract with that due to someone else is as yet no part of our law and is not proven to be the law of Washington.\nThe case cited by counsel for respondent of Smith v. Kay[4], is in no way applicable to what is in question herein. That was indeed the converse of this case. Indeed it suggests rather the thought that the fraud in question herein was one joined in by the bank, if not wholly the product of the bank, and hence suggests another remedy for the kind of fraud involved herein than can be afforded in such cases as this.\nThe joint effort of the bank and the appellant to deceive may have laid a foundation for an action of deceit, but that would not help here where only the neat question of the proper application of the doctrine of estoppel in pais is all that should concern us.\nThe appeal should be allowed with costs throughout.\nDUFF J.\u2014It is not disputed that the plaintiff must fail if the right of recovery depends upon the rules of the law of British Columbia. It is therefore incumbent upon him to prove the law of the State of Washington. This he must prove as matter of fact by the evidence of persons who are experts in that law. These experts may, however, refer to codes and precedents in support of their evidence and the passages and references cited by them will be treated as part of their testimony; and it is settled law that if the evidence of such witnesses is conflicting or obscure the Court may go a step further and examine and construe the passages cited for itself in order to arrive at a satisfactory conclusion. Nelson v. Bridporl[5]; Bremer v. Freeman[6]; Di Sora v. Phillipps[7]; Concha v. Murietta[8]; Rice v. Gunn[9].\nIn Bremner v. Freeman[10], Lord Wensleydale's judgment delivered on behalf of the Privy Council included a most searching examination of the French authorities bearing upon the point of French law in dispute.\nI think, applying these principles, the learned trial judge, Mr. Justice Macdonald, was entitled to examine the authorities upon.which he relied. The decision in Moore v. Kildall[11] was based upon more than one ground; but the substantive ground upon which the court proceeded in pronouncing the judgment was that the note sued upon, having been given for the express purpose of enabling the officials of the bank to present a false appearance of assets, the plaintiff was, representing as he did the interests of the creditors, entitled to insist as against the defendant that the instrument sued upon was an enforceable obligation. The court cited with approval and relied on a passage quoted from a decision of the Supreme Court of Illinois in the case of Golden v. Cervenka[12]. That passage in full is in the following words:\u2014 Where notes or other securities have been executed to a bank for the purpose of making an appearance of assets, so as to deceive the examiner and enable the bank to continue business, although the circumstances may have been such that the bank itself could not have collected the securities, it has been held that the receiver, representing the creditors, could maintain the action and the makers were estopped upon the insolvency of the bank, to allege want of consideration. Hurd v. Kelly[13]; Best v. Thiel[14]; Sickles v. Herold[15]; State Bank of Pillsburg v. Kirk[16]; Peoples' Bank v. Stroud[17]; Dominion Trust Co. v. Ridall[18]; Lyons v. Benney[19]. In one such case (Lyons v. Benney, supra) the defence was set up by an affidavit which the court held insufficient, saying:\"\u2014\n\"The substance of this affidavit of defence is that the appellant made and delivered his note to the bank in furtherance of a scheme to deceive the bank examiner, under a promise made to him by the bank that he would not be held liable upon the obligation. He agreed that it should appear as one of the assets of the institution for the purpose of deceiving those whose duty it was to examine them, and he now sets up the defense that, as it was to serve no other purpose, it is to be regarded as a worthless piece of paper under this agreement with the bank * * * . So this appellant was a party to a scheme of the officers of the bank to enable them to make a deceptive and fraudulent showing of assets, and as the fraud was perpetrated upon the creditors now represented by the bank's receiver, he can maintain an action on the note for their benefit * * * . Neither the law nor good conscience can sanction the contention of the defendant that he ought to be permitted to take advantage of the fraudulent agreement between him and the bank to which its creditors were not parties and for whom the receiver sues.\"\nOne of the decisions mentioned in this passage, Lyons v. Benney[20] a decision of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania is referred to by the learned trial judge; and the court in that case cited and relied upon the following passage from the judgment of Ross J. delivered in Pauly v. O'Brien[21], in the Circuit Court of California. In his judgment Ross J. says at pp. 461-2:\u2014\nIf, however, this was not really the case, but that, in truth, the transaction was a mere trick to make it appear to the government and to the creditors and stockholders of the bank that it had a valuable note when in fact it did not have one, the result must be the same, for, when parties employ legal instruments of an obligatory character for fraudulent and deceitful purposes, it is sound reason, as well as pure justice, to leave him bound who has bound himself. It will never do for the courts to hold that the officers of a bank, by the connivance of a third party, can give to it the semblance of solidity and security, and when its insolvency is disclosed, that the third party can escape the consequences of his fraudulent act. Undoubtedly, the transaction in question originated with the officers of the bank, but to it the defendant became a willing party. It would require more credulity than I possess to believe that the defendant, when his brother, who was the book-keeper of the bank, came to him with the proposition of its vicepresident, in its every suggestion and essence deceptive and fraudulent, did not know its true character and purpose. So far as appears, Naylor was a total stranger to him. Why should he execute his note to take up the note of Naylor? What moved him to do it, except to enable the officers of the bank to supplant the overdue note of Naylor with a live note, which he now insists was without consideration and purely voluntary, but which enabled the bank officers to make a deceptive and therefore fraudulent, showing of assets? Obviously nothing. There will be judgment for the plaintiff for the amount due upon the note sued upon, according to its terms, with costs.\nThe law as laid down in this passage cited from the judgment of Ross J. delivered in 1895 and in that cited from the judgment of Dunn J. speaking on behalf of the Supreme Court of Illinois, in 1917, appears from the evidence given in this case to be the law of the State of Washington.\nMr. Craig in a very able argument contended that the oral witnesses who spoke as to the law of the State of Washington deposed in effect that the liability of the defendant, if it existed at all, arose from the application of the general principle of estoppel in pais, being conditioned consequently by the existence of the constituents of estoppel including a change of position on part of the party relying upon the estoppel brought about in consequence of the conduct of the other party. I think if Mr. Craig's minor premise is sound, namely, that the rule invoked by the plaintiff does rest upon a strict application of the doctrine of estoppel as recognized in the law of the State of Washington as well as in English law his conclusions necessarily follow. But in truth this premise is much more than doubtful; the cause of action and the only cause of action vested in the plaintiff is the bank's cause of action; to that he succeeds by force of the statute and if the principles of the common law were to be applied it is quite plain that nothing done by the defendant with the concurrence of the bank could, consistently with such principles, preclude the defendant from resisting the bank's claim.\nThe rule expounded in the authorities already referred to is a rule resting on broader and deeper principles. The statutory custodian of the property of the insolvent corporation while he succeeds to the assets of the corporation does so primarily in the interest of the creditors and (although in the first instance his right to the assets is not the right of the creditors but the right of the corporation in liquidation), the legal relations of the corporation undergo some alteration by reason of the change of status involved in its statutory dissolution and the rule above mentioned has been established as a rule of policy, a rule required in such circumstances by justice and convenience. A person who has participated in an attempt on the part of officials of the corporation to present a false appearance of prosperity and for that purpose has been content to represent himself as a debtor of the company is not permitted to deny the existence in law of this liability; but this rule is a substantive rule of law, it is not a mere rule of evidence. It is analogous to the rule by which a person improperly placed on the list of shareholders of a joint stock company and entitled therefore to have his name removed must act promptly. If he fail to act promptly he will be denied relief and in winding up proceedings will be compelled to pay for the shares, because it is conclusively presumed against him that the presence of his name has added to the credit of the company.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nANGLIN J.\u2014If the plaintiff, in order to succeed, were obliged to establish the facts necessary to make a case of estoppel against the defendant, including proof of prejudice ascribable to the defendant's conduct, I should be of the opinion that such a case was not made out. But the evidence in the record establishes to my satisfaction that it is a rule of substantive law in the State of Washington that\none giving a note as \"live paper\" to make an appearance of assets so as to deceive the bank examiner is estopped, on the insolvency of the bank, to allege want of consideration.\nMoore v. Kildall[22]; Barto v. Nix[23]; Skagit State Bank v. Moody[24]. That is undoubtedly what the defendant did in the present case.\nOther cases cited at bar and in the judgments delivered in the Court of Appeal indicate that a similar rule obtains in other American jurisdictions. Lyons v. Benney (Penn.),[25]; Pauly v. O'Brien (Cal.)[26]; Golden v. Cervenka (III.)[27].\nThe judgment holding the defendant liable was in my opinion right and should be upheld. BRODEUR J.\u2014The action is on a promissory note, and is instituted by the Bank Commissioner of the State of Washington. In 1914, the defendant Allen, who was then living in the United States, gave an accommodation note to The Northern Bank & Trust Company for the purpose of making an appearance of assets so as to deceive the Bank examiner. The Northern Bank & Trust Company, in spite of these misrepresentations as to its assets, had, a few years later, to be put in the hands of the Bank Commissioner of the State who, according to the laws of the State of Washington, proceeded to the liquidation of the affairs of the bank. He found among the assets Allen's promissory note; and as Mr. Allen is now living in British Columbia he is sued before the courts of this province by the bank examiner for the payment of this note.\nHis defence is that there was a total failure of consideration.\nThis case has to be decided by the laws of the State of Washington where the note was signed and the liability was incurred.\nThere is no doubt that no consideration was given. But it is contended by the Bank Commissioner Hay that, according to the laws of the State of Washington a note given in similar circumstances can be sued upon by the official liquidator of the bank.\nThis note was evidently given for a fraudulent purpose viz., for the purpose of showing in the bank returns assets which did not in reality exist, and also for the purpose of inducing the public to deposit their moneys in the bank. Very severe laws have been passed in that state in order to put an end to such fraudulent transactions; and the jurisprudence is to the effect that the Bank Commissioner could sue on these notes though they were originally given without consideration.\nIn a case of Golden v. Cervenka[28], the Supreme Court of Illinois, where similar legislation exists, decided that\nwhere notes or other securities have been executed to a bank for the purpose of making an appearance of assets, so as to deceive the Examiner and enable the bank to continue business although the circumstances may have been that the bank could not have collected the securities, it has been held that the receiver representing the creditors could maintain the action and the makers were estopped upon the insolvency of the bank to allege want of consideration.\nIn two cases of Lyons v. Benny[29], and Pauly v. O'Brien[30], the principle of law which was enunciated is that the giving of such notes is a fraud upon the creditors of the bank.\nA decision of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Washington rendered in 1920 is to the same effect. It was held in the case of Moore v. Kildall[31], that \"one giving a note as live paper\" to make an appearance of assets so as to deceive the bank examiners is estopped on the insolvency of the bank from alleging want of consideration.\nIt is contended by the defendant that the prejudice which is essential to constitute in a case of estoppel has not been proven in this case.\nWe have in this case facts which are absolutely similar to those that were in issue in Moore v. Kildall(4) and there is no doubt, according to my opinion, that if Allen was still living in the State of Washington and had been sued there he would have been condemned to pay the note. We have then here to apply the same principles of law and to render the same decision as should have been rendered there, and even if our general notions as to the application of the rule of estoppel are violated in some respects we have to disregard these notions and apply the law as it is enunciated in the Washington decisions.\nI consider that the appellant has been legally condemned to pay his note and that his appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nMIGNAULT J.\u2014There is no difficulty here as to the facts. The defendant appellant, without consideration, signed at the request of one Phillips, then President of the Northern Bank and Trust Company of Seattle, State of Washington, a note for $10,000.00 in favour of the said bank, and a year later, at the request of one Collier, who had replaced Phillips as president of the bank, he signed a renewal note for a like amount, receiving from Phillips and subsequently from Collier a written acknowledgement that there was to be no liability under the note and its renewal. This note was given to the bank to create a false appearance of assets and so deceive the State bank examiner and prevent the closing up of the bank.\nThe law to be applied is that of the State of Washington, proved by expert witnesses. The respondent, the Bank Commissioner of that State, is entitled to sue on this note. He represents the bank and its creditors. The vital question is whether in a suit by the Bank Commissioner, acting on behalf of the creditors of the insolvent bank as well as of the bank itself, the appellant is estopped from setting up the collateral agreement with the bank that he should not be liable on this note?\nI think, according to the evidence made of the law of estoppel in force in the State of Washington, and under the decisions cited by the learned trial judge, who was referred to them by the expert witness called by the appellant for a statement of the law governing estoppel in the State of Washington, that the appellant is estopped from raising the defence of non-liability or want of consideration against the respondent.\nMy only doubt, at the hearing, was whether prejudice to the creditors, necessary for estoppel, had been shewn. But I think on consideration that prejudice must be assumed, for to allow an insolvent bank to continue in business by a show of fictitious assets is certainly prejudicial to all who deal with the bank and acquire rights against it. It may well be that had the appellant not given his note, the bank might have been allowed by the bank examiner to remain open for a further period, but that is merely a surmise, and too much reliance must not be placed on the statement of Moore, one of the bank examiners, that he thinks he would not have done more than he did had the appellant's note not been exhibited to him. But the intention, to which the appellant weakly allowed himself to become a party, was unquestionably to deceive the State bank examiner, and under these circumstances the decisions which, in the State of Washington, are accepted as the law and which apply to such a case the doctrine of estoppel, are consonant with the true principles of justice and fair dealing, and I think they fully support the judgment appealed from.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Craig & Parkes.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Tiffin & Alexander.\n[1] [1922] 1 W.W.R. 646.\n[2] 29 B.C.

(Defendant) Respondent.\n1922: May 3, 4; 1922: June 17.\nPresent: Sir Louis Davies C.J. and Idington, Duff, Anglin, Brodeur and Mignault JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR BRITISH COLUMBIA.\nInsurance\u2014Marine\u2014Floating policy\u2014Facts subsequent to its execution\u2014Insured barge\u2014Unseaworthiness\u2014Previous uninsurability\u2014Non-disclosure.\nThe appellant issued to the respondent a floating policy of marine insurance to cover wood pulp during transportation (including loading) between certain termini. The respondent chartered a barge; while in the course of being loaded, she sank at respondent's wharf. The respondent, being bound to \"declare\" all shipments made and to pay premiums thereon at rates fixed by a schedule to the policy, complied with these conditions as to the above cargo and the premium was accepted by the appellant. The claim for insurance was also paid by the appellant; but, subsequently, it took an action to recover the amount on the ground that the barge was unseaworthy and uninsurable to the knowledge of the respondent at the time the cargo was declared and the premium paid.\nHeld, that the appellant was liable under the floating policy. The evidence did not show that the respondent had known of the unseaworthiness of the barge. As all the conditions of the policy had been complied with, the appellant would have been bound even if the fact of the uninsurability of the barge had been communicated to it so that the non-disclosure of that fact, although known by the respondent at the time the premium was paid, did not vitiate the contract.\nJudgment of the Court of Appeal ([1922] 1 W.W.R. 679) affirmed. APPEAL from the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1], reversing the judgment of Murphy J. at the trial and dismissing the appellant's action.\nThe appellant issued to the respondent a floating policy of marine insurance to cover wood pulp to be transported from Mill Creek, near Vancouver, \"in the ship or vessel called the steamers approved, including risk of North Bend barge and 2 scows.\" The respondent chartered a barge or scow called the Baramba from the Kingsley Navigation Company, of Vancouver and sent her to Mill Creek to be loaded and while in the course of being loaded she sank at respondent's wharf. The claim for insurance was paid. After proceedings had been commenced against the Kingsley Navigation Company by the appellant, who had been subrogated to respondent's rights, for damages, the appellant alleged that they discovered that the respondent was aware of the unseaworthiness of the Baramba prior to loading and had not disclosed this fact to the appellant. The latter then discontinued that action and sued the respondent to recover the insurance money paid to them.\nThe trial judge found that the Baramba was unseaworthy but that the respondent did not consider her so; but he also found that the respondent did know that she had been refused insurance, and on that ground he maintained the appellant's action.\nThe Court of Appeal reversed the judgment of the trial judge on practically the same grounds as the Supreme Court of Canada, McPhillips, J.A., dissented, held that the material fact of the uninsurability of the barge should have been disclosed.

Newcombe for the appellant.\u2014The duty of an insurer is to make a full disclosure to the underwriter of every material fact which might, if correct, affect the contract of insurance, otherwise such contract is void.\nThe respondent did not disclose to the appellant the following facts known to them, i.e., that the Baramba was unseaworthy and that no insurance could be obtained upon her.\nW. N. Tilley K.C. and A. H. Douglas for the respondent.\u2014There is no duty of disclosure upon an assured at any time after the formation of a contract such as the one in this case. Ionides v. The Pacific Fire and Marine Insurance Co.[2]. The Baramba was not unseaworthy to the knowledge of the respondent at the time of her sailing. The appellant had absolved the respondent from any duty of disclosure, if such duty had existed.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014For the reasons stated by my brother Anglin, with which I fully concur, I am of the opinion that this appeal must be dismissed with costs.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014I think for the reasons respectively assigned by the learned Chief Justice and Mr. Justice Martin in the Court of Appeal (taken as a whole, for each covers different ground) with which I entirely agree, that this appeal should be dismissed with costs throughout.\nI desire, however, in deference to the argument of counsel presented here, to add a few words. The action is in principle founded upon a mistake of fact and, if well founded, might as well have been brought by resorting to the simple old fashioned count of a case for money had and received.\nThat was long ago declared by Lord Mansfield in the case of Moses v. Macferlan[3], to be a form of action in which the question raised is whether or not it is inequitable that the defendant should retain the money he has been paid.\nThe facts presented here fall far short of fulfilling such a condition and hence the money should remain where it is.\nThe policy was specifically amended so as to avert any reliance upon an implied warranty of seaworthiness in the vessel that might be in question. Hence the appellant's counsel frankly admits that even if unseaworthy he could not rely upon that alone.\nYet he tries to induce us to believe that if the facts come to the knowledge of the respondent that the owner of the vessel had said something tending to shew the vessel was uninsurable though in good condition and fitted for the service she was to be put to in quiet inland or almost inland waters, that if the appellant had been told this same story its agents would, beyond doubt, have rejected the risk so to be taken.\nI am not quite sure that he consistently stated his proposition quite so broadly for at times and for the most part he put it as if connected with the fact of undoubted unseaworthiness.\nI do think, however, that unless the story can be relied on as ground of relief quite independently of that question, there is nothing to stand upon unless fraud, which is not argued for. I fail to see how its connection with either seaworthiness or unseaworthiness is at all material in this case where it is not contended that respondent knew it was so and if it is so put the evidence contradicts it.\nHe in effect asks us to assume that appellant would, beyond doubt, have, if told the story in question, rejected the declaration made by the respondent. I certainly cannot accept that as proven.\nNor, in face of the overwhelming evidence that such barges and scows as in the service this one was engaged for, would not be insured by a large part of the insurers in the Vancouver district and by the other part only when induced by the chance of obtaining thereby other large and important business, can I believe that the appellant, doubtless well aware of that condition of the insurance business there, would have paid any attention to such a story as of any significance, any more than respondent did.\nIt is shewn that a very large part of the business handled by the respondent was for the long time the appellant was its insurer of pulp so carried by what were practically uninsurable scows and barges. Yet not a word of inquiry as to whether these vessels were insured or insurable in that district.\nSurely, if faith is to be kept by business men, these now laying stress upon an omission which had consistently been observed throughout, as if quite permissible, cannot be permitted to be thus treacherously set up.\nThe only difference (if it is one, which is not clear from the evidence) in this case would seem to be that the owner of this barge, now in question, refused to accept the risk and insisted and had his way that respondent become its own insurer by agreeing to return the Baramba in same good condition as got. The Baramba was, twice before the occasion now in question, used under more onerous conditions than existed at the loading under which she sank.\nThe mystery has not been solved.\nThe appellant got Mr. Cullington, an expert, to try to solve it. He did not. Of course he tells us how it was possible for water to have got in through certain holes, but these holes were there for all the prior trips and under as heavy loading as had taken place when she began to sink.\nThe Baramba had been duly declared to the appellant by respondent, and the accident duly reported on the 25th of February, and Mr. Cullington immediately summoned by the appellant to investigate, which he did, twice, yet no solution that appeals to one's common sense in light of the immediately preceding history or its carrying powers.\nThe appellant was not surprised nor did it ask any questions of the respondent as to past history or relation between the owner and respondent, and yet it agreed to pay on the 14th of April, six weeks after the curious accident, the amount found due, and nearly two years later the balance of same arising out of general average.\nIt seems asking too much to try to make of a most equitable principle of our law the basis for a most inequitable operation of the law.\nI am, therefore, not surprised to find that the appellant has been unable to cite to us any case in which anything like what it asks us to decide was ever decided, much less decided in its way of presenting the law.\nIt cites case of actions by insured against insurer in which were set up a variety of defences of failure to disclose something material. What might be material and have weight in such a case is very far from being the same as setting it up by way of founding an action to recover back money voluntarily paid.\nThe only case it cites of that kind is the case of Kelly v. Solari[4] where, through the clearest inadvertence, the insurance company had, when paying life insurance, included the amount of a policy which had not only expired, but been marked so.\nYet in so clear a case of mistake of fact, which is the only basis for this action, as it was for that, the court had to give a second trial.\nI fail to see the semblance between the two cases if we have any regard to the principles to be observed.\nA mere voluntary payment, as this may have been for aught we ought to care, is not recoverable whatever the motives behind it on the part of appellant so paying.\nHaving referred to all the cases cited by the appellant and then turned to respondent's citations, I imagine the decisions in the judgments, especially that of Willes J. in the case of Thompson v. Hopper [5], sets forth what is still good law and a safe guide.\nDUFF J.\u2014This action is brought to recover moneys paid to the respondent by the appellant company under an insurance policy covering pulp, the policy having been issued by the appellant to the respondent.\nThe insurance was on\nwood pulp, * * * shipped, or to be shipped, per steamers approved or held covered from Howe Sound to Vancouver (including risk per scows &\/or North Bend barge) &\/or Seattle and thence per steamer approved or held covered to a direct port in Japan. On the policy there was indorsed a memorandum by the appellant that\nseaworthiness of the vessel as between the assured and the assurers is hereby admitted.\nIn February, 1919, the defendant hired a craft named the Baramba and on the 25th of that month, while the Baramba was being loaded with pulp which the respondent company intended to ship to Japan by way of Vancouver, she sank and the pulp was lost. The defendant declared the cargo under the policy and on the 31st of March, 1919, paid the premium according to rates provided by the policy, and on the 14th of April, 1919, the plaintiff paid to the defendant the sum of $12,715.20, the amount of the respondent company's loss.\nThe appellant company having first sued the owners of the Baramba for breach of a warranty of seaworthiness under an assignment to them by the defendant of the defendant's rights, and the action having been discontinued upon the discovery that no such warranty could be established, the appellant company brought the action out of which the present appeal arises, alleging that at the time the insurance was effected, that is to say, when the premium was paid and accepted by the appellant, the respondent company was aware of the fact that the Baramba was an uninsurable craft and that this fact ought to have been disclosed to the appellant company when the cargo was declared under the policy, and that for default in this duty of disclosure the contract of insurance effected by declaration and the acceptance of the premium was voidable at the option of the appellant company. The payment of the loss in April was, the appellant company alleges, a payment in ignorance of facts entitling them to avoid the policy and a payment consequently which they are entitled to revoke as made under a mistake of fact.\nThe appellant company relied also upon another ground. It was contended that the Baramba when she sank was in such a state as to be utterly unfit for the carriage of cargo even from Mill Creek to Vancouver; that the respondent company was aware of this and that the loading of the cargo in such circumstances was a wrongful act, which was the real cause of the respondent company's loss, a loss for which upon the sound principle that a plaintiff is not entitled to recover reparation for damages resulting from his own wrongful act, the appellant company was not obliged to make good under its policy. As to this I think the appeal fails because I think the evidence does not establish that the officials of the respondent company can have seriously doubted that the Baramba was in a fit state to carry a cargo from Howe Sound to Vancouver.\nThe conditions of the appellant company's right to recover are of course, first, that the moneys paid in April were paid under a mistake of fact and, second, that this mistake arose from the supposition of the appellant company of the existence of a state of facts which did not exist but which if it had existed would have disentitled the respondent company to the moneys paid.\nIn the view I take of the appeal, the question of substance is: Were the moneys paid under a mistake of fact which was relevant in the sense above indicated? I think it sufficiently appears that the appellant company was not aware of the fact that the respondent company knew the Baramba to be uninsurable, although the evidence does not convince me that the appellant company did not know the condition of the Baramba and the probable state of the respondent company's knowledge with respect to her condition at the time the premium was paid.\nBut was the plaintiff company's ignorance of the respondent company's non-disclosure of the uninsurability of the craft a relevant mistake\u2014a mistake within the meaning of the rule? That depends upon the answer to this question: Did the fact of non-disclosure absolve them from the obligation to pay in execution of which the moneys were paid?\nNow the obligation to pay under which they acted was undoubtedly the obligation of the policy. The cargo was declared under the policy; the premium was paid and accepted under the policy; the insurance moneys were paid as moneys due under the policy. That this was so in fact is on the evidence incontrovertible.\nThe cargo was treated as a cargo covered by the policy, notwithstanding the fact that the appellant company was fully aware of the character of the Baramba.\nIt is now said indeed that the policy did not contemplate shipment from Howe Sound in barges but only in scows, except in the case of the barge North Bend and that, consequently, a shipment by the Baramba which it is said was a barge and not a scow was not covered by the policy.\nBut it is to be observed not only that the character of the Baramba herself was known when the insurance moneys were paid; but as the appellant company admits, the appellant company had acquiesced in the use by the defendant company of barges other than the North Bend for shipment from Howe Sound, and that the cargoes so shipped had been treated as cargoes under the policy.\nIf, therefore, there was any mistake in this connection there was no mistake of fact. It could only be a mistake as to the construction of the policy and a mistake in this sense that in point of law the policy is incapable of a construction such as would cover shipment by a craft like the Baramba.\nNow in construing a commercial contract such as this policy, it is unquestionably open to the parties to show that in the locality in which the contract is made and is to operate a word such as the word \"scow\" is commonly used and understood to denote craft of a particular kind. The word \"scow\" is not a word of fixed legal significance and therefore such evidence would be admissible. And when one reads the evidence, noting the application of the words \"scow\" and \"barge\" by witnesses who must be familiar with the uses of such terms in Vancouver and Seattle, and indeed when one refers to the pleadings, one is left without a doubt that had the contention been put forward at the early stages of the litigation it would inevitably have raised a contest on the meaning of the word \"barge\" in such a contract and it is therefore too late now to rely upon it.\nSuch being the scope of the policy, was there any legal duty of disclosure resting on the respondent company? I think there was no such duty. The contract of insurance had been effected, the subject matter had been ascertained, the seaworthiness had been admitted of all craft within the contemplation of it; and the risk attached as soon as the conditions of the policy were complied with. Mr. Davis' con- tention as to the premium must, I think, be rejected; the premium was fixed by the policy itself. The case cited by the Chief Justice in the court below, Ionides v. Pacific Fire and Marine Ins. Co.[6], seems to be in point and is conclusive.\nI think the appeal fails and should be dismissed with costs.\nANGLIN J.\u2014The floating insurance in question covered any and all \"declared\" cargoes of pulp belonging to the respondent during transportation (including loading) between certain termini. The respondent was bound to \"declare\" all such shipments and to pay premiums thereon at rates fixed by a schedule to the policy and, as I read the policy, the appellant was obliged to insure the respondent, at the appropriate rate so fixed, against loss of, or injury to, any such cargo so declared. In the absence of fraud upon the policy in the making of the declaration (as there would have been in declaring the shipment by the Baramba if the respondent had known of her unseaworthiness, Thompson v. Hopper[7]), the appellant could not reject the insurance of any declared shipment however unseaworthy the craft on which it was, or was to be, transported from Mill Creek to an \"approved\" steamship either at Vancouver or Seattle, as the case might be, provided such craft was a scow or the North Bend barge. Ionides v. Pacific Fire and Marine Insurance Co.[8]. The practice of allowing the plaintiff to use any scow or barge it chose for the transportation from Mill Creek to the steamship's side seems to have been well established.\nThe shipment in respect of which the loss occurred was undoubtedly to be carried by the Baramba from Mill Creek to Vancouver. The rate of premium for pulp shipped via Vancouver was fixed in the schedule to the policy at 5-8% from Howe Sound to Japan whether a scow or the barge North Bend\u2014or, according to the practice, any other barge\u2014was employed to transport the cargo from Mill Creek to Vancouver. By some error\u2014probably due to the date having been given as the 17th of February instead of the 25th\u2014the shipment was treated by the appellant as having been intended to be carried via Seattle instead of via Vancouver, and consequently the rate of premium was inserted by it at 1 1-8% instead of 5-8%. If, as I think, the appellant had no option to reject the insurance of the cargo in question because of any exception that it might have taken, when the respondent's declaration was communicated, to the use of the Baramba, the rate of premium being also fixed, as it was, it is difficult to appreciate the materiality of non-disclosure of the fact that the Baramba could not be insured. Ionides v. Pender [9]; Ionides v. Pacific Fire and Marine Insurance Co.[10].\nThe evidence fully warranted the findings of the learned trial judge that the Baramba was unseaworthy, but that that fact was not known to the respondent, and also that the respondent was aware that the Baramba could not be insured when it was last hired. That her unseaworthiness was the cause of her sinking was, I think, the only inference reasonably open on the evidence. The voyage from Mill Creek to Vancouver on inland waters involved very slight risk to the Baramba. The respondent readily assumed that risk and itself became the insurer of it to her owners. It was no doubt believed that the Baramba would make the trip in perfect safety.\nUpon this state of facts the declaration of the cargo intended to be sent by the Baramba from Mill Creek to Vancouver was not such a fraud on the policy as would avoid the risk. Thompson v. Hopper [11].\nThe loss was not paid by the plaintiff under mistake as to any facts which, if known, would have afforded it a valid defence to the respondent's claim under the policy. The existence of such facts has not been shown.\nI would for these reasons uphold the judgment appealed from and dismiss this appeal with costs.\nBRODEUR J.\u2014I concur with my brother Idington.\nMIGNATULT J.\u2014I concur in the judgment dismissing this appeal.\nThe appellant had insured the defendant's shipments under a floating policy. While a shipment of pulp was being loaded on a barge called The Baramba the barge sank and the loss was incurred. In due time the appellant paid this loss to the respondent, but subsequently took an action to recover back the money paid, alleging that the payment had been made in error on substantially two grounds: 1, that the barge was unseaworthy to the knowledge of the respondent; 2, that no insurance could be obtained on this barge, and that the respondent although aware of this fact had failed to disclose it to the appellant. The learned trial judge found that the barge was unseaworthy, but that the respondent had no knowledge of its unseaworthiness. He, however, came to the conclusion that the respondent company knew that the barge could not be insured and for that reason he rendered judgment in favour of the appellant.\nThe Court of Appeal set aside this judgment agreeing with the trial court that, although the barge was unseaworthy, the respondent was not aware of it, which was shewn by the fact that the respondent had undertaken to return the barge in good condition to its owners. And as to the non-disclosure of the fact that the barge had been refused insurance, the learned Chief Justice of British Columbia did not consider that non-disclosure of such a fact coming to the knowledge of the insured only after a policy of this description, i.e., a ship or ships policy, was issued, would vitiate the contract. Mr. Justice McPhillips dissented from the judgment of the Court of Appeal.\nHad the respondent been aware of the unseaworthiness of The Baramba, the concealment of this fact, when the respondent declared its shipment to the appellant, would have amounted to fraud. But no such knowledge is proved. No doubt the respondent was aware that the barge had been refused insurance. It is, however, suggested that insurance companies as a rule refuse to insure barges. And unless refusal of insurance on this barge brought home to the respondent the knowledge that it was unseaworthy, and that has not been shewn, I do not think that refusal of insurance for other reasons than unseaworthiness, for instance, because barges in general are not considered by insurers as desirable risks (a fact which the appellant company must have known), was something which under the policy in question should have been disclosed to the insurer under pain of forfeiture of the right to claim the insurance.\nOn the question whether The Baramba came within the description of the policy, this was a fact which could have been ascertained by the appellant before it paid the insurance. I am therefore not impressed by the contention that it was not a \"scow\" within the meaning of the policy.\nI would not disturb the judgment appealed from.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Davis & Company.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Bowser, Reid, Wallbridge, Douglas & Gibson.\n[1] [1922] 1 W.W.R. 679.\n[2] [1871] L.R. 6 Q.B. 674.\n[3] [1760] 2 Birr. 1005, at p. 1010.\n[4] [1841] 9 M. & W. 54.\n[5] [1858] E.

The action was begun after the 1st July, 1920. By the judgment pronounced at the trial, the plaintiff recovered $1,974.57, including interest to the date of the judgment. An appeal to the Court of Appeal was dismissed. Special leave to appeal was not asked for, and the defendant gave notice of appeal to this court. The question was as to the construction of see. 40 of the \"Supreme Court Act,\" as enacted by 10-11 Geo. V., c. 32, which reads as follows:\nWhere the right to appeal or to apply for special leave to appeal is dependent on the amount or value of the matter in controversy, such amount or value may be proved by affidavit, and it shall not include interest subsequent to the date on which the judgment to be appealed from was pronounced or any costs.\nBy sec. 39, it is provided that:\nExcept as otherwise provided by sections thirty-seven and forty-three, notwithstanding anything in this Act contained, no appeal shall lie to the Supreme Court from a judgment rendered in any provincial court in any proceeding unless,\n(a) the amount or value of the matter in controversy in the appeal exceeds the sum of two thousand dollars; or,\n(b) special leave to appeal is obtained as hereinafter provided.\nGeo.

Milligan[1], and like cases. \"The matter is controversy in the appeal\" (s. 39, former s. 48c), was that of which recovery had been awarded by judgment at the trial and did not include interest subsequently accrued.\nBy the Court:\nWe agree with the position taken by counsel for the respondent.

In an action to set aside a judgment obtained in the same court, the statement of claim merely alleged that the judgment \"was obtained by the false and untrue statements made by the defendant\" on material matters of fact at the former trial. In dismissing the action, the trial judge said \"that to hear evidence would only leave me in the position that the judge was in when he tried the first action.\" Counsel for the appellant in this court declined to give any assurance, or even to state, that any evidence materially different from that given at the original trial would or could be adduced. The trial judge dismissed the action and the Appellate Division affirmed his judgment.\nHeld, Duff J. dissenting, that a new trial should be refused.\nPer Davies C.J. and Anglin J.\u2014The dismissal of the action may be regarded as equivalent in effect to an order perpetually staying it as frivolous and vexatious and an abuse of the process of the court, which under the circumstances, should not be interfered with.\nPer Idington and Brodeur JJ.\u2014The statement of claim does not sufficiently disclose a cause of action. Duff J. contra.\nPer Idington J\u2014The trial judge rightly refused to rehear substantially the same evidence and to review the judgment rendered upon it at the former trial.\nPer Idington and Brodeur JJ.\u2014The sufficiency of the allegations in a statement of claim is a matter of practice and procedure and the jurisprudence of this court is not to interfere in such matters.\nPer Duff J. (dissenting).\u2014Where the plaintiff's statement of claim sufficiently alleges a cause of action and the plaintiff appears at the trial ready to proceed with his evidence in support of his claim, the trial judge could not properly dismiss the action except upon some admission on behalf of the plaintiff shewing his claim to be unfounded or unforceable. To dismiss the action as an abuse of the process without hearing the evidence in such circumstances would be un- precedented and contrary to the course of the court. The trial judge did not so proceed but dismissed the action on the ground that the statement of claim shewed no cause of action, and as he erred in this, there should be a new trial.\nPer Mignault J\u2014When it became evident to the trial judge at the second trial that no other evidence than that offered at the former trial would be tendered he was justified in dismissing the action.\nJudgment of the Appellate Division ([1922] 1 W.W.R. 1208) affirmed, Duff J. dissenting.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta[1] affirming the judgment of Ives J. at the trial and dismissing appellant's action.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions in issue are fully stated in the above head-note and in the judgments now reported.\nLafleur K.C. for the appellant. The statement of claim discloses a good cause of action. All the material and necessary allegations to constitute an action for fraud were made and particulars of the fraud were given. The plaintiff should have been allowed to proceed and to have his case tried, and evidence heard to show that the statements complained of were in fact untrue. Then the trial judge would have been in a position to decide whether the court at the former trial could in fact have been misled by such statements. Flower v. Lloyd[2]; Abouloff v. Oppenheimer[3]; Birch v. Birch (4).\nGeo. H. Ross K.C. for the respondent. The Supreme Court of Canada should not interfere with matters of practice and procedure.\nThe statement of claim does not disclose a good cause of action.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014For the reasons stated by my brother Anglin, in which I concur and to which I have nothing useful to add, I would dismiss this appeal with costs. IDINGTON J.\u2014The appellant by his amended statement of claim sets forth that respondent recovered judgment, on the 22nd December, 1920, against him for the sum of $4,500.58 and the costs of the action.\nIn the third, fourth and fifth paragraphs of said statement of claim he alleges as follows:\u2014\n3. The said judgment was obtained by the false and untrue statements made by the defendant in giving his evidence before this honourable court.\n4. The defendant made such statements knowing them to be false and untrue, and with the intent that they should be acted upon by this honourable court, and this honourable court being misled and deceived by acting on such false and untrue statements caused judgment to be given in favour of the defendant in the said action to the loss and detriment of the plaintiff in the action.\n5. The following are the false and untrue statements made by the defendant in giving his evidence before this honourable court on the 28th day of October, 1919.\nThen follow over six pages of the printed appeal case herein what appears to be a copy of the respondent's evidence in that case; mostly trivial questions and answers and a few which may or may not have been the material matters upon which the decision of the learned trial judge or the referee to whom some questions had been referred, turned.\nAnd following such copy of evidence is the plaintiff's (now appellant's) prayer for relief as follows:\u2014\n(a) That the said judgment of this honourable court be set aside and vacated.\n(b) Judgment against the defendant for the said sum of $5,673.82.\n(c) His costs of this action.\nThe statement of defence by present respondent thereto denied the allegations in the said fourth and fifth paragraphs of the said statement of claim and further alleged that he would have been entitled to the judgment given in said action even if none of the evidence complained of in the statement of claim herein had been given at the trial; and again that all the statements complained of were litigated in said action and decided against appellant who then unsuccessfully appealed to the Appellate Division. That the plaintiff instituted original proceedings against the defendant for false swearing at the said trial, which proceedings resulted in the acquittal of the defendant; and that there is no evidence available to the plaintiff which was not available to him at the time of the said trial, and at the time the appeal was taken therefrom; and that if plaintiff now knows of any evidence which he did not produce at the trial, it was wholly due to his failure to exercise reasonable diligence in his preparation for the trial and the appeal taken therefrom.\nThe final paragraph of the statement of defence was as follows:\u2014\n(8) The statement of claim does not disclose a cause of action and is bad in law.\nNo reply to all this or even formal joinder of issue is to be found in the case presented to us.\nThe appellant's counsel opened the trial hereof by calling appellant and after his examination had proceeded so far as to show what a wide range of irrelevant matter was possible under such pleadings, objection was taken after the record of the former trial had been produced, including the opinion judgments of the learned trial judge thereof and of the referee, that the action could not be maintained, and that the statement of claim herein did not show a good cause of action for different reasons and that evidence along that line could not be properly tendered.\nTo this the learned trial judge remarked as follows:\u2014\nThe court: Well, I don't know, it occurs to me that if false statements, false evidence is given at a trial and it can be shewn that the evidence so given induced the judgment, and upon shewing that evidence was false, that it did induce the judgment, that that judgment can be set aside. Now have you any authority against that proposition?\nThereupon there ensued an argument of some length of which there is no record, but merely marks indicating that the reporter made no note of what passed between counsel and the court.\nAt the conclusion thereof the learned trial judge said he had made up his mind on the issue of law so raised, but if it would save expense and trouble he was willing to proceed, but if counsel insisted he was entitled to judgment now.\nCounsel for defence insisting, he delivered his judgment as follows: The court: Well this action as at present constituted will be dismissed on the ground that the pleadings disclose no cause of action. I think that to hear evidence would only leave me in the position that the judge was in when he tried the action of Pier v. MacDonald and upon which he has decided.\nThis being the result it is quite clear to me that the learned trial judge having the correct conception of the law as expressed before the said argument had concluded from all that appellant's counsel had presented to him, that he was not in a position to do more than ask him to re-hear substantially the same evidence as adduced at the trial of the other case, with nothing materially new and hence he had no right to review the case and reverse the learned judge in the former trial.\nIn all of this I think the learned trial judge in this case was right and the Appellate Division was therefore right in dismissing the appeal therefrom.\nIt is elementary law that a judgment obtained by fraud can be vacated and surely perjury, which produces that fraud, falls within such a proposition. And as I read the elaborate opinions of the learned judges of the Appellate Division, none deny the law to be so but four out of five agree that such a case is not properly stated herein. Mr. Justice Beck would allow an amendment by plaintiff if he saw fit. I submit, as I suggested on the argument herein, that therefore there is nothing involved in this appeal but questions of practice and procedure and hence it should not have been entertained if we followed, as we should, the settled jurisprudence of this court in that regard.\nThe statement of claim herein by no means makes any such case in such a proper manner that any court could or should listen to as a means of enforcing the law which does not permit of such a mode of re-trial and acting upon simply a different view of the facts from that taken respectively by the learned trial judge and referee in the first action.\nIt is to be observed that the learned trial judge of such action was a member of the Appellate Division who heard the appeal now in question herein, and agreed with Mr. Justice Stuart. I submit that a statement of claim in such a case as this should, when relying alone upon alleged perjury of the respondent, as the basis of the fraud alleged to have been practised, at least be quite as concise and definite in pointing out each of the essential statements claimed to have been perjury, as would be required in an indictment for perjury.\nCan any one imagine any court trying, or even listening, to an indictment for perjury framed in the way this statement of claim presents the appellant's case?\nAgain the claim to vacate a judgment on the grounds of perjury cannot succeed unless by new evidence and shewing that the aggrieved party could not by reasonable diligence have been able to discover and bring forward at the trial such new evidence as desired to be presented in the action, and the statement of claim should so allege and give some good reason for such failure.\nThe statement of claim in question herein entirely fails in this regard and thereby, as well as on other grounds entitled the learned trial judge to rule as he did.\nAgain one may surmise that one of the substantial features intended to have been relied upon by appellant was what the respondent had stated before the referee relative to the rate of compensation to have been due the appellant by the respondent.\nThe referee states these parties were in conflict in the evidence given; and that by reason of appellant never having claimed, in the course of the business more than five per cent, contended for by the respondent, and having rendered accounts for several years on that basis without making any reservation that he should go beyond, and then he (the referee) was influenced thereby to accept that as correct.\nIf I am correct in my surmise as to this item, surely there was not so much basis connected therewith for reaching any such charge as possibly intended to have been made herein relative thereto.\nThis statement of claim is such a curiosity that I am not surprised that neither party has been able to cite any precedent exactly fitting it; but the many cases cited here and below do show that when the plaintiff fails to present a clear and definite case, he must fail.\nAnd I submit that our courts should always, when any pretensions set up as herein, rigidly adhere to the clear and definite requirements of the law in that regard and thus discourage any suitor from hoping to re-litigate any case unless he has used the utmost care and diligence in the preparation of his case or defence and done everything possible to help the trial court to determine aright. I think this appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDUFF J. (DISSENTING).\u2014The learned trial judge and the majority of the judges of the Appellate Division came to the conclusion that the statement of claim did not in substance disclose a cause of action. Had I come to the same conclusion I should have been prepared to dismiss the appeal on the ground, if on no other, that no adequate reason had been presented for setting aside the judgment of the Alberta courts. The Supreme Court of Alberta has authority to strike out any pleading disclosing no reasonable cause of action in addition to its inherent authority to stay or dismiss actions which on good grounds the court is satisfied are frivolous and vexatious.\nAn application made invoking the jurisdiction of the court to strike out a pleading as disclosing no reasonable cause of action or defence, as the case may be, is an application which must be determined upon an examination of the pleadings alone, while on the other hand, an application addressed to the inherent jurisdiction of the court to exercise its control over proceedings initiated in abuse of the process of the court is one with which the court deals after being fully informed of the facts and in which evidence may and commonly is offered and received pro and con from both sides. After a case has come on for trial, it would, I think, be without precedent, the plaintiff being there with his witnesses and ready to present his evidence in support of his case, in support, that is to say, of a claim resting upon allegations disclosing a good cause of action on the face of it\u2014it would, I think, be an unheard of thing for a trial judge in such circumstances to dismiss the action as frivolous and vexatious except at all events upon the strength of some admission deliberately made by counsel and establishing that the case made upon the pleadings could not be supported; even in such a case it would be an unusual thing to dismiss the action without the consent of the plaintiff's counsel Thirty years ago it was held by the Court of Appeal in Fletcher v London and North Western Railway Company[4], that a trial judge had no power to non-suit a plaintiff without his consent upon the ground that on the opening statement of his counsel, it must be held that the plaintiff had no cause of action.\nBut the trial judge in the present case took no such course. He took a course which, having regard to the view of the law expressed by him was, I think, not open to criticism. Taking, as I have said, the view that the statement of claim did not allege the facts constitutive of a right of action to set aside the previous judgment as obtained by fraud he held that the pleading ought to be struck out and the action dismissed accordingly.\nThat is quite evident from the report of the proceedings at the trial. The learned judge explicitly says:\nThis action as at present constituted should be dismissed on the ground that the pleadings disclose no cause of action.\nIt is true he goes on to say:\nI think, that to hear evidence would only leave me in the position that the judge was in when he tried the action of Pier v. Macdonald and upon which he has decided.\nBut the learned judge was evidently under the impression that the plaintiff must not only produce evidence which had not been produced at the former trial but that such evidence must be set out in his pleadings or that, at all events, he must in his pleadings allege the discovery of fresh evidence; and that in the absence of such an allegation the plaintiff would not be permitted to offer any evidence other than that which had been produced before the judge who pronounced the judgment impeached. I cannot help saying, with great respect, that this position of the trial judge appears to be logically unassailable. If it was necessary that the plaintiff should allege that fresh evidence had been discovered as a condition of the production of such evidence then it is quite obvious that under the pleadings as they stood such evidence could not be produced and the learned judge was quite right in thinking that in the absence of such additional evidence the trial would be a waste of time. The majority of the judges of the Appellate Division dealt with the case, I think, in a similar way and on similar grounds. The principal ratio of the judgment of Mr. Justice Stuart and quite clearly the conclusion at which he arrived was that the allegations in the statement of claim were not in substance sufficient to entitle the plaintiff to the relief demanded. His remarks as to the proceedings being vexatious do not convey to my mind the idea that in the absence of any explicit admission by counsel and in the absence of any application to the court to dismiss the action as frivolous and vexatious on the ground that the statement off claim, assuming it to disclose a cause of action, could not be supported by evidence (a proceeding which would have required the plaintiff to make answer and to disclose to the court the nature of the case he was prepared to make)\u2014 I do not get the impression, I say, that in the absence of any such admission or any such proceeding calling for an answer from the plaintiff by way of affidavit or otherwise Mr. Justice Stuart would have considered it the proper way to deal with an action based upon a good statement of claim to dismiss it in the middle of the trial as an abuse of the process. The observations of the learned judge are, of course, quite ad rem in relation to the point to which he is addressing himself, namely, whether in the circumstances the dismissal of the action should stand or the plaintiff should be given an opportunity to amend and proceed to a further trial; and again, let me say that having taken the view he did as to the allegations necessary to support such an action I think the ultimate conclusion to which he came to is one with which I am not at all disposed to disagree. The action was an action to set aside a judgment on the ground that the judgment had been obtained by fraud, the fraud being the fraud of the plaintiff in producing before the court his own perjured evidence. It will help to elucidate what I have to say if I quote at the outset the first paragraph of Lord Cairns' judgment in Patch v. Ward[5].\nThe bill in this case is filed to set aside a decree absolute for foreclosure made as long ago as the month of March, 1849, and enrolled a few years subsequently. Being a decree signed and enrolled, the matter covered by it has become solemnly res judicata between the parties to the suit, and the decree must remain unless it can be set aside either upon the ground of error apparent upon the face of it, upon the ground of new matter subsequently discovered or upon the ground of fraud. If it is to be impugned upon the ground of error apparent upon the face of it, or for new matter relevant to the issues in the cause, that must be done by bill of review, the bill of the former case being filed without any leave of the court, in the latter not without leave, and in order to obtain that leave the applicant must satisfy the court that the new matter is relevant to the issues and could not with reasonable diligence have been earlier discovered. There is here no error apparent upon the face of the decree, neither has any leave been applied for or obtained to file a bill of review upon the ground of new matter discovered. The third ground alone remains, and it is that on which the bill is filed, that the decree was obtained by fraud.\nI quote this passage because it shows that a supplemental bill claiming a, rehearing on the ground of the discovery of fresh evidence is a very different thing from a bill to set aside a judgment on the ground of fraud. I can find no authority anywhere in the books to show that in an action to set aside a judgment on the ground of fraud it is necessary for the plaintiff to set out in his statement of claim the evidence or the nature of the evidence upon which he relies in support of the claim. It is one of the elementary rules of pleading that the pleading is not to allege evidence but that it is to allege the facts which are constitutive of the cause of action. In Sir James Stephen's language, it must allege facta probanda, not the evidence by which the facts are to be proved. In view of the very able argument presented by Mr. Ross, I think it is right to point out what this does not mean. It does not mean that in an action to set aside a judgment on the ground of fraud consisting of perjury by one of the parties that a judgment could be given for the plaintiff solely upon the strength of the evidence which was before the judge who tried the case in which the judgment impeached was pronounced. Upon that point the law is quite clear but it does not follow that notice of the additional evidence must be given in the pleadings or that it is necessary that the pleadings should mention the evidence or refer to the evidence which the plaintiff intends to offer. It is not necessary just as it is not necessary in a case in which corroboration is required by law of the plaintiff's testimony. It would be bad pleading to set out in the statement of claim the manner in which the plaintiff proposed to corroborate his own testimony.\nThe authorities which influenced the minds of the judges in the court below are the judgment of Lord Selborne in Boswell v. Coaks[6], and a judgment of the Court of Appeal in Birch v. Birch[7] as well as the judgment of James L.J. in Flower v. Lloyd[8].\nLord Selborne's judgment deals with an application to dismiss an action as frivolous and vexatious. He points out that assuming evidence to have been withheld from the court at the former trial from improper motives that conduct was not in itself a sufficient ground for setting aside the judgment unless the evidence withheld was something \"material\" to \"disturb\" the judgment impeached, and he comes to the conclusion that the evidence upon which the plaintiff proposed to rely could not be said, on the facts presented, to be material. There are certain observations in Lord Selborne's judgment relied upon by Mr. Ross which, it ought to be noticed, relate only to proceedings in the nature of a bill of review in respect of which under the old practice it was necessary to obtain leave of the court before filing the bill. It is quite clear that no such leave was necessary where the bill was an original bill impeaching a decree as obtained by fraud. That is clear from the passage already quoted from Lord Cairns' judgment as well as from the discussion of the subject in Milford on Pleadings pp. 101-114 (where such bills are clearly distinguished from a bill impeaching a judgment on the ground of fraud), as well as from Maddock's Chancery Practice (vol. 2, p. 709). Lord Selborne's whole judgment proceeds upon the view that in passing upon the evidence offered in proof of the allegation that a judgment has been obtained by fraud the court is bound to act in the spirit of the observations of Lord Justice James in Flower v. Lloyd[9], and that the plaintiff could only succeed by producing evidence discovered since the former trial in proof of fraud and that on a summary application to dismiss the action as being without foundation the court would examine the facts with care and in order to see whether there had been\na new discovery of something material in this sense that prima facie it would be a reason for setting the judgment aside if it were established by proof.\nLord Selborne's observations indeed have very little direct bearing upon any question in controversy on this appeal. The fraud charged there was the concealment of evidence with the object of misleading the court; and the gist of the decision consists in this, that such an allegation in itself even if fully established, would not be a ground for setting aside the judgment but that the plaintiff must go further and show that the facts withheld were material to the issues in controversy in the proceeding resulting in the judgment. If the plaintiff's action was based on these grounds it was, of course, necessary for him to allege first the concealment of the facts, and secondly, such other facts as might be necessary to make them appear material and of facts of this kind his Lordship says there was neither allegation nor proof. Birch v. Birch[10] is also a case of an application by the defendant to deal with an action on the ground that it was frivolous and vexatious. The Court of Appeal according to the practice heard evidence pro and con for the purpose of ascertaining whether or not there was such probability of success as to entitle the plaintiff to proceed with his case. It was held that in the circumstances the plaintiff was really seeking a re-trial of issues already passed upon. In both these cases an application was made invoking the jurisdiction of the court to deal with vexatious proceedings. The plaintiff was required and permitted to place before the court the evidence upon which his claim was founded and the court scrutinizing the evidence held it in both cases to be too slight to afford any foundation of the plaintiff's claim. In the present case no such application was made, the action had proceeded to trial, the plaintiff was proceeding with his evidence in support of his claim and offered to lay before the court the whole of the evidence which he proposed to adduce. The action was dismissed, not on the ground that the evidence which he was neither called upon to produce nor allowed to produce was insufficient, but on the ground that no cause of action was disclosed by the pleadings, that there was no issue on the record which if found in his favour would entitle him to judgment.\nThe discussion of Flower v. Lloyd[11] I postpone for the moment.\nWe come at once to the question whether or not an action lies to set aside a judgment on the ground that the judgment was obtained by perjury of one of the parties. I quote in full the language of Lord Justice James which shows how grave is the issue presented when the jurisdiction of the court is invoked to set aside a judgment on the ground that it has been obtained through perjured evidence. I quote from pp. 333 and 334 in the report of Flower v. Lloyd11:\nBut we must not forget that there is a very grave general question of far more importance than the question between the parties to these suits. Assuming all the alleged falsehood and fraud to have been substantiated, is such a suit as the present sustainable? That question would require very grave consideration indeed before it is answered in the affirmative. Where is litigation to end if a judgment obtained in an action fought out adversely between two litigants sui juris and at arm's length could be set aside by a fresh action on the ground that perjury had been committed in the first action, or that false answers had been given to interrogatories, or a misleading production of documents, or of a machine, or of a process had been given? There are hundreds of actions tried every year in which the evidence is irreconciliably conflicting, and must be on one side or other wilfully and corruptly perjured. In this case if the plaintiffs had sustained on this appeal the judgment in their favour, the present defendants in their turn might bring a fresh action to set aside that judgment on the ground of perjury of the principal witness and subornation of perjury, and so the parties might go on alternately ad infinitum. There is no distinction in principle between the old common law action and the old chancery suit, and the court ought to pause long before it establishes a precedent which would or might make in numberless cases judgments supposed to be final only the commencement of a new series of actions. Perjuries, falsehoods, frauds when detected, must be punished and punished severely; but, in their desire to prevent parties litigant from obtaining any benefit from such foul means the court must not forget the evils which may arise from opening such new sources of litigation, amongst such evils not the least being; that it would be certain to multiply indefinitely the mass of those very perjuries, falsehoods and frauds.\nAs I have already mentioned Lord Selborne refers to these observations in Boswell v. Coaks[12] and the passage in which he does it is worth quoting:\nI say that, not by any means dissenting from the spirit of the observations made in Flower v. Lloyd[13] by that great judge, Lord Justice James, and concurred in by Lord Justice Thesiger, that the court ought to be even more than usually cautious how it attends to all sorts of reasons which may be brought forward plausible upon the face of them, for disturbing such a solemn judgment, having regard to the enormous mischief of unsettling the principle on which the doctrine of res judicata is established.\nNow Lord Selborne explicitly says that he has no doubt, that a judgment may be set aside on the ground of fraud and it is to be noted that the observations of Lord Justice James are not confined in their application to cases where, the fraud charged consists of perjury; false answers to interrogatories, misleading production of documents, subornation of perjury are all pointed out in the passage quoted above, and I think that notwithstanding Lord Selborne's expressed approval of the spirit of those observations and notwithstanding the weight and force of the observations themselves one is constrained to the conclusion upon an examination of the authorities that there is jurisdiction in the court to entertain an action to set aside a judgment on the ground that it has been obtained through perjury. The principle I conceive to be this; such jurisdiction exists but in the exercise of it the court will not permit its process to be made use of and will exert the utmost care and caution to prevent its process being used for the purpose of obtaining a re-trial of an issue already determined, of an issue which transivit in rem judicatam under the guise of impugning a judgment as procured by fraud. Therefore the perjury must be in a material matter and therefore it must be established by evidence not known to the parties at the time of the former trial Mr. Ross in his very able argument on behalf of the respondent relied upon Baker v. Wadsworth[14], a decision of a divisional court in which some countenance is no doubt given to the proposition I am now discussing but I am not perfectly clear that in Baker v. Wadsworth14 Mr. Justice Wright and Mr. Justice Darling intended really to decide anything more than the point that the case was not clear enough to justify an order for judgment in default of defence. At all events in Cole v. Langford[15], decided in the same year, another divisional court declined to follow Baker v. Wadsworth14. Cole v. Langford15 was followed by McCardie J. in Gordon-Smith v. Peizer[16]. The subject is discussed in two cases before the Court of Appeal. Abouloff v. Oppenheimer[17] and Vadala v. Lawes[18]. The principle upon which both these cases proceeded is that, to quote the judgment in the Duchess of Kingston's case[19]:\nAlthough it is not permitted to show that the court was mistaken it may be shown that.it was misled.\nWhere the court is misled by the fraud of the parties that is something which vitiates the most solemn proceedings of courts of justice and as Lord Coke says, it avoids all judicial acts ecclesiastical or temporal. In the very nature of things as Lord Coleridge C.J. said in Abouloff v. Oppenheimer17 at p. 302, the question whether the court was misled in pronouncing judgment never could have been submitted to them, never could have been in issue before them and therefore never could have been decided by them. Brett L.J. at p. 307 discusses the judgment of James L.J. in Flower v. Lloyd[20] and he expressly dissents from the proposition that there can be any doubt that the fraud of the party to the action committed before the court for the purpose of deceiving the court is a ground for setting aside the judgment. In the second of the above quoted cases the subject is discussed in a very instructive way by Lindley L.J. The action was an action on a foreign judgment and the defence was that the court pronouncing judgment had been imposed upon by the shuffling of some documents and the substitution of genuine documents for forged documents in such a manner as to deceive it. Lindley L.J. points out that there are two propositions which are to be reconciled. It is the law that a party to an action can impeach the judgment given in that action for fraud. There is another general proposition that when you sue on a foreign judgment it is not open to the defendant to go into the merits which have been decided in a foreign court and after examining the judgments in Abouloff v. Oppenheimer[21] he comes to the conclusion that, where the fraud alleged consists in misleading the court by, evidence produced by a party knowing the evidence to be false, it may be that for the purpose of establishing the fraud it is necessary to try over again issues already passed upon and that if so, then it is competent to the court before which the judgment is impeached to re-try the merits.\nNow it is quite true that in both of these cases the court was dealing with an action on a foreign judgment but it is equally true that no distinction appears to be drawn for this purpose between the status of a foreign judgment and that of a domestic judgment. There is, it is true, a technical difference. A domestic judgment is a contract of record, a foreign judgment gives rise only to a simple contract obligation, but given the jurisdiction of the court a judgment in a foreign court is conclusive against the parties to the litigation to the same extent as a domestic judgment and for my own part I find it difficult to comprehend any ground of distinction for our present purpose between the two classes of judgment.\nThe appeal should be allowed. ANGLIN J.\u2014After hearing some evidence given by the plaintiff and arguments of counsel, the learned trial judge dismissed this action, saying:\nThis action as at present constituted will be dismissed on the ground that the pleadings disclose no cause of action. I think that to hear evidence would only leave me in the position that the judge was in when he tried the action of Pier v. MacDonald, and upon which he decided.\nThe same view prevailed with at least two of the learned judges who constituted the majority in the Appellate Division, the third member of the majority of that court basing his judgment on the view that the materiality of the impeached evidence did not sufficiently appear. Under these circumstances the plaintiff comes before this court without offering any assurance, or even alleging, that, if the case be sent back for a new trial, any evidence different from or in addition to that adduced at the original trial before Mr. Justice Scott will be forthcoming.\nOn this aspect of the matter being drawn to his attention, counsel for the appellant, no doubt because without instructions enabling him to do so, did not offer any such assurance to the court. He did not even state that he was instructed that the evidence at the new trial would in any respect differ from that passed upon by Mr. Justice Scott.\nA legitimate, and I think the proper, inference is that the plaintiff has no additional evidence to offer and is unable to put before the court anything which would make it in the least probable that his allegation of perjury on the part of the defendant can be maintained.\nHaving regard to all that has transpired, including the important fact that a criminal prosecution for the same alleged perjury has already failed, without expressing an opinion as to the cause of the action disclosed by the statement, of claim, I think it would be quite improper for this court to interfere with the judgment dismissing this action, which, though differing m form, is in substance and effect the same as an order perpetually staying the action as frivolous and vexatious and an abuse of the process of the court. Birch v. Birch[22]; Lawrence v. Norreys[23]; Reichel v. Magrath[24]. BRODEUR J.\u2014The question in this case is whether the allegations of the statement of claim are sufficient.\nA judgment which has been obtained by fraud can be impeached by means of an action. But in such action the particulars of the fraud should be given and should relate to matter which prima facie would be a reason for setting the judgment aside.\nThe sufficiency of the allegations is in this case a matter of practice and procedure and the constant jurisprudence of this court is that we do not interfere in such matters with the disposition of the case by the courts below. Ferrier v. Tr\u00e9pannier[25]; Higgins v. Stephens[26]; Russia v. Proskouriahoff[27].\nThe plaintiff has had several opportunities to amend his statement of claim in order to show that the evidence which he would adduce would not be the same as the one on which the first action was decided but he has failed to do so.\nThe appeal fails and should be dismissed with costs.\nMIGNAULT J.\u2014This is an action to have vacated and set aside a judgment whereby, in an action by the present respondent against the present appellant, the latter was declared accountable to the respondent on certain transactions between them. The appellant alleged, in his statement of claim, that the judgment was obtained by reason of false and untrue statements made by the respondent in giving his evidence, which statements were untrue to the knowledge of the respondent and were made with the intention that they should be acted upon by the court. Issue was joined on this statement of claim and the trial began, the appellant's counsel having called his client as his first witness. After some questions had been put to the appellant and answered, the respondent's counsel objected that his adversary had no right to offer the evidence of the appellant to make out a case of perjury against the respondent. A discussion took place between counsel on this objection and finally the learned trial judge reached the conclusion that the pleadings disclosed no cause of action and that, should he hear evidence, he would find himself in the same position as the judge was when he tried the former case. The action was therefore dismissed.\nI am not at all ready to say that the plaintiff's statement of claim disclosed no cause of action, but it must have been evident to the learned trial judge that the evidence being tendered would be the same as in the previous case. Counsel for the appellant never suggested that he had any other evidence of the fraud and perjury which he had alleged as the basis of his action. And before this court counsel for the appellant could give no assurance that any evidence was available to the appellant other than that adduced in the first trial.\nUnder these circumstances, no useful purpose would be served in sending back the case for trial and I concur in the judgment dismissing the appeal.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\n[1] [1922] 1 W.W.R. 1208.\n[2] [1878] 10 Ch.

Dufresne, [1923] S.C.R. 126\nDate: 1922-11-27\nC. L. Dufort (Plaintiff) Appellant;\nand\nMarius Dufresne (Defendant) Respondent.\n1922: October 23; November 27.\nPresent: Idington, Duff, Anglin, Brodeur and Mignault JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF KING'S BENCH, APPEAL SIDE, PROVINCE OF QUEBEC\nContract\u2014Partnership\u2014Dissolution\u2014Profits\u2014Division\u2014Art. 1013 C.C.\nIn 1909, the respondent, carrying on on his own account the practice of a civil engineer, employed the appellant as his assistant. On the 1st September 1912, the respondent entered into a contract by private writing with the appellant and one H\u00e9roux to carry on the same undertaking under the name of \"Marius Dufresne.\" The agreement provided inter alia that the profits realized (\"b\u00e9n\u00e9fices r\u00e9alis\u00e9s\") at the expiration of each year should be divided, 80 per cent to the respondent and 10 per cent to each of the others. The agreement was silent as to what was to become of the fruits of work done during the term of the partnership that should remain uncollected upon its expiration. On the 31st of December, 1912, all moneys received during the four months of the existence of the partnership, including those paid on account of work done by the respondent before the 1st September, 1912, were distributed between the partners. At the date of the dissolution of the partnership, on the 31st December, 1916, a new agreement was passed between the appellant and the respondent by which the former was hired by the latter for the year 1917 at a salary of $150 a month plus 10 per cent of the \"b\u00e9n\u00e9fices realis\u00e9s\" during that year. The appellant, over two years after the first agreement had terminated, claimed 10 per cent of the moneys collected by the respondent after the dissolution of the partnership for work done during its existence.\nHeld, that, as the meaning of the provisions of the written agreement is not free from obscurity, the intention of the parties may be ascertained by taking into consideration the surrounding circumstances and by examining the conduct of the parties themselves in so far as it throws light on the interpretation they have placed upon their contractual rights. The contract so interpreted gives the appellant no claim on the profits realized after the expiration of the agreement.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King's Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec, reversing the judgment of the Superior Court at Montreal, Duclos J., and dismissing the appellant's action.\nThe material facts of the case are fully stated in the above head-note and in the judgments now reported. Chs. Laurendeau K.C. and Arthur Brossard K.C. for the appellant.\nEug. Lafleur K.C. for the respondent.\nIdington J.\u2014The respondent had carried on his business of a civil engineer, land surveyor and architect for some years in the town of Maisonneuve.\nThe appellant served him as an assistant in 1909, and up to the formation of the contract presently to be referred to, getting such compensation from time to time as his services were mutually agreed to be worth.\nOn the 1st September, 1912, respondent and appellant and one H\u00e9roux entered into a contract by private writing to carry on the said business under the name of respondent and, unfortunately, the said writing was so ambiguously expressed that it has given rise to this action of the appellant, in February, 1919, over two years after the said agreement had terminated as it did, and at the end of 1916 everything seemed to have been settled to the mutual satisfaction of all concerned and the appellant had entered into and served respondent, under another agreement in writing, for over a year, without making the claim now set up.\nThe mode of compensation of the appellant and said H\u00e9roux, by said respondent, was expressed in said first mentioned writing, as follows:\u2014\nLes benefices r\u00e9alis\u00e9s seront partag\u00e9s \u00e0 l'expiration de chaque ann\u00e9e dans la proportion suivante: les dits H\u00e9roux et Dufort prendront chacun dix pour cent (10%) de ces b\u00e9n\u00e9fices et le dit Marius Dufresne prendra la balance, soit quatre-vingt pour cent (80%).\nChacun des associ\u00e9s pr\u00e9l\u00e8vera sur les recettes de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 titre de salaire, pareille et \u00e9gale somme de cent cinquante piastres ($150) par mois.\nThe salaries thus provided for were paid and, at the end of each year, 1912, 1913, 1914, 1915 and 1916, respectively, a settlement was made on the basis thus specified, and of the account book kept by the respondent, or rather a competent person whom he was bound to employ for the purpose of keeping said book. Statements were made out at the end of each of the years 1912, 1913, 1914, 1915, and 1916, which included all the receipts which had come into the hands of respondent for each of said years derived from the earnings of his business, not only for each current year but the previous years as well, and settlements made on that basis.\nThe appellant pretends herein that, notwithstanding that mode of dealing and the said express language of the agreement, he is entitled to an accounting by respondent for anything earned during said period and to share therein.\nThe learned trial judge acceded to such pretension, but upon appeal to the Court of King's Bench that judgment was reversed.\nIf ever there was a case in which the interpretation and construction of the agreement could and should be helped by steps leading up to the contract and that done by the parties concerned therein after the business provided for by the contract had been entered upon, I think this is one.\nWe find that those so concerned in this contract began by a literal adherence to its terms at the end of the year 1912, and that the cash received by respondent during the entire year of 1912, for work previously done as well as for the year 1912, was brought into the account and the percentage allowed and paid appellant and H\u00e9roux respectively, as provided by the above quotation from the agreement, though the time they had worked under same had only been for four months of the said year.\nThe Court of King's Bench was guided largely by this conduct of the parties as the correct interpretation of their contract and in doing so was, I think, absolutely right.\nNumerous other like features of this case which appear in the evidence, and especially the yearly settlements in subsequent years as if final up to the respective times when made, tend to confirm me in the opinion that the judgment appealed from is right.\nThe appellant in argument and in his factum especially seems to incessantly repeat that as this agreement used the word \"soci\u00e9t\u00e9\" therefore all that appears relative to what the bargain governing this soci\u00e9t\u00e9 really was, must be discarded because usually the terms of such an agreement in fact are different and the law relevant thereto would work out a different result.\nThe law does not prohibit parties from making any agreement they choose, even for a soci\u00e9t\u00e9. And as this agreement even if taken to be for such a contractual relation was terminable by either of the three parties thereto giving three months' notice, it was the duty of the appellant to have taken, at the end of 1912, the objection he is now taking.\nParties can measure the share they are to receive out of the operations of a partnership by any rule they choose to lay down and to alter same if they see fit, and their conduct is often in any case the evidence of a contract.\nThe clear intention of the parties so manifested herein was that all the appellant or H\u00e9roux ever were expected to get out of the business in question was the $150 a month each, and the percentage of net receipts as settled at the end of each current year in the manner provided for and adopted.\nIn justice to H\u00e9roux I may say that we are told he makes no pretension to the contrary.\nAny other claim such as made herein might by virtue of the mode of reasoning put forward, as well have been made to a third of the profits beyond that specified and in the way specified.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs throughout.\nDuff J.\u2014The agreement of the 1st September, 1912, unquestionably is framed in such a way as to give rise to difficulties of construction. The respondent Marius Dufresne had been carrying on on his own account practice as engineer, surveyor and architect and the document before us was brought into existence for the purpose of recording the arrangement between himself and the appellant Dufort and another engineer H\u00e9roux whom he was associating with himself in his practice. The document begins with a declaration that all parties consent\nde nous mettre en soci\u00e9t\u00e9 comme ing\u00e9nieurs civils, arpenteurs g\u00e9om\u00e8tres et architectes sous la raison sociale de \"MARIUS DUFRESNE\" avec bureau \u00e0 Maisonneuve susdit, aux conditions suivantes * * * It is agreed that each shall give his whole time to the affairs of the \"soci\u00e9t\u00e9\" that each is to receive a salary of $150 a month and that at the end of each year \"les b\u00e9n\u00e9fices r\u00e9alis\u00e9s\" shall be divided, the respondent receiving 80 per cent, and each of the others 10 per cent of such \"b\u00e9n\u00e9fices\" It was stipulated that the partnership should continue for an indeterminate period with the right of any one of the partners to retire upon giving three months' notice and finally it was agreed:\nEn cas de d\u00e9c\u00e8s ou d'abandon des affaires par l'un des associ\u00e9s, ses int\u00e9r\u00eats dans la pr\u00e9sente soci\u00e9t\u00e9 cesseront imm\u00e9diatement, mais la somme repr\u00e9sentant sa part des b\u00e9n\u00e9fices r\u00e9alis\u00e9s jusqu'alors demeurera dans la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 pour lui \u00eatre pay\u00e9e seulement \u00e0 l'expiration de l'ann\u00e9e alors courante.\nThe furnishings of the office and the professional instruments were to be supplied by the respondent and were to be his property. On the face of it the instrument appears to deal only with the cash receipts from the business during the partnership period. The instrument is silent on the subject of partnership accounts in respect of work done during the partnership period, but not collected until the expiration of it and does not explicitly deal with moneys received on account of work done by Dufresne before the date of the so-called partnership.\nI think it may fairly be said that as regards these points the provisions of the written instrument are not so unequivocal as to be entirely free from obscurity.\nThe rule of interpretation for such a case (in substance it is the same in the province of Quebec as in France), seems to be well settled. Where the language of a private convention is doubtful or obscure, to quote Huc, Commentaire du Code Civil, vol. 7, Art. 175,\nle juge doit, avant tout, rechercher quelle a \u00e9t\u00e9 la commune intention des parties pourvu cependant que cette intention paraisse douteuse. Cette intention peut d'ailleurs \u00eatre recherch\u00e9e, en dehors de l'acte, dans d'autres \u00e9crits et les circonstances de la cause. Comme aussi l'\u00e9x\u00e9cution donn\u00e9e par les parties \u00e0 une convention en sera souvent le meilleur interpr\u00e8te.\nThe authorities recognize in the most explicit way the principle adverted to in the concluding words that the conduct of the parties in the execution of a contract expressed in doubtful language affords a very important clue to their real intention. Thus Demolombe, Code Civil, vol. 25, par. 36:\n36. Il faut encore mettre au rang des r\u00e8gles les meilleures d'interpr\u00e9tation, quoique notre code ne la mentionne pas, celle que fournit l'\u00e9x\u00e9cution qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9e par les parties de la clause de leur convention, dont le sens est maintenant controvers\u00e9 entre elles.\nL'ex\u00e9cution de la clause, c'est l'interpr\u00e9tation vivante et anim\u00e9e.\nC'est, en quelque sorte, l'aveu de la partie, et \u00e0 moins qu'elle ne prouve que l'ex\u00e9cution, qu'elle y a donn\u00e9e, a \u00e9t\u00e9 le r\u00e9sultat d'une erreur, il est logique et \u00e9quitable qu'elle ne soit pas, en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, admise \u00e0 revenir contre son propre fait:\nTalis enim pr\u0153sumitur pr\u0153cessisse titulus, qualis apparet usus et possessio.\nTels sont les termes, dans lesquels on pourrait, d'apr\u00e8s Dumoulin, poser notre r\u00e8gle.\nTo the same effect is Laurent, vol. 16, no. 504:\n504. Toullier remarque, d'apr\u00e8s Dumoulin, que le moyen le plus s\u00fbr de fixer le v\u00e9ritable sens d'une convention est de s'attacher \u00e0 la possession, \u00e0 l'interpr\u00e9tation que les parties ont faite elles-m\u00eames de l'acte, par la mani\u00e8re dont elles l'ont ex\u00e9cut\u00e9. La jurisprudence a consacr\u00e9 cette maxime. \"Lorsque les actes pr\u00e9sentent quelque incertitude, dit la cour de cassation, l'interpr\u00eate le plus s\u00fbr en est l'ex\u00e9cution volontaire, formelle et r\u00e9it\u00e9r\u00e9e que leur ont donn\u00e9e les parties int\u00e9r\u00e9ss\u00e9es, qui se rendent ainsi non recevable \u00e0 m\u00e9conna\u00eetre ensuite leurs propres faits.\" Dans l'esp\u00e8ce il s'agissait de fixer la contenance d'une for\u00eat soumise \u00e0 des droits d'usage. Cette contenance, mal pr\u00e9cis\u00e9e dans le titre de concession, se trouvait d\u00e9termin\u00e9e dans les plans et cartes topographiques post\u00e9rieurs, dress\u00e9s en pr\u00e9sence des usagers at approuv\u00e9s par leur ex\u00e9cution volontaire et r\u00e9it\u00e9r\u00e9e. La cour de Metz adopta cette d\u00e9limitation. Pourvoi en cassation fond\u00e9 sur le violation du titre constitutif. Le pourvoi fut rejet\u00e9, parce que la cour n'avait fait qu'interpr\u00e9ter le titre par l'ex\u00e9cution que les parties contractantes lui avaient donn\u00e9e.\nThe passage in Toullier to which Laurent refers is in vol. 6, no. 320. In 1840, it may be added, la Cour de Cassation (S., 40. 1. 789) laid it down that\nlorsque les actes pr\u00e9sentent quelque incertitude l'interpr\u00eate la plus s\u00fbr en est l'ex\u00e9cution volontaire, formelle et r\u00e9it\u00e9r\u00e9e que leur ont donn\u00e9 les parties int\u00e9r\u00e9ss\u00e9es, qui se rendent ainsi non recevable \u00e0 m\u00e9conna\u00eetre ensuite leurs propres faits.\nThe passage cited above from Demolombe was quoted and applied by Mr. Justice Girouard in The City of Quebec v. The North Shore Railway Co.[1], and this principle was the basis of a judgment of this court in Cliche v. Roy[2] where Mr. Justice Girouard, speaking for the court, adopted the reasons for judgment given by Lacoste C.J. of the Court of King's Bench which proceeded upon the ground that\nles parties elles-m\u00eames ont interpr\u00e8t\u00e9 l'acte dans ce sens l\u00e0.\nI agree with the finding expressed in the consid\u00e9rants of the Court of King's Bench in the following words:\nConsid\u00e9rant que seuls les deniers per\u00e7us pendant l'existence de l'arrangement devaient tomber dans le fonds \u00e0 partager, et que c'est l'interpr\u00e9tation que les parties ont elles-m\u00eames donn\u00e9e \u00e0 leurs conventions, en particulier lors du premier partage.\nThe fair meaning of the document of the 31st December, 1916, is, I think, that under the agreement expressed in that document the cash receipts from the 31st December, 1916, were to be divided as therein specified. The fact that the parties entered into this arrangement taken together with the disposition of the proceeds received during the partnership term for services rendered and business done by the respondent before the partnership arrangement was made sufficiently, I think, support this consid\u00e9rant embodying the unanimous opinion of the Court of King's Bench.\nThe appeal should be dismissed.\nAnglin J.\u2014It may be conceded that the parties to the agreement of the 1st September, 1912, contemplated a partnership of some description. Nevertheless the terms of that partnership and the rights of the partners to share in its profits are defined, with more or less exactitude, in their agreement. The distribution of profits realized\u2014\"b\u00e9n\u00e9fices r\u00e9alis\u00e9s,\"\u2014which I would translate \"net cash receipts,\" is explicitly provided for. The agreement is silent as to what is to become of the fruits of work done during the term of the partnership that should remain uncollected upon its expiry. Taking into consideration, however, as I think we should, the clause of the contract which deals with the rights of a retiring partner or the representatives of a deceased partner and the agreement made between the parties to this action to take effect from the 31st of December, 1916, the date of the dissolution of the partnership constituted by the agreement of September, 1912, I find enough doubt as to the meaning of the parties to the latter agreement to bring it within the purview of Art. 1013 C.C. I know of no better means of solving that doubt than the conduct of the parties themselves in so far as it throws light on the interpretation they have placed upon their contractual rights. The inclusion in the \"b\u00e9n\u00e9fices r\u00e9alis\u00e9s\" distributed amongst the partners between the 1st September, 1912, and the 31st of December, 1916, of all monies received during that period on account of work done by Marius Dufresne before the former date makes it reasonably clear why no provision was made as to the distribution of monies due for work done during the term of the partnership but uncollected when it expired. Such monies were not meant to form part of the funds to be divided between the partners, but were to belong to Dufresne, no doubt to offset the monies earned by him before the partnership began but included, by arrangement of the parties within the \"b\u00e9n\u00e9fices r\u00e9alis\u00e9s\" in which they participated.\nMr. Justice Dorion has expressed views very similar to those which I entertain and have endeavoured to state.\nThe appeal, in my opinion, fails.\nBrodeur J.\u2014Il s'agit dans cette cause d'une convention que Dufort appelle un acte de soci\u00e9t\u00e9 et que Dufresne d\u00e9signe un contrat de louage de services.\nDufresne exer\u00e7ait seul depuis plusieurs ann\u00e9es sa profession d'ing\u00e9nieur civil et d'arpenteur, et il avait \u00e0 son service le demandeur Dufort et un nomm\u00e9 H\u00e9roux qui \u00e9taient aussi tous deux ing\u00e9nieurs civils. D\u00e9sireux d'am\u00e9liorer la situation de ses aides et profitant d'une grande prosp\u00e9rit\u00e9 dans ses affaires, Dufresne d\u00e9cida de les faire participer dans ses b\u00e9n\u00e9fices, et ils firent tous les trois \u00e0 cette fin la convention qui nous est soumise et qui est faite sous seing priv\u00e9.\nCe contrat, qui est dat\u00e9 du 1er septembre 1912, comporte que Marius Dufresne, Dufort et H\u00e9roux \"consentent\" \u00e0 se mettre en soci\u00e9t\u00e9 comme ing\u00e9nieurs \"sous la raison sociale de 'Marius Dufresne,'\" que cha\u00e7un des associ\u00e9s pr\u00e9l\u00e8vera sur les recettes de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 titre de salaire \"$150 par mois,\" que les b\u00e9n\u00e9fices r\u00e9alis\u00e9s\nseront partag\u00e9s \u00e0 l'expiration de chaque ann\u00e9e dans la proportion suivante: les dits H\u00e9roux et Dufort prendront chacun 10% et Dufresne prendra la balance 80% ; (que) la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 est contract\u00e9e pour un temps ind\u00e9termin\u00e9, chacun des associ\u00e9s ayant le droit de se retirer en donnant trois mois d'avis, que le mobilier du bureau et les instruments d'arpentage seront fournis par Dufresne et seront sa propri\u00e9t\u00e9, que ce dernier verra seul aux finances et signera les ch\u00e8ques; et le contrat se termine par la clause suivante, qui est la plus importante pour la d\u00e9cision du litige et qui se lit comme suit:\nEn cas de d\u00e9c\u00e8s ou d'abandon des affaires par l'un des associ\u00e9s, ses int\u00e9r\u00eats dans la pr\u00e9sente soci\u00e9t\u00e9 cesseront imm\u00e9diatement, mais la somme repr\u00e9sentant sa part des b\u00e9n\u00e9fices r\u00e9alis\u00e9s jusqu'alors demeurera dans la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 pour lui \u00eatre pay\u00e9e seulement qu'\u00e0 l'expiration de l'ann\u00e9e alors courante.\nA la fin de la premi\u00e8re ann\u00e9e, les parties ont r\u00e9gl\u00e9 les b\u00e9n\u00e9fices r\u00e9alis\u00e9s et on a fait entrer dans les recettes non seulement l'argent per\u00e7u pour la valeur des travaux ex\u00e9cut\u00e9s depuis le 1er septembre 1912, date de la convention, mais aussi les deniers per\u00e7us pour les travaux ex\u00e9cut\u00e9s avant le 1er septembre 1912. En d'autres termes, on a fait entrer en ligne de compte des travaux dont Dufresne, sans la convention, \u00e9tait incontestablement le seul et unique b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire. Dufort et H\u00e9roux se sont trouv\u00e9s par ces r\u00e8glements de fin d'ann\u00e9e \u00e0 profiter non-seulement des travaux qui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 faits depuis leur convention, mais aussi de ceux faits ant\u00e9rieurement. Les op\u00e9rations financi\u00e8res de l'ann\u00e9e ont donc \u00e9t\u00e9 accept\u00e9es par les parties pour d\u00e9terminer les b\u00e9n\u00e9fices r\u00e9alis\u00e9s par la \"soci\u00e9t\u00e9.\"\nLa convention a pris fin en d\u00e9cembre 1916, sur notification de Dufresne. Ce dernier a voulu d\u00e9terminer les \"b\u00e9n\u00e9fices r\u00e9alis\u00e9s\" suivant les recettes et les d\u00e9penses de l'ann\u00e9e. Mais Dufort demande par sa pr\u00e9sente action de faire entrer dans ces b\u00e9n\u00e9fices la valeur des travaux qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 ex\u00e9cut\u00e9s depuis la convention de 1912 et pour lesquels aucun argent n'a encore \u00e9t\u00e9 vers\u00e9 dans la caisse.\nAfin de d\u00e9cider ce litige, il s'agit d'abord de savoir si la convention doit \u00e9tre consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme un acte de soci\u00e9t\u00e9.\nIl me semble que les parties ont bien voulu consid\u00e9rer leurs conventions comme constituant un acte de soci\u00e9t\u00e9.\nIls ont form\u00e9 une raison sociale et ils ont \u00e0 diverses reprises au cours de l'acte parl\u00e9 de relations qu'ils ont qualifi\u00e9es de relations sociales. Le contrat r\u00e9unit les \u00e9l\u00e9ments essentiels de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9, c'est-\u00e0-dire qu'il est pour le b\u00e9n\u00e9fice common des associ\u00e9s et que chacun d'eux y apporte son habilet\u00e9 et son industrie et qu'il y a participation dans les profits (Arts. 1830-1831 C.C.)\nJe sais que la nature d'un contrat ne doit pas \u00eatre d\u00e9termin\u00e9e par la qualification que les parties ont donn\u00e9e \u00e0 un acte quand il est certain que cette qualification est contraire au v\u00e9ritable caract\u00e8re de la convention; mais nous ne devons nous \u00e9carter du sens litt\u00e9ral des mots que lorsqu'il est certain que les parties les ont pris dans une acception impropre. (Baudry-Lacantinerie, 2\u00e8me \u00e9dition, nos. 556-557).\nDans le cas actuel, les parties, ce me semble, ont bien entendu exprimer leur volont\u00e9 de former une soci\u00e9t\u00e9; et, en r\u00e9alit\u00e9, le litige ne porte que sur l'actif qui doit y entrer ou en \u00eatre exclu.\nCela nous ram\u00e8ne alors \u00e0 examiner la question qui est de savoir si la valeur des travaux faits avant la formation de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 mais pay\u00e9s durant son existence fait partie de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9; et si, par contre, les travaux faits pendant la soci\u00e9t\u00e9, mais non pay\u00e9s \u00e0 sa dissolution, doivent \u00eatre pris en consid\u00e9ration pour d\u00e9terminer les \"b\u00e9n\u00e9fices r\u00e9alis\u00e9s\" dont parle le contrat.\nS'il y a doute \u00e0 ce sujet, nous trouvons dans la conduite des parties contractantes la v\u00e9ritable intention qu'elles avaient. Ainsi dans le premier r\u00e8glement qui s'est fait en 1912 et dans les ann\u00e9es subs\u00e9quentes, on a calcul\u00e9 les \"b\u00e9n\u00e9fices r\u00e9alis\u00e9s\" sur les recettes et les d\u00e9penses de chaque ann\u00e9e sans rechercher si ces recettes et ces d\u00e9penses couvraient la valeur des travaux ex\u00e9cut\u00e9s avant l'existence de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 ou non. Si Dufresne a perdu le b\u00e9n\u00e9fice des travaux qu'il avait ex\u00e9cut\u00e9s lui-m\u00eame, il me semble juste et \u00e9quitable qu'il ait \u00e9galement \u00e0 la dissolution, le b\u00e9n\u00e9fice des travaux qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 ex\u00e9cut\u00e9s pendant la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 mais dont cette derni\u00e8re n'avait pas per\u00e7u la valeur.\nD'ailleurs l'int\u00e9r\u00eat du demandeur serait bien minime, car un contrat de louage de services fait entre Dufort et Dufresne en 1917 donne \u00e0 Dufort de nouveau 10 pour cent sur les honoraires per\u00e7us durant l'ann\u00e9e par Dufresne, d\u00e9duction faite des d\u00e9penses et salaires pay\u00e9s. Si plusieurs comptes sont rest\u00e9s impay\u00e9s pendant l'ann\u00e9e 1916, il est \u00e0 pr\u00e9sumer qu'ils ont d\u00fb \u00eatre per\u00e7us en 1917 en grande partie et que Dufort aura alors sa part dans ces comptes.\nPour ces raisons l'appel doit \u00eatre renvoy\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens.\nMignault J.\u2014Les parties sont des ing\u00e9nieurs civils et arpenteurs-g\u00e9om\u00e8tres et elles ont pris cette qualit\u00e9 dans le contrat du 1er septembre, 1912, invoqu\u00e9 par chacune d'elles. Elles paraissent aussi avoir agi comme architectes, avec ou non le droit de le faire, peu importe. Le 1er septembre, 1912, l'appelant et l'intim\u00e9 ont sign\u00e9, avec M. Joseph P. H\u00e9roux, un contrat pr\u00e9par\u00e9 par eux.\nUne des questions soulev\u00e9es est de savoir si ce contrat constitue un contrat de soci\u00e9t\u00e9; l'appelant le soutient, l'intim\u00e9, au contraire, dit que c'est un contrat de louage d'ouvrage. L'appelant avait \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 l'emploi de l'intim\u00e9 avant le 1er septembre 1912. L'arrangement de cette date a dur\u00e9 entre les trois parties jusqu'au 31 d\u00e9cembre 1916. Apr\u00e8s cette date il y a eu un contrat de louage d'ouvrage pour une ann\u00e9e entre l'appelant et l'intim\u00e9, le premier louant ses services au second.\nApr\u00e8s avoir examin\u00e9 le contrat du 1er septembre 1912, je suis d'avis que c'est un contrat de soci\u00e9t\u00e9. Les parties d\u00e9clarent express\u00e9ment qu'elles consentent \u00e0 se mettre en soci\u00e9t\u00e9, et les mots \"soci\u00e9t\u00e9\" ou \"associ\u00e9s\" sont r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9s presque \u00e0 chaque clause. Sans doute les termes dont les parties se servent pour d\u00e9signer le genre de contrat fait par elles ne constituent pas toujours un indice infaillible de la nature juridique de ce contrat, mais cela aide beaucoup \u00e0 d\u00e9couvrir quelle a r\u00e9ellement \u00e9t\u00e9 leur intention, et si les conventions peuvent se concilier avec la description que les parties en ont faite, cet indice peut \u00eatre accept\u00e9 comme d\u00e9cisif par les tribunaux. Le contrat en question renferme tous les \u00e9l\u00e9ments du contrat de soci\u00e9t\u00e9, car la convention de partager dans les pertes, qui manque ici, d\u00e9coule de la stipulation de partage dans les b\u00e9n\u00e9fices, et la loi la sous-entend (Art. 1831 C.C.). Il y a donc eu soci\u00e9t\u00e9.\nLa solution de cette premi\u00e8re question en faveur de l'appelant n'entra\u00eene pas n\u00e9cessairement la cons\u00e9quence que son action \u00e9tait bien fond\u00e9e. Il reste \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer quelle part l'appelant devait retirer dans cette soci\u00e9t\u00e9. Si cette part, outre le salaire qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 pay\u00e9, est seulement dix pour cent des b\u00e9n\u00e9fices r\u00e9alis\u00e9s pendant la soci\u00e9t\u00e9, l'appelant a re\u00e7u tout ce qui lui revient et l'action en reddition de compte qu'il intente \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9 se trouve sans objet.\nUne difficult\u00e9 m'a d'abord frapp\u00e9. Dans la clause o\u00f9 il est question du partage des b\u00e9n\u00e9fices, les trois associ\u00e9s sont plac\u00e9s sur le m\u00eame pied, sauf que l'intim\u00e9 re\u00e7oit quatre-vingt pour cent de ces b\u00e9n\u00e9fices et l'appelant et H\u00e9roux dix pour cent chacun, les sommes \u00e0 \u00eatre retir\u00e9es par les trois associ\u00e9s pour leur salaire \u00e9tant \u00e9gales. On n'a pas pourvu au partage de ce qui pourrait \u00eatre pay\u00e9 apr\u00e8s la fin d'une ann\u00e9e pour l'ouvrage fait pendant cette ann\u00e9e. Tant que la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 a dur\u00e9 il ne pouvait y avoir de difficult\u00e9, car les sommes ainsi pay\u00e9es pour services ant\u00e9rieurs comptaient parmi les b\u00e9n\u00e9fices r\u00e9alis\u00e9es pendant l'ann\u00e9e o\u00f9 elles avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 per\u00e7ues et la clause de partage s'y appliquait. Mais la pr\u00e9tention que soul\u00e8ve l'appelant est de partager dans les sommes re\u00e7ues par l'intim\u00e9 depuis la dissolution de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 pour des ouvrages faits pendant son existence. Il dit que chaque fois que la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 faisait un ouvrage pour le compte d'un de ses clients, elle acqu\u00e9rait un droit de cr\u00e9ance contre ce client et chaque associ\u00e9 avait le droit de partager dans cette cr\u00e9ance quand elle \u00e9tait pay\u00e9e, que ce f\u00fbt pendant la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 ou apr\u00e8s sa dissolution.\nOn r\u00e9pond que par les partages annuels que les parties ont faits, elles ont autrement interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 leur contrat; que dans les quatre derniers mois de 1912, la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 ayant commenc\u00e9 le 1er septembre de cette ann\u00e9e, on a divis\u00e9 parmi les associ\u00e9s tous les b\u00e9n\u00e9fices re\u00e7us sans \u00e9gard au temps o\u00f9 l'ouvrage avait \u00e9t\u00e9 fait, donnant ainsi \u00e0 l'appelant dix pour cent pour des travaux ex\u00e9cut\u00e9s par l'intim\u00e9 avant le commencement de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9; et que cette m\u00e9thode a \u00e9t\u00e9 suivie durant toute l'existence de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9, les associ\u00e9s n'ayant partag\u00e9 que les sommes actuellement re\u00e7ues pendant l'ann\u00e9e. Et on dit que les parties ont ainsi d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que dans leur intention rien que les b\u00e9n\u00e9fices actuellement re\u00e7us ou r\u00e9alis\u00e9s durant l'existence de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 ne pouvait entrer dans la masse \u00e0 partager entrer entre les associ\u00e9s.\nCe raisonnement qui a pr\u00e9valu devant la cour d'appel ne me satisfait pas. Il est probable que l'intim\u00e9 a laiss\u00e9 entrer dans la somme partag\u00e9e en d\u00e9cembre 1912 quelque chose qui n'aurait pas d\u00fb y figurer, mais il n'en r\u00e9sulte pas, \u00e0 mon avis, que les parties aient eu l'intention d'interpr\u00e9ter leur acte de soci\u00e9t\u00e9. Les autres partages annuels ne fournissent aucun argument \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9, car on n'a partag\u00e9 que ce qui seul pouvait \u00eatre divis\u00e9, c'est-\u00e0-dire le surplus des recettes apr\u00e8s le paiement des d\u00e9penses.\nMais un argument bien plus formidable r\u00e9sulte du contrat que l'appelant a fait avec l'intim\u00e9 apr\u00e8s la dissolution de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9. Ce contrat, qui devait durer une ann\u00e9e \u00e0 compter du 31 d\u00e9cembre 1916, n'est pas dat\u00e9, mais l'intim\u00e9 dit qu'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait \u00e0 la fin de janvier ou au commencement de f\u00e9vrier 1917; il y est d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que\nMr. Leroux Dufort recevra \u00e0 la fin de l'ann\u00e9e dix pour cent des b\u00e9n\u00e9fices r\u00e9alis\u00e9s durant l'ann\u00e9e ; les b\u00e9n\u00e9fices seront \u00e9tablis de la mani\u00e8re suivante, le surplus des honoraires per\u00e7us durant l'ann\u00e9e d\u00e9duction faite des d\u00e9penses et salaires pay\u00e9s durant l'ann\u00e9e.\nL'appelant, en vertu de ce contrat qui est un louage de services, devait recevoir de l'intim\u00e9, outre son salaire, dix pour cent des b\u00e9n\u00e9fices r\u00e9alis\u00e9s durant l'ann\u00e9e, c'est-\u00e0-dire dix pour cent du surplus, d\u00e9duction faite des d\u00e9penses, des honoraires per\u00e7us durant l'ann\u00e9e. Il devait \u00eatre \u00e9vident, quand ce contrat a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait, que ce surplus d'honoraires comprendrait des honoraires pay\u00e9s, durant l'ann\u00e9e 1917, pour des travaux ex\u00e9cut\u00e9s auparavant, c'est-\u00e0-dire pendant l'existence de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9. La stipulation par l'appelant, comme employ\u00e9 de l'intim\u00e9, d'un pourcentage sur les recettes de 1917 sans distinguer les honoraires pour travaux anciens de ceux pour travaux nouveaux, indique \u00e0 mon avis qu'il reconnaissait qu'il n'avait plus rien \u00e0 r\u00e9clamer, comme associ\u00e9, sur des honoraires qui seraient pay\u00e9s apr\u00e8s la dissolution de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 pour des travaux ant\u00e9rieurs. Et un tel contrat fait imm\u00e9diatement apr\u00e8s la dissolution de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 est \u00e0 mon avis une interpr\u00e9tation des conventions sociales qui lie l'appelant, et un abandon par lui de toute pr\u00e9tention \u00e0 autre chose que les b\u00e9n\u00e9fices r\u00e9alis\u00e9s pendant l'existence de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9.\nIl ne faut pas oublier non plus que c'\u00e9tait toujours le bureau de l'intim\u00e9 qui continuait avant, pendant et apr\u00e8s la soci\u00e9t\u00e9. En d'autres termes, l'intim\u00e9, qui avait \u00e9tabli un bureau pour l'exercice de sa profession, s'est associ\u00e9 l'appelant et H\u00e9roux pendant un certain temps, mais c'\u00e9tait toujours le bureau \"Marius Dufresne\" qui subsistait. Cela r\u00e9pond \u00e0 l'objection de l'appelant que s'il n'a pas droit aux sommes per\u00e7ues apr\u00e8s la dissolution de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 pour des travaux ant\u00e9rieurs, l'intim\u00e9 lui-m\u00eame n'y a pas droit, car la clause de partage s'applique aux trois associ\u00e9s et ne leur donne le droit qu'aux b\u00e9n\u00e9fices r\u00e9alis\u00e9s durant l'ann\u00e9e. D'ailleurs, si l'intim\u00e9 a pay\u00e9 \u00e0 l'appelant tout ce qui revient \u00e0 ce dernier comme associ\u00e9, peu importe ce qu'il fait du r\u00e9sidu, car ce r\u00e9sidu n'appartient certainement pas \u00e0 l'appelant. Ce serait quelque chose qui n'aurait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 mis dans la soci\u00e9t\u00e9.\nJe crois que l'appel doit \u00eatre renvoy\u00e9.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: Arthur Brossard.\nSolicitor for the respondent: J.

Before his contract was completed G. absconded and the company treated his contract as abandoned and took possession of the logs cut. M., to whom nothing was due by G. at that time, had an interview with the president of the company, who said to him: \"You will keep on with the work exactly as you were to do with G.; you will finish your contract. Put your wood where you expected to put it with G. I will pay you. You are not dealing with G. any more, you are dealing with us. Make your drive and I will pay you. I will pay you your contract as G. was supposed to pay you.\" M. completed his contract but payment was refused.\nHeld, that the undertaking by the company to pay M. was not a contract to answer for a debt of G. which the Statute of Frauds required to be in writing but was a new and independent contract entailing liability on the company when performed.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Appeal Division of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick affirming the judgment at the trial in favour of the defendant company.\nThe facts are sufficiently stated in the above head-note\nP. J. Hughes for the appellant. The company made a new contract with appellant and not one to answer for a debt of another.\nSee Guild v. Conrad[1], Conrad v. Kaplan[2], Leake on Contracts (7 ed.) 165.\nStevens K.C. for the respondent referred to Fitzgerald v. Dressier[3], Williams v. Leper[4]. The Chief Justice.\u2014For the reasons stated by my brother Duff, in which I fully concur, I would allow this appeal with costs.\nIdington J.\u2014The respondent, having a right to cut timber on a basis of paying therefor according to terms set forth in the agreement giving such right, entered into a written contract with one Grandmaison to cut about five million feet thereof; haul the logs so cut to a point or points on certain rivers, and then to drive such logs as were floating on the said respective streams to certain other points. Said Grandmaison sub-let the work to the extent of about a million feet to the appellant by another written contract embodying all the terms of the first, so far as fitting such a sub-contract, but on such terms as apparently to produce a profit to Grandmaison.\nIn the contract between him and respondent there was nothing binding the latter to make advances to aid the contractor, though evidently such was contemplated as likely to become necessary, and advances were made from time to time.\nThe last of said advances was $12,000 with which Grand-maison absconded.\nThe respondent then availed itself of the power given it in the contract to stop operations thereunder, and to take possession of the logs cut and all the equipment used up to that time in the execution of the contract by Grandmaison.\nThis unexpected condition of things led appellant, accompanied by three of the assistants he had helping him to carry out his sub-contract, to go to Van Buren where respondent's headquarters were, to find out what was to be done by each of the parties hereto under the circumstances.\nThe president of respondent, on its behalf, and appellant verbally agreed that appellant should go on and complete the work he had agreed with Grandmaison to do. It is upon that verbal agreement that this action is brought. The said parties differed very widely in the terms thereof.\nThe appellant's story practically amounted to a substitution of respondent for Grandmaison, as appellant's paymaster, under the sub-contract, including both what had been done and that already named but not done, for that which yet remained to be done.\nThe respondent contended that it incurred no such liability but only to pay for cost of work to be done and a per diem wage to the appellant.\nThe jury was asked to find which story was true and adopted the appellant's version, the result of which was a verdict for plaintiff, now appellant, of $10,000.\nThe objection was taken throughout, in pleadings and at the trial, that this agreement so far as relative to the work done up to the making thereof, was void under the Statute of Frauds because it was not reduced to writing.\nThat view was upheld by the learned trial judge who dismissed the action on that ground. And on appeal therefrom to the Appeal Division of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick, the majority of that court, consisting of the Chief Justice thereof and Mr. Justice Grimmer, dismissed the appeal.\nMr. Justice Crocket, dissenting therefrom, held that the appeal should be allowed.\nThe learned trial judge, and Chief Justice Hazen who wrote the opinion which prevailed in appeal, seem, I most respectfully submit, to attach too much importance to the persistent contention of counsel for appellant that, short of an actual novation of contract, whereby the original debtor would be absolutely discharged, no contract involving an obligation for the payment of the debt of another could be maintained unless reduced to writing.\nI cannot assent to such a proposition. There are numerous cases\u2014indeed too numerous to mention\u2014conflicting entirely therewith.\nIf there happens to be an actual novation of contract of course that ends all doubt or difficulty. But by no means do the cases resting thereon decide that there must be novation of contract before liability can arise on a verbal contract which involves the obligation of payment of another's debt.\nThe question raised herein I submit is whether or, not this case falls within the true meaning of the decision in the case of Sutton v. Gray[5], where Lord Esher expresses himself, on page 288, as follows:\nIf he is totally unconnected with it except by reason of his promise ; to pay the loss, the contract is guarantee; if he is not totally unconnected with the transaction, but is to derive some benefit from it, the contract is one of indemity, not of guarantee, and section 4 does not apply.\nEven this, from so careful an authority in the use of language, may be interpreted too widely.\nThe case of Davys v. Buswell[6], illustrates how far it was attempted to be strained.\nIn these cases, as authorities on which they respectively rest or were sought to be rested, there are cited the leading cases which turned on the distinction between the words of the statute being a special promise to answer for the \"debt, default or miscarriage of another\" and the manifold ways in or by which a contract of indemnity may be called into existence, and yet not be that kind of special promise, within the Statute of Frauds.\nIn this case now in hand we will be, I submit, if we allow this appeal, far within the line drawn in Couturier v. Hastie[7], or Sutton v. Gray5, just cited, and not invading the law as laid down since.\nI therefore think this question, upon the Statute of Frauds as defence, should be decided accordingly.\nThere are other features of the case, such as the liens against the logs in question, that might, I suspect, have been made more effective in answering the objections resting upon said Statute of Frauds than was done at the trial.\nThe Woodman's Lien Act was cited to us on the argument and there were men engaged in the appellant's part of the work who were entitled under said Act to have made, at the time the agreement in question was entered into, good their claim under said Act. And I find three of these men were those who accompanied appellant to Van Buren on the occasion when the agreement in question was entered into, and returned satisfied with the assurance given appellant by respondent's president to help complete the work appellant had undertaken. One of these at the trial swore that $850 was still due him for such services.\nAnother giving evidence put his claim yet due for similar services at $1,783.\nSuch possibilities, including that of appellant's own claim (for subsection 2 of section 2 of the Act seems wide enough to support a fairly arguable claim on his behalf in that regard) may have been discarded for good reasons arising out of the local jurisprudence in applying the Act.\nBut whether such claims are absolutely well founded in law or not, they, or the possibilities thereunder, were likely to have presented to a business man's mind the actual situation in such a way as to render the assumption of Grandmaison's indebtedness not such an improbable thing as the learned trial judge and the learned Chief Justice in appeal seem to have thought.\nAnd if the claims against appellant by his men were such as could have been registered under the said Act at the time this agreement was entered into, then there existed another possible feature of this case bringing it absolutely within the decision in the case of Fitzgerald v. Dressier[8].\nPerhaps it is in principle within the ruling in that case. I need not, for obvious reasons, already stated, follow that line of thought.\nI cannot find the answers of the jury so inconsistent and conflicting as is urged upon us as to render the verdict worthless. Indeed the outstanding features of the case, that the contract of respondent with Grandmaison was for a higher figure than the basis of appellant's with him, and the profit implied therein stood against any probable loss in the assumption thereof instead of the original liability to Grandmaison under his contract especially in light of the one-sided kind of contract that was giving respondent every possible means of protecting itself, guided by an experience of forty years as its president claimed to have had.\nOnce the $12,000 was got back from Grandmaison, and that no doubt counted on, respondent does not seem to have made any such improbable sub-contract with appellant as the learned trial judge and the majority in the court below seemed to hold the jury had found.\nIt is only as to the probabilities, or improbabilities if you please, that any of these features are worthy of consideration and that only before the jury.\nThere is no plea of fraud presented. And the alleged want of consideration presented as an argument here and below, has nothing to rest upon as a matter of law if the story found true by the jury is correct, or the finding of the jury. Elementary English law does not, unless in case of fraud, require or enable the courts to pass upon the measure of consideration if there is in truth a consideration as herein is presented.\nIn deference to the argument presented I have made many of the foregoing suggestions. I feel myself, however, so much in accord with the reasoning in Mr. Justice Crocket's judgment that I adopt same and need not proceed further than to say I would allow the appeal with costs throughout.\nDuff J.\u2014Grandmaison had a contract to cut and drive the respondent company's logs and the appellant had a subcontract with Grandmaison for the execution of part of this work. Grandmaison, on becoming insolvent absconded, while the appellant's sub-contract remained unexecuted in part. Under some arrangement with the respondent the appellant finished driving the logs he had cut under his subcontract. The jury found that the appellant's account of this arrangement was the true one; but the Appeal Division have held that accepting that account, the arrangement amounted to a guaranty of the obligations undertaken by Grandmaison under the sub-contract with the appellant and that the arrangement, not being evidenced in compliance with the 4th section of the Statute of Frauds, was unenforceable. The evidence of the appellant accepted by the jury was to this effect:\u2014\nGrandmaison has gone away; you will keep on with the work exactly the same as you were to do with Grandmaison; you will finish your contract. Put your wood where you expected to put it with Grandmaison at the mouth of Little Forks. I will pay you. You are not dealing with Grandmaison any more, you are dealing with us. Make your drive and I will pay you. I will pay you your contract as Grandmaison was supposed to pay you at the mouth of the brook.\nI concur with the conclusion of Crocket J. that the evidence interpreted in light of the situation establishes the existence of a new and substantive undertaking by the respondents and not a contract of suretyship.\nGrandmaison by the terms of his contract agreed to complete the work in the spring of 1921, and payment for it was due on the 1st April, 1921, but the contract expressly declared that cash or supplies and equipment to the estimated value of the work done might be advanced as the operation progressed and that such advances should be used only for the purposes of carrying out the contract, and that any diversion of them should be deemed an act to defraud the company. It was further provided that the company might \"stop operations\" at any time should the contractor be indebted to it in excess of the value of the work done or if the contractor should fail to fulfil any of the conditions of the contract. Up to the 1st of April the respondent had advanced $81,000 to Grandmaison, including the sum of $12,000 advanced on the 31st March with which Grandmaison absconded leaving New Brunswick and going to Quebec where he deposited part of the money in his son's name in a bank. This the respondents treated as a breach of the contract and they accordingly took possession of the logs cut by Grandmaison himself as well as by his sub-contractors, including the appellant.\nObviously in these circumstances it became impossible for the appellant to carry out his sub-contract with Grandmaison without the consent at least of the respondents. The terms of the appellant's sub-contract were virtually the same, mutatis mutandis, as those of Grandmaison's contract with the respondent. The contract price was payable by Grandmaison on the 1st June, 1921, as an entirety although the contract contemplated advances in cash and supplies if necessary during the course of its execution. These, however, Grandmaison was under no legal obligation to make. The appellant no doubt immediately, as a result of the respondent's act in taking possession of the logs, acquired a right of action against Grandmaison on the principle of Inchbald v. Neilgherry Coffee Co.[9]; that is to say, he became entitled to treat the contract as at an end and sue for work and labour done instead of suing for damages for breach of contract. Loader v. Slowey[10].\nHe also became entitled to sue for damages for breach of Grandmaison's implied undertaking not to prevent or hinder the performance of the work he had contracted to do. United States v. Peck[11] ; Mackay v. Dick[12].\nIn these circumstances it is quite clear of course that the appellant and the respondents might have arranged that the appellant should proceed with the execution of his subcontract with Grandmaison, and that, treating that contract as still on foot, the respondent should become responsible to the appellant for the performance of Grandmaison's obligations under it. But on the other hand the respondents were entitled to stipulate that the appellant in driving their logs should do so only under the arrangement with them, and not as a sub-contractor with Grandmaison, and indeed they might very well consider it in the circumstances important that they should not in any way recognize any of Grandmaison's sub-contracts. It is agreed on both sides, notwithstanding differences in other vital matters, that the appellant was to \"have nothing more to do with Grandmaison,\" that he was to deal exclusively with the respondents; in other words, it was the basis of the arrangement between the appellant and the respondents that Grandmaison's contract was to be treated as rescinded.\nSuch being the facts, it seems clear that the undertaking by the respondent to pay was an independent undertaking and not a contract of suretyship. A contract of guaranty necessarily presupposes the existence of a principal obligation. As the sub-contract with Grandmaison was treated as rescinded, there remained in the contemplation of the parties no obligation under that contract to pay the contract price in whole or in part, in other words, no principal obligation to which a contract of guaranty could attach. The appeal should, for these reasons, be allowed and judgments given with costs in all courts for the amount of the verdict.\nAnglin J.\u2014The jury was quite within its right in accepting the plaintiff's version of his arrangement with the defendant company rather than that of its president. Nor do I find any such inconsistency in the answers of the jury as would justify setting them aside. Mr. Justice Crocket has, in my opinion, satisfactorily dealt with these aspects of the case.\nWhile I am also prepared to accept the conclusion of that learned judge that the Statute of Frauds is inapplicable, I am not satisfied with the soundness of the view, on which I understand him to base that conclusion, that the defendant's ownership of the logs and its interest in the Grandmaison contract for taking them out suffice to exclude the application of the statute under the test stated in the note (l) to Forth v. Stanton[13]. The evidence discloses no liability on the part either of the defendant or of his property for any sum due by Grandmaison to the plaintiff except such as arises from the express promise sued upon. Davys v. Buswell[14]. If the plaintiff had a lien on the defendant's logs which he had taken out for Grandmaison the case would fall within the test under consideration and the statute would not apply. But a case of lien was neither presented nor established.\nAssuming that the contractual liability of Grandmaison to the plaintiff continued and that it was that liability that the defendant undertook to meet in consideration of the plaintiff completing his contract, I would feel obliged to hold the statute applicable notwithstanding the absolute and unconditional promise to pay made by the defendant. Beattie v. Dinnick[15]. On such an assumption I think the plaintiff's case could be put more strongly on the ground that the immediate and main object of the agreement between Morin and the defendant company was to have the logs, cut by the former and of which the latter had taken possession, driven to the mouth of the river and thus made available for its purposes, and that payment of any debt of Grandmaison to Morin was a mere incident or ulterior consequence of the arrangement. Harburg India Rubber Co. v. Martin[16]; Sutton v. Grey[17]; Emerson v. Slater[18].\nBut, as is pointed out by my brother Duff, the effect of the jury's finding accepting the plaintiff's version of his agreement with the president of the defendant company is that the contract of the latter with Grandmaison and that of Grandmaison with the plaintiff were treated as having been abandoned. Grandmaison had absconded; the defendant company had taken possession of the logs; the plaintiff had no money to complete his drive, even if the defendant would have allowed him to do so under his contract with Grandmaison; without its consent he could do nothing further. On the other hand, no debt was due to Morin by Grandmaison; under the terms of the contract between them none could be due for several months after the completion of the drive. I agree with my learned brother that the defendant company did not undertake to become responsible to Morin for the fulfilment of Grandmaison's obligation under his contract, but, on the contrary, they insisted on Grandmaison's contract and subcontract being entirely superseded and entered into an original and independent undertaking to pay the defendant certain moneys, regardless of any liability of Grandmaison, in consideration of the plaintiff undertaking to drive the logs cut by him to the mouth of the river. I agree with Crocket J. that this formed an independent consideration sufficient to support the defendant's promise to pay Morin.\nI also incline to agree with my brother Duff that there was no principal obligation of Grandmaison in the nature of a debt within the fourth section of the Statute of Frauds which the parties contemplated should be guaranteed by the defendant. Both contracts with Grandmaison were treated as having been abrogated and the basis of the new arrangement was that Morin should have nothing more to do with him.\nBrodeur J.\u2014I entirely concur with the opinion expressed by Mr. Justice Crocket in his dissenting judgment in the court below, and it would be useless for me to add anything to what he has so ably said on the question of law as well as on the interpretation of the findings of the jury.\nAs it is said in Halsbury, vol. 15, p. 462,\nthe true test whether the Statute of Frauds applies is to see whether the person who makes the promise is, but for the liability that attaches to him by reason of the promise, totally unconnected with the transaction, or whether he has an interest in it independently of the promise.\nIf the promise is made by a person connected with the business, then the Statute of Frauds does not apply. This principle has been enunciated in several decisions. Couturier v. Hastie[19] ; Sutton v. Gray[20].\nIn the present case, I am not surprised as to the defendant company making the agreement alleged by the plaintiff and undertaking that the latter should complete his contract and that he would be fully paid for all the work which he had done; otherwise the defendant might be exposed to very serious damages. It must have made some sales of the lumber which was being cut during the winter on its timber limits. There were some liens on this timber. It could not take possession of the logs without discharging these liens. Law suits could have been brought by different persons and could have stopped the driving of the logs during the short time which is available for that purpose. It could experience a great deal of trouble in finding the large number of men necessary to complete delivery of the logs, since all this organization had been made through its principal contractor who had absconded. Then instead of acting as a madman, as it has been suggested, I find that it has acted very wisely in simply continuing the sub-contracts which had been made by Grand-maison. For these reasons, I am of opinion that the verdict of the jury in favour of the appellant should stand and that the judgment of the court below should be reversed with costs throughout and that the plaintiff's action should be maintained.\nMignault J.\u2014I have no difficulty in reconciling the answers made by the jury to the questions put to them, and may simply refer to the judgment of Mr. Justice Crocket on this point.\nIn my view, following the breach by Grandmaison of the contract between him and the respondent and of the sub-contract between him and the appellant, both these contracts were treated by the appellant and the respondent as being at an end. The arrangement made by them, whether the plaintiff's or the respondent's evidence be accepted, was an entirely independent contract, and in no way a promise to answer for Grandmaison's debt. The jury believed the appellant's testimony as to this arrangement, and I agree with the reasons of my brothers Duff and Anglin for considering it entirely outside the Statute of Frauds.\nI would allow the appeal with costs throughout and give judgment to the appellant for the amount of the jury's verdict.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: J.

Ry. Co. to construct at its own cost an overhead crossing over its right of way at a point in the Township of Eton and a highway crossing in the Township of Aubrey. The board granted both applications and gave leave to the company to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada. The order for leave stated that the title of the company was obtained under authority of the Provincial Act, 59 Vict. c. XI, and was expressly made subject to the provisions of sec. 2 thereof, namely, \"such transfer * * * shall not be deemed * * * to affect or prejudice the rights of the public with respect to common and public highways existing at the date hereof within the limits of the land hereby intended to be conveyed.\" It also stated that when the Act was passed there were existing common and public highways across the lands intended thereby to be conveyed but none at either of the points in question and none laid out in the area covered by the Townships of Eton and Aubrey. Further that by an order in council passed in 1866 in respect to lands on the northerly shores of Lakes Huron and Superior an allowance of five per cent of the acreage should be reserved for roads and the right was reserved to the Crown to lay out roads where necessary.\nHeld, per Davies C.J. and Duff, Brodeur and Mignault JJ., that the phrase \"rights of the public with respect to common and public highways existing at the date hereof\" should receive its ordinary grammatical construction, namely, rights of the public in existing highways; and that as there were highways existing on the right of way the rights of the public were only protected in respect thereto. Canadian Pac. Ry. Co. v. Dept. L. and F. (58 Can. S.C.R. 189) expl.\nPer Duff J. The lands transferred being occupied by a railway constructed by the Dominion Government, the transfer of the latter was not one of the kind contemplated by the order in council which primarily related to patents granted under the Ontario Land Acts. Per Anglin J. The legislature could not have intended that sec. 2 of 59 Vict., c. XI, would only protect public rights in the scattered trails over the hundreds of miles covered by the right of way in question and must have meant to protect such rights which were in posse under the order in council when the Act was passed; but as the order in council only applies to lands on the northerly shores of lakes Huron and Superior, and the townships of Eton and Aubrey are not so situated, there is no reservation of rights in respect to the highways in question on this appeal and the province of Ontario has no right reserved to construct crossings over the railway.\nIdington J. did not deal with the merits of the appeal, being of opinion that the order of the board did not present such a stated case as required by law to give this court jurisdiction.\nAPPEAL from the decision of the Board of Railway Commissioners for Canada that the cost of constructing crossings of the Canadian Pacific line of railway in the Kenora District should be borne by the company.\nThe order of the board granting leave to appeal from its decision reads as follows:\u2014\nOrder No. 32294\nTHE BOARD OF RAILWAY COMMISSIONERS FOR CANADA\nWednesday, the 12th day of April, A.D. 1922.\nHON. F. B. CARVELL, K.C., Chief Commissioner.\nS. J. McLEAN, Asst. Chief Commissioner.\nJ. G. RUTHERFORD, C.M.G., Commissioner.\nIn the matter of the application of the Department of Lands and Forests, Northern Development branch, province of Ontario, hereinafter called the \"Applicant,\" for an order directing the Canadian Pacific Railway Company, hereinafter called the \"Railway Company,\" to provide and construct an overhead crossing, at its own expense, over its right of way on the line between Lots 6 and 7, Concession 1, in the Township of Eton, District of Kenora, Province of Ontario;\nAnd in the matter of the application of the applicant, under section 256 of the Railway Act, 1919, for an order directing the Railway Company to provide a suitable highway crossing where its railway intersects the line between Lots 10 and 11, Concession 6, in the Township of Aubrey, District of Kenora, Province of Ontario, mileage 73 of the Railway Company's Ignace sub-division, file Nos. 30870 and 28140.\nUpon the application of the Railway Company, and upon consideration of the submissions made on behalf of the Railway Company and the applicant; and upon its appearing that the Railway Company's railway through the townships in question was constructed in the year 1883, and that the right of way on which the said railway was constructed was conveyed to the Railway Company by Letters Patent issued under authority of the Dominion of Canada, dated 29th March, 1904, having been previously conveyed to the Dominion of Canada by an order in council made by the Lieutenant-Governor in Council of Ontario, dated 3rd June, A.D. 1897, and issued under the authority of the statute of the province, 59 Victoria, chapter XI;\nAnd upon its appearing that at the time of the passing of the said statute, 59 Victoria, chapter XI, there were existing common and public highways across the lands intended to be conveyed by that Act, but no such highway was in fact located at either of the points now in question, nor were any highways laid out in the area covered by the townships of Eton and Aubrey which were then unsurveyed;\nAnd upon its appearing that the Railway Company's title was, under the terms of the said order in council dated June 3, 1897, made expressly subject to the conditions and limitations contained in section 2 of the said provincial Act, which section provides\u2014\n\"Such transfer shall be deemed to be subject to any agreement, lease, or conveyance affecting the same made by the Government of Ontario before the passing of this Act, as well as to the limitations and conditions, if any, in the order in council making the transfer, and the order in council shall not be deemed to have conveyed, or to convey, the gold or silver mines in the lands transferred, or to affect or prejudice the rights of the public with respect to common and public highways existing at the date hereof, within the limits of the land hereby intended to be conveyed\"\u2014 And upon its appearing that, under the terms of the order in council, made on the recommendation of the Commissioner of Crown Lands, dated August 6, 1866, it was provided that in respect of lands on the northerly shores of lakes Huron and Superior, an allowance of five per cent of the acreage be reserved for roads, as is done in Lower Canada, and that a clause be inserted in letters patent for the lands accordingly, also reserving the right of the Crown to lay out roads where necessary;\nAnd upon its appearing that the townships of Eton and Aubrey are situated upwards of 200 miles westerly of Fort William;\nAnd whereas the time within which an appeal herein from this Board to the Supreme Court of Canada might be made, was extended until the 18th day of April instant;\nAnd whereas, in the opinion of the Board, a question of law arises as to the effect of the above statute and orders in council\u2014\nIt is ordered that leave be, and it is hereby, granted the Railway Company to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada upon the following question of law, namely;\n\"Whether, upon the facts stated by the Board, the title of the Railway Company is subject to a prior right reserved in the Crown to construct and maintain public crossings over the Railway Company's right of way, as applied for by the applicant herein.\"\n(Signed) F. B. CARVELL,\nChief Commissioner,\nBoard of Railway Commissioners for Canada.\nThe reasons for the decision of the board were prepared by Mr. McLean, Assistant Chief Commissioner, and were concurred in by Commissioner Rutherford. He held that the order in council of 1866 is still in force, that the points in question on the railway are on the northerly shores of Lakes Huron and Superior, and that public rights in crossings on highways laid out under authority of the order in council are preserved by sec. 2 of 59 Vict., c. XI.\nTilley K.C. for the appellant.\nF. E. Titus for the respondent. The Chief Justice.\u2014This case comes before us by way of appeal, granted by the Board of Railway Commissioners, from two orders of the board authorizing the construction of highways across the railway in the Township of Aubrey and Eton and ordering that the construction and maintenance should be borne by the railway company.\nThe facts stated by the board were that,\u2014\nUpon its appearing that the railway company's railway through the townships in question was constructed in the year 1883, and that the right of way on which the said railway was constructed was conveyed to the railway company by letters patent issued under the authority of the Dominion of Canada, dated 29th March, 1904, having been previously conveyed to the Dominion of Canada by an Order in Council made by the Lieutenant Governor in Council of Ontario, dated 3rd June, A.D. 1897, and issued under the authority of the statute of the province, 59 Victoria, chapter XI;\nAnd upon its appearing that at the time of the passing of the said statute, 59 Victoria, chapter XI, there were existing common and public highways across the lands intended to be conveyed by that Act, but no such highway was in fact located at either of the points now in question, nor were any highways laid out in the area covered by the townships of Eton and Aubrey which were then unsurveyed;\nAnd upon its appearing that the railway company's title was, under the terms of the said Order in Council, dated 3rd June, 1897, made expressly subject to the conditions and limitations contained in section 2 of the said provincial Act, which section provides\u2014\n\"Such transfer shall be deemed to be subject to any agreement, lease, or conveyance affecting the same made by the Government of Ontario before the passing of this Act, as well as to the limitations and conditions, if any, in the Order in Council making the transfer, and the Order in Council shall not be deemed to have conveyed, or to convey, the gold or silver mines in the lands transferred, or to affect or prejudice the rights of the public with respect to common and public highways existing at the date hereof, within the limits of the land hereby intended to be conveyed\"\u2014\nAnd upon its appearing that under the terms of the Order in Council made on the recommendation of the Commissioner of Crown Lands, dated August 6, 1866, it was provided that in respect of lands on the northerly shores of Lakes Huron and Superior, an allowance of five per cent of the acreage be reserved for roads, as is done in Lower Canada, and that a clause be inserted in letters patent for the lands accordingly, also reserving the right of the Crown to lay out roads where necessary;\nIt is ordered that leave be, and it is hereby granted, the railway company to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada, upon the following question of law, namely:\n\"Whether upon the facts stated by the Board, the title of the railway company is subject to a prior right reserved in the Crown to construct and maintain public crossings over the railway company's right of way, as applied for by the applicant herein.\" The admitted fact found by the board that at the time of the passing of the statute of the province, 59 Vict., c. XI, there were common and public highways existing across the lands intended to be conveyed by that Act, appears to me to be the controlling factor in determining the true meaning and intent of the statute and order in council under which the railway company obtained its title.\nThat title was, under the terms of the order in council, dated 3rd June, 1897, made expressly subject to the conditions and limitations contained in sec. 2 of the provincial Act which provided, inter alia, that the\nOrder in Council making the transfer shall not be deemed to affect or prejudice the rights of the public with respect to common and public highways existing at the date hereof, within the limits of the land hereby intended to be conveyed.\nIt is admitted that there were such highways then existing and in my opinion the language of the section cannot be construed as applicable to the highways now in question and which are only now sought to be opened and provided.\nReference was made at the argument to the case, known as the \"Kirkpatrick Case,\" before this court[1] Canadian Pac. Ry. Co. v. Dept. of P.W. of Ontario, where it was held that in view of the finding of fact by the board in that case, that there were no highways in the district when the railway company acquired title, the condition of sec. 2 of the Act must be construed as meaning\nthe rights of the public existing at the date hereof in common and public highways,\nand as including rights in highways to be laid out under the reservation for roads by the order in council of 1866. As these potential highways existed before the crossing (asked for), the company being the junior occupant was properly charged with the expense.\nUnder the facts stated in that case and on which the decision of the court was based, namely, that there were no highways in the district when the railway acquired title, the decision of the court seemed to be the only one that could be given. I may be pardoned for quoting a paragraph from my own judgment in that case:\nI confess that if I had to answer the question submitted to us without regard to the findings on the questions of fact of the Railway Board, I should hesitate a good deal before answering in the affirmative * * * If there were no public highways laid out at the date the statute was passed, it would be without meaning or effect unless it (the statute) was held to apply to potential highways which might be opened from time to time under the reservation of the five per cent area provided for in the order in council of 1866. If there are two meanings which may be given to the language of a public statute one of which would render the statute meaningless and ineffective for the purposes it was meant to cover and the other which would give effect to the statute, I take it the latter must be adopted.\nIn the case now before us it appears that the court in the Kirkpatrick Case[2] was misled as to the determining factor whether or not there were any existing highways when the statute was passed.\nIt is now stated that there were such existing highways and in my judgment the language of section 2 cannot apply to potential and non-existing highways such as we now have to deal with in this case and the language of the section must be given its plain and natural meaning and confined to then existing common and public highways and as not having in view, or being applicable to, non-existing highways.\nI would allow the appeal, with costs.\nIdington J. (dissenting).\u2014This is an appeal from the Board of Railway Commissioners for Canada upon what is alleged to be a stated case pursuant to the provisions of the Railway Act in that regard.\nCounsel for appellant in his argument herein suggested that some of us, if not all, in the case of Canadian Pac. Ry. Co. v. Department of Public Works of Ontario (1), had misapprehended the facts.\nI suggested that that furnished a good reason for going back to the board and having their case properly stated inasmuch as it did not appear to me to be so.\nI suggested the same to counsel for the respondent.\nMy suggestion met with no response. I found then that the so-called stated case in the previous submission, above cited, was in substance identical in its terms with that now submitted herein, save in the difference in township and district in which the respective highways in question were situated.\nIndeed this case as submitted would seem to have been copied from the other.\nWhat are the facts as found by the board?\nAre we to travel through the judgment of the board to find same, as argument of counsel seemed to indicate was intended?\nI most respectfully submit not, in face of the dispute relative thereto and the suggestion of a misapprehension of same when similarly stated in a case of much less complicated character.\nAnd if we turn to the order which stated the case and should contain a concise statement of the relevant facts giving rise to the application of the question of law supposed to be raised by the case, are we to speculate at large, as it were, upon what may be the question of law arising, and are we to assume as a matter of fact that the order in council of 1866, before confederation in fact, related to those lands now in question?\nI need not enlarge, for any one looking at the map must be puzzled as to that. It is either relevant or it is not. Yet it is a question of fact which might well affect the dubious language of the Act and the grant made thereunder.\nI may point out that the cases such as Bischop v. Toler[3], and In re County Council of Cardigan[4], shew, as do many others to be found in Boulton's Law and Practice of a Stated Case, how far this case as stated falls below what is required.\nI must therefore hold it should be dismissed for that reason alone.\nDuff J.\u2014This appeal raises a question touching the construction of certain words of an Act of the Legislature of Ontario, c. 11, 59 Vict. I think it will be convenient to set out the statute in full. It is in these words:\u2014\nHer Majesty by and with the advice and consent of the Legislative Assembly of the Province of Ontario, enacts as follows:\u2014\n1. The Lieutenant Governor in Council may in his discretion transfer to the Dominion of Canada any lands heretofore taken and occupied by the Canadian Pacific Railway for the road-bed, stations, station grounds, and other purposes of the said railway and included in the plans of the railway deposited by the company in the office of the Minister of Railways and Canals, the same being so transferred to enable the Government of Canada to fulfil its obligations to the said company in that behalf with respect to the railway. The lands so transferable shall be the lands lying between the terminus of the Canada Central Railway near Nipissing known as Calendar Station, and the western boundary of the province of Ontario, near Rat Portage and between the junction at Sudbury on the main line of the Canadian Pacific Railway for the Algoma Branch and the River Saint Mary.\n2. Such transfer shall be deemed to be subject to any agreement, lease or conveyance affecting the same made by the Government of Ontario before the passing of this Act, as well as to the limitations and conditions, if any, in the Order in Council making the transfer, and the Order in Council shall not be deemed to have conveyed or to convey the gold or silver mines in the lands transferred, or to affect or prejudice the rights of the public with respect to common and public highways existing at the date hereof within the limits of the lands hereby intended to be conveyed.\n3. Such transfer by Order in Council shall be as binding on the province of Ontario as if the same were specified and set forth in the Act of this legislature.\nSubsequently by order in council (under this statute) of the 3rd June, 1897, the land occupied by the C.P.R. for road beds, stations and station grounds and other railway purposes between Fort William and Cross Lake were vested in the \"Government of the Dominion of Canada\" subject to certain conditions not material and\nsubject to conditions and limitations specified in section 2 of the (Act of 1896.)\nThe point in dispute arises in this way. By an order in council of the 6th August, 1866, certain provisions were made in respect of a survey of \"lands on the northerly shore of Lakes Huron and Superior\" and for the establishment of roads in that part of the country. And it was provided for that purpose that\nan allowance of 5 per cent of the acreage of lands be reserved for the roads, as is done in Lower Canada, and that a clause be inserted in the letters patent for the lands accordingly, also reserving the right of the Crown to lay out roads where necessary.\nIt is stated in the case submitted that at the time of the passing of the Act of 1896, there were existing highways; but it is now contended by the province that the effect of the statute is to reserve to the Crown in right of the province the right\nto construct and maintain public crossings over the railway company's right of way\nin conformity with the spirit of the order in council of August, 1866. Whether this right is reserved or not is the question to be decided on this appeal.\nOn behalf of the province it is argued that the statute preserves not only the rights of the public in existing highways but that it reserves a right to the Crown to lay out and construct highways over the lands granted.\nThe more natural construction of the section appears to be that which treats the words\nexisting at the date hereof within the limits of the lands hereby intended to be conveyed\nas an adjectival phrase qualifying highways and the words\nwithin the limits of the lands hereby intended to be conveyed\nas an adverbial element qualifying \"existing.\" This appears to be the grammatical construction of the language.\nI can see no reason for departing from the grammatical and ordinary sense of these words. I do not forget Lord Macnaghten's language in Vacher & Sons v. London Society of Compositors[5] at p.118, where he says that in the absence of a preamble as a rule there are only two cases in which it is permissible to depart from the ordinary and natural sense of the words in an enactment; those two cases being, 1st, where the words taken in their natural sense lead to some absurdity, and 2nd, where there is some other clause in the body of the enactment inconsistent with or repugnant to the clause in question construing in the ordinary sense the language in which it is expressed. I am unable to discover any absurdity or repugnancy arising from reading the words according to their natural sense nor indeed can I, without straining the language to a degree for which there appears to be no justification, find anything in the statute which reserves to the provincial government the right which is now claimed.\nRead as they stand, without any kind of distortion, the words seem quite apt to reserve the rights of the public in respect of existing common and public highways, the rights of the public (that is to say the rights of His Majesty's liege subjects) to use such highways for what may be called highway purposes, rights not vested in the Crown as proprietor but generally under the guardianship of the Crown as parens patri\u0153. As applied to highways existing at the time, that is to say, at the critical time, the date of the passing of the Act, the language seems to be clear, precise and apt.\nLet us consider the effect of the statute under the alternative construction proposed. The right claimed is, as already mentioned, the right to construct and maintain public crossings over the railway company's right of way. Now the rights reserved to the Crown by the order in council cited above obviously become operative only when a title has passed from the Crown to a grantee. Strictly the right reserved to the Crown is a right to lay out highways over the lands granted and to assume such part of those lands as may be necessary without compensation up to 5 per cent of their area. It may be conceded that these rights reserved to the Crown are rights which do not depend upon the terms of the patent but in all cases to which the order in council applies they exist by virtue of the order in council itself whatever the terms of the instrument of grant may be; and I think it would not be an exaggerated or non-natural construction of the phrase used in the second section of the statute of 1896 (\"rights of the public\") to read it as comprehending these rights of the Crown exercisable in respect of lands granted for the purpose of providing highways. The language is not very apt for such a purpose it is true, but I think that would not be an inadmissable construction. But it is a very different matter to treat this order in council as giving rise to rights in the \"public\" in the sense above mentioned (all His Majesty's subjects) in land still ungranted and still vested in the Crown.\nThe whole allodial title in such a case is in the Crown and, except as regards highways established by law, that title is burdened by no \"rights of the public\" in any accurate sense of the term in relation to highways. As a famous American judge recently said that \"such words as 'right' are a constant solicitation to fallacy.\" Jackman v. Rosenbaum[6], at page 8 per Holmes J. It is the duty of public officials charged with the administration of Crown lands to act according to law; and the \"public\" using the term as denoting the body of citizens in whom reposes what Mr. Dicey calls the \"political sovereignty\" of the province, has perhaps in some loose sense a \"right\" to have this duty observed. But even here \"public\" has not the same meaning as it has when one speaks of the \"rights of the public\" in a highway.\nThere is no good reason I apprehend for ascribing to the phrase \"rights of the public\" used in this statute any such vague indefinite import; \"rights of the public\" as applied to such a subject as highways means according to the ordinary signification of the words rights of a class known to the law and capable of legal protection at least in some proceeding by the Crown ad vindicatam publicam. I can see no reason why they should not be given effect to according to that meaning.\nAgain the lands conveyed by the statute were already in occupation for the purposes of the railway already constructed by the Dominion Government under the authority of statute in execution of the undertaking given by the Dominion in the British Columbia terms of union. Under the Expropriation Act the proper Dominion officials had authority in so far as the Dominion Parliament could grant such authority, to enter upon the Crown lands of the province for the purpose of constructing public works, the procedure for doing so being laid down in the Act. The Lake Superior section of the railway was built almost wholly through the Crown lands of the province with the knowledge of everybody in Canada and it must be assumed, after the lapse of forty years, that the Government proceeded either in conformity with the procedure laid down by statute or that it did so with the consent of the provincial government. That the Dominion had authority to enter upon and take provincial lands for this purpose I seems to be the necessary result of the decision of the Privy Council in Attorney General of British Columbia v. Canadian Pac. Ry. Co.[7]. Whatever may be thought as to the general scope of the principle laid down in that case it is conclusive upon this point at least, that the Dominion in execution of the agreement with British Columbia in relation to the construction of the Canadian Pac. Ry. had authority to enter upon and take the Crown lands of a province for the purpose of constructing the railway agreed upon. One has no difficulty in understanding the desire of the company to have a conveyance from Ontario in order to set at rest any possible question as to the regularity of its title but for the purpose of the present question it must be taken that the lands were lawfully in the occupation of the railway for railway purposes; and in such circumstances authority to construct and maintain a highway over the railway could only be given by the Dominion Parliament. Attorney General of Alberta v. Attorney General for Canada[8].\nI can find nothing in the order in council which makes it applicable to such a case. It is an order in council primarily applying to lands granted to a subject by letters patent. It is not an instrument framed in contemplation of the transfer of lands to a Government department or other public authority for the purpose of constructing a government railway or other public work. Nor can I see anything in the statute of 1896 pointing to an intention to reserve to the Provincial Government a right to construct and maintain works which could only be exercised under authority given by the Dominion Parliament.\nThe previous decision presents no difficulty. It proceeded upon a misapprehension of fact.\nThe question should be answered in the negative. Anglin J.\u2014By leave of the Board of Railway Commissioners, given under section 52 (3) of the Railway Act, 1919, the Canadian Pacific Railway Company appeals to this court on the following question of law:\u2014\nWhether, upon the facts stated by the Board, the title of the railway company is subject to a prior right reserved in the Crown to construct and maintain public crossings over the railway company's right of way, as applied for by the applicant herein.\nThe decision of the board being final on questions of fact which it has determined (s. 52, s.s. 6 and 10 (a)) and the submission being \"upon the facts stated by the board\" we look to the order granting leave for the facts upon which we are to proceed. Inter alia it is therein stated that the right of way of the appellant consists of property conveyed to it by Dominion letters patent (1904) which had been previously conveyed to the Dominion by order in council of the Lieutenant-Governor of Ontario (27th of May, 1897\u2014a date probably erroneously given instead of the 3rd of June, 1897) issued under the authority of the statute of the province, 59 Vict., c. XI (assented to on the 7th of April, 1896), and that\nthe railway company's title was * * * made expressly subject to the conditions and limitations contained in section 2 of the said provincial Act.\nAlthough the Dominion letters patent of 1904 now before us omit the clause, found in the letters patent of other lands granted in 1906 (which were before the court in the Kirkpatrick Township Case[9] at page 194), making the title thereby conferred on the railway company expressly subject to\nthe limitations and conditions and the reservations set forth in the Order in Council of the Lieutenant Governor of our said province of Ontario, dated, etc.,\nin my opinion the facts stated by the board preclude the contention addressed to us that the appellant obtained by the grant of 1904 rights authority to confer which is vested in the Dominion for railway purposes and which are paramount to and override any conditions, limitations or reservations that accompanied the transfer of the provincial title to the Dominion as prescribed by section 2 of the provincial statute. Upon \"the facts stated by the Board,\" which constitute the hypothesis upon which the question of law is submitted to us, what we are asked to determine is whether the statutory declaration that any transfer made under the authority of the 59 Vict., c. XI,\nshall not be deemed * * * to affect or prejudice the rights of the public with respect to common and public highways existing at the date hereof\nreserved to the Crown the\nright to construct and maintain public crossings over the railway company's right of way, as applied for by the applicant herein,\n\u2014nothing else and nothing more.\nUpon the statement of fact made by the board in the submission of the Township of Kirkpatrick Case[10], that\nno highway was laid out across the said railway before title to its right of way was acquired,\nthis court there determined that the words,\nrights of the public in common and public highways existing at the date hereof,\nin section 2 of the Act, 59 Vict., c. XI,\nmust be construed as meaning \"the rights of the public existing at the date hereof in common and public highways\" and as including rights in highways to be laid out under the reservation\nof 5 per cent for roads made in the survey of the township pursuant to the policy established by an ante-confederation order in council of 1866 of the late province of Canada made under the authority of C.S.C., c. 22, s. 7.\nWe are now confronted with the statement of fact, made in the board's order granting leave to appeal,\nthat at the time of the passing of the statute, 59 Vict., c. XI, there were existing common and public highways across the lands intended to be conveyed by that Act.\nThis new statement of fact, no doubt, takes away the ground on which the judgment of the majority of this court proceeded in the Township of Kirkpatrick Case10 and I agree that the court is not bound to regard the construction there put upon the language of the reservation made in section 2 of the 59 Vict., c. XI (0.) as at all conclusive in the case now presented.\nBut with respect for the views of my colleagues who are of a contrary opinion, I remain unconvinced that in providing for the transfer to the Canadian Pacific Railway Company of a right of way over provincial Crown lands from Calendar to the Manitoba boundary, a distance of many hundreds of miles, the only public rights of crossing which the legislature and Government of Ontario intended to protect were in respect of the few scattered trails which the railway then intersected and that they meant to forego, so far as they might effect the railway right of way, whatever rights it had been provided, should be reserved for the construction of public highways by the order in council of 1866. Merely to avoid repetition, on this aspect of the matter I refer to what I said in the Township of Kirkpatrick Case[11]. In the whole area of the townships of Eton and Aubrey with which we are now dealing, and through which the railway runs for 123 miles, the fact, as now stated by the board, is that no highways were laid out at the date of enactment of 59 Vict., c. 11.\nThese townships were surveyed after the passing of that statute. The fact that in them a reservation of 5 per cent for highways has been made is therefore in itself of no significance. If the territory included in them should be regarded as part of the \"lands on the northerly shore of Lakes (sic.) Huron and Superior\" dealt with by the order in council of 1866 (as the township of Kirkpatrick was admitted to be in the former case (1) at pp. 191 and 195) the same \"rights of the public\" which prevailed there must, I think, have been respected here. I should perhaps add that a reservation by the Crown of the rights of the public in regard to highways actually existing would scarcely seem to have been necessary, whereas in regard to highways not located, but for the sites of which there was provision in the 5 per cent reservation directed to be made in surveys, such a reservation would be eminently proper and reasonable. But in the present case the applicability of the order in council of 1866 to the territory included in the townships of Eton and Aubrey is in issue. It is not affirmed in the order granting leave to appeal. On the contrary, while the order in council is recited in that order and is also included as one of the documents in the case, the recital of it is immediately followed by the statement that\nthe townships of Eton and Aubrey are situated upwards of 200 miles westerly of Fort William.\nAn Ontario departmental map put in with the case shews that the District of Rainy River, in the province of Ontario and part of the State of Minnesota, lies between those townships and Lake Superior. The eastern boundary of the townships of Aubrey and Eton will, if produced southerly, extend through the District of Rainy River into the State of Minnesota and will never reach Lake Superior, but will pass many miles west of its extreme western end.\nNotwithstanding these facts the learned Assistant Chief Commissioner in his reasons for judgment held that the territory comprised in these townships fell within the description \"lands on the northerly shore of Lake Huron and Superior.\" I was for some time disposed to think that we should accept that finding as \"final\" under s. 52 (10a) of the Railway Act, because the recital of the order in council of 1866 in the board's order granting leave to appeal would seem to imply its relevancy. On further consideration, however, in view of the omission from the board's order of the explicit finding on that point contained in the learned commissioner's opinion, of the specific statement that the two townships are situated 200 miles west of Fort William, and of the fact that the question to be determined by us is whether there has been a reservation of rights to the Crown covering the points at which the applicant has applied for the construction of public crossings, I now regard the applicability of the order in council of 1866 to these localities as one of the matters involved in the question submitted, no other reservation of rights than that made by such order in council having been suggested.\nWith very great respect, I am of the opinion that the territory comprised in the townships of Aubrey and Eton cannot be regarded as \"lands on the northerly shore of Lake Huron and Superior,\" and that the order in council of 1866 therefore does not apply to it. No other reservation of right in regard to highways in that territory, before the 7th April, 1896, having been preferred, it follows that upon the case as now presented it must be held that no\nright reserved in the Crown to construct and maintain public crossings over the (appellant) railway company's right of way, as applied for by the applicant,\nhas been shown: and if no such right, of course no such \"prior right.\"\nI would for these reasons answer the question submitted in the negative and would therefore allow the appeal.\nBrodeur J.\u2014This is an appeal from the Board of Railway Commissioners on a question of law under the provisions of the \"Railway Act.\"\nThe question which the board has given leave to submit reads as follows:\nWhether upon the facts stated by the Board the title of the company is subject to the prior right reserved in the Crown to construct and maintain public crossings over the company's right of way, as applied for by the applicant herein.\nIn order to fully understand the bearing of this question it is necessary to state briefly what are the facts and the circumstances which have given rise to the present appeal.\nIn 1866, an order in council was passed by the government of the day directing that out of the lands on the northerly shore of Lakes Huron and Superior an allowance of five per cent of the acreage of lands be reserved for roads and that a clause be inserted in letters patent for the lands accordingly, also reserving the right of the Crown to lay out roads where necessary.\nIn 1883, the Canadian Pacific Railway was built in the northwestern part of Ontario under Dominion legislation. At that time the townships of Eton and Aubrey, in which the crossings in issue in this case are situated, were not proclaimed; and it was only in 1896 and 1897 that they were surveyed in accordance with the provisions of the order in council of 1866. No road allowances were laid on the survey plans, but in the grants of lands subsequently made five per cent was reserved for roads.\nAs it was contended by some that the Dominion Parliament could not authorize the taking of provincial Crown lands for the construction of a Dominion Railway (Attorney General of British Columbia v. Canadian Pacific Ry. Co.[12], it was suggested that legislation should be passed by the province of Ontario for the purpose of setting this contention at rest; and, in 1896, the legislature of this province authorized the transfer of the lands occupied by the Canadian Pacific Railway on the condition that the grant should not\naffect or prejudice the rights of the public with respect to common and public highways existing at the date hereof.\nIn 1897 the Ontario Government vested in the Dominion of Canada the lands occupied by the Canadian Pacific Railway from Fort William to the western boundary of Ontario, which included the rights of way through the two townships above mentioned. This grant of the Ontario Government was made on the condition above quoted of the statute of 1896.\nIt has now become necessary to open highways in these townships and the Railway Board has decided that the right of way of the railway company being subject to the rights of the public with respect to the common and public highways existing means that the condition covers not only existing highways, but potential highways.\nThis question is not a new one; it came before us in 1918 in a case concerning the construction of a crossing in the township of Kirkpatrick[13]. In this Kirkpatrick Township Case (1) the majority of the court came to the conclusion, on the construction of facts stated by the board, that there were no highways in the district when the railway company acquired title and that the rights of the public included rights in potential highways to be laid out under the reservation for roads by the order in council of 1866.\nIn the facts now submitted to us, it is formally stated that there were highways existing in the district. I did not then concur in the view expressed by the majority of the court. It seemed to me impossible that it could be suggested that from the District of Nipissing to the western boundary line of Ontario there were not highways existing when the law of 1896 was passed; and I quoted different Ontario statutes which, according to my mind, would controvert this suggestion. I was of the view that the statute of 1896 had to be construed according to the ordinary grammatical rule ad proximum antecedent fiat relatio and the words\nrights of the public with respect to common and public highways existing at the date hereof\nmean not rights then existing with respect to highways, but rights of the public with respect to highways then existing. The participle \"existing\" qualifies not the substantive \"rights\" but the substantive \"highways,\" because it is nearer the latter than the former. My construction of the facts submitted to us and of the statute did not prevail and I was, with my brother Mignault, in the minority.\nWith the facts which are now submitted to us by the board, it is evident that the legislature of Ontario did not intend to refer in its legislation of 1896 to potential highways, but to the highways built and established at the time it was passed.\nFor these reasons the appeal should be allowed with costs and we should answer negatively the question submitted to us; and we should state that the title of the railway company is not subject to the prior right reserved in the Crown to construct and maintain a public crossing over the railway company's right of way.\nMignault J.\u2014In the case of The Canadian Pacific Ry. Co. v. Department of Public Works of Ontario[14], referred to in the judgment appealed from as \"The Kirkpatrick Case,\" I expressed the opinion that the question of seniority should be decided in favour of the railway company. My brother Brodeur was of the same view, but the majority of the court decided otherwise, holding that the highway and not the railway company was senior. In that case, the statement of facts on which the judgment of the court was based declared expressly that\nno highway was laid out across the said railway before title to its right of way was acquired under the said Order in Council.\nHere the case submitted by the Railway Board states that\nat the time of the passing of the said statute, 59 Victoria (Ontario), chapter XI, there were existing common and public highways across the lands intended to be conveyed by that Act, but no such highway was in fact located at either of the points now in question, nor were any highways laid out in the area covered by the townships of Eton and Aubrey which were then unsurveyed.\nThe Ontario statute here referred to authorized the Lieutenant Governor in Council of Ontario to transfer to the Dominion of Canada certain lands occupied by the Canadian Pacific Railway between Calender Station, at the eastern extremity of Lake Nipissing, and the western boundary of Ontario, and in the former case I said that I could not assume that there were no highways in this large tract of land covering several hundred miles. It now turns out that there were highways across the lands intended to be conveyed by the Act, and the case stated for the opinion of this court expressly so declares.\nI think this difference of statement of fact sufficiently differentiates this case from the previous one and leaves me free to decide (as I think it should be decided) the question of seniority in favour of the company without it being necessary to repeat what I said in the former case. I feel all the less hesitation in distinguishing the two cases because the portion of railway over which it is proposed to carry the highways in question was originally built by the Dominion of Canada under the authority of the Dominion statute, 37 Vict., c. 14. For the purpose of this work Parliament could and did authorize the Dominion Government to take provincial Crown lands; Attorney General for British Columbia v. Canadian Pacific Ry. Co.[15]. And the grant of this portion of the railway, to wit the portion between Fort William and Manitoba, made by the Dominion to the appellant on the 29th March, 1904, under the authority of the Dominion statute, 44 Vict., c. 1, is in no wise based upon the Ontario statute above referred to, and contains no restrictions whatever in respect of highways.\nI would allow the appeal with costs and answer the question submitted in the negative.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant : W.

The purchaser having, then, made default in his payments, the former owners resumed possession of the property. Shortly after the company which had so operated made a voluntary assignment under the Bankruptcy Act.\nHeld, Idington and Brodeur JJ. dissenting, the said company was not a \"railway company\" within the meaning of sec. 2 (k) of the Bankruptcy Act and its assignment was authorized under the provisions of that Act.\nShortly before going into bankruptcy the company made an assignment of its book debts which under sec. 30 (1) of the Act was void if the assignor did not comply with the requirements of provincial legislation as to registration, notice and publication thereof.\nHeld, that the assignment was void as against the trustee in bankruptcy though there was no such provincial legislation.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick on a case stated between the parties hereto.\nCase stated to the court on the application of The Eastern Trust Company, trustee in bankruptcy of the estate of the Inverness Railway and Collieries Limited.\n1. The Inverness Railway & Coal Company is a body corporate, incorporated by special Act of the legislature of Nova Scotia for the purpose of owning and operating a mining undertaking at Inverness and elsewhere in the county of Inverness and for the purpose of owning and operating a railway in said county and the said company had duly built a railway from Canso to Inverness and had operated the same in the carrying of freight and passengers and had operated mines at Inverness up to the 20th day of July, 1920.\n2. The National Trust Company, Limited, is a body corporate and the mortgagee of the entire railway and mining undertaking of Inverness Railway & Coal Company and trustee for bondholders under a trust deed.\n3. By agreement in writing, which appears in schedule \"A\" hereto, and which was dated the 16th day of June, 1920, said Inverness Railway & Coal Company, Limited, and the National Trust Company, Limited, agreed to sell the entire undertaking of the said Inverness Railway & Coal Company to Myron E. C. Henderson upon the terms therein expressed and in pursuance of said agreement said Myron E. C. Henderson entered into possession of the properties therein described on the 20th day of July, 1920.\n4. The Inverness Railway & Collieries, Limited, is a body corporate, incorporated under the provisions of the Nova Scotia Joint Stock Companies Act on the 28th day of July, 1920, for the purpose of carrying on a mining and railway undertaking. In accordance with the provisions of the Railway Act, Revised Statutes of Nova Scotia, 1900, and amendments thereto, said Myron E. C. Henderson notified, copy of which notice is hereto annexed as schedule \"B\", the Commissioner of Mines on the 20th day of July, 1920, that he had purchased the said properties, but no notification was ever given the said Commissioner of Mines by or on behalf of the Inverness Railway & Collieries, Limited, of that company's intention to run or operate a railway. On the 21st day of July, 1920, said Myron E. C. Henderson and Inverness Railway & Collieries, Limited, entered into the agreement hereto attached as schedule \"C\".\n5. Said Inverness Railway & Collieries, Limited, as agents of said Myron E. C. Henderson operated the said railway from on or about the 21st day of July, 1920, up to and until the 7th day of February, 1921, when the said Inverness Railway & Coal Company and the National Trust Company re-entered into possession of the properties on default having been made by said Myron E. C. Henderson under his agreement. 6. The Royal Bank of Canada, on the 27th day of December, 1920, received an assignment of book debts from Inverness Railway & Collieries, Limited, and a copy of such assignment is hereto attached as schedule \"D\".\n7. For the purposes of this application only (and not debarring or estopping the trustee of the Inverness Railway & Collieries, Limited, from denying or disputing the fact in any other or subsequent proceeding and specially reserving to the trustee its rights, if any, to set aside said assignment of book debts as having been given without adequate or any consideration) it is admitted the Royal Bank of Canada gave present cash value on taking such assignment of book debts.\n8. On the 26th day of February the Inverness Railway & Collieries, Limited, made an assignment under the provisions of the Bankruptcy Act to The Eastern Trust Company, trustee in bankruptcy.\n9. Two questions are raised for the consideration of the judge in bankruptcy:\n(a) Whether the assignment made by the Inverness Railway & Collieries, Limited, to The Eastern Trust Company was authorized under the provisions of The Bankruptcy Act;\n(b) Assuming such assignment be valid, whether the general assignment of book debts to the Royal Bank is void as against the trustee in bankruptcy.\nThe Judges of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia were equally divided in opinion as to the answer to be given the first question. The second was answered by the majority in the affirmative.\nA. W. Stewart for the appellant. The Inverness Ry. & Collieries Co. was a railway company and not subject to The Bankruptcy Act. See International Coal Co. v. County of Cape Breton[1].\nA. W. Stewart for the appellant.\nJenks K.C. for the respondent.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014This appeal is from a judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia on a stated case submitted to that court in which two questions were asked as follows:\n(a) Whether the assignment made by the Inverness Railway & Collieries, Limited, to the Eastern Trust Co. was authorized under the provisions of the Bankruptcy Act;\n(b) Assuming such assignment to be valid, whether the general assignment of book debts to the Royal Bank is void as against the Trustee in Bankruptcy.\nThe learned judges were equally divided upon the answer to be given to the first question which consequently was not answered. The second question was answered by three of the justices in the affirmative and by Mr. Justice Russell in the negative. I am of the opinion that both questions should be answered in the affirmative.\nMy brother Anglin in his reasons for judgment has expressed my views and conclusions on both these questions and I have nothing useful to add to those reasons.\nRespondent company should have its costs.\nIdington J. (dissenting).\u2014This is an appeal from the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia which heard a stated case, submitted by the respondent to the judge in bankruptcy who in turn submitted it to the said Supreme Court, whereby answers were sought to the following questions:\u2014\n(a) Whether the assignment made by the Inverness Railway & Collieries, Limited, to The Eastern Trust Company was authorized under the provisions of the Bankruptcy Act;\n(b) Assuming such assignment to be valid, whether the general assignment of book debts to the Royal Bank is void as against the Trustee in Bankruptcy.\nThe said court was equally divided as to the first question and formally declared it to be unanswered, but, by a majority, answered the second question in the affirmative.\nThe case is brought here by leave consented to by the parties hereto.\nFor the reasons assigned by Mr. Justice Chisholm in the court below, I would answer said first question in the negative.\nIt seems to me that in light of such an answer by the majority of this court the second question should not be answered for it ends all possibility of invalidating the assignment of book debts by virtue of the Bankruptcy Act and there is no other ground pretended before us upon which it can be held to have been void.\nI submit, therefore, the appeal should be allowed, with costs, if claimed.\nDuff J.\u2014The judgment of Mr. Justice Mellish presents the considerations governing the disposition of this appeal exactly as I conceive them. I can usefully add nothing to what he has already said.\nAnglin J.\u2014The material facts of this case are detailed by Mr. Justice Mellish. Upon them I am satisfied that the Inverness Railway & Collieries, Limited, was not a \"railway company\" within the purview of the exception in the definition of the word \"corporation\" in the Bankruptcy Act. I also agree with the unanimous view of the learned judges of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia that the appellant bank is an \"other person\" within the meaning of that term as used in section 30 (1) of that statute.\nOn what I may call the main question, I am of the opinion that section 30 (1) clearly avoids, as against the trustee in bankruptcy of the assignor, every general assignment of book debts so far as they remain unpaid at the date of an authorized assignment in bankruptcy by such assignor, except in cases where provsion is made by provincial legislation for the registration, notice and publication of such assignments of book debts and there has been compliance therewith. If the intent of the Bankruptcy Act had been to avoid general assignments of book debts only where provincial statutes providing for registration, notice and publication have not been complied with, section 30 (1) would certainly have been expressed in very different terms\u2014if, indeed, it would have found a place in the statute at all. I cannot conceive of Parliament expressing the intent for which the appellant contends in the terms found in subsection 1 of section 30. I entertain no doubt whatever that as against the trustee in bankruptcy of the assignor such a general assignment as that made to the appellant bank is avoided as to all debts covered by it which remained unpaid at the date of the authorized assignment in bankruptcy.\nThe appellant, in my opinion, derives no assistance from section 32, which, as I read it, is expressly subject inter alia, to the provisions of section 30 (1) found under the caption \"Settlements and Preferences.\"\nBoth questions submitted by the special case should be answered in the affirmative.\nThe respondent is entitled to its costs.\nBrodeur J. (dissenting).\u2014The first question of the stated case is whether the assignment made by the Inverness Railway and Collieries, Limited, to the Eastern Trust Company was authorized under the provisions of \"The Bankruptcy Act.\"\nPrior to the 20th July, 1920, the Inverness Railway and Coal Company, a body incorporated by special Act of the Nova Scotia Legislature for the purpose of owning and operating a mining undertaking at Inverness and elsewhere in the county of Inverness and for the purpose of owning and operating a railway in the said county, had duly built a railway from Canso to Inverness and had operated the same in the carrying of freight and passengers, and had also worked a coal mine at Inverness. It had mortgaged its entire railway and mining undertaking to the National Trust Company, Limited, as trustee for bondholders under a trust deed. On the 16th of June, 1920, the Railway Company and the National Trust Company entered into an agreement to sell the entire undertaking of the former company to Myron E. C. Henderson, who took possession of the properties described in the agreement on the 20th July, 1920, the agreement having been approved on the day previous by a judge of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia.\nIn accordance with the Nova Scotia Railway Act, section 269, Henderson, on the 20th July, 1920, notified the Commissioner of Public Works and Mines that he had purchased the railway and intended to operate it.\nThe Inverness Railway and Collieries, Limited, was incorporated under the Nova Scotia Joint Stock Companies Act on the 28th July, 1920 (this date is inconsistent with the date given as the 21st July, 1920, for the agreement between Henderson and the Inverness Railway and Collieries, limited, but both dates are taken from the record) for the purpose of carrying on a mining and railway undertaking.\nOn the 21st July, 1920, an agreement was entered into between Henderson and the Inverness Railway and Collieries, Limited, whereby the former conveyed to the latter all his rights, powers and privileges under the agreement of sale to him by the Inverness Railway and Coal Company and the trustees for the bondholders, with power to use the name of the vendor (Henderson), and it was agreed that the Inverness Railway and Collieries, Limited, would assume all Henderson's obligations under the said agreement of sale, that it would pay him $200,000, which he had paid to his vendors, that Henderson would thereafter hold the railway and any letter of licence which might be issued to him as trustee for the Inverness Railway and Collieries, Limited, and would permit the latter to operate the railway as his agent, and that the parties would promote and endeavour to obtain from the legislature any necessary legislation, the expense thereof to be borne by the company.\nThe stated case alleges that, as agent for Henderson, the Inverness Railway and Collieries, Limited, operated the railway from the 21st July, 1920, until the 7th February, 1921, when the Inverness Railway and Coal Company and the National Trust Company re-entered into possession of the properties on default having been made by Henderson under his agreement.\nOn the 26th February, 1921, the Inverness Railway and Collieries, Limited, made an assignment under \"The Bankruptcy Act\" to the Eastern Trust Company, trustee in bankruptcy.\nThe question submitted is whether this assignment was authorized under \"The Bankruptcy Act.\"\nBy section 9 of that Act it is provided that any insolvent debtor, whose liabilities to creditors provable as debts under the Act exceed $500, may make to an authorized trustee appointed pursuant to section 14 with authority in the locality, an assignment of all his property for the general benefit of his creditors, and this assignment is referred to in the Act as an \"authorized assignment.\"\nThe word \"debtor\" is defined in the Act (section 2, subsection (o)) as including\nany person, whether a British subject or not, who, at the time when any act of bankruptcy was done or suffered by him, or any authorized assignment was made by him, (a) was personally present in Canada, or (b) ordinarily resided or had a place of residence in Canada, or (c) was carrying on business in Canada personally or by means of an agent or manager, or (d) was a corporation or member of a firm or partnership which carried on business in Canada.\nAnd the subsection goes on to say that where the debtor is a corporation as defined by this section, the Winding-up Act shall not extend or apply to it.\nThis definition of the word \"debtor\" makes it necessary that we should refer to the definition of the word \"corporation\" (subsection (k)), which is as follows:\n\"Corporation\" includes any company incorporated or authorized to carry on business by or under an Act of the Parliament of Canada or of any of the provinces of Canada, and any incorporated company, wheresoever incorporated, which has an office in or carries on business within Canada, but does not include building societies having a capital stock, nor incorporated banks, savings banks, insurance companies, trust companies, loan companies or railway companies.\nI may merely advert to subsection (aa) stating that \"person\" includes corporation and partnership. In my opinion, it does not help in this inquiry.\nTherefore, to fall under \"The Bankruptcy Act\" a \"corporation\" must be a company incorporated or authorized to carry on business by or under an Act of Parliament or of a provincial legislature, or a company wheresoever incorporated having an office or carrying on business within Canada, but must not be, inter alia, a \"railway company.\"\nThe Bankruptcy Act does not define the term \"railway companies\" which we find in subsection (k). These words therefore should be given their ordinary meaning, and would certainly include a company incorporated for the purpose of carrying on a railway undertaking. It is true that the Inverness Railway and Collieries Co. had two purposes, a mining and a railway undertaking, but the latter purpose was not, we were informed, a subsidiary one. The railway is some 61 miles in length, it carries freight and passengers. Of course, the other purpose of the company, coal mining, would not take it out of the operation of \"The Bankruptcy Act.\" But, if one may hazard the surmise, the intention of Parliament was probably to prevent the operation of a railway, which is in the the public interest, from being hampered by proceedings under The Bankruptcy Act. And if this company can be said to be a \"railway company,\" notwithstanding its other purposes, it is excepted from the Act.\nI have duly considered Mr. Jenks' contention that this company, while having the capacity, has not the authority to operate a railway, under the Nova Scotia Railway Act which, in the case of the sale of a railway, requires that the purchaser, who\nhas not any corporate powers authorizing the holding and operating thereof,\nshould give notice to the Commissioner of Public Works and Mines, and thereafter obtain legislative authority to hold, operate and run the railway (sections 269, 270, 271). If I may say so, the construction advocated by Mr. Jenks, and which would restrict the natural meaning of the words \"railway companies,\" appears to me forced and artificial. And, even supposing that section 269 applies to a company incorporated for the special purpose of operating a railway, which seems rather doubtful, would such a company be any the less a \"railway company\" because it had to give some notice before it operates a railway? A similar construction might take this company entirely out of the definition of a \"corporation,\" for it could be asserted that until it gives this notice it is not a company authorized to carry on business. Surely the character of a company should be determined by reference to its charter of incorporation. I may add that a full consideration of the facts stated here and of the agreements entered into has convinced me that there was operation in fact of the railway, and therefore the carrying on of business as a railway company, with possibly the use of Henderson's name as a shield. But in every way the company appears to have acted as a railway company and no doubt incurred liabilities as such. It therefore was excepted from the operation of \"The Bankruptcy Act\" and could not make an assignment under section 9 of that Act. I would answer question 1 in the negative.\nAs to the second question submitted by the stated case it is not necessary for me to answer it. The main question on this appeal, according to my mind, is whether the Inverness Railway and Collieries, Limited, was authorized to make an assignment under the provision of The Bankruptcy Act. As I have come to the conclusion that this company does not come under the purview of the latter Act, it is useless to consider whether some assignment of book debts which the company made to the Royal Bank is valid against the trustees in bankruptcy. This question involves the consideration of an Act which does not apply to this company.\nIn view of my conclusion on the first question, the second one becomes merely academic.\nThe appeal should be allowed with costs and the first question answered in the negative.\nMignault J.\u2014I take no part in this judgment.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: W. A. Henry.\nSolicitor for the respondent: L. A. Lovett.\n[1] 22 Can. S.C.R. 305.\n",

In this case the money was paid on account of an admitted debt and the debtor could not impose conditions.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario reversing the judgment at the trial in favour of the defendant.\nIn an action for specific performance of a contract the trial judge held that it was obtained by fraud and dismissed the action. The Appellate Division concurred in the finding as to fraud but decreed performance of the contract on the ground that defendant had not offered to return money paid as required by its terms and could not therefore obtain rescission nor restore land transferred to him which had been sold for taxes. The defendant appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nH.J. Scott K.C. for the appellant.\nW.L. Scott K.C. for the respondent.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014The respondent bought from one E.S. Blain lot 18, block 176, according to a plan of record in the Land Titles Office for the Saskatoon Land Registration District as plan Q\u20113, for the sum of $45,000.\nThereafter, on the 16th November, 1912, by an agreement of that date made between the said Blain of the first part, said Hedley Shaw of the second part and the said respondent of the third part (which recited said purchase and that there was then still owing and unpaid under the articles of agreement, witnessing said purchase, the sum of $22,500, with interest thereon at the rate of 8 per cent. per annum from the 10th day of October, 1912, to said Blain and that he had agreed to assign all his interest therein and in the said lands and all moneys still owing and unpaid under said purchase agreement, to the said Hedley Shaw) the said Blain assigned the said agreement for purchase and all moneys owing thereunder and said lands to the said Shaw.\nThe said Blain covenanted thereby that in default of said respondent Masson paying said balance of purchase money, he, Blain, would pay same and the interest as specified.\nThe respondent also by said tripartite agreement covenanted therein with said Shaw to pay him the said balance of purchase money and interest as aforesaid.\nThe said security was thus acquired through the firm of McCallum and Vannatter, brokers in Saskatoon, acting for said Blain.\nShaw resided in Toronto and, when an instalment of $11,250 of said principal, and interest on the whole for six months, was about to fall due, forwarded his said security through the Imperial Bank to Saskatoon for collection by it. When doing so he wrote Mr. McCallum of said firm of brokers a brief note, dated 29th March, 1913, in regard thereto and another security of the like character, stating the amounts respectively due, the one on the 12th of April and the other on the 10th of April, and that he was notifying the said parties of his sending said documents to the Imperial Bank for collection. And then, by the last sentence of his said letter, said:\nI would like if you would also notify them that these payments must be met, and if you should have any good agreements offered you about that time you might advise me.\nOn the 29th they replied that they had notified said parties, and ended by saying that they would try and get an agreement of about the \u201cright size to submit to you as soon as the money is paid.\u201d On the 7th of April they wrote Shaw that they had a letter from Masson stating that he expected to be in Saskatoon early in April \u201cand would be prepared to make his payment on the Blain agreement.\u201d\nMeantime they had submitted another investment to him and in regard thereto he replied by saying\nI will do nothing with this until the agreements that are now due are paid.\nOn the 19th April, 1913, Shaw wrote McCallum as follows:\nI received your letter of the 7th instant, also your wire of the 11th. I have had no word from the Imperial Bank that either one of the agreements has been paid, and the parties interested have not even written about them.\nI will notify the bank that if these agreements, also Irving\u2019s Mortgage are not paid by the 1st May, to take the necessary proceedings immediately to collect same.\nAnd on the 1st of May, 1913, McCallum & Vannatter, writing in regard to other matters, say as follows:.\u2014\nMr. Masson from Ottawa has not arrived yet, but in talking to a friend of his he stated that he expects Mr. Masson daily, and understand he expects to make his payment as soon as he reaches here, which will also be turned over to you.\nAs soon as we collect some more money for you, will submit an agreement, but will not do so until we get the money out of your Saskatoon agreements, when we hope to put up something to you which you will consider favorably.\nWhen Masson did arrive a few days later he does not seem to have been quite as prepared to pay as his evidence pretends he was, if another letter from McCallum, on the 6th May, 1913, to Shaw is to be relied upon, amongst other things announcing arrival of Masson, but saying:\nHe is not positive whether he will be able to make the full payment or not as he is expecting some money and has not received it yet. In any case he will be able to pay a goodly portion of it.\nSuch was the situation when the following telegrams passed between McCallum and Shaw:\u2014\nMay 6th, 1913.\nHedley Shaw,\nc\/o Maple Leaf Milling Co.,\nToronto, Ontario.\nHave interviewed Masson, and he wishes to obtain title to Lot 18, Block 176. To do this he offers agreement for sale covering 50 feet of good business property south side of river sold April 30th to good eastern parties for $25,000. On this there was a cash payment made of $6,250, leaving a balance due of $18,750 in three equal payments in six, twelve and eighteen months with interest at eight per cent. In addition to this agreement he will pay $5,750 cash. Can recommend security in property offered and all parties good. This pays 23 per cent without deducting any bonus on October payment due by Masson to you. Wire at once if can accept.\nD.J. McCallum.\nToronto, Ont., May 7th, 1913.\nD.J. McCallum:\u2014\nTo-day\u2019s value Masson agreement twenty-three thousand five hundred and fifty, with twelve thousand, two hundred and fifty now due, balance due in five months. Prefer getting money as can use to good advantage elsewhere. However, if Masson will pay six thousand and you say agreement and parties are as good security as agreement giving up, you may close.\nHedley Shaw.\nMay 8th, 1913.\nHedley Shaw, Esq.,\nToronto, Ontario.\nArranged proposition according our wire excepting cash will be $6,000. Consider new agreement good and you will still hold Masson\u2019s covenant. Will write you fully to\u2011morrow.\nD.J. McCallum.\nSo far from agreement of Easton offered in exchange being, as stipulated by Shaw in his said telegram of 7th May, 1913, as good security as agreement he was asked to give up, it seems to me quite clear that was not the case.\nThe agreement he was asked to give up (of which I have set forth above the facts it evidences) was for only half the purchase price of the land securing it, whilst that Easton agreement was for three-quarters of the purchase price of the land.\nHow such an audacious misrepresentation came to be made (if made in the sense respondent contends for) by the parties making it passes my comprehension, unless moved by a fraudulent purpose.\nIt turned out that the Easton contract which was tendered was not in fact the real contract which then existed between Easton and Masson.\nThat had been entered into between Masson, as vendor, and Easton, as purchaser, and was negotiated for Masson by the said McCallum & Vannatter in the previous October when the cash payment of $6,250 was made, and interest on the balance of $18,750, at 8 per cent. per annum had fallen due with an instalment of $6,250 of principal, on the 30th of April, 1913, when it was well known to both Masson and said firm that Easton could not meet his payment then due.\nUnder such circumstances they were driven to substitute another contract as if entered into on the 30th of April, 1913, at which date instead of in the previous October, the cash payment was pretended to have been made, and this substituted contract was executed by Masson but not by Easton until some time after appellant Shaw had become suspicious and had repudiated the transaction set forth in above quoted telegrams.\nExactly when it was executed by Easton does not appear in evidence. He was unable through illness to attend the trial.\nIngram who is supposed to have attested his signature was not called as a witness.\nBut we have in the correspondence a letter from McCallum & Vannatter, dated 7th June, 1913, to Shaw trying to induce him to reconsider his determination not to carry out the proposal, in which they tell him they had sent the papers to Renfrew, where Easton resided, to be completed.\nI think this is much more cogent evidence than what counsel before us, driven to despair apparently, suggested was to be found in some remarks of Mr. McCarthy when arguing one of the many points discussed at the trial, happened to refer to it as if it had been executed in May.\nHe was neither intending to make an admission of that kind nor, in what he was arguing then was the exact date of execution by Easton an essential feature\u2014so long as the matter he was referring to indicated the signing by Easton was after what had transpired and was being put forward as a completed contract, when in fact it was not.\nIt was this pretended Easton agreement of 30th of April, 1913, that was made the basis of the assignment by Masson to Shaw, and is sought herein to be made the material part of the basis of this action for specific performance.\nBut curiously enough (though one of the reasons which McCallum, or MacCallum & Vannatter, persistently pressed on Shaw in their letters trying to induce him to accept this assignment and thus carry out the alleged agreement to exchange the Easton agreement for that of Blain, was the value of Masson\u2019s covenant for due payment by Easton) Masson now pretends herein that such a covenant was a fraud upon him and ought to be deleted from said assignment.\nThe existence of such a covenant binding Masson for the due payment by Easton, is the only respectable excuse for the said firm assuring Shaw that the one security might be taken as the equivalent of the other, but even that could not justify it, for Masson\u2019s means of payment seems to have been dependent on his wife\u2019s will and means to pay.\nEven if otherwise, I am unable to see how an exchange of securities, which in their essential feature depended on the value of the land, securing either, such misrepresentations as impliedly made relative to their being of equal value, can be in any way justified or in any respect held to have been a due fulfilment of the express condition of Shaw\u2019s reply: \u201cAnd you say agreement and parties are as good security as agreement giving up, you may close.\u201d\nIt was clearly expected McCallum could say so honestly. Indeed, curiously enough, McCallum did not in his reply expressly venture so far. The parties never were in fact ad idem when telegrams duly scrutinized.\nIt seems to me absurd to call the securities that would be afforded for payment of the $17,500 balance on land, bought only for $25,000, as the equivalent of $18,500, or even $23,400 on land bought for $45,000. I assume, as no evidence to the contrary, these prices represent what was then believed to be respective value of each.\nI have no hesitation in holding that an assurance given Shaw to that effect was not given in good faith, or within the terms of the conditions he had imposed as basis for such temporary and conditional assent as he gave.\nI agree with the finding of the learned trial judge that the whole dealing was vitiated by the fraud carried out in the substitution of the actual Easton agreement by another fabricated transaction.\nIndeed I cannot help coming to the conclusion that the whole transaction was so saturated with fraud that even if McCallum & Vannatter could be held to have been agents of Shaw whilst so deceiving him, the case would fall within the rule laid down in Mortlock v. Buller[1], and followed by many cases since, and hence no relief by way of specific performance can be properly founded thereon.\nBut it seems clear beyond any doubt that the firm of McCallum & Vannatter was the agent of respondent Masson, and merely, so far as Shaw was concerned, a means of communication used by respondent in his dealings in question herein with the said Shaw, who was in Toronto, whilst Masson and his agents were in Saskatoon. What was said in the telegram by Shaw to said agents might as well have been said direct to the party making the proposal, and if he receiving it had so replied, and thereby falsely assured the other of the facts as to value, there would be no basis thus furnished for a binding contract.\nMcCallum, the senior member of said firm, had died in November, 1915, and hence the only actual witness who could speak to the relations between Masson and said firm was Vannatter, and he swears distinctly that they got two hundred dollars from Masson as commission for their services in bringing about the alleged agreement now in question and never got nor pretended to claim from Shaw any commission.\nIt was suggested in argument that said firm had been acting as agent for Shaw in other matters, and hence an inference might be drawn as to the actual relation between them. In like manner they had been acting previously for Masson in bringing about the sale to Easton.\nA perusal of the entire evidence including the correspondence leads me to the conclusion that they were, so far as Shaw was concerned, merely brokers selling securities of the class in question and looked to their clients, offering securities such as those in question herein, for their commission.\nOf course such a relationship would naturally give rise to much correspondence between them and investors like Shaw, tending to give their relation another colour. We have a fairly good test in this very case of how Shaw looked upon their relations.\nAlthough he had bought the Blain security now in question from Blain through them, when it came to a question of collecting same he entrusted that to, and sent the documents to, the bank, and at the same time writing to them respectively and acquainting their agents of his having done so, and asking that they call and pay what was due.\nAt the same time, as I infer, it was by way of mere courtesy to the brokers that he notified them of what he had done.\nBe all that as it may if there was anything beyond what I suggest there was no evidence adduced directly bearing upon the point, except that of Vannatter who seems to have given his evidence fairly and without prejudice.\nI cannot see how Masson can escape the consequences of what was done on his behalf and to which he was an actual party in the framing up of the deceptive substitution of the Easton agreement by another which was, I hold, fraudulent.\nFor these reasons alone I submit the judgment of the learned trial judge is correct and the Appellate Division in error in setting same aside.\nIn deference to what is said in the said appellate court\u2019s judgment, I respectively submit that there being fraud, which is not denied therein, no relief should have been given by way of specific performance.\nWhat seems to me, I most respectfully submit, to be undoubted law is the statement of the relevant law in Fry\u2019s Specific Performance, 4th ed. at page 306, par 703, that where there is fraud in the obtaining of the contract or in the course of its performance, there is ground for the cancellation of the contract and, a fortiori, that it presents to the party defrauded a complete defence to an action for specific performance.\nThis aspect of the law seems, I most respectfully submit, to have been overlooked by the majority in the Appellate Division, which treated the action as one for rescission and reversed the learned trial judge\u2019s judgment, although Mr. Justice Middleton in his brief dissenting judgment, pointed out how he deemed the fraud to be an impossible barrier to relief sought.\nNotwithstanding the fact that Shaw had in his letter to McCallum, c\/o McCallum & Vannatter, of the 29th May, 1913, pointed out some reasons for suspecting the value of the Easton agreement as a security, and after getting their explanations, on the 11th of June, 1913, had sent the following telegram to them,\nToronto, Ont., June 11th, 1913.\nD.J. McCallum,\ncare McCallum & Vannatter,\nSaskatoon.\nYour letter June 7th received, don\u2019t consider property new agreement good security, don\u2019t care to take new agreement unless substantial payment say twenty-five hundred dollars made on property, please advise. Hurst balance money due must be paid immediately.\nH. Shaw,\nand that he had thus distinctly refused to carry out the alleged arrangement unless so modified as therein required the respondent failed to bring any action until this one, on the 17th November, 1917. Four years and a half seems, under such circumstances, rather a long time to wait before bringing an action such as this.\nMeantime the Easton property was sold for taxes apparently in 1915 and 1916, and Easton had failed entirely to meet his payments according to the terms of his agreement in question, and the respondent had failed to meet his obligations under his covenant in the assignment by him to Shaw on Easton\u2019s default, or to tender Shaw payment of same.\nThat presents rather a remarkable case of non-observance of the rule laid down by Lord Alvanley in Milward v. Earl Thanet[2], that\na party cannot call for specific performance unless he has shown himself ready, desirous, prompt and eager\nwhich has in substance remained good law to the present day.\nThen if we try to apply herein common law to this alleged contract its fraudulent character still remains a good defence. And if there were no such defence available damages would be the only relief, in which case the duty of the respondent would have been to minimize the damages by such other steps as available to him in way of reselling the thing he alleges he had sold, to say nothing of his express covenant to pay on Easton\u2019s default.\nNot the least curious of the many features presented by this case is the attempt to delete that covenant although the evidence is that such is the usual form of contracts in Saskatchewan, in transferring such like securities as the Easton agreement.\nIndeed that was brought home to the respondent, if he never knew before, by the assignment of his own contract with Blain by the latter, to which he was a party, and wherein Blain had to give his covenant to pay on Masson\u2019s default.\nThe printed forms are identical except for a few immaterial words.\nThat covenant of the respondent was part of the agreement tendered by his agents McCallum & Vannatter in execution of the alleged agreement now sued on and is thus part of the foundation of this action.\nYet the judgment appealed from retains for respondent the right to insist, in a modified way not clear, on his peculiar contention when before the Master in Ordinary.\nI need not pursue this matter further than to point out that Shaw uniformly adhered to his imperative condition that there must be at least $2,500 added to the original proposal for exchange in order to bring the Easton security up to the standard of equality he had insisted on in his telegram giving a conditional assent to the respondent\u2019s proposition.\nThe correspondence, after his refusal to carry out the proposal as made by respondent through his agent McCallum & Vannatter, does not seem to me to help or hinder either party.\nIt discloses that respondent\u2019s said agents hoped to secure such further payments by Easton as would reduce the amount of his liability and thereby induce Shaw to look upon the securities sought to be exchanged as nearly equivalent in substantial value. I am of the opinion that for the foregoing reasons this appeal should be allowed with costs here and in the appellate division and the judgment of the learned trial judge be restored.\nDUFF J.\u2014The appeal turns upon two telegrams in the following terms:\u2014\nMay 6th, 1913.\nHedley Shaw,\nc\/o Maple Leaf Milling Co.,\nToronto, Ont.\nHave interviewed Masson, and he wishes to obtain title to Lot 18, Block 176. To do this he offers agreement for sale covering 50 ft. of good business property on south side of river sold April 30th to good Eastern party for $25,000. On this there was a cash payment made of $6,250, leaving a balance due of $18,750 in three equal payments of six, twelve and eighteen months with interest at 8 per cent. In addition to this agreement he will pay $5,750 cash. Can recommend security in property offered and all parties good. This pays 23 per cent. deducting any bonus on October payment due by Masson to you. Wire at once if can accept.\nD.J. McCallum.\nToronto, Ont., May 7th, 1913.\nD.J. McCallum:\u2014\nTo-day\u2019s value Masson agreement twenty-three thousand, five hundred and fifty, with twelve thousand, two hundred and fifty now due, balance due in five months. Prefer getting money as can use to good advantage elsewhere. However, if Masson will pay six thousand and you say agreement and parties are as good security as agreement giving up, you may close.\nHedley Shaw.\nThe authority given to McCallum was an authority to accept the terms of May 6th. McCallum professed to enter into an arrangement of a very different character. In fact he attempted with Masson\u2019s approval to use his authority in a manner which both of them must have known was not consistent with good faith towards Shaw. Shaw on discovering this was entitled to repudiate the whole thing as a fraud upon him, which he did. In the circumstances the agreement was not an enforceable one.\nThe point chiefly insisted upon was that Shaw could not retain the moneys paid by Masson and at the same time repudiate the agreement which McCallum professed to make with Masson. This argument plainly fails of effect when the relations between Shaw and Masson are remembered. Masson was the debtor to Shaw who held as security a lien upon lands which Masson had purchased from him. Masson proposed that Shaw should accept in exchange for this security a lien upon other lands and certain additional payments. Shaw consented subject to the condition that Masson\u2019s debt to him should be reduced by a named amount. The debt was overdue. The moneys paid by Masson were paid in performance of his obligation to Shaw and were applied in reduction of the debt.\nShaw\u2019s right to retain the moneys paid was an unconditional right on two grounds, in the first place, and this of course is quite conclusive, it was paid in reduction of the existing debt, in performance of the existing obligation and not in execution of any fresh obligation to be undertaken by Masson. In the second place, the common law rule is quite plain that the general principle solvitur in modo solventis is subject to an exception in cases in which the money paid is admitted by the payer to be due. The authorities are conclusive that a debtor paying an admitted debt cannot lawfully attach conditions to the payment; and that the creditor receiving the money does nothing wrongful in retaining it, although he disregards the conditions. Miller v. Davies referred to by Lord Esher in Day v. McLea[3] at page 612; Ackroyd v. Smithies[4]; Day v. McLea3. The retention of the money in such a case is not a trespass; a count for money had and received would not lie because the view of the law is that where the money is admitted to be due there is nothing contra equum et bonum in retaining it.\nThe appeal should be allowed and the action dismissed with costs.\nANGLIN J.\u2014The plaintiff sues for specific performance of a contract whereby, in consideration of making a cash payment of $6,000 and transferring to the defendant all his interest in a sale agreement whereby one Easton had purchased from him certain property in Saskatoon, the defendant, who had acquired the interest of one Blain, as vendor, under an agreement for the sale of certain other property, agreed to convey such latter property to the plaintiff and to relieve him from liability for payment of the purchase price thereof. The plaintiff also claimed that the contract sued upon should be reformed by the excision from it of a personal guarantee by him of the Easton payments. The defendant denied the making of the contract sued on and, by amendment, pleaded that, if given, his assent thereto had been procured by fraud.\nThe learned trial judge found that a condition upon which the defendant had, by his telegram of the 7th of May, 1913, authorized acceptance of the plaintiff\u2019s offer\u2014namely, that McCallum and Vannatter, agents at Saskatoon, should assure him that the Easton agreement and parties were as good as the Blain agreement and the parties to it\u2014had not been fulfilled; and he also maintained the charge of fraud. As stated by Meredith, C.J.O., the defendant\nhad no knowledge of the true nature of the transaction between the plaintiff and Easton until it was divulged by the plaintiff in giving his testimony at the trial.\nThe action was accordingly dismissed in the trial court.\nThe Appellate Divisional Court agreed that the fraud alleged by the defendant had been established. It found, however, that there had been a binding acceptance of the plaintiff\u2019s proposal and that, inasmuch as the defendant retained and made no offer to refund $5,000 of the $6,000 cash payment which he had received and the Easton property had been sold for taxes in the interval, the defendant was not entitled to rescission of the contract and should be ordered to carry it out. The reformation asked by the plaintiff was not granted. Specific execution of the contract as drawn was accordingly decreed at the instance of the party held to be chargeable with fraud in procuring it. Such a result is startling, to say the least.\nWhile disposed to agree with the construction put by the Appellate Court on the telegram of the 7th of May and to regard what took place as a fulfilment of any conditions it imposed, I am inclined to think that the plaintiff\u2019s real difficulty in regard to the making of the contract sued upon lies deeper\u2014that it consists in the non-existence of the subject matter in respect to which the defendant intended to contract. The proposition made to him and of which acceptance was authorized by his telegram of the 7th of May was for the transfer to him of an agreement by Easton for the purchase of land dated the 30th of April, 1919, already made. There was in fact no such agreement at that time. The plaintiff never contemplated the taking of an agreement which was yet to be made, and was in fact made only on the 8th of May.\nBut the finding of fraud imputable to the plaintiff, confirmed by the Appellate Divisional Court, rests upon evidence quite adequate to ensure its not being disturbed in this court, and upon that finding this action in my opinion must fail. It would indeed be an extraordinary case in which specific execution of a contract so tainted could be decreed. It may be that as a pre\u2011requisite to seeking rescission the defendant would have been obliged to proffer restitution of the money paid him by the plaintiff. But fraud is a personal bar to specific performance which may be set up by a defendant not entitled to rescission. Fry on Specific Performance (5 ed.) section 749. The defendant is not seeking the aid of the court either to obtain rescission or for any other purpose. He is merely resisting a demand for specific performance. The plaintiff owed him more than $11,000 upon a contract still in his hands. I cannot see that the application by the defendant in reduction of that indebtedness of the $5,000 paid him precludes his contesting the plaintiff\u2019s claim in this action. I am rather inclined to take the view that commended itself to Mr. Justice Middleton as to the essence of the transaction between the parties and the nature and effect of the fraud perpetrated. But in any aspect of the matter the plaintiff is not entitled to the relief for which he sues.\nThere is no counter claim. The judgment must therefore be confined to a dismissal of the plaintiff\u2019s present action leaving either party to assert such further rights and claim such other remedies as he may be advised.\nBRODEUR J.\u2014I concur in the result.\nMIGNAULT J.\u2014Both the learned trial judge and the Appellate Divisional Court found that a fraud was committed by the respondent in representing to the appellant that the agreement of sale between the respondent and Easton was made on April 30, 1913, whereas it had really been made on October 30, 1912, and Easton had failed to meet the payment on account of capital which became due on April 30, 1913, to wit, $6,250. Easton had applied for an extension of time to effect this payment, and McCallum and the respondent conceived the idea of making a new sale agreement between the respondent and Easton, dated six months after the real one, in order to induce the appellant to accept it and to agree to \u201cswitch\u201d the Blain agreement of sale to Masson, which had been transferred to the appellant, for the Masson agreement of sale to Easton. I think this fraud has been brought home to the respondent, whether or not McCallum was his agent, for the learned trial judge believed the statement of Vannatter, McCallum\u2019s partner, that the respondent was aware of the contents of McCallum\u2019s telegram to Shaw of May 6, 1913, wherein the false and fraudulent representation as to the date of the Easton agreement was made.\nThe appellant thus deceived had authorized McCallum to accept the Easton agreement for the Blain agreement, subject to the payment by the respondent of $6,000. McCallum obtained a cheque for $5,200 from the respondent, and sent to the appellant $5,000 to be credited on the proposed exchange of agreements, retaining $200 for commission. He subsequently collected $1,000 from Easton, to wit, $750 for interest due Masson and $250 paid by Easton for a time extension, and this $1,000 he held to be paid to the appellant when the latter would have signed (which he never did) a transfer of the land covered by the Blain agreement.\nNotwithstanding that the Appellate Divisional Court concurred in the trial judge\u2019s finding of fraud, it appears to have looked at the case as if the appellant had asked for the rescission of the agreement on which the respondent\u2019s action was based. And for the reason that the appellant could not obtain rescission without returning the $5,000 he had received from the respondent, and which he did not offer to return, and without also returning the land the respondent had agreed to sell to Easton, and which had been sold for taxes, the appellate court granted specific performance of the agreement between McCallum and respondent.\nThe respondent had indeed prayed for the specific performance of this agreement, but the defendant did not counterclaim and was content to ask for the dismissal of the action. There was therefore no demand for rescission, but only one for specific performance, which was met by a denial of the alleged agreement. The appellant discovered the fraud only at the trial and amended his statement of defence by setting up that by reason of this fraud the respondent was not entitled to ask for specific performance of the agreement.\nThe question is therefore whether the respondent can obtain specific performance of an agreement procured by fraud. The only answer in my opinion should be in the negative. The respondent\u2019s action therefore fails. Whatever other rights the respondent may have in view of the appropriation of the $5,000 by the appellant for a purpose other than that for which it was paid to him, it is clear that he cannot come before the court and ask that it exercise its equitable jurisdiction by decreeing specific performance of an agreement tainted by fraud.\nI would therefore, with respect, allow the appeal and restore the judgment of the learned trial judge which dismissed the action, leaving to the parties such other remedies, if any, to which either of them may be entitled. The appellant should have his costs here and in the Appellate Divisional Court.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Millar, Ferguson & Hunter.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Ewart, Scott, Kelley & Kelley.\n[1] 10 Ves. 292.\n[2] 5 Ves. 720n.\n[3] 22 Q.B.D. 610.\n[4] 54 L.T. 130.\n",

Smith, [1923] S.C.R. 203\nDate: 1922-11-27\nCanadian Vickers, Limited, (Defendant) Appellant;\nand\nA. G. Smith (Plaintiff) Respondent.\n1922: November 10; November 27.\nPresent: Sir Louis Davies C.J. and Idington, Duff, Anglin, Brodeur and Mignault JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF KING'S BENCH, APPEAL SIDE, PROVINCE OF QUEBEC\nNegligence\u2014Master and servant\u2014Liability\u2014Machine throwing off steel particles\u2014Guard\u2014Goggles\u2014Arts. 1053, 1054 C.C.\u2014Art. 1384 C.N.\nThe respondent, a skilled and experienced workman, employed by the appellant company, was in charge of a lathe for paring down steel rods. From the machine, when normally operated, particles of steel dangerous to the eyes flew in different directions. A steel shaving having struck respondent's right eye and ruptured the eye-ball, necessitating the extraction of the eye, the respondent brought action for $5,000 damages.\nHeld, Davies C.J. dissenting, that as the injury had been caused by a thing under the appellant's care without human agency intervening, the case fell within the purview of article 1054 C.C.; the consequent prima facie liability was defeasible only by the appellant \"establishing that it was unable by reasonable means to prevent the act (le fait) which had caused the damage\"; and, upon the evidence, the appellant had failed to do so. Quebec R.L.H. & P. Co. v. Vandry ([1920] A.C. 662) and City of Montreal v. Watt & Scott ([1922] 2 A.C. 555) followed.\nPer Davies C.J. dissenting.\u2014The respondent had the onus of affirmatively establishing that a guard upon the machine was feasible and practicable having in view the efficiency of the machine and therefore was a reasonable means pf preventing the injury, which he failed to discharge.\nPer Duff J.\u2014Any physical object handled or directed can be a cause of damage within the meaning of article 1054 C.C.; an automobile, for example, containing within itself its own forces of propulsion causing harm by impact is a \"thing\" causing \"damage\" within the meaning of that article.\nPer Duff J.\u2014As between the appellant and the respondent, it cannot be assumed under article 1054 C.C., but must be proved, that the machine which the respondent was operating was a thing in the care of the appellant.\nPer Brodeur J.\u2014The appellant is also liable under article 1053 C.C. Judgment of the Court of King's Bench (Q.R. 32 K.B. 443) affirmed, Davies C.J. dissenting. APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of King's Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec[1], affirming the judgment of the Superior Court, Martineau J. and maintaining the respondent's action for $5,000.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions in issue are fully stated in the above head-note and in the judgments now reported.\nCook K.C. and Heney for the appellant. The use of goggles by the appellant's workmen in connection with the operation in question was impracticable and unnecessary.\nIn any event, the appellant complied with its legal duty in regard to goggles by providing the same for the use of its skilled mechanics who thoroughly understood the character and dangers of the work in which they were engaged.\nNo legal duty was placed on the appellant to force its expert workmen to wear these goggles.\nThe use of a guard over the cutting tool of the lathe was impracticable, unnecessary and unknown, and the failure of the appellant to devise such a guard which nobody else had devised or used on a machine which had safely been operated for over three years would not in law constitute an act of negligence attaching legal responsibility for injury.\nThe determining cause of the accident was the fault and negligence of the respondent himself in placing his head too close to the machine while the same was in operation and in not properly attending to his duty.\nOgden K.C. and Popliger for the respondent. Under Art. 1054 C.C., as interpreted by the Privy Council in Quebec Ry. L.H. & P. Co. v. Vandry[2], it was incumbent upon the appellant to exculpate itself by affirmative proof that it could not have prevented the accident, which evidence had not been made.\nOgden K.C. and Popliger for the respondent.\nIt was incumbent upon the appellant.\nThe Chief Justice (dissenting).\u2014After reading the evidence in this case, I am not prepared to hold that the suggested guard upon the machine which, the plaintiff was operating when he was injured was practicable having regard to the working efficiency of the machine. There is no evidence which affirmatively establishes that proposition and it appears to me that the absence of such evidence is fatal to the plaintiff's claim.\nThe plaintiff, himself a skilled workman, aged about 28, admitted that it was not customary in factories for guards to be placed on machines of the kind he was operating when injured. No one else stated that such guards were customary or known. The machine manufacturers had never supplied them. The provincial inspectors had never suggested their use. Neither in Canada nor elsewhere were they shewn to have been used.\nI think the duty of proving that such a guard was feasible and practicable, having in view the efficiency of the machine, lay upon the plaintiff, and that the defendants could not be held liable for such an accident as happened to the plaintiff unless such evidence was given.\nIn the late case of City of Montreal v. Watt & Scott[3], their Lordships of the Privy Council explained what was meant by them in the case of the Quebec Railway Light, Heat & Power Co. v. Vandry[4] as to the proper construction of article 1054 of the Quebec Civil Code, namely, that the words \"unable to prevent the damage\" meant\nunable by reasonable means to do so and did not denote an absolute inability.\nIt becomes then a vital question as to whether the suggested guard, having regard to the necessary efficiency of the machine being operated, was a reasonable means of preventing such damage as the plaintiff suffered here. In other words, was it practicable?\nNo evidence was given to shew that it was. And the universal absence of its use anywhere on similar machines would, it seems to me, lead to the conclusion that it was not.\nAs to the conclusion that it was the duty of the defendants to have compelled the workmen to wear goggles, the learned judge found that their use was impracticable and that no fault could be imputed to the defendants in that regard. I can only say that I agree with him and the learned dissentient judges of the Court of King's Bench on that point.\nFor these reasons, I would allow the appeal and dismiss the action.\nIdington J.\u2014For the reasons assigned by the learned trial judge, and those in appeal agreeing therewith, I would dismiss this appeal with costs.\nDuff J.\u2014As regards the merits of the appeal as a whole I do not dissent from the conclusion at which the court has arrived. There are points, however, of great importance raised in the course of the discussion and to some extent considered in the judgments of the Court of King's Bench which cannot, I think, properly be passed over without an observation or two.\nAnd first, I am unable to agree with the suggestions which have been advanced as to the limited scope of Art. 1054. By that article there are three conditions of responsibility. One is that the plaintiff shall have suffered damage, another is that the damage shall have been caused by a \"thing\" and the third is that the \"thing\" causing the damage shall have been under the care of the defendant or of some person for whose conduct he is responsible vis \u00e0 vis the plaintiff. The responsibility is the legal result of the concurrence of these factors unless the defendant brings himself within the exculpatory clause by shewing that the damage could not have been avoided by him through the use of means which he might reasonably have been expected to employ.\nI confess I am unable to understand the contention that a physical object handled or directed (as an automobile, for example), cannot be a cause of damage within the meaning of Art. 1054. This view seems to me to involve the assumption that the more complete the control the defendant has over the physical object which is the cause of the harm the less cogent is the presumption against him of responsibility. I cannot understand why, for example, an automobile containing within itself its own forces of propulsion causing harm by impact may not be a \"thing\" causing \"damage\" within the meaning of Art. 1054.\nIt is quite true that until recently the courts in France seem to have been committed to the doctrine which limits the application of Art. 1384 to cases of damage caused by the \"fait autonome\" of the thing. That doctrine appears, however, to have been discarded and it is worth while I think to quote in full the note of M. Ren\u00e9 Demogue in 20 Rev. Trim, at p. 734 in the following words:\nLa Cour de Cassation (ch. civ. 6 nov. 1920, D. 1921. 1. 169) a rendu un arr\u00eat qui marque une \u00e9tape dans la th\u00e9orie de la responsabilit\u00e9 du fait des choses. Un incendie \u00e9clatant dans une gare est aliment\u00e9 per des r\u00e9sines qui s'y trouvaient et il gagne des installations voisines. La cour a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 \"qu'il n'est pas n\u00e9cessaire que la chose ait un vice inh\u00e9rent \u00e0 sa nature susceptible de causer le dommage, l'art. 1384 rattachant la responsabilit\u00e9 \u00e0 la garde de la chose, non \u00e0 la chose elle-m\u00eame.\" Aussi a-t-elle cass\u00e9 l'arr\u00eat qui, pour refuser d'appliquer l'article 1384, d\u00e9clarait que la cause du dommage doit r\u00e9sider dans la chose et que la r\u00e9sine n'avait pu s'enflammer spontan\u00e9ment. Cette solution est en opposition avec la jurisprudence ant\u00e9rieure des cours d'appel (v. Bordeaux, 26 oct. 1909, S. 1914, 2. 214 en note; Paris, 23 mars, 1911, S. 1913, 2. 302), La port\u00e9e de l'arr\u00eat actuel est consid\u00e9rable. On pourra l'invoquer pour obtenir indemnit\u00e9 si un incendie se communique du mobilier d'une maison \u00e0 la maison voisine, si un objet mani\u00e9 ou dirig\u00e9 cause un dommage. Ce sera donc la cons\u00e9cration de cette id\u00e9e sociale : quiconque a le profit d'une chose mobili\u00e8re doit supporter le dommage qu'elle occasionne. Cette base donne \u00e0 cette innovation une chance tr\u00e8s s\u00e9rieuse de se consolider.\nL'arr\u00eat pr\u00e9cise un autre point. La responsabilit\u00e9 de l'article 1384 ne peut \u00eatre d\u00e9truit que par la preuve d'un cas fortuit ou d'une force majeure non imputable au d\u00e9fendeur. Il ne suffit pas de prouver que l'on n'a commis aucune faute ou que la cause du dommage est inconnue. Ainsi se trouve condamn\u00e9e l'opinion d'un arr\u00eat ant\u00e9rieur qui se contentait de l'impossibilit\u00e9 de d\u00e9terminer la cause de l'accident (Req. 30 mars, 1897, S. 98, 1. 65) Il faut prouver un fait d\u00e9termin\u00e9: ainsi le terme de pr\u00e9somption de faute para\u00eet insuffisante. Il y a une responsabilit\u00e9 l\u00e9gale ne comportant que des causes pr\u00e9cises d'exon\u00e9ration. Par l\u00e0 encore la responsabilit\u00e9 se trouve \u00e9tendue.\nThis note by the eminent commentator may well serve as a warning against the risk of adopting too readily as a guide for the application of Art. 1054 C.C. the decisions of the French courts on the subject of responsabilit\u00e9.\nThe note also brings into relief the fact that the development of la jurisprudence on this subject in France has gradually come under the influence of a definite doctrine of social responsibility, a doctrine on its legal side known as le risque cr\u00e9\u00e9. It cannot be too rigorously insisted upon that the natural meaning of the language of Art. 1054 cannot properly be expanded in deference to any such doctrine. Art. 1054 lays down a rule of the law and the scope, of the rule must be ascertained by the usual means of interpretation.\nThat brings me to a point raised by this appeal in respect of which there has been no discussion but which I think it is my duty to mention. And that is the question, whether or not, as between the appellant company and Smith, the machine which Smith was operating was a thing in the care of the appellant company. In France it has been assumed that in such circumstances the machine was in the care of the employer, but the assumption rests upon an application of the doctrine above referred to\u2014the doctrine that the person who derives the profit from the operation of a movable thing must incur the loss incidental to the operation of it. That is not an admissible ground upon which a similar view as to the effect of Art. 1054 can be based.\nWhether or not in the particular circumstances of this case the conclusion that the machine was in the company's care within the meaning of this article is a point upon which I express no opinion. We have had no argument upon it.\nAnglin J.\u2014In my opinion this case falls within the purview of Art. 1054 C.C. It is a case of damage caused by a thing under the defendant's care. Not only is all contributory fault on the part of the plaintiff negatived, but human intervention, either by him or by any other person, was not a factor in the causation of the injury. Montreal Tramways Co. v. Frontenac Breweries[5]. The plaintiff was operating the defendant's lathe in the normal way necessary for the work on which he was engaged: the flying off of the metal chips was an inevitable consequence of such operation. As put by Mr. Justice Dorion :\u2014\nSi l'action de l'ouvrier n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 pour rien dans l'accident, c'est donc le fait de la machine qui l'a caus\u00e9, et il incombe au gardien de la chose de se disculper. That he can do, as held by their Lordships of the Judicial Committee in Quebec Railway, Light, Heat and Power Co. v. Vandry[6] only by\nestablishing that he was unable to prevent the act (le fait) which has caused the damage\n\u2014which, as their Lordships' later judgment in City of Montreal v. Watt & Scott[7], explains, implies \"unable by reasonable means.\"\nThe burden of establishing this exculpation falls on the defendant. The learned trial judge found that the plaintiff had affirmatively established that the absence of a guard on the machine constituted fault sufficient to entail responsibility under Art. 1053 C.C. The majority of the learned judges of the Court of King's Bench approved of that finding and also held that failure of the defendant to insist on the workman operating the machine in question using goggles amounted to actionable fault. There is evidence in the record to support both findings. The efficiency of the precautions which were found to have been wrongfully omitted is probably established; their practicability seems to be much mote open to question. I am by no means satisfied that I should have found that it had been affirmatively established. On the other hand, giving to the findings made below the weight to which they are entitled, I am not prepared to say that it is so clearly proven that the defendant was unable by the use of one or other of these means\u2014both certainly reasonable in themselves if efficient and practicable\u2014to prevent the act (le fait) that caused the damage for which the plaintiff seeks to recover that the judgment in his favour, affirmed on appeal, should be set aside here.\nBrodeur J.\u2014Que cette cause soit d\u00e9cid\u00e9e sous l'autorit\u00e9 de l'article 1053 ou de l'article 1054 du code civil, je suis d'opinion que la d\u00e9fenderesse, la compagnie Vickers, a engag\u00e9 sa responsabilit\u00e9.\nY a-t-il eu faute de la part de la compagnie? Je n'h\u00e9site pas \u00e0 dire que oui. Cette machine \u00e0 laquelle travaillait Smith \u00e9tait incontestablement dangereuse. La preuve a \u00e9t\u00e9 contradictoire sur ce point, mais le juge qui pr\u00e9sidait au proc\u00e8s a ordonn\u00e9 une expertise; et l'expert, dont la comp\u00e9tence ne saurait \u00eatre mise en doute, vu qu'il est \u00e0 la t\u00eate de l'\u00e9cole technique, a fait fonctionner cette machine et a rapport\u00e9 que dans sa marche normale elle pouvait causer l'accident dont le demandeur Smith a \u00e9t\u00e9 le victime.\nLe patron d'un \u00e9tablissement industriel est oblig\u00e9 de prot\u00e9ger ses ouvriers contre les dangers qui peuvent \u00eatre la cons\u00e9quence de leur travail; il doit pr\u00e9voir non-seulement les causes habituelles mais m\u00eame possibles des accidents, et il doit prendre les mesures propres \u00e0 les \u00e9carter. Sirey, 1878. 1. 412.\nDans le cas actuel, il est en preuve que cette machine dont se servait Smith a projet\u00e9 de menues parcelles ou brindilles d'acier qui lui ont atteint l'\u0153il et qui en ont n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 l'ablation.\nLa compagnie aurait d\u00fb installer un \u00e9cran ou un appareil qui aurait pu prot\u00e9ger l'ouvrier contre ce danger. Elle ne l'a pas fait.\nElle a pr\u00e9tendu que l'installation de cet appareil n'aurait pas permis une production aussi consid\u00e9rable. Cette pr\u00e9tention ne saurait la relever de sa responsabilit\u00e9. Est-ce que la vie ou la sant\u00e9 de l'ouvrier ne demande pas une protection constante de la part de son patron; et ce dernier a-t-il le droit de sacrifier son ouvrier pour avoir une production plus consid\u00e9rable? C'est l\u00e0 faire parade d'un \u00e9goisme qui ne saurait avoir gr\u00e2ce devant les tribunaux. Le patron doit veiller \u00e0 la s\u00fbret\u00e9 de son employ\u00e9.\nMais le patron dit: Nous n'avons jamais eu d'accidents sur cette machine, et l'\u00e9cran qu'on me demande d'installer n'est en usage dans aucune usine. Sur ce point, il y a conflit dans la preuve. Le demandeur a prouy\u00e9 que pour des machines semblables offrant le m\u00eame danger, on se servait d'une couverture ou d'un \u00e9cran. De plus, il a demand\u00e9 de rouvrir son enqu\u00eate pour prouver que des machines absolument semblables \u00e9taient munies de cet appareil protecteur. Le juge n'a pas cru n\u00e9cessaire d'accorder cette demande, \u00e9tant convaincu \u00e9videmment que la preuve \u00e9tait d\u00e9j\u00e0 assez forte pour donner gain de cause au demandeur. Si cette cause doit \u00eatre d\u00e9cid\u00e9e sous l'autorit\u00e9 de l'article 1054, si le dommage a \u00e9t\u00e9 caus\u00e9 \"par une chose qui \u00e9tait sous la garde\" de la compagnie Vickers, il incombait \u00e0 cette derni\u00e8re de prouver qu'elle n'a pu emp\u00eacher le fait qui a caus\u00e9 le dommage. La pr\u00e9somption de faute \u00e9dict\u00e9e dans ce cas ne peut \u00eatre d\u00e9truite que par la preuve d'un cas fortuit ou de force majeure ou d'une cause \u00e9trang\u00e8re qui ne lui soit pas imputable. Dalloz, 1920.1.169.\nLa d\u00e9fenderesse n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 en position de d\u00e9truire cette pr\u00e9somption de faute qui \u00e9tait \u00e9dict\u00e9e contre elle. Elle a, je crois, mis au dossier tous les faits qu'il lui \u00e9tait possible d'invoquer. Et cependant, non-seulement elle n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 capable de repousser cette pr\u00e9somption, mais le poids de la preuve est plut\u00f4t en faveur du demandeur et est \u00e0 l'effet qu'il y a eu n\u00e9gligence de la part de la d\u00e9fenderesse.\nPour ces raisons, son appel doit \u00eatre renvoy\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens.\nMignault J.\u2014The case established here clearly falls within Article 1054 of the civil code as construed by the Judicial Committee in Quebec Railway, Light, Heat & Power Co. v. Vandry[8], and City of Montreal v. Watt & Scott[9], being a damage caused by a thing under the care of the defendant. The lathe which caused the injury was in perfect order and was operated as it should have been, the plaintiff being a skilled and experienced workman. In the proper and normal use of the lathe, particles of steel, the evidence shews, would fly in all directions from the eccentric rod which was being pared down, and one of these particles struck the plaintiff's right eye and it had to be removed. The damage here was therefore caused by the thing, to wit the lathe, which the defendant had under its care, and not by any human agency negligently setting the thing in motion. See the distinction made by my brother Anglin in Curley v. Latreille[10], in which I fully concur.\nIn the Watt & Scott Case9, their Lordships explained the meaning of their decision in the Vandry Case8, and these two decisions should be read together. It is there- fore authoritatively determined that article 1054 establishes, for damages caused by a thing which a person has under his care, a liability which is defeasible only by proof of inability to prevent the damage. Further, in the Watt &. Scott Case[11], in addition to the views they had ex-pressed in the Vandry Case[12], their Lordships stated that\n\"unable to prevent the damage complained of\" means \"unable by reasonable means.\" It does not denote an absolute inability.\nIt will be interesting to compare the construction placed by the Judicial Committee on article 1054 of the Quebec code with probably the latest pronouncement of the Cour de Cassation in France as to the effect of article 1384 of the French code. See Cass. civ., 16th November, 1920, Dallox, 1920.1.169. with annotation by Mr. R. Savatier. The first paragraph of article 1384 is construed as establishing a presumption of fault which the defendant can only rebut\npar la preuve d'un cas fortuit ou.de force majeure ou d'une cause \/\u00e9trang\u00e8re qui ne lui soit pas imputable. Il ne suffit pas au gardien de prouver qu'il n'a commis aucune faute, ni que la cause du dommage est demeur\u00e9e inconnue.\nThe exculpatory paragraph of article 1384 C.N. is by its terms restricted to the specific cases therein mentioned, In Quebec, in a matter coming within the first paragraph of article 1054, it suffices for the defendant to prove that he was unable, by reasonable means, to prevent the damage complained of.\nWas this defendant unable by reasonable means to prevent the damage complained of? The learned trial judge thought that the defendant should have placed a guard over the lathe to prevent the chips from flying in the operator's face. It is urged that to do so would have been impracticable, that it would have interfered with the proper working of the lathe. I would be very slow to hold that the person having machinery under his care should resort to impracticable or unreasonable means to prevent injury occurring by reason of the normal working of the machinery. But having carefully read the evidence, I think it stops short of clearly shewing that it would have been impracticable to place a guard over this lathe to stop the flow of clippings. The non-use of goggles was not considered as a fault by the learned trial judge, and it is unnecessary to say whether it would have afforded a reasonable means of preventing the injury. In my opinion, the defendant has not succeeded in placing itself within the protection of the exculpatory paragraph of article 1054.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Cook & Magee.\nSolicitor for the respondent: G.

Wright (Defendant) Respondent.\n1922: November 13; 1922: November 27.\nPresent: Sir Louis Davies C.J. and Idington, Duff, Anglin, Brodeur and Mignault JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR BRITISH COLUMBIA\nContract\u2014Agreement\u2014Breach\u2014Party wall\u2014Narrowing of wall contrary to agreement \u2014Proper remedy\u2014Injunction\u2014Specific performance.\nA party wall agreement between appellant and respondent provided that respondent might build the wall two feet or more in thickness, half on each property, the middle line to coincide with the boundary line. The respondent built a wall the foundation, basement and first story of which were in accordance with the agreement, but he narrowed the second story by four inches on his own side of the wall, and the third story by a further four inches, keeping the wall on the outside (appellant's side) perpendicular. After it had been erected for some years and formed a wall of respondent's building, the appellant, alleging he had recently discovered the breach of agreement, sued for a mandatory injunction to compel the respondent to pull down that part of the wall not erected in compliance with the agreement and for specific performance of same.\nHeld, that these facts did not constitute merely a breach of contract for which recovery of damages would be a proper remedy, but a trespass, and that the appropriate remedy is to grant a mandatory injunction as prayed for by the appellant.\nPer Idington J. The appellant has also the right to ask for specific performance of the agreement, and the respondent should be ordered to rebuild the wall of the same thickness of two feet.\nJudgment of the Court of Appeal ([1922] 2 W.W.R. 1028) reversed.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1], reversing the judgment of Clement J. at the trial and dismissing the plaintiff's action.\nThe material facts of the case are fully stated in the above head-note and in the judgments now reported. Geo. F. Henderson K.C. for the appellant.\nEug. Lafleur K.C. for the respondent.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014For the reasons stated by my brother Anglin, with which I fully concur and to which I have nothing useful to add, I would allow this appeal with costs.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014 The appellant owned lot 11, and respondent Wright lot 12, in a certain survey on Hastings street, one of the best business streets in Vancouver.\nThe appellant had built on his said lot a frame building which in the rear part thereof was found to have encroached upon said lot 12.\nIn 1908 the said respondent Wright desired to build upon his said lot 12.\nThe foregoing circumstances seem to have led to the said parties entering into an agreement dated 31st January, 1908, whereby appellant, by the first operative clause thereof, bound himself to remove from the eastern boundary of said lot 11 so much of his said building as should be necessary in order to enable said respondent Wright to build the party wall thereinafter provided for at his own expense as and when required by him for the purpose of constructing his said building and the proper building and construction of the said party wall.\nThe second operative clause reads as follows:\u2014\n2. The party of the first part may build a party wall of brick or other material two feet or more in thickness on any part or the whole of the boundary line between the said lots Nos. 11 and 12, and under the sidewalk on Hastings street from the northern boundaries of said lots, which the party of the second part shall have the right to use as herein provided, the middle line of which shall coincide with the said boundary line, and the said party of the first part shall have the right to enter in and upon said lot No. 11 and build and construct the said wall and when any portion of the wall so to be built by the party of the first part shall be used by the party of the second part his heirs or assigns, the party of the second part, his heirs or assigns, shall forthwith pay to the party of the first part, his heirs or assigns, one half of the cost price of the building and construction of the whole thickness of the portion of such wall so used by the party of the second part, his heirs or assigns, and in estimating the portion of such wall so used, the cost thereof shall be estimated on the cost of the whole height of the wall for the width used from the foundation to the top thereof, and the sum of money to be paid by the party of the second part, his heirs and assigns, to the party of the first part, his heirs and assigns, shall, until paid, remain a charge upon the said land of the party of the second part, and shall be an incumbrance and charge upon said land, being lot No. 11. The party wall to be constructed by the party of the first part to be approximately as shown upon the sketched plan annexed to this agreement, subject to such alterations therein as the party of the first part may see fit from time to time to make. In case of total destruction of the said party wall by fire or otherwise this agreement and all covenants and agreements herein contained shall terminate. And it is agreed that the covenants herein contained shall run with the land, but no covenant herein contained shall be personally binding on any person except in respect of breaches during his or their seizin or title to the said lands.\nThe third operative clause provided that though one half of the said wall should be situated upon appellant's land, it should remain and be the property of respondent Wright until such time as appellant should use and pay respondent therefor as same would be so used and then the latter should own that portion of the wall so used and paid for\nbut the same shall remain intact and be for the mutual enjoyment and benefit of both of the parties.\nthereto and until then the said respondent Wright in the meantime should have the use, benefit and enjoyment of the whole of said wall.\nThen followed a clause relative to chimneys, which is not material for our consideration herein, and a further clause for reference to arbitration as to value of price mentioned above, not important herein.\nThe 6th clause is as follows:\u2014\n6..And it is further agreed that the wall built by virtue of this agreement shall be of good materials and workmanship, and when built shall be and remain a party wall.\nSome few months after these parties had duly signed and sealed the said agreement the respondent had begun the building of a four-story brick building on his said lot 12, using in the foundation of the western wall thereof the agreed space assigned for such use as a party wall between him and appellant, the said owner of lot 11.\nThat foundation was a little over the two feet in thickness named in the agreement. Mr. Watson, the said respondent's architect (whose evidence I take as absolutely reliable) tells that before beginning the said foundation of the said party wall the ground was surveyed by competent surveyors and the line drawn between the said lots 11 and 12, and a pin driven into the ground at the street line in front to mark and indicate said division line, and such line so determined was rigidly observed in laying the said foundation wall, so that one half of it was on the appellant's said land and the other half on the said respondent's lot.\nThat wall, in order to conform with the terms of said agreement, should have been carried up to the top of the four stories, intended to be and actually built by the said respondent, in such manner and form that each foot upwards should have rested equally on the respective properties of said parties to said agreement.\nWhether it might have been contracted in thickness as to be less than two feet as it reached the upper stories I need not say.\nThe respondent Wright directed the contractor and architect when reaching the second story so to contract the thickness of the wall after reaching the top of the ground floor in height that instead of being two feet or more in thickness it should be, as it became under his directions, as testified by Watson the architect, as follows:\u2014\nQ. How was the wall on the right side?\u2014 A. It is set back.\nQ. Set back on what stories?\u2014 A. On the first floor and second floor. The plans were prepared for a three\u2014story building but we built four stories.\nQ. Both walls in the basement are perpendicular?\u2014 A. The basement and ground floor is perpendicular, 2 feet 1 inch thick. The next floor is 1 foot 9 inches; the wall on the next floor 1 foot 4 inches; the next floor a brick and a half, 12 inches.\nQ. With a little mortar would make it?\u2014 A. A brick and a half.\nOn the western side, being that next and upon appellant's lot 11, the wall is absolutely perpendicular and in the result in the fourth story rests entirely, or substantially so, upon appellant's said lot.\nThe space thus secured by respondent for use on his own side is said to be the equivalent of a room ten by twelve feet.\nIf that had been all that needed to be herein considered we might let the judgment below stand, but it is very far from being the gravest or chief cause of concern to the appellant herein. He never discovered the trick thus played upon him until ten or twelve years later when he had decided to build upon his lot 11 a brick building which for the first time would involve the use of the party wall, in the sense in which I read it. Then he certainly was confronted with a number of very serious problems. If he wished to use the wall to go beyond the second story he could not do it conformably with the city by-law in that regard.\nThe respondent suggests that the thickness of the wall to conform with the city by-law could be obtained by adding to that now existent by means of building up inside and on lot 12 the necessary additional thickness.\nThe inspector of buildings, called to give evidence on this suggestion, did not seem disposed to say so or at least properly refused to pass thereon until such a concrete case was presented for his consideration.\nThere is another class of expert evidence on the point which clearly demonstrates to my mind that the adding of a new wall to attain the desired thickness would not add to the strength of the wall because the old wall having been up so many years had settled, and the new supplemental wall would settle and not adhere to the old wall.\nHence it seems to me quite impracticable to rely and act upon the suggestion made and obtain any satisfactory results.\nThe learned trial judge acted upon the submission of trespass made by the pleadings and gave nominal damages, but at the same time granted an injunction restraining the respondents from continuing the said trespass, but allowed two years in which either to complete the wall in question so as to make it conform with the said agreement and the said order restraining the respondents.\nHe relied upon the case of Stollmeyer v. Petroleum Development Co.[2] which was a case of nuisance.\nThe Court of Appeal by a majority reversed the said judgment; held that substantial damages were the only remedy and directed a new trial. Mr. Justice McPhillips would simply have dismissed the appeal.\nI respectfully submit that specific performance of the agreement, which is prayed for by appellant's pleadings, and recognized in the judgment of the learned Chief Justice in appeal as a remedy, is the only appropriate remedy.\nThe remedy by way of damages, from any angle I can look at it, seems entirely inadequate.\nThey could only be adequate if the appellant should receive damages equal to the value of the part of lot 11 which respondent Wright has used, and the abandonment by appellant of his title thereto, and he or his assigns so driven to build a wall of his, or their, own; and the further cost of breaking up his building already built two stories high and using, pursuant to the agreement, the present wall as a party wall. In short a new agreement being made damages might suffice.\nThere is a peculiarity in the agreement which seems, I respectfully submit, to have been overlooked by the courts below. It is this: That it is in a sense absolutely unilateral for it gives no rights to the appellant unless and until the respondent has exercised the option given by the second clause of the same which provides that the said respondent Wright may build a party wall, but nowhere binds him to do so.\nHaving done so the agreement has been so far part performed by him that the occupation of the appellant's land by him, pursuant thereto, enables us to act upon the principles relative to specific performance in a way that absolute justice can be done between the parties which cannot be effectively obtained in any other way.\nThe theory of trespass does not fit the actual case as presented.\nThe appellant, much less his assignees, cannot, as is usual in party wall agreements, enter, by virtue of this peculiar agreement, upon the said land and do anything to protect his rights in his own property. The agreement, in effect, forbids that, or any effective remedy except specific performance. It was suggested that the appellant having used one part of the wall and refusing to pay therefor had disentitled himself to relief.\nThe respondent never having built even that so far used, as his agreement bound him to, is not in a position to set up such contention, and cannot claim active relief in that regard, unless and until he has performed his obligations under the agreement.\nIt has been suggested also, that as the appellant has no present intention of building further, he is not injured and hence has no claim for damages.\nSurely that is a most effective answer to the pretention that damages would be an effective remedy.\nIt is just by such a mode of reasoning that respondent would hope to escape paying adequate damages or a court be disabled from giving what would be adequate relief. So much would be dependent upon speculative estimates that appellant is entitled to have the contract specifically performed in a way which would add something tangible and appreciable to the market value of the remainder of appellant's property.\nIt is no unusual thing for a man possessed of vacant property, adjoining other vacant property on which the owner desires to build, to enter into an agreement of this kind. If the party wall that is to be erected on such terms is completed and the parties have agreed then there is created an inducement for others seeking for a site to build on to buy the vacant lot with the right to use said party wall and build thereon, but exactly what such an asset is worth is most speculative in its character. When such an agreement is not in fact carried out but the property left by a trick of respondent in the situation this is, the remedy by specific performance being applied, adequate compensation either way may incidentally thereto be given in a way to do approximate justice between the parties.\nThe respondent Wright claimed in his evidence the right to build two storys additional to the four he had built, and evidenced an intention to do so, but later admitted as follows:\u2014 Q. Is the interior structure of the first and second stories such that you could erect two additional stories on your building?\u2014 A. What do you mean by first and second?\nQ. The ground floor and the next floor?\u2014 A. It may have to be reinforced from the first story.\nQ. It may have to be reinforced right from the basement?\u2014 A. No, I think not.\nI assume that under the agreement he may have the right to add two stories provided the foundation, and upward, of the party wall is carried up the two feet or more in thickness.\nBut his idea of reinforcement by a new wall is entirely contrary to what the evidence already referred to establishes, and is impossible unless the wall is demolished entirely down to the point where the two feet in thickness was departed from.\nUnless respondents distinctly abandon such right and intention, and appellant agrees to his doing so, I conclude that the wall must be demolished down to the part where the two feet thickness of wall was departed from and the respondents be ordered to rebuild same of the said thickness of two feet as specified in the agreement and that on or before the 21st October, 1923, according to the specification in the agreement.\nAnd in such event the appellant should pay the respondents then or so soon as determined the half of the cost price of the construction of the said party wall so far as used by the appellant up to said date.\nIf, however, the appellant is content to refrain from insisting upon the terms named in the agreement and satisfied with a wall twenty-one inches in width from the point where the wall was reduced as originally built from two feet to twenty-one inches in thickness, that then the existent wall shall be demolished down to that point to the top of the four existent stories and in accordance with the terms otherwise specified in said agreement.\nIn such event as that the wall so carried up will not be in conformity with the original agreement and the same will rest upon the land conceded by the appellant in a greater proportion than upon the respondent's land, due compensation should be made by them for the difference to be determined by the local registrar of the court or other party those concerned may select in settling the minutes of judgment herein.\nSuch wall of reduced thickness shall be available for the use of the appellant or his successors in title according to the terms specified in the agreement as if of the agreed thickness therein contemplated but subject to the foregoing reduction as provided for above.\nOf course this suggestion adopting with compensation to appellant for the use of a greater part of his land than would be contributed by respondents can only be acted upon if a twenty-one-inch wall for such a four-story building as existent, or a six-story building as contemplated by respondent, can be made conformable with the city by-law relative to party walls.\nLittle authority has been cited us by either side but the only case cited by respondents, Weston v. Arnold[3], seems so far from touching anything involving the principles applicable to this case that one is surprised to find such a citation supposed to be useful herein.\nOn the other hand the only case cited by appellant, Shelfer v. City of London Electric Lighting Co.[4], is in point as to the question of preferring the application of the recognized principles of equity jurisprudence relative to specific performance in lieu of damages.\nThe paucity of citations of authorities is no doubt owing to the extraordinary methods the respondent Wright adopted and pretended to be founded upon a very plain agreement which he chose to violate, though pretending such violation was in pursuance of the terms of the agreement, which gave him contrary to the usual terms of a party wall agreement, a free hand, except in one plainly specified option which he chose to exercise in a most unjustifiable way.\nThe right to specific performance, so far as the contract in question is concerned once the respondent actually accepted and acted upon the contract so as to render it operative, seems to me elementary law unless so far as met by the contention that damages are an adequate remedy if this case can be brought within any such case as the courts have so held as a reason for refusal thereof.\nThe cases on which I rely for the application I am making of the law relative to specific performance being granted when damages are an inadequate remedy, are to be found in Fry on Specific Performance, at p. 26 and following pages, and Dart on Vendors and Purchasers, chapter on Specific Performance and especially at pp. 989 et seq. of 5th ed. and cases cited therein.\nAnd as to the application of compensation see Fry on Specific Performance, Part V, c. 3 (6th ed.).\nBut one case, Powell v. The South Wales Ry. Co.[5] (to which I am indebted to Dart in Vendors and Purchasers, cited at p. 990 of the 5th ed. thereof) decided by V. C. Wood, seems in principle to cover the whole ground herein both as to the execution of a work, in that case a drain, and the question of compensation.\nI regret that we have not had on this branch of the case as I have dealt with it, any argument.\nI would therefore suggest, if my views are agreed upon by the majority of the court, that if the parties concerned cannot agree, the minutes may be spoken to.\nI would allow the appeal and decree specific performance on the foregoing terms, with costs to the appellant throughout.\nDUFF J.\u2014 The appellant and the respondent are owners of adjoining building lots in Vancouver and in 1908 they entered into an agreement by which, among other things, the respondent was given the privilege of erecting a wall, described as a party wall, not less than two feet in thickness upon any part of the whole of the boundary line between the two lots, the middle line of the wall to coincide with the boundary line, and the respondent was to have certain rights in relation to this wall when so constructed. The respondent proceeded in due time to build a wall properly placed in conformity with the terms of the agreement, one half on each side of the boundary line and he proceeded in this way to the height of 12 feet. The wall was raised to a further height of 36 feet but with the thickness reduced progressively at different stages to 12 1\/2 inches at the top. The whole of this reduction of thickness was made on the respondent's side, the wall on the appellant's side presenting an even surface from top to bottom. The appellant having, years afterwards, discovered what had taken place, the action out of which this appeal arises was brought. The learned trial judge granted an injunction directing the demolition of the wall down to the point at which the dimensions of it ceased to conform to the specification of the agreement but stayed the operation of the injunction for two years to enable the parties to arrange matters. The Court of Appeal reversed this judgment substituting an inquiry as to damages. The question on the present appeal is whether or not the judgment of the trial judge should be restored.\nI am unable to agree with the view of the case taken by the Court of Appeal. That view was that the plaintiff's sole ground of complaint was that there had been a breach of contract and that as it was not a case in which the court would, according to its practice, order the contract to be specifically executed, the plaintiff's only right was to recover damages. I am unable to agree with this because it seems to me quite clear that the conduct of the respondent was tortious. His authority to enter upon the appellant's land was an authority strictly limited. It was for the purpose of constructing a wall which should be placed half on his side of the line and half on his neighbour's side. This term of the agreement as to the situation of the wall is not a mere incident, it is of the very essence of the licence granted to the respondent. The moment he began to reduce the thickness of the wall on his own side of the line while maintaining unreduced its thickness on the other side he became a trespasser. He became a trespasser because having authority to enter upon his neighbour's property for a certain purpose he was using it for another purpose for which he was not authorized to enter. The principle is well illustrated in the cases touching abuse of rights of way. Dovaston v. Payne[6]. I may add that treating the reciprocal rights and duties of the parties to this agree- ment as within the domain of contract alone it is quite clear that the respondent came under an implied undertaking not to make that part of the wall resting on the appellant's land thicker than the part resting on his own.\nIn these circumstances what is the appropriate remedy? Lord Justice Scrutton has recently pointed out in a case in which the subject of mandatory injunction was a good deal discussed how difficult it is to discover in the decided cases any definition enabling one to draw a line exactly between the, conditions in which a mandatory injunction will be granted and the circumstances in which it will not be granted. Kennard v. Cory[7]. In that case the Court of Appeal sustained an order made by Mr. Justice Sargant requiring the defendant to execute certain works in the nature of repairs. The order was made upon an application under leave to apply reserved in the judgment given at the trial and the case largely turned upon the scope of the inquiry as to damages which had been granted and that of the original injunction and leave. The original injunction as interpreted by the Court of Appeal was an exercise of jurisdiction of a somewhat unusual character and affords a more than ample precedent for the order of the trial judge in the present litigation.\nThe circumstances of this case indeed seem to bring it within the analogy of more than one well marked class of cases in which the Court of Chancery exercised its jurisdiction by granting specific relief without hesitation. I must premise before particularizing that it seems quite clear that the trial judge proceeded on the view that the appellant remained in ignorance down to the time the proceedings were taken of the fact that the agreement had been violated by the respondent. My own conclusion is that the fact was concealed. The suggestion made by the respondent himself that although he knew what was being done he had no design of infringing the appellant's rights is one that postulates a degree of indifference to the rights of others which a court of equity could not treat as innocent. In such matters standards must be objective standards. The case therefore falls within the class dealing with the responsibilities of persons who, having obtained an advantage on faith of an undertaking to do something for the benefit of another, seek to retain the advantage while escaping the obligation through some technical loophole. Equity has always in such cases insisted upon the performance of the duty where the advantage could not be surrendered or on the surrender of the advantage where it would not compel the performance of the duty; and an excellent illustration is to be found in those cases in which a railway company having taken lands from a landowner on terms of performing certain works, the court in departure of its general practice to refuse orders for the construction of works has required the railway company to carry out its undertaking. Wolverhampton and Walsall Ry Co. v. London and North-Western Ry. Co.[8]. The case is within that principle in its general features for the respondent has taken advantage of an authority conferred upon him for a strictly defined purpose clandestinely to use it in violation of the good faith of the agreement. Again the work complained of was constructed in breach as we have seen of the explicit terms of the agreement and it is within the analogy of those cases in which it has been held that the court will grant a mandatory injunction to restrain the violation of such an agreement. Morris v. Grant[9] ; McManus v. Cooke[10] ; Manners v. Johnson[11].\nThe case moreover is within the principle of Goodson v. Richardson[12]. The defendant in that case had without the consent of the owner of the soil laid certain water pipes under a highway and Lord Selborne at p. 224 said:\u2014\nI cannot look upon this case otherwise than as a deliberate and unlawful invasion by one man of another man's land for the purpose of a continuing trespass, which is in law a series of trespasses from time to time, to the gain and profit of the trespasser, without the consent of the owner of the land; and it appears to me, as such, to be a proper subject for an injunction.\nThere can be no distinction in principle between getting possession clandestinely and getting possession by agreement for a given purpose and then surreptitiously using the possession so acquired for another purpose. There is no doubt, as laid down by the Lords Justices in Kennard v. Cory[13], that the primary point for consideration in every case where the question is injunction or no injunction is whether or not the wrong complained of is a wrong \" for which damages are the proper remedy,\" to use the phrase of Lindley L.J. in London & Blackwall Ry. Co. v. Cross[14], that is to say a complete and adequate remedy; and I have no doubt that it would have been competent to the court to direct an inquiry as to damages wide enough to include damages suffered by reason of diminution of the value of the appellant's land. See judgment of the Master of the Rolls in Kennard v. Cory [15] at p. 13, and of Warrington L.J. at p. 18. But on the other hand as Lord Selborne and the Lords Justices point out in Goodson v. Richardson[16], a very important element in the value of land may be the right to exclude a particular trespasser or the right of the owner to have specific works erected as in the Wolverhampton Case[17]. It is quite clear that the trial judge did not think that damages ascertained according to any principle upon which it would be feasible to assess them would afford an adequate remedy. I am unable to say that the Court of Appeal disagreed with this because the Court of Appeal proceeded upon a basis which, with great respect, as already mentioned, was not, I think, the right basis. I am unable to say what view the Court of Appeal would have taken if they had agreed with the trial judge that the conduct of the respondent amounted to an actionable wrong. Being myself far from satisfied that damages would afford adequate reparation, I think the appeal should be allowed and the judgment of the trial judge restored.\nANGLIN J.\u2014 By an agreement made between the parties in 1908 the defendant obtained the right to enter upon and utilize 12 inches of the plaintiff's land for the erection of a party wall of not less than 24 inches in thickness of which the centre line should coincide with the boundary line between their respective properties. The defendant built the wall. It was in substantial compliance with the agreement as to the basement and the first or ground floor story. For the second story the wall was only 21 inches in thickness\u2014 12 inches on the plaintiff's land and 9 inches on the defendant's land. For the third story the total thickness was 16 1\/2 inches of which only 4 1\/2 inches was on the defendant's land. For the fourth story the wall had a thickness of 12 1\/2 inches of which only one-half an inch was on the defendant's land. A fire parapet carried above the roof and 9 inches thick was wholly on the plaintiff's land.\nThe wall was perpendicular on the outside, or the plaintiff's side, and he remained unaware that from the second story up it did not conform to the contract until shortly before he brought this action. Nothing amounting to acquiescence, or even to laches such as might disentitle him to relief by injunction has been shown.\nUpon the evidence it is reasonably clear that the existing wall cannot be added to by further construction on the defendant's property so as materially to strengthen it or make it at all equivalent to a wall originally built according to the requirements of the contract. While it seems probable that the wall as constructed would have sufficient strength to serve as a party wall for a four-story building of comparatively light construction, such as an office building, to be erected on the plaintiff's land, it has not been shown that under the existing by-laws of Vancouver the plaintiff would be allowed to utilize it as a party wall for such a structure. Moreover, it is quite clear that it would not suffice as a party wall for a warehouse or for any other building intended to carry a heavy weight, and probably not for a building of lighter construction of more than four stories in height. Even if in a position to make some use of the wall as a party wall the plaintiff would therefore find himself restricted in the use to be made of his land to an extent materially greater than would have been the case had the party wall been built as agreed upon.\nThe evidence of the architect, Watson, shows that the departure from the terms of the agreement was decided upon by the defendant when the plans for his building were in course of preparation and before work on the party wall had begun. Upon these facts the learned trial judge held that a trespass had been committed on the plaintiff's land by the erection of the narrowed wall above the top of the first story, and enjoined the continuance of such trespass, but suspended the operation of the injunction for two years to enable the defendant to make the wall conform to the agreement.\nThe Court of Appeal (Macdonald, C.J.A., Galliher and Eberts JJ.A., McPhillips, J.A. diss.) being of the opinion that there had been no trespass but merely a breach of agreement, and that the wall as erected\nis a good and sufficient wall for the purpose for which it was built,\nset aside the judgment of the trial court and substituted for it a judgment awarding the plaintiff such damages (if any) as he had sustained by the defendant's breach of contract,\nthe amount of such damages, if any, to be arrived at by ascertaining the value to the respondent (plaintiff) of the space the use of which he has been deprived of by the appellant, Wright, building the said wall\nas he did, and a new trial to assess such damages was directed.\nThe plaintiff appeals and asks the restoration of the judgment of the learned trial judge. There is no cross-appeal by the defendant, who, on the contrary concedes that the wall is not built according to the terms of the agreement and, with a view to escaping an immediate injunction, offers either to strengthen it by additional construction on his side, or, if that he not feasible, to rebuild from the second story up such portion of it as the plaintiff may desire to use as a party wall whenever he shall be prepared to carry on his building.\nWith great respect, if damages should be the appropriate remedy, the measure of them should not be restricted to the value of the space lost to the plaintiff by the wall being narrowed wholly on the defendant's side instead of equally on both sides. In the first place the perpendicularity of the wall on the plaintiff's side was in strict conformity with the contract. That caused no loss of space to which he was entitled under its terms. What should be allowed as damages would be such sum as would, as nearly as money compensation could do so, place the plaintiff in the same position as he would have held had the wall been erected according to the terms of the contract.\nBut is his remedy properly restricted to the recovery of damages? Is he not entitled to the mandatory injunction which the learned trial judge granted him?\nWhatever might have been the case had the original entry been lawful\u2014i.e., had the defendant when he began to build the wall intended to construct it according to the terms of the agreement and determined to narrow it, as he did, only while it was in course of construction,\u2014 whether or not upon that state of facts the view taken by the Court of Appeal, that the cause of action is not for trespass but only for breach of agreement, or, perhaps more accurately, for an abuse of licence, would have been correct, (The Six Carpenters' Case[18] ; Smith's Leading Cases, (12 ed. 146, 156) the defendant, having obtained a licence to enter upon the plaintiff's land only for a defined purpose, his entry for a different purpose was in my opinion clearly a trespass, which he continued by erecting the wall as he did and still continues by maintaining it. The determination to build the wall otherwise than as agreed upon having been arrived at before the work was begun, the original entry itself was not authorized by the licence given by the agreement.\nAgain, the evidence satisfies me that the departure from the agreement was intentional and deliberate and was made for the purpose of securing to the defendant such additional space as he would thus obtain and probably also in order to save him a portion of the cost of constructing a party wall of 24 inches, in thickness from top to bottom. The positive testimony on this point given by the architect, Watson, should, I think, be accepted rather than the plaintiff's denial. This case seems to present an instance of wanton disregard of a plaintiff's rights, and perhaps also of an attempt to steal a march on him. Colls v. Home & Colonial Stores, Ltd.[19] ; Jones v. Tankerville[20]. To quote the language of Lord Selborne L.C. in Goodson v. Richardson[21] : I cannot look upon this case otherwise than as a deliberate and unlawrul invasion by one man of another man's land for the purpose of a continuing trespass, which is in law a series of trespasses from time to time, to the gain and profit of the trespasser, without the consent of the owner of the land; and it appears to me, as such, to be a proper subject for an injunction.\nThe plaintiff has therefore established an invasion of his legal right not trivial either in its character or in its consequences\u2014if indeed the latter need be considered in a case of trespass such as this, Goodson v. Richardson[22] . No doubt, unless under circumstances of peculiar aggravation, (Kerr on Injunctions, 5th ed., pp. 43-4) the jurisdiction to grant a mandatory injunction, especially where it involves subjecting the defendant to such serious loss as the tearing down of the party wall must in this instance entail, should be exercised with great caution and only if the remedy by damages is inadequate. Colls v. Home & Colonial Stores'[23] . But the jurisdiction itself is undoubted even when the injury has been completed before action is brought, Durell v. Pritchard[24] ; City of London Brewery Co. v. Tennant[25], and such an order has more than once been made. Baxter v. Bower[26] ; Attorney General v. Parish[27]. It seems to be the remedy to which a plaintiff is entitled where the defendant has deliberately placed an unauthorized erection on his land. Holmes v. Upton[28] .\nHere we have a case of wilful trespass involving substantial injury, adequate compensation for which it is almost impossible to estimate\u2014so much so that the removal of the wall so far as it is not in compliance with the agreement appears to be the only remedy by which justice ean be done to the plaintiff. Shelfer v. City of London Electric Lighting Co.[29]. The court has not the right to compel the plaintiff to part with his exclusive legal right over his own land for something different from that for which he bargained as the consideration for foregoing it. Cowper v. Laidler[30] . That in effect will be done if the mandatory injunction sought be refused. Any damages which the plaintiff could reasonably expect to recover would not give him full compensation for the injury done him should the wall be allowed to remain as it now stands.\nUnder these circumstances, although the expense to which the defendant will be put may be considerably greater than any actual benefit the plaintiff may derive, the plaintiff insisting on the relief of a mandatory injunction to restrain continuation of the trespass is in my opinion entitled to it. Woodhouse v. Newry Navigation Co.[31].\nThe defendant at the trial and again in this court offered, if allowed for the present to retain the wall as it stands, an undertaking to rebuild it so as to conform to the contract from the top of the first story upwards whenever the plaintiff should determine to carry up the one-story building now erected on his land. But such an undertaking would not be satisfactory; nor, if put in the form of a judgment, would it afford the plaintiff adequate relief. The agreement is registered against his land. He may at any time desire to sell it and an outstanding question as to the party wall would probably have an adverse effect, if not on the prospect of sale itself, at least on the price obtainable.\nThe defendant has not so conducted himself as to be an object of sympathy. If the mandatory injunction to be granted will entail serious loss to him he has only himself to thank for the situation in which he is placed. I accept the view of the late Mr.. Justice Clement that a stay of the operation of the injunction for a period of two years is reasonable in view of the fact that the plaintiff appears to have no present intention either of proceeding with his building or of selling his land.\nThe appeal should be allowed with costs here and in the Court of Appeal and the judgment of the trial judge restored, modified, if necessary, so that demolition above the point at which the wall ceases to be not less than 24 inches in thickness will be directed, as the learned judge no doubt intended.\nBRODEUR J.\u2014 The parties in this case, who are owners of adjoining lots, agreed in 1908 that a party wall of at least two feet in thickness should be built by Wright one-half on each lot. The first story was built according to the agreement; but in the upper stories Wright narrowed the wall on his side and kept it perpendicular on Gross' side. In that way, Wright gained some space for his own property.\nGross, having recently discovered that Wright had not properly fulfilled the agreement, took the present action for trespass, for demolition and for specific performance.\nThe trial judge maintained the action, but the Court of Appeal decided there was no trespass but simply a breach of agreement which entitled Gross to damages for the loss of space occasioned by the wrongful building. Gross appeals from this judgment.\nIt is in evidence and it was so found by the trial judge that the wall as it now exists is of sufficient strength to carry any structure Gross is ever likely to put on his lot; and if I could satisfy myself that Wright was in good faith in constructing the wall as he did and in giving to himself more roomy space, I would be inclined to leave the wall as it is upon payment of reasonable indemnity (Delorme v. Cusson[32] ). But the evidence of Wright's architect shows that he was instructed to construct the wall as he did in order that he (Wright) would have more room on the inside. Damages could be substituted for a mandatory injunction ; but where, as Kerr on Injunctions, 5th ed. p. 44 says,\nthe defendant has been guilty of sharp practice or unfair conduct or has shown a desire to steal a march upon the plaintiff,\nthen the remedy should be by injunction. The courts are not instituted for legalizing wilful wrongful acts; and, as it is stated in Shelfer v. City of London[33], the court has always protested against the notion that it ought to allow a wrong to continue simply, because the wrongdoer is willing and able to pay for the injury he may inflict.\nWright, in virtue of his contract with Gross had a Licence or authority to enter on his neighbour's property for a certain purpose; but this did not justify an entry for another purpose and the doing of acts not authorized by the License. (Cyc, vol. 38, p. 1061.)\nThe law is to the effect that if a land is subject to a certain right, a person who unlawfully uses such land for any purpose other than that of exercising the right to which it is subject is a trespasser. (Halsbury, vol. 27, p. 847.)\nApplying these principles to the present case, it seems to me that the action instituted by Gross should be maintained, that the defendant should be considered as a trespasser and that all the wall which is not in conformity with the contract should be demolished.\nThe appeal should be allowed with costs of this court and of the Court of Appeal and the judgment of the trial judge should be restored, with a modification which would make the formal judgment clearly carry out the decision of the judge as expressed in his notes.\nMIGNAULT J.\u2014In my opinion, in building his wall as he did, the respondent committed a trespass on the appellant's land for which the only adequate remedy is an injunction to the effect indicated in the reasons for judgment of the learned trial judge. I would allow the appeal with costs throughout.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: McInnes & Arnold.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Gwillim, Crisp & McKay.\n[1] [1922] 2 W.W.R. 1028.\n[2] [1918] 87 L.J.P.C. 83.\n[3] [1873] 8 Ch.

N. Henderson gave, amongst other legacies, to the respondent Fraser $20,000 and to the respondent Henderson $10,000. The testator later made a codicil. The first clause was as follows: \"I hereby ratify and confirm the said will in every respect save in so far as any part is inconsistent with this codicil.\" In the two other clauses, he bequeathed to each of the respondents a sum of $25,000.\nPer Idington, Duff and Anglin JJ.\u2014The two bequests in the codicil are additional to, and not substitutional for, the gifts made to the same legatees by the will. Davies C.J. and Brodeur and Mignault JJ. contra.\nJudgment of the Court of Appeal affirmed on equal division of this court.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia, reversing the judgment of Hunter C.J. at the trial.\nThe Montreal Trust Company, trustee under the will, made application to the Supreme Court of British Columbia for the determination of the following question arising out of the construction of the last will and codicil of the late J. N. Henderson, namely: \"Whether the legacies mentioned in the codicil were cumulative or whether they were in substitution of the legacies mentioned in the will.\"\nHunter C.J. held that the legacies given by the codicil were substituted for those in the will. The Court of Appeal, per Macdonald C.J.A. and Martin J.A., reversed this judgment, McPhillips J.A. dissenting.\nThe present appellant is a party to the proceedings, both in his own interest as residuary legatee and as representative of all other legatees, by virtue of an order made in these proceedings. Tilley K.C. for the appellant: Upon the evidence and under the circumstances in this case, the intention of the testator was to make the legacies in the codicil substitutional.\nIf any presumption of law arises in this case, it is rebutted by the following circumstances as stated in the factum:\n(a) The use of the words \"I hereby ratify and confirm the said will in every respect save in so far as any part is inconsistent with this codicil\", as the first clause in the said codicil, instead of the usual ratification clause, together with the fact that no change was made by the codicil in the provisions of the will, except in the legacies to the respondents;\n(b) The total estate being sufficient to pay legacies in full and leave a certain amount in the residuary fund if the legacies in the codicil be taken as substitutional, whereas a large deficiency will be occasioned if the legacies are held to be cumulative;\n(c) The respondents not being treated alike in the will, but being given an equal amount in the codicil.\nIn re A.

Prima facie the gift in the codicil is a new gift not substitutional for or revocatory of the gift in the first.\nThis presumption is strengthened when the codicil contains no words of revocation.\nA clear gift ought not to be taken away except by expressions so clear as to leave no reasonable doubt. Wilson v. O'Leary[8] ; Russell v. Dickson[9] ; Suisse v. Lowther[10]; Watson v. Reed[11] ; Sawrey v. Rumney[12] .\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014This appeal has given rise to much difference of judicial opinion upon the proper construction to be given to a will and codicil, and as to whether certain bequests of money to two of the nieces of the testator in the codicil should be held to be cumulative or substitutionary to those given to the same nieces in the will. The deceased testator was a bachelor and died at Victoria, B.C., on the 10th August, 1920, leaving a will dated 16th of May, 1919, by which he devised and bequeathed all his real and personal property to the Montreal Trust Company upon trust to sell and convert the same into money and out of the proceeds to pay his debts, funeral and testamentary expenses and a large number of legacies. Amongst these were, one to his niece Muriel Edna Henderson, wife of Donald G. Munro Fraser, of the sum of $20,000, and another to his niece Evelyn G. Henderson, of the sum of $10,000. There were a number of other legacies and bequests and a residuary devise to his nephew, the present appellant.\nThe question to be determined is whether the bequests to those two nieces in the codicil were cumulative to those given in the will or were substitutional therefor. That question must be determined by deciding what the intention of the testator was. That intention must be gathered from the language of the will and codicil, and from the conditions surrounding the testator when he made them. It is not without weight in so determining to find, as is admitted here, that if the cumulative rule sought to be followed is adopted the result will be that all of the testator's pecuniary legacies to his other beneficiaries will be cut down 15 per cent, whereas if the codicil bequests are found to be substitutional, there will be no such abatement.\nNow turning to the codicil and endeavouring to find the controlling factor from it, namely the intention of the testator, we find that the codicil was made at Long Beach, California, and that he had not his will with him at the time. We can presume this because in the opening paragraph of the codicil he says he cannot remember the exact date of his will.\nThen follows the first clause, viz.:\nFirst: I hereby ratify and confirm the said will in every respect save in so far as any part\nis inconsistent with this codicil.\nClauses 2 and 3 containing the bequests to each of the two nieces of $25,000 then follow.\nNow it is to my mind absolutely clear that he is thereby confirming his will in every respect except in regard to the two legacies to his two nieces given by the will which by his codicil he increased, one from $20,000 to $25,000 and the other from $10,000 to $25,000, thus putting both nieces on an equal footing.\nI construe the words\nsave in so far as any part is inconsistent with this codicil\nto mean \"not consistent\" or \"at variance with.\" Now \"any part\" includes the amount of their respective legacies under the will and he expressly fails to confirm those, evidently to my mind showing a clear intention on his part not to confirm those two previous legacies given in his will. In every other respect he intends to confirm and does so, but with regard to these two legacies of $20,000 and $10,000 respectively he does not confirm the will. On the contrary, as I think, he substitutes for them the sums of $25,000 which he bequeaths to his nieces by the codicil.\nThe cumulative construction seems to me to ignore absolutely, or at any rate to fail to give any effect to the words confirming the will\nsave in so far as any part is inconsistent with this codicil.\nThese important words on that construction are left without any meaning and therefore ignore altogether the testator's intention. He confirms the will in every respect save in so far as the changes made in his bequests to his two nieces. With regard to them he does not ratify or confirm his will, but, on the contrary, devises increased amounts to each, giving each $25,000.\nI have not heard any suggestion as to any meaning to be attached to these words of the codicil confirming his will\nsave in so far as any part is inconsistent with this codicil,\nunless the suggestion is the correct one that his intention was to ratify and confirm his will in every respect except with regard to these two legacies each of which he desired to increase and did increase.\nI have read the cases cited below and in argument here but do not find anything in any of them suggesting that the cumulative rule regarding legacies in a will and a codicil is more than a prima facie one, and one which must in all cases of course yield to the paramount rule that the intention of the testator, if it can be found, or determined, must prevail.\nIn this case, I think the intention clear that the two codicil bequests are substitutionary and not cumulative to those of the will, and that the intention of the testator that they should be so is also clear from the express words in the first paragraph of the codicil which ratifies and confirms the\nwill in every respect save in so far as any part is inconsistent with this codicil,\nor as I construe the words, not consistent with, or at variance with. The only part of the codicil altering or varying the will is where the two bequests are increased, as I have stated, and so to his mind were inconsistent with the original bequest made in the will.\nOn this question of the testator's intention, if it can be found, being paramount over the prima facie cumulative rule, I quote from the speech of Lord St. Leonards in the case of Russell v. Dickson[13]:\nI considered myself at liberty, without trenching upon any rule of law, or breaking in upon any decision, to determine this case upon the intention. There is no rule of law that prevents a court from looking to the intention. Every case that you open says: If you find the intention, you are at liberty to act upon it; and the simple question in this case is: Do you or do you not find the intention? Of that I have already spoken. Then there is the difficulty about the rule of law. There is no case exactly like this nor is it likely that such a case should frequently occur. You must depend upon the principle. If you can find within the four corners of the instrument an intention, not that the legacy shall be cumulative, but that it shall be substitutionary, you are at perfect liberty to act upon the intention, you are not only at perfect liberty, but you are bound by law to give effect to it, provided only that it does not contravene any existing rule of law.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014I cannot add much, if anything, useful to that which has been said by the learned judges constituting the majority determining the result now in appeal herein.\nCounsel for the appellant has fairly presented in his factum the results of the leading cases which I have con- sidered but which by no means convince me that the codicil in question was not intended to be cumulative according to the prima facie effect to be given thereto.\nUndue importance seems to me to be attached to the word \"inconsistent\".\nI may add that seeing an item of $32,097.27 for real estate in value according to those appraising for the imposition of succession duties, suggests the possibility that the testator attached a much higher value thereto and thus the basis for appellant's conjecture is quite unfounded.\nI observe he was careful to suggest due care in the disposition thereof and suggested his brother, who was the father of those benefiting most largely by this will, should be consulted as to his family affairs.\nThat suggests much to me that might explain the view taken by the testator.\nAt all events I cannot see my way to reverse the prima facie rule to be adopted.\nI would dismiss the appeal without costs save as to those of the executors or trustees, while theirs between solicitor and client must be paid out of the estate.\nDUFF J.\u2014The point for decision on this appeal can be stated in a sentence or two. The testator by his will left to his niece Muriel Edna Henderson a legacy of $20,000 and to his niece Evelyn G. Henderson a legacy of $10,000. By a codicil he gave to each of these nieces a legacy of $25,000. The question upon which we are to pass is whether or not in each case the gift by the codicil is in substitution for the gift by the will or whether on the other hand the gifts by the two instruments take effect cumulatively.\nIn order to appreciate the argument on behalf of the appellant it is necessary to read the whole of the codicil which is in the following terms:\nI, Joseph Newlands Henderson, of the city of Vancouver, British Columbia, in the Dominion of Canada, but temporarily residing at Long Beach, California, United States of America, hereby declare this to be a codicil to my last will and testament which last will and testament I made during the months of May and June, 1919, the date of which I do not remember.\nFirst: I hereby ratify and confirm the said will in every respect save in so far as any part is inconsistent with this codicil. Second: I hereby give and bequeath to my niece Muriel Edna Henderson, wife of Donald George Munro Fraser, said Muriel Edna Henderson being the daughter of my brother Thomas Morrison Henderson, the sum of twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000).\nThird: I give and bequeath to my niece, Evelyn Gladys Henderson, the daughter of my brother Thomas Morrison Henderson, the sum of twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000).\nIn witness whereof I have hereunto set my hand and seal this fifteenth day of January, in the year of our Lord one thousand nine hundred and twenty.\nJoseph Newlands Henderson (Seal).\nThe general rule of construction being that prima facie where by a will and a codicil two legacies whether of the same or of different amounts are given to the same persons, the legacy given by the codicil is presumed to be additional to that given by the will; the ground from which Mr. Tilley directs his attack on the judgment of the Court of Appeal is that the introductory clause or rather the first paragraph of the codicil means and overcomes this presumption.\nNow although it may be, as argued on behalf of the respondent, that the first paragraph is in a sense otiose because the publication of the codicil is in itself a republication of the will, as of the date of the codicil, still it is undeniable that paragraph does contain a solemn declaration by the testator of his intention that the dispositions made by the will shall be undisturbed save in so far as the provisions of the codicil are inconsistent with them. And that by implication does of course sufficiently disclose an intention in fact on the part of the testator that in the case of such inconsistency and to the extent of such inconsistency the dispositions of the codicil are to prevail over the dispositions of the will.\nThe real question is: How far does this carry us? I am unable to agree that it follows as a consequence from this premise that the legacies given by the codicil are to be substituted for those given by the will. And for this reason, ex hypothesi, there is substitution if there is inconsistency and there is no substitution unless there is inconsistency and the question therefore necessarily turns on the point, is there or is there not inconsistency? And touching that point the presumption against substitution rests upon the foundation that there is no incompatibility and no inconsistency involved in the giving considered in itself of a pecuniary legacy by codicil to a legatee to whom a legacy has already been given by the will. We need not go into the reasons for the presumption. It seems to be founded in good sense; and such great masters of judicature as Lord Cairns and Lord Justice James gave effect to it without hesitation and without doubt. Prima facie, at least, therefore Mr. Tilley is not assisted by the first paragraph. Prima facie there is no inconsistency between the provisions of the codicil in relation to the legacies in question and the relevant provisions of the will.\nMr. Tilley meets this by the argument that, conceding this to be the prima facie construction of the paragraph, it is not its true construction. You must, he says, read the first paragraph with its context, in other words you must read it as an addendum to each of the two remaining paragraphs, the two paragraphs giving the legacies under consideration. And read with its context in this way he contends that the fair meaning, if not the necessary meaning, of it is that the provision made by the codicil for each of the beneficiaries mentioned is the provision, that is to say, the only provision the testator is making for those beneficiaries by way of pecuniary legacy.\nThere is no doubt weight in the contention that the first paragraph should be read as a part of the whole text of the codicil and I think this is so notwithstanding one's predisposition to look upon it as a stereotyped form. But the argument does not, I think, carry the appellant the whole distance. If it appeared that the paragraph on the construction which has been given to it in the Court of Appeal was without operation, we should have a very different case. It is impossible I think, to contend that because, while there is no inconsistency between the legacies in the codicil and the legacies given to the same legatees in the will, there is inconsistency between the codicil and the disposition of the residue by the will and therefore the first paragraph is not in any view wholly nugatory.\nThe sum of the matter, as will already have been apparent according to my view, is that the appellant's argument is really an attack, when it is closely analysed, upon the presumption against substitution and as such, I say this of course with the greatest respect for those who take another view, I cannot help thinking that in its effect it is an appeal to the court to substitute one's impression as to the probable intention of the testator for the conclusion one is driven to as to the result of a faithful adherence to the language the testator has employed. A passage is cited in the respondent's factum from a judgment of Lord Justice James in Wilson v. O'Leary[14], which I cannot forbear quoting:\nI would only add this that I cannot help feeling that this case has occupied more time than it would have done if I had throughout confined myself strictly to that which is my legitimate duty, that is, if instead of endeavouring to find out what the testator meant I had confined myself to endeavouring to ascertain what was the meaning of the testamentary papers which he left behind him.\nThe appeal should be dismissed.\nANGLIN J.\u2014There is nothing in the codicil which can be said to give expression to an intention to revoke the legacies given to the two respondents in the will. There is no inherent \"inconsistency\" between the gifts to them in the will and the gifts to them in the codicil\u2014nothing so incompatible that both may not take effect. On the other hand the residuary bequest in the will would certainly be cut down by the legacies given in the codicil. The confirmation of the will was subject to this modification.\nI attach no significance to the fact that under the will the bequests to the two legatees were of unequal amounts, whereas the legacies given to them by the codicil are each of the same amount. We have no clue to the motives that actuated the testator on either occasion. Without some knowledge of them any inference of intent that the new legacies should be substitutional would be unsafe and unwarranted. Prima facie, therefore, the gifts under both instruments are to be regarded as cumulative. Russell v. Dickson[15] ; Hurst v. Beach[16].\nThe only extraneous circumstances relied upon to support the inference of a contrary intention on the part of the testator is the fact, now apparent, that, after debts and succession duties have been satisfied, if the bequests in question are cumulative, all the testator's pecuniary legacies must abate 15 per cent, whereas, if the gifts by the codicil are substitutional for those in the will, no abatement will be requisite. No doubt if it were clear that that fact had been present to the mind of the testator its significance might be cogent. Yet, even under such circumstances, I can scarcely conceive of the testator, if he meant that there should be a revocation of the gifts made to the respondents in the will, expressing that intention in his codicil by the clause,\nI hereby ratify and confirm the said will in every respect save in so far as any part is inconsistent with this codicil.\nHe almost certainly would have employed some such phrase as \"instead of (in lieu of, or in substitution for) the gifts made to them in my will, I give and bequeath, etc.\"\nBut it is by no means improbable that the deficiency in the estate, now ascertained, was quite unknown to the testator. His assets consisted inter alia of several parcels of real estate, the actual worth of which must have been problematical, and of various stocks and shares, many of them highly speculative in character and of very uncertain value. It is quite a usual thing for an owner to be optimistic in respect to the value of his own property. Then again the testator may not have realized that his debts would amount to over $13,000, or that succession and probate duties would deplete his assets by a sum exceeding $26,000. In a word, it must be pure conjecture whether the testator appreciated that the additional bequests of $25,000 apiece to his two nieces would more than exhaust the residue of his estate bequeathed by his will to the appellant. As James L.J. said in Wilson v. O'Leary[17]:\nWhere there is a positive rule of law of construction such as exists in these cases, that is to say, that gifts by two testamentary instruments to the same individual are to be construed cumulatively, the plain rule of law and construction is not to be frittered away by a mere balance of probabilities.\nIn the case at bar I fail to find even a balance of probabilities in favour of the view urged by the appellant.\nIn my opinion no case can be made for taking the two bequests in the codicil before us out of the ordinary rule that they should be regarded as additional to, and not as substitutional for, the gifts made to the same legatees by the will. Jarman on Wills (6th ed.) p. 1123; 28 Halsbury L. of Engl. no. 1432.\nBRODEUR J.\u2014We are called upon to decide whether the legacies mentioned in the codicil are cumulative or whether they are in substitution of the legacies of the will.\nIn his will the testator had made several legacies to his ten nephews and nieces, ranging from $2,000 to $20,000. The two respondents, who are nieces, were legatees to the extent of $10,000 and $20,000 respectively. The will had been made in British Columbia on the 16th of May, 1919. A few months later the testator went to California where he made a codicil on the 15th of January, 1920, and died a short time later. By this codicil he declared at first that he ratified and confirmed his will in every respect \"save in so far as any part is inconsistent with this codicil\"; and then he gave $25,000 to each of his nieces to whom he had given previously by his will $20,000 and $10,000 respectively.\nIf the $50,000 disposed of by the codicil is to be considered as an addition to the $30,000 given to these legatees by the will, the estate will not be large enough to pay in full the other legatees. If, on the contrary, the legacies to these two nieces are substitutional, all the legacies could be paid in full.\nThere is not much in the evidence before us to guide us in the construction of this will. We may fairly assume that the testator knew the value of his fortune; and we could hardly say that his intention was to deprive the other legatees of the amount which he had given them, since he confirms everything he has done in his will and the only inconsistencies and differences which are to be found between his codicil and his will are in the legacies which he gives to his nieces.\nI consider that his evident intention was to increase the legacy which he had previously mentioned and to substitute in one case $25,000 for $10,000, and $25,000 for $20,000 in the other. For these reasons, the appeal should be allowed, the costs to be paid by the estate.\nMIGNAULT J.\u2014The only question here, and it is a question of much nicety, is whether the bequests which the late J. N. Henderson made by his codicil to his two nieces, the respondents, were in substitution for or in addition to the legacies which he had given them by his will. The will was executed before witnesses at Vancouver on May 16th, 1919, and, among a number of legacies to relatives of the testator, he gave to the respondent Muriel Edna Henderson, wife of Donald Fraser, $20,000, and to the respondent, Evelyn G. Henderson, $10,000. The testator was in Long Beach, California, when, on January 15th, 1920, he made a codicil to his will which evidently he did not have in his possession, for he says he does not remember its date. By this codicil, after stating in clause one that he ratifies and confirms his said will in every respect,\nsave in so far as any part is inconsistent with this codicil,\nhe bequeaths to each of the respondents, by separate clauses, the sum of $25,000.\nThe first court held that these last legacies were substitutionary; the Court of Appeal, Mr. Justice McPhillips dissenting, that they were cumulative. The appellant, the residuary legatee\u2014and there will be no residue but a deficiency if the bequests are cumulative\u2014now appeals to this court.\nAs stated by Lord Cranworth in Russell v. Dickson,\nwhere a legacy is given to the same party in each of two different instruments, a will and codicil, prima facie you must treat them as two gifts. That is an obvious proposition. If the party has twice said he gives, he must be understood to mean to give twice, but of course there may be circumstances to show that the prima facie construction is not, in the particular case, the construction to be adopted. What the circumstances are that are sufficient to outweigh the prima facie presumption, is extremely difficult to be determined by any rule of a priori reasoning, Very small circumstances have sometimes been acted on as sufficient to take the case out of the general rule.\nThe test is, of course, what the testator really intended, and no case better shows than Russell v. Dickson[18] that when the intention sufficiently appears to substitute the later legacy for the former, effect will be given to that intention. As Lord St. Leonards said, in the same case, at p. 310 :\nIf you can find within the four corners of the instrument an intention, not that the legacy shall be cumulative, but that it shall be substitutionary **** you are bound by law to give effect to it.\nSo in Russell v. Dickson[19] the testator, in a codicil executed a few days before his death, began by the words:\nNot having time to alter my will and to guard against any risk, ***\nand this language, among other circumstances, was considered as indicating his intention to substitute the legacy contained in the codicil for that made by his will.\nHere the testator had in mind that what he was going to do by his codicil would be inconsistent with some parts of his will, which otherwise he wished to ratify and confirm in every respect, and to the extent of such inconsistency he desired to alter his will. There could be no, what I might call intrinsic, inconsistency, by which I mean legacies which cannot be carried out cumulatively, between the will and the codicil, because the bequests in both were of sums of money. Nevertheless the testator, when he said\nsave in so far as any part is inconsistent with this codicil\nwas not dealing with a possible, but with an actual, inconsistency assumed by him to exist between the will and the codicil, and in my judgment this is a most important consideration to determine whether the testator intended to add these large legacies to the quite substantial amounts he had already given to his nieces. So the inconsistency contemplated here was one existing in the mind and intention of the testator, as he understood his testamentary provisions, and resulting from something contained in his codicil.\nWere the two bequests to these two sisters, the respondents, of $25,000 each, by the codicil, inconsistent with the bequest to them of unequal sums by the will, to wit, $20,000 to Mrs, Fraser, and $10,000 to Miss Henderson? Perhaps not intrinsically, in the sense in which I have used the word, but the real question is whether the testator considered the one inconsistent with the other. And equal treatment of these two legatees in the codicil would certainly be inconsistent with unequal treatment towards them in the will. If the intention of the testator in making his codicil, in other words if the scheme of the codicil, was to remove this inequality\u2014and the codicil deals only with these respondents\u2014certainly there would be an inconsistency in his mind between the will and the codicil. Giving effect to the will and codicil cumulatively would leave the inequality; treating the legacies in the codicil as substitutionary for those in the will would remove it.\nI have therefore reached the conclusion that in the intention of the testator, which of course must be determined by inspection of the instrument, the legacies made by the codicil were inconsistent with the legacies to the same legatees in the will and that therefore they should not be given cumulative effect.\nThe appeal should be allowed and the trial judgment restored. Costs out of the estate.\nAppeal dismissed.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Bowser, Reid, Wallbridge, Douglas & Gibson.\nSolicitors for the respondents: O'Brian & McLorg.\n[1] [1907] P. 125.\n[2] 4 H.L.

The appellant, in preparing rooms for one McK., its chief of police and fire chief, had employed a plumber and paid the cost of installing a stove pipe bought by the appellant, extending from the kitchen stove, which was the property of McK. The pipe passed through a wooden ceiling, thence through an attic and thence out of the building through a wooden roof. A municipal by-law required that in such a case the pipe should be \" enclosed in brick or tile walls with a space of at least three inches between the enclosing walls and the smoke pipe from bottom to top.\" Non-compliance with this by-law and that compliance would have prevented the escape of fire were admitted Some time before the fire occurred, the stove had been removed by McK. and another substituted, and one of the sections of the pipe was shortened in a manner which, it was alleged, added to the risk of fire. The trial judge directed the jury that the fact that a fire first broke out in appellant's premises was prima facie evidence of negligence and that the onus was on the appellant to acquit itself of liability by showing that the fire began accidentally; but he refused to direct that the appellant municipality was not liable for anything resulting from the act of McK. in making the pipe less safe. The verdict of the jury involved a finding that the fire originated from cinders or sparks escaping from the stove pipe into the attic.\nHeld, Mignault J. dissenting, that the appellant municipality was liable.\nHeld, also, Mignault J. contra, that there had not been misdirection as to the appellant's liability for the act of its servant McK. The appellant being responsible for the setting up in the first place of the stove, it was within the normal scope of McK.'s duty as appellant's servant to take notice of anything calculated to make the use of it a source of danger; McK.'s knowledge of what was done when the stove was changed was the knowledge of the municipality because his occupation was their occupation, and therefore McK's negligence was appellant's negligence.\nHeld, further, that owing to the jury's finding as to the cause of the fire, in view of the existence of its own by-law and of the fact that the fire would not have occurred if the by-law had been complied with, the appellant was prima facie liable for not having taken reasonable means to prevent harm to its neighbours by the escape of the fire it had authorized and that the charge of the trial judge, if textually open to criticism, was in substance unassailable. Mignault J. contra\nPer Idington and Mignault JJ.\u2014The fact that directions given to the jury conformed to views expressed by the Court of Appeal in setting aside a former judgment dismissing this action and ordering a new trial does not prevent their correctness being challenged on appeal from the judgment based on the verdict at such new trial.\nAPPEAL per saltum from the judgment of the Supreme Court of British Columbia maintaining the respondents' actions.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions at issue are fully stated in the above head-note and in the judgments now reported.\nFarris K.C. for the appellant.\nLafleur K.C. for the respondent.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014For the reasons stated by my brother Duff, in which I concur, I would dismiss this appeal with costs. IDINGTON J.\u2014Three actions were brought against appellant for damages alleged to have arisen from a fire originating in its fire hall, by reason of the negligence of said appellant, its servants or agents, and so spreading there from as to destroy real and personal property of each of the respective plaintiffs.\nAn order was made that the first of said actions should be tried as a test case and the others be stayed meantime, and I presume abide the result of such trial.\nThat case was accordingly tried and the verdict of the jury was for the defendant which upon appeal to the Court of Appeal for British Columbia was set aside and a new trial directed.\nUpon the second trial which took place before Mr. Justice Morrison, the verdict of the jury was for the plaintiff and judgment entered accordingly with a direction that the damages should be determined by the registrar of the court.\nJudgment was also entered in each of the others of the three cases in the same terms as in the case so tried.\nThereupon a motion was made before the Court of Appeal for leave to appeal to this court per saltum and such leave was given covering all the judgments in each of the three cases in question.\nThe objection was taken from the bench in course of the argument herein that the judgment in the action tried by granting a new trial overruled the direction of the learned trial judge on the first trial and as there was no appeal therefrom to this court it had the effect of creating a res judicata fatal to this appeal.\nI cannot so hold for I think our decision in the cases of Western Canada Power Co. v. Bergklint[1], Lavin v. Gaffin[2], and Kinney v. Fisher[3], rather seem to ignore such a ground, though maintained by my brother Mr. Justice Duff.\nI am on record in the second of these cases, if not all, as holding that the record of the judgment merely granted a new trial and did not pretend to definitely decide any point raised in argument. And in the lastly mentioned of these cases I pointed out that if the court below had so intended it could have so declared and put upon the party concerned the burden of appealing here before raising it again in the course of the new trial.\nI still adhere to that view and in this case more decidedly so for the reason that Mr. Justice McPhilips, with whom Mr. Justice Eberts concurred, constituting the majority deciding, specifically declared that even if he erred in the view taken by him as to the direction of the trial judge, he explicitly held and declared that the verdict then in question was against the weight of evidence and perverse, and for that reason there must be a new trial, which left the whole matter open on the second trial and it was clearly conducted accordingly.\nThe material before the court herein upon which the Court of Appeal gave leave to appeal per saltum here, does not appear in the printed case before us.\nIncidentally to my investigations of the point thus raised another of more serious import occurred to me as to the power to make such an order since the recent amendment to our Act. But as no such point taken in the argument I do not see that it should now be raised even if worth arguing.\nCounsel before us did not seem to me desirous of taking the position suggested and above dealt with and I suspected felt bound by a possible assent when before the Court of Appeal to the course of coming here per saltum in hopes of ending the litigation at less expense.\nIn argument, however, counsel for appellant seemed desirous of giving to the charge of Mr. Justice Morrison the complexion that he was taking the view that he was bound by everything Mr. Justice McPhillips had said.\nA perusal of the charge does not so impress me and I think it was clearly intended to apply the correct view of the law and that he succeeded therein.\nAnd if a single sentence therein quoted by counsel for appellant is capable of the construction that he sought to place thereon\u2014namely that, if a fire lawfully existing on the premises spread without any negligence, to the property of the plaintiff, then the defendant was liable unless and until he the defendant established it was accidentally that it spread.\nNo such construction; I respectfully submit, can fairly be attributed to what the learned trial judge said.\nThe case was tried throughout, as it was claimed by the pleadings to rest, upon the negligence of the defendant (now appellant) or that of its servants for whom it must be held responsible and was so presented to the jury by the learned trial judge.\nThe appellant in preparing a place for its fire chief to live in by day and night, so that he would be close to the fire engine and other apparatus for extinguishing a fire, saw fit to use a bare stove pipe, reaching from the kitchen stove, up through a board floor above, and thence up to the roof of the attic, and unprotected in any way, such as directed by its own by-law which was in accord with common sense and ordinary procedure.\nThis was done by the tinsmith or plumber, whom the appellant employed to do the work, and paid therefor.\nThe by-law in question provided, amongst other things, as follows:\u2014\nMetallic chimneys or smoke pipes shall not be used inside any building in such a way as to pass through the floors or roof of the same unless such metallic smoke pipe or chimneys are enclosed in brick or tile walls with an air space of at least three inches, between the enclosing walls and the smoke pipe from bottom to top. All outside metallic smoke stacks to be thoroughly anchored and guyed.\nThis is the rule which was laid down by appellant for others to follow and anything short of its observance by the appellant, unless something equally as safe, was in my opinion, gross negligence, such as should not, I submit, betolerated or palliated by any court of justice, in such a case as this.\nIf the three-inch air space that section provides for between the metal and the brick or tile walls to enclose it, had existed, there never would have been that accumulation of soot on the part in question where the fire originated, and there would have been no fire such as in question.\nThe confusion apt to be created by telling about a new stove being brought in and substituted by the fire chief for the one first placed there, is all beside the question that was to be tried. He may or may not have made matters worse when so substituting one stove for another, but if he did he was the servant of the appellant in charge of that place and especially for the purpose of protecting the respondents and others from fire and his acts of negligence in that connection are such as his employer, the appellant, was in law responsible for.\nConfusion is again apt to arise from the argument of counsel for appellant as to the law relevant to actions founded on a by-law.\nIt is not necessary to rest on any such right of action, nor was that contemplated by the learned judge's charge. The by-law is cogent evidence against appellant of what kind of care should be taken when a stove pipe is passed up through an attic board floor and thence to the roof to prevent such use of a stove pipe unless and until guarded in some such way as the by-law indicated.\nThis action is rested in the statement of claim solely upon negligence.\nI am by no means to be taken as holding that it might not have been rested on that by-law alone for I have not seen why I should pass an opinion on such an irrelevant suggestion, though there might have been found serious objection if that had been the ground taken.\nWe have not the entire by-law before us as it would doubtless have been, and should have been, if any such attempt had been made to enable the court to apply the law as laid down by Lord Cairns in the leading case of Atkinson v. Newcastle & Gateshead Waterworks Co.[4], where he held that it must depend to a great extent on the purview of the particular statute in question.\nThe learned judge's charge heard by counsel was objected to briefly on a single point made by counsel for plaintiff and that explained without further objection and then appellant's counsel, he says, handed up some written memorandum not produced, of his objections.\nThe learned trial judge then took up the three points so made, point by point, and answered same to the appar- ent satisfaction of the counsel, for nothing more was said by counsel anent same. If there was error in such explanation it was the duty of counsel to have pointed it out.\nThe second might have been more happily expressed but I can see no likelihood of it in any way having misled the jury.\nIf he had used the word \"evidence\" in support of the cause of action, instead of simply cause of action, when saying he could only repeat his explanation and so expressing what he said, it would perhaps have been better.\nBut no one could properly be misled by what was said. We must bear in mind the charge as a whole and its meaning so read, and credit the jury with common sense.\nThe third point in explanation was in substance a mode of putting in plain English which the jury could understand what lawyers and judges, when speaking to each other, refer to in latin as res ipsa loquitur, a perfectly well understood principle of law relative to evidence of negligence.\nI see nothing in any of these, or other objections, to justify setting aside a verdict obtained on very clear evidence of negligence once the jury had got over the really difficult part of the case raised on much conflicting evidence to determine whether the fire originated from causes internal or external in relation to the fire hall.\nOnce they decided in favour of the former proposition the case was a simple one.\nAnd with regard to this finding appellant does not now complain.\nI think therefore the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDUFF J.\u2014The argument on this appeal touched upon heads of the law under which there are points still unsettled and in respect of which there is room for considerable difference of opinion; but the case before us is, I think, without difficulty once the facts and proceedings are clearly understood. The appellant municipality had a wooden building, described as a fire hall, in which a fire broke out in August, 1920; the fire spread and destroyed some property of the respondent. The building was primarily used as a place for keeping the fire engine and other apparatus for fire extinguishment used by the municipality. One McKinley, who was the chief of police and fire chief was in charge of the building for the municipality, occupying with his family certain rooms. In one of these rooms there was a stove which was the property of McKinley to which was attached a pipe that passed through a wooden ceiling, thence through an attic and thence out of the building through a wooden roof. This pipe was supplied by the municipality and the municipality paid the expense of putting it in. Some time before the fire broke out the stove was removed and another substituted and one of the sections of the pipe was shortened in a manner which, it was alleged, added to the risk of fire.\nThe principal controversy of fact at the trial was whether the fire which destroyed the building originated from cinders or sparks escaping from the stove pipe into the attic or from cinders alighting on the roof emanating from some source outside the premises. It is quite clear, I think, and it was not disputed on the argument that the verdict of the jury necessarily involved a finding that the fire originated from the stove.\nAt the time the stove and the pipe were set up there was in force a by-law requiring certain precautions to be taken to reduce the risk of fire from metal stove pipes or chimneys passing through a wooden or plaster partition or roof. The by-law required that in such cases the metal pipe should be surrounded by a casing of brick and it was not disputed that if the directions of the by-law had been complied with the precautions prescribed would have afforded sufficient protection in the circumstances in which the fire arose.\nThe responsibility of the occupier of a building or other premises for damage caused by a fire lighted there and escaping was from the earliest times governed by a rigorous rule.\nThe law imposed (says Mr. Holdsworth, 3 Hist, of English Law at p. 309), a duty upon all householders to keep their fires from damaging their neighbours. Hence if a fire arose in a house by the act of any of the servants or guests, and damage was caused to the house of others, the owner was liable. He could only escape from liability if he could shew that the fire had originated from the act of a stranger. The phrase \"act of a stranger\" is explained by the language of the authority cited by Mr. Holdsworth, Y.B. 2 Hy. IV Pasch, pl. 6 :\nMes si home de hors ma meason encounter ma volunte boute la fewe en le straw de ma meason *** de ceo jeo ne serra pas tenus de responder a eux.\nA stranger is a person who is not one of my household either as guest or servant and who acts against my will. Act of God would no doubt also have been an answer. Tuberville v. Stamp[5], per Holt C.J. Indeed the law on this head might be considered an application to a special case of the principle which afterwards came to be recognized as the rule in Rylands v. Fletcher[6]. It is true that the old form of declaration ran quare negligenter custodivit ignem suum in clauso suo, but negligenter here does not mean negligently in the sense of modern law. The import of it was that the defendant has failed to observe his legal duty to prevent his fire escaping and damaging others. Lord Canterbury v. The Queen[7], per Lord Lyndhurst. The law was changed by the statute of Anne and again by the statute of 14 Geo. III, c. 27, sec. 86) which no doubt is in force in British Columbia, and by which it was provided :\nNo action, suit, or process whatever, shall be had, maintained or prosecuted against any person in whose house, chamber, stable, barn or other building, or on whose estate any fire shall *** accidentally begin.\nThere are points still unsettled as to the effect of this statute. It was held in Filliter v. Phippard[8], that a fire is not accidental within the statute if it begins through negligence and it may be taken to be the law that fires intentionally lighted and fires arising through negligence are outside the statute and that responsibility in respect of them is governed by the common law. On principle, since the statute creates an exception to the general rule, the onus ought to be upon the defendant alleging that the statute applies to shew that the fire did accidentally begin; but the point is no doubt an arguable one with the weight of dicta probably in favour of an answer in the opposite sense, \u2014the view accepted by Macdonald C.J., in this case. It is not necessary I think to pass upon the point for the purposes of this appeal. Again the judgments of the Lords Justices in the recent case of Mosgrave v. Pandelis[9], suggest some interesting questions; whether, for example, a fire which originated in a coal or cinder escaping from a domestic stove is, for the purpose of applying the statute, to be treated as beginning with the lighting of the fire in the stove or with the fire kindled through the agency of the escaping fragment. The effect of the statute as constructed by Filliter v. Phippard[10] is to impose upon the occupier of premises in which a fire is lighted at the very lowest the duty to take all reasonable precautions to prevent the fire getting beyond his own premises and doing injury to others; and an obligation to take reasonable precautions in dealing with such a dangerous element as fire is an obligation to take special care, Ellerman v. Grayson[11]. The dictum of Atkin L.J. was expressly approved in the House of Lords by the Lord Chancellor as well as by Lords Finlay and Parmoor. To express this concretely in its application to the case before us the appellant municipality owed (at least) an obligation to its neighbours to take special care that the fire lighted by its servant in the stove should not, through the emission of cinders or otherwise, cause a fire to start in some unprotected part of the building which might spread beyond the premises and expose the neighbouring property to the risk of injury. If the view of Sir Henry Duke expressed in Mosgrave v. Pandelis[12] be the correct view the obligation was higher than this; it was an obligation to compensate a person suffering damage as the result of the escape of a fire intentionally lighted by their servant in the stove.\nThe jury having found that the fire originated through the escape of burning material from the stove and it being undisputed that the injurious consequences of the escape of such material would probably have been avoided if the precautions prescribed by the by-law had been observed, it is doubtful indeed whether a verdict in favour of the municipality by the jury could, given these premises, have been sustained as a reasonable finding. The municipality by its council had in execution of statutory powers imposed the duty upon the owners of buildings to take the prescribed precautions. In so doing they had formally declared not only that these precautions ought reasonably to be expected from owners but that the considerations in favour of the adoption of them were so cogent and so obvious as to justify the council calling into play its legal authority in order to make the observance of them legally obligatory. I am unable to understand by what process the conclusion could be arrived at that the municipality taking neither these precautions nor any other precaution in substitution for them was taking all reasonable means to prevent harm by the escape of the fires it had authorized.\nIt seems at least to be beyond dispute that when the learned trial judge told the jury that prima facie the failure to observe the precautions laid down by the by-law was negligence he was giving a direction of which the municipality had no ground to complain.\nThese considerations afford also a complete answer to the objection that the learned trial judge misdirected the jury in telling them, as it may be conceded for the purpose of discussion he did, that the onus was on the municipality to acquit itself of the responsibility for the fire. I must observe in passing and I think it is quite clear that the learned trial judge stated in effect to the jury that they must first satisfy themselves that the fire originated on the appellant's premises. Assuming that to be found against the municipality, a finding involving, of course, the conclusion that the fire was caused by the escape of burning matter from the stove, the learned trial judge would have been quite right in directing the jury on any theory of the law that on the admitted facts (the existence of the by-law and the absence of the precautions prescribed by the by-law) the onus was on the municipality to acquit itself of responsibility; and even assuming on this point that the charge is open to some criticism textually it is impossible, I think, to assail the substance of it successfully.\nMr. Farris in his able argument dwelt upon the part played by McKinley, the fire chief, and argued that the jury should have been directed that the municipality was not responsible for anything resulting from what McKin- ley did in making the pipe less safe when the change of stoves occurred. I think the trial judge was right in refusing to give that direction. The responsibility of the municipality was as occupier of the fire hall. It was admitted that as regards the room in which the stove was McKinley was in occupation of it as the servant of the municipality as \"fire chief.\"\nThat the premises should be sufficiently heated to make them habitable was a necessary incident of McKinley's occupation. The municipality was indisputably responsible in fact as well as in law for the setting up in the first place of a stove with metal pipes. It would be within the normal scope of McKinley's duty as servant of the municipality to permit the use of the stove for the purpose of heating the apartment. It would be within the normal scope of his duties as \" fire chief \" to take notice of anything calculated to make the use of the stove for heating purposes a source of danger to the building or the contents of the building; if he had observed, for example, that sections of the pipe had become disconnected in such a way as to constitute a manifest danger when the fire was lighted; so when the first stove was replaced by the second if the manipulation of the pipe created a danger or was likely to create a danger, then it was his duty as caretaker to see to it that the stove was not thereafter used until the defect was remedied. This was his duty and his knowledge of what was done when the pipes were changed was the knowledge of the municipality because his occupation was their occupation. McKinley's negligence therefore in permitting the stove to be used after the change was made was the negligence of the municipality.\nOn the assumption that the relevant fire is the fire that started in the attic, the question was this, was this fire ignited by matter escaping from the stove through the negligence of the municipality, that is to say, through the negligence of somebody for whom the municipality is responsible? Now the fire was put in the stove by or by permission of the servant of the municipality who was occupying the premises for the municipality who was aware of the ex hypothesi negligent setting up of the pipes which had taken place some time before. As between the municipal- ity and the caretaker, the caretaker was no doubt guilty of a grave dereliction of duty on this hypothesis in lighting a fire in circumstances which exposed the building to the risk of being burned but he was nevertheless about the municipality's business and for the negligent conduct of that business it is responsible.\nThe old authorities lay down in general terms that the occupier of a house is responsible for fires set by his guests and by his servants. For example, in the authority cited above from Mr. Holdsworth's book, vol. III, it is stated at p. 309 :\nSi mon servant ou mon hosteller mette un chandel en un pariet, et le chandel eschiet en le straw, et arde tout ma meason et le meason de mon vicine auxi, en cest case jeo respondra al mon vicine del damage que il ad, quod concedebatur per curiam.\nAnd in Crogate v. Morris[13], it is said:\nIf my friend come and lie in my house and set my neighbour's house on fire the action lieth against me.\nOn the other hand it has been laid down that the occupier is not responsible for the fire brought about by the act of a servant who is doing something entirely outside his employment, McKenzie v. McLeod[14] ; the theory apparently being that the act of the servant in such circumstances is the act of a \" stranger.\"\nBut here we have a servant who admittedly as servant occupies for his master and whose occupation is therefore his occupation and who moreover as incidental to his occupation has his master's authority to light fires. An interesting case having a general similarity to the present came before the High Court of Australia a year or two ago. Bugge v. Brown[15]. The defendant who was the owner of grazing land employed a servant who was entitled as part of his remuneration to be supplied with cooked meat. On one occasion the servant was supplied with raw meat with instructions to cook it at a certain house. Notwithstanding his instructions he lighted a fire in the open and by his negligence it escaped and damaged the plaintiff's land. It was held that the defendant was responsible on the principle that where the act done is one of a class of acts which in given circumstances would be part of or incidental to the servant's duty the master is responsible unless the servant so acts as to make him a stranger in relation to his master with respect to the act he has committed so that what he does is the unauthorized act of a stranger. The same principle was applied in Black v. Christ Church[16]. The present case presents even less difficulty because of the admission that McKinley's occupation was the occupation of the municipality.\nWhat I have said is sufficient to dispose of the grounds upon which the appeal is based and I do not refer to the other questions discussed on the argument.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nANGLIN J.\u2014I concur with my brother Duff.\nBRODEUR J.\u2014I concur with my brother Duff.\nMIGNAULT J. (dissenting).\u2014There are three cases here which were tried together and consolidated for the purposes of this appeal.\nThe appellant obtained from the Court of Appeal of British Columbia special leave to appeal per saltum, under section 37 of The Supreme Court Act (Canada), from three judgments of Mr. Justice Morrison giving effect to a general verdict of a jury in favour of the respondents in three actions claiming damages for the destruction of their buildings and furniture by a fire which started on the appellant's property.\nThe trial before Mr. Justice Morrison was the second trial of the respondents' actions. A first trial had taken place before Mr. Justice Murphy and a jury, and the verdict being in favour of the present appellant, judgment was rendered accordingly. The present respondents appealed from these judgments to the Court of Appeal on the ground of misdirection to the jury by the trial judge and also on the ground that the verdict was against the weight of evidence, and they succeeded in their appeals. The judgment of the court was rendered by Mr. Justice McPhillips, with whom Mr. Justice Eberts concurred, the Chief Justice dissenting. In his reasons for judgment, Mr. Justice McPhillips found error in the direction given to the jury in that the jury were told that the onus of proving negligence was on the plaintiffs and not on the defendant in whose building the fire originated, and against whom therefore there was established a prima facie case of negligence. Mr. Justice McPhillips further expressed the opinion that in not constructing its chimney in the manner required by its by-law, the defendant committed a breach of a statutory condition which imported negligence, and that the trial judge erred on this point in his charge to the jury. He also said that the defendant was liable for the condition of the building and for the acts of its servant, McKinley, in whose premises the fire originated. The conclusion of Mr. Justice McPhillips was that the learned trial judge had misdirected the jury, but that at all events the verdict of the jury was against the weight of evidence and perverse, and he ordered a new trial.\nNo appeal was taken from the judgment of the Court of Appeal, but a new trial took place and the learned trial judge (Mr. Justice Morrison) charged the jury in substantial compliance with the judgment of the Court of Appeal as rendered by Mr. Justice McPhillips, possibly adding thereto when he told the jury that where a thing is shewn to be under the management, control or custody of the defendant or its servants, and the accident is such as in the ordinary course of things does not happen if those who have the management use proper care, it affords reasonable evidence, in the absence of explanation by the defendant, that the event arose from want of care on the part of the defendant (see Scott v. London and St. Katherine Docks Co.[17].\nThe verdict this time having been against the present appellant, the latter now appeals by leave directly to this court and the grounds of its appeal are solely that the learned trial judge misdirected the jury. The direction here in question having been given to the jury in substantial compliance with the judgment of the Court of Appeal, this appeal really questions the soundness of the latter judgment from which the appellant did not appeal. The question now is whether it should be allowed to do so.\nThe respondent objects that there is res judicata against the appellant; that the direction given to the jury in the second trial was the proper direction; or at least that the appellant having acquiesced in the judgment of the Court of Appeal and taken the chances of a new trial cannot now complain that the jury were charged in compliance with that judgment.\nI do not think that the doctrine of res judicata applies here. What was decided was that the first judge misdirected the jury and the first trial was set aside. A second trial took place and the second judge charged the jury substantially as the Court of Appeal decided the first judge should have done. The appellant now claims that the second judge misdirected the jury. Nothing was determined, unless it could be said to have been determined in advance, with respect to the correctness and legality of the charge to the jury in the second trial, but at the most there was an expression of opinion as to the proper direction to give the jury in a case such as that disclosed by the evidence adduced in the first trial. This does not therefore bring the matter within the rule of res judicata.\nThe objection of acquiescence by the appellant, or, more properly expressed, the objection that the appellant is now estopped from contending that directions given to the jury in substantial compliance with the judgment of the Court of Appeal, are misdirections in law, \u2014is certainly a much stronger one. I have carefully looked at the cases, but have failed to find any case where a judgment ordering a new trial was held to estop a party from afterwards contending in the new trial that the jury should not be charged as the appellate court held that the first judge should have charged them. It may however be noted that Halsbury (Laws of England) vol. 13 vo. Estoppel, no. 463, says:\nProvided a matter in issue is determined with certainty by the judgment, an estoppel may arise where a plea of res judicata could never be established *** A party is precluded from contending the contrary of any precise point which, having been once distinctly put in issue, has been solemnly found against him. But none of the decisions referred to in the notes were in connection with new trials. There are however two decisions of this court in which a somewhat similar question arose in reference to the effect of an order for a new trial.\nIn Western Canada Power Co. v. Bergklint[18], Mr. Justice Duff, at p. 299, said:\u2014\nThere is some authority indicating that where a court of appeal in granting a new trial decides a substantive question in the litigation, that question, for the purposes of that litigation, is to be taken to have been conclusively determined as between the parties. I refer without further discussion to the observations of Lord Macnaghten in Badar Bee v. Habib Merican Noordin[19], and to their Lordships' decision in Ram Kirpal Shukul v. Mussumat Rup Kuari[20], (see especially p. 41 as to the effect of determinations in interlocutory judgments upon the rights of parties in the suits in which the judgments are given). It seems quite clear that for this purpose we are not confined to the formal judgment Kali Krishna Tagore v. Secretary of State for India[21], and Petherpermal Chetty v. Mumandi Servai[22] .\nI have carefully examined the cases cited by my learned brother but in none of them had a new trial been granted, the question being as to the effect of a former judgment in proceedings between the same parties.\nBut in Kinney v. Fisher[23] a new trial of a libel action had been ordered and all the judges of the appellate court had expressed the opinion that the letter containing the alleged libel was written on a privileged occasion. The head-note of the report of the decision of the appellate court[24] is misleading, for it assumes that the action was dismissed. The report itself shows however that the court was evenly divided, as to the dismissal of the action, and in the result, which the report does not mention, a new trial was ordered. At the new trial the action was dismissed at the close of the plaintiff's case and on a second appeal the appellate court, again expressing the opinion that the occasion was privileged, sent the case back for retrial on the issue of malice. The defendant then appealed to this court, but his appeal was dismissed by a majority on the ground that as the first order for a new trial was without restriction and the evidence given on the former trial was not before the court, there was no res judicata on the question of privilege. Mr. Justice Duff dissented from the judgment in this court, relying on the opinion he had expressed in the Bergklint Case[25].\nKinney v. Fisher[26] would seem therefore to support the argument that no question of res judicata can arise here, nor would it leave room for the contention that independently of res judicata there is ground for estoppel, for the order for the new trial, in this case as in Kinney v. Fisher[27], was made without restriction. It is proper to add that here the new trial was ordered not merely because, in the opinion of the appellate court, the trial judge had misdirected the jury, but because it was considered that the verdict was against the weight of evidence. It would have been, to say the least, very unlikely that this court would have set aside an order for a new trial under these circumstances, (Cameron's Practice and cases cited, vol. 1, p. 197 et seq.), and the failure of the defendant to appeal from the judgment of the court of appeal does not necessarily shew that it acquiesced in all the reasons for which a new trial was ordered.\nComing now to the merits of the present appeal, which is brought here solely on the ground of misdirection by the learned trial judge, the appellant, in its factum, particularizes the alleged misdirections as follows:\n1. In directing the jury that there was a presumption of negligence against the defendant if the jury found that the fire originated on its premises.\n2. In directing the jury that \"where the thing is shown to be under the management, control or custody of the defendant or its servants *** and the accident or incident is such as in the ordinary course of things does not happen if those who have the management use proper care it affords reasonable evidence in the absence of explanation by the defendant that the event arose from want of care on the part of the defendant.\"\n3. In directing the jury in effect that this presumption could only be rebutted by showing it was \"pure accident,\" namely, that it was due to \"some extraneous circumstance or condition over which the agent or servant or employee of the municipality had no control.\"\n4. In directing the jury that the municipality was liable for the acts of its servant (the chief of police) in changing the stoves. 5. In directing the jury that the breach of the building by-law was the breach of a statutory duty prima facie giving a right of action to the person injured.\nI will deal with each of these alleged misdirections in the order mentioned.\n1.Consideration of the first point raises the important question of the liability of a person for damage caused by a fire which originates on his premises.\nA short but authoritative statement of the law, before it was changed by statute, may be found in the judgment of Lord Tenterden C.J., in Becquet v. MacCarthy[28] :\nBy the law of this country before it was altered by the statute 6 Anne c. 31, s. 6, if a fire began on a man's own premises, by which those of his neighbour were injured, the latter, in an action brought for such an injury, would be bound in the first instance to shew how the fire began, but the presumption would be (unless it were shewn to have originated from some external cause) that it arose from the neglect of some person in the house.\nThe change made by statute (see 14 Geo. III, ch. 78, sect. 86) was as follows:\n86. No action, suit or process whatever shall be had, maintained, or prosecuted against any person in whose house, chamber, stable, barn or other building, or on whose estate any fire shall *** accidentally begin, nor shall any recompense be made by such person, for any damage suffered thereby, any law, usage or custom to the contrary notwithstanding.\nThe object of the statute is to relieve a person from liability when the fire begins accidentally, and it is of the nature of an exception to the general rule of liability. It would seem to follow that the onus of shewing that the fire did begin accidentally is on the person who claims the benefit of the statute in order to escape from the legal presumption of negligence. In other words, the statute affords a defence, and it is not for the plaintiff to shew, in the first instance, that the fire did not begin accidentally; he can rest on the presumption until the defendant has rebutted it by shewing that the fire began accidentally.\nI think therefore there was no misdirection as to the first point.\n2. The words which the appellant quotes from the learned judge's charge are taken from the judgment of Erle C.J., in Scott v. London & St. Katherine Dock Co.[29], and are generally considered as expressing the rule res ipsa loquitur. This rule admits of a presumption of negligence similar to the one just adverted to. Inasmuch as by law the person in whose premises a fire begins is liable for the damage it causes to neighbouring property unless he shews that it began accidentally, no prejudice could be caused by stating to the jury the rule in the terms of Scott v. London & St. Katherine Dock Co.[30], which is very largely to the same effect as the other rule. This ground of alleged misdirection therefore also fails.\n3. Taken with the context, I.do not think that the few words quoted by the appellant amount to misdirection. The learned judge correctly stated that there is a presumption of negligence against the person on whose premises a fire originates. He then added that it is for such person to show that the fire was accidental. The distinction between \" accident \" and \" pure accident \" is perhaps a difficult one for the jury's understanding. Nevertheless I do not consider that the jury were misled. The learned trial judge had previously told them that it was for the defendant to satisfy them that he was not, as charged by the plaintiff, negligent in the handling of that fire. Subject to what I will say on the question whether the defendant here is liable for the acts of McKinley who occupied the premises where the fire originated, I think this objection to the finding of the learned trial judge is not well taken.\n4. The fourth objection is that the learned trial judge misdirected the jury in telling them that the municipality, that is to say this defendant, was liable for the acts of its servant, McKinley, in changing the stoves.\nMcKinley was an employee of the appellant, being chief of police and fire chief. With his wife and child, he lived in rooms at the rear and on the second story of the fire hall, one of these rooms being the kitchen where the stove in question was installed. The free occupation of these rooms as a dwelling was granted by the appellant to McKinley probably as one of the considerations of his con- tract of employment, and this, I think, is the scope of the appellant's admission that as a servant of the appellant McKinley was in lawful occupation or possession of the room in which the said stove or range was situate, for the admission cannot mean that that as a servant of the appellant McKinley kept house for his wife and child in these rooms. The evidence justifies the conclusion that McKinley was in as full control of these rooms as he would have been had he rented a house from the appellant. The municipality had paid for the installation of the stove pipe, but the stove was furnished by McKinley, and the new stove or range put in during the preceding winter, which necessitated the shortening of the pipe, was paid for by McKinley, who had no authority from the appellant to effect this change. In respect to this point, there was a material difference between the two trials because an admission made in the first trial that the appellant had paid for the erection of the stove and pipe was withdrawn with the permission of the court in the second trial.\nIn my opinion, the relation of master and servant between the appellant and McKinley did not extend to, or engender liability for, acts performed by the latter in keeping house for himself and his family in his own dwelling, whether this dwelling was a part of the fire hall or a separate building belonging to the appellant. In other words, nothing he did in his own dwelling for the purposes of housekeeping was in the course of McKinley's employment as a servant of the appellant. I may add that in the decisions dealing with the legal presumption of negligence where a fire is communicated from a building in which it originates to another building belonging to a different owner, I have found no case where this presumption was asserted against the owner or lessor as distinguished from the occupier or tenant of such a building. It seems to me that the foundation of the presumption is occupation of the premises where the fire originates and if, as here, the owner does not occupy the building or part of building where the fire took place he would seem to be outside the rule. But it is probably sufficient to decide here that when McKinley installed or changed his stove and shortened the stove pipe, and when he lit the fire, he was not acting in the course of his employment as a servant of the appellant, and with respect, I think the learned trial judge should have so directed the jury. This objection, therefore, appears to me to be well taken.\n5. The learned trial judge directed the jury as a matter of law that the non-performance of the statutory duty imposed by the building by-law, causing injury to a member of the class for whose benefit the by-law was imposed, prima facie gives a right of action to the person injured. There might be no quarrel with an abstract proposition of this kind (Groves v. Wimborne[31], but the difficulty is .to determine whether the by-law, of which we have only three extracts, is a by-law of this character. In the absence of the whole by-law, and in view of what I have said as to the fourth objection of the appellant, I do not think it necessary to express any opinion with respect to the direction of the learned trial judge on this point.\nI have however reached the conclusion that there was material misdirection of the learned trial judge in instructing the jury that the appellant was, as McKinley's employer, responsible for the latter's act in changing the stove or stove pipe, and on that ground I think the verdict cannot stand.\nI would allow the appeal with costs and order a new trial.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: G.

A fiat had been granted by the Attorney-General under \"The Alberta Petition of Right Act, 1906, c. 20,\" but when the case came on for trial and before any evidence had been taken, the objection raised by counsel for the Crown that no action could lie for a tort was sustained, and the action was dismissed with costs. The Appellate Division reversed this judgment and ordered a new trial.\nEug. Lafleur K.C. and R. A. Smith for the appellant.\nS. R. Wallace and Louis Cote for the respondent.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE (dissenting).\u2014I concur with Mr. Justice Mignault and would allow the appeal\nIDINGTON J.\u2014I am of the opinion that subsection 2 of section 31 of the Public Utilities Act of Alberta, which reads as follows\nthe public utility shall be responsible for all unnecessary damage which it causes in carrying out, maintaining or operating any of its said works.\nmeans just what it says, and that it was intended to mean that, and to furnish a remedy for such like incidents as in question herein, when arising from want of due care and hence causing unnecessary damage.\nI do not see why a remedy for damages arising from want of due care in the operation of any public utility, should be something which appellant, in his wide sphere of activities in Alberta, should be advised against providing, or refused the consent of the Legislative Assembly therefor.\nI therefore assume the needed remedy was furnished in said language and its obviously legal effect, if to be given any, is that I have above suggested.\nSome effect is usually sought to be given the language used by the legislature, and I can see nothing more apt to apply such language to, when found in such relation as it is, than to furnish the needed remedy I suggest.\nI do not see any reason for disturbing the learned trial judge's findings of fact and, agreeing as I do with the reason- ing of Mr. Justice Stuart and Mr. Justice Beck as well as that of the learned trial judge presented respectively in the proceedings below, when finding, in said subsection 2 of section 31 above quoted, a remedy for what is complained of, I need not say more than I have done, except to add that I think this appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDUFF J.\u2014This appeal raises a question touching the effect of section 31 (2) of the Alberta Public Utilities Act:\nThe public utility shall be responsible for all unnecessary damage which it causes in carrying out, maintaining or operating any of its works.\nAssuming that \"public utility\" comprehends the province of Alberta (His Majesty the King in right of his province of Alberta) as owner of the Alberta Government Telephones, I can only say, with the greatest respect for other opinions, that this enactment does not (on that assumption) appear to me to be of doubtful meaning. \"Responsible\" in such a context in a statutory enactment can, I think, be no less comprehensive than \"responsible in damages.\" There is moreover ample evidence that the default through which the respondents suffered the damage complained of was a default in \"carrying out, maintaining or operating\" the telephone system.\nThat being so, it follows, I think\u2014still proceeding upon the same assumption that \"public utility\" comprehends the province in its character as owner of \"Government Telephones\"\u2014that petition of right is the appropriate procedure for asserting the Crown's responsibility. Normally petition of right does not lie for tort; but that rests upon the ground that in point of substantive law the Crown is not liable, that is to say, the Crown owes no duty to the sufferer to make reparation for the torts of its servants. Section 31 (2) creates the duty to make reparation with its correlative right; and ubi jus ibi remedium. One cannot conceive the legislature vainly creating an unenforceable right to recover damages. It is implied that the courts of the province have jurisdiction to enforce the right and to do so by the appropriate procedure. The law in such cases makes the necessary implications to avoid the injustice and the scandal of the denial of substantive rights because of technical defects in procedure. The objection that petition of right does not lie for the enforcement of statutory rights is without substance. The Petition of Rights Act gives jurisdiction to the court to award damages and I think that should be construed as extending to all cases in which a duty reposes upon the Crown by law to pay damages.\nThe critical question, therefore, is this: Does \"public utility\" in section 31, ss. 2, bear a sense which imposes upon the province\u2014the Crown in right of the province\u2014 the responsibility established as against such bodies generally by the subsection? And this is the point upon which naturally Mr. Lafleur directed the weight of his argument. The question subdivides itself into two branches.\nThe first, is whether \"public utility\" in this context and construed with reference to the interpretation section (section 2, s.s. b) does, upon a fair interpretation of these provisions, denote among other \"corporations, firms and persons\" to which it applies, the province of Alberta in its character of owner of the \"Alberta Government Telephones\"; and the second branch of the question is whether, assuming that to be so, there is here in this provision, when it is read in light of the Act as a whole, a clear and plain manifestation of legislative intent to impose such a responsibility upon the Crown.\nThese points may be considered in the order in which I have stated them. Subsection (b) of section 2 must be quoted in full. These are the words:\u2014\n(b) The expression \"public utility\" means and includes every corporation other than municipal corporations (unless such municipal corporation voluntarily comes under this Act in the manner hereinafter provided), and every firm, person or association of persons, the business and operations whereof are subject to the legislative authority of this province, their lessees, trustees, liquidators, or receivers, appointed by any court that now or hereafter own, operate, manage or control any system, works, plant or equipment for the conveyance of telegraph or telephone messages or for the conveyance of travellers or goods over a railway, street railway or tramway, or for the production, transmission, delivery or furnishing of water, gas, heat, light, or power, either directly or indirectly, to or from the public; also the Alberta Government telephones, now managed and operated by the Department of Railways and Telephones.\nThe last clause is due to an enactment of 1917 (section 30 of c. 3 of the statutes of that year). This enactment simply added the words also the Alberta Government Telephones now managed and operated by the Department of Railways and Telephones.\nBy a statute of 1906 (the general Interpretation Act) \"Alberta Government\" means, generally speaking, His Majesty in right of the province of Alberta, and the phrase \"the Alberta Government Telephones\" is virtually the equivalent of \"the Telephones of His Majesty in right of the province.\" The only admissible view, I think, of the effect of this enactment of 1917 is that the Provincial Government Telephone System is added as a concrete addition to the \"systems, works, plants, equipments,\" comprised in the general description immediately preceding. I think that is the correct reading of the enactment because the only alternative reading is to treat the enactment as directing the construction of the phrase \"public utility\" wherever it appears in the Act, in such a manner as to include \"the Alberta Government Telephones\" as a \"public utility.\" This alternative is forbidden, I think, because as regards a considerable number of the most important provisions of the statute, the effect of such a substitution would be to make nonsense of the provision unless we are to treat the amending enactment as conferring upon the Government system legal personality, an implication which I think would not be justified. Section 20, for example, which defines the jurisdiction of the board uses \"Public Utility\" in subsections b, c, d, e, f, and g, in a sense necessarily implying in the object denoted by the phrase, a legal entity, capable of acting juridically, capable of being a party to legal proceedings, a party to contracts, and generally of ownership of property and of being the subject of rights and duties. If the Province as owner of a telephone system falls within the operation of these clauses as a \"public utility\" then no difficulty arises in respect of the application of them. On the other hand, if it is the system as a system which is brought by the amendment within the class denoted by \"public utility\" the alternatives are obvious. Either the system has been endowed with legal personality in which case the language of the clauses would be sensible with reference to the system or, on the other hand, the system is entirely excluded from the operation of them. To give to the enactment of 1917 such a construction as to exclude \"the Government telephones\" from these provisions of the Act, would be to render the enactment of 1917 largely nugatory and the courts will go very far in supplying omissions in elliptical phraseology and in discarding redundancies in order to avoid such a result. Salmon v. Duncombe[2].\nThe other alternative, the alternative of implying the creation of a legal personality must, as I have already said, also be rejected.\nIf the enactment is read in the manner which I have suggested the \"corporations, persons and firms\" comprehended within the class \"public utility\" are, by this reading, made to include the corporations or persons owning or operating \"the Government telephones,\" and the words \"Alberta Government\" having by statute the significance above pointed out, no technical or other difficulty arises in reading the word corporation or the word person as including His Majesty in right of the Province. The Crown is technically a corporation sole, and is of course in the legal sense a person capable of being a subject of rights and duties.\nThere is some ineptitude in the phrasing of the amendment of 1917, but for the reasons I have mentioned the reading is, I think, amply justified.\nI come now to the question upon which the appeal really turns. Looking at the provisions of the statute as a whole, is an intention manifested with sufficient clearness to bring the Provincial Government within the scope of s.s. 2 of section 31 to satisfy the rule of construction, a rule based upon good sense and upon inveterate legislative practice as well as judicial authority, that responsibility is not to be deemed to be imposed upon the Crown by legislative enactment, unless the intention to do so has been expressed in language which is unmistakable? I quite agree that even though the argument on the exegetical side were more rigorous than it is, still if from the purview of the statute as a whole, sufficient evidence of a contrary intention appeared to create a real doubt as to the effect of the section when read in light of the other parts of the Act, the answer to the question just propounded must be in the negative. The question is one by no means free from difficulty. Mr. Lafleur did, I think, make good his point that there are many provisions of the statute, and in particular those relating to the enforcement of orders of the board for the payment of money and those relating to penalties which obviously could not be put into operation against the Crown.\nThis is a circumstance of weight which, however, is not conclusive. The definitions of the interpretation clause are not applied when such application produces inconsistency or absurdity and in the sections referred to such would be the result of the literal application of the definition of public utility in its entirety. No such difficulty, arises respecting section 31 (2). There is nothing absurd or even startling in bringing the Crown in its character of owner of such enterprises within the scope of such a provision.\nAt this point s.s. (a) of section 3 becomes very significant. The Act is thereby declared to be applicable to\"public utilities\" as defined\nwhich are now or may hereafter be owned or operated by or under the control of the Government of the province.\nA statutory corporation, therefore, consisting of members nominated by the Government, or a joint stock corporation controlled by the Government through ownership of its shares, if answering the definition of \"public utility\" is not to be excluded from the provisions of the Act, and I can see no reason why, in such a case, the provisions of the Act generally (including section 31, subsection 2) should be held not to be operative. This is evidence, I think, that the scheme of the Act proceeds upon the policy that \"public utilities\" fairly coming within the description furnished by the interpretation section are, except where the context or the subject matter of the provision otherwise requires, to be subject to each of the provisions of the Act. This again throws light upon the enactment of 1917, and I think the proper inference is that the Government telephones were brought within the orbit of the system established and that the provisions of the Act must be held to be operative in relation to the Government telephones and to the Crown as owner of them according to the natural meaning of the words in which they are framed with the exception of those provisions in which some absurdity or inconsistency would thereby be produced.\nThe appeal should be dismissed.\nANGLIN J.\u2014For the reasons stated by Mr. Justice Stuart in his opinion of the 22nd June, 1922, I am satisfied that the finding of the trial court that the injury sustained by the plaintiff was due to negligence in the maintaining and operating of the Government telephone lines cannot be disturbed. There appears also to have been a breach of the duty imposed by section 31 (c) of the Public Utilities Act (1915, c. 6), which prescribes that\nall poles shall be as nearly as possible straight and perpendicular.\nA consequence of such negligence and breach of statutory duty was an undue interference with the public right of travel in contravention of section 31 (a), resulting in the injury of which the plaintiff complains.\nIn my opinion, the damage suffered by the plaintiff was \"unnecessary damage\" caused in maintaining and operating a work which would have entailed responsibility under section 31 (2) of the Public Utilities Act on the public utility controlling it, if a private person, firm or body corporate. I cannot accede to the view that the application of section 31 (2) is confined to cases in which there has been an exercise of statutory powers in excess of what is reasonably necessary for the accomplishment of the purpose for which they are conferred. I see no reason for so restricting the operation of that provision. Though not required to fix any other \"public utility\" with responsibility for injuries caused by negligence, it is necessary for that purpose in the case of Government telephones, and, for the reasons indicated by Mr. Justice Beck, I think it should be so applied. Where telephone wires of a public utility fall because of negligence either in maintaining or replacing, or in failure to replace in due season the poles which carry them, or because of a breach of clause (c) of subsection 1 of section 31, and as a result injury is caused to persons using a highway, we have a case of damage caused in the maintaining or operating of the works of the telephone system and, in my opinion, the fact that the falling of the wires and allowing them to interfere with traffic on a highway was due to negligence or to breach of a statutory duty necessarily implies that the damage thereby caused was \"unnecessary.\" If the application of subsection 2 should be confined to cases of damage caused by a breach of one of the clauses of subsection 1 of section 31, such a case is here presented. There was a breach of clause (c) which at least contributed to the fall of the pole and the consequent presence of wires on the highway in contravention of clause (a).\nThe wording of the concluding clause of the definition of \"public utility\" (s. 2 (b))\nalso the Alberta Government telephones now managed by the Department of Railways and Telephones\nis no doubt awkward and unsatisfactory. But a perusal of the Public Utilities Act makes it reasonably certain that the effect given to those words by Mr. Justice Stuart in his opinion of the 22nd of February, 1922, as meaning not telephones operated by the Government, but the Alberta Government itself and therefore\" H.M. The King in his right as exercised by the province of Alberta,\" must be what the legislature meant them to have. It was never intended, for instance, to create a liability in rem in the case of the Government Telephone System (s. 31 (2) ). Sections 20 (c) and 40 further indicate the difficulties that would ensue from a strict construction of the concluding clause of the definition such as the appellant contends for. Moreover upon that construction s. 3 (a) would seem to be quite superfluous. Applying s.s. 7 of s. 7 of the Interpretation Act (c. 3 of 1906) as we should, we have in s. 31 (2) of the Public Utilities Act an enactment that \"H.M. The King acting for the Province\" of Alberta shall be responsible (i.e. answerable to a person injured whether in body or in property) for damage caused by the negligent carrying out, maintaining or operating of (inter alia) the Alberta Government telephones in my opinion sufficient to overcome the prerogative exemption of the Crown from liability for torts of its servants recognized at common law. In the Alberta Petition of Right Act we find provisions which, though probably not designed to confer a right to recover from the Crown in respect of torts, are quite wide enough to furnish a procedure by which such a right, when otherwise created, may be exercised. As Mr. Justice Beck points out we have in the Privy Council decisions in Attorney General of the Straits Settlement v. Wemyss[3], and Farnell v. Bowman[4], the highest authority for the utilization of the procedure by petition of right to obtain relief to which the Public Utilities Act confers the right.\nI find it unnecessary to express any opinion upon the question whether a consequence of the Dominion or a Provincial Government engaging in a commercial enterprise is a pro tanto abrogation of the prerogative exemption from responsibility for tort: The Queen v. McLeod[5]; Farnell v. Bowman (2); Attorney General of Straits Settlements v. Wemyss (1). The Crown, when empowered by statute to enter upon an undertaking, does so subject to the limitations, restrictions and conditions which the legislature has imposed upon the carrying of it out. Attorney General v. De Keyser's Royal Hotel[6].\nThe appeal in my opinion fails.\nBRODEUR J.\u2014The respondent Zornes has presented a petition of right claiming that he has suffered damages on account of the negligent construction and operation of the telephone system owned by the Alberta Government.\nThe latter denies liability on the ground that the King could not be sued in tort.\nThat is the issue which is now submitted to our consideration.\nAs a general proposition, there is no remedy against the King for compensation in damages; but they can be obtained from the officer who did the wrong. Canterbury v. Attorney General[7].\nBut in many countries and provinces the governments are in the habit of undertaking works which are usually performed by private individuals and companies; and it is then found expedient to provide remedies for injuries suffered in the course of these works. Attorney General of Straits Settlement v. Wemyss[8].\nThe telephone system in Alberta was operated for some years by a private company. But the legislature decided to acquire this telephone system and to have it operated by the government; and it was put under the management of the Department of Railways and Telephones.\nIn 1915 the Public Utilities Act was passed and a board of Public Utility Commissioners was created; and it was declared that the Alberta Government telephones would be considered as a \"public utility.\"\nSection 31 of the Act provided that any public utility having for its object the construction, working and maintaining of the telephone lines should be submitted to the orders of the Commission and should not interfere with the public right of travel, that the wires should not be less than 16 feet above any highway; that all the poles should be as nearly as possible straight and perpendicular; and an article was added as subsection 2:\nThe public utility shall be responsible for all unnecessary damage which it causes in carrying out, maintaining or operating any of the said works.\nIt is alleged in the petition of right and found in the verdict rendered after trial that the Alberta Government telephone has been the cause of damage to the respondent on account of a defective wire which broke and became loose on the road, and that there were telephone poles down on the road which had caused the accident in question.\nTaking into consideration the general proposition which I have enunciated above concerning the liability of the Crown for tort, I am of the view that the provisions of The Public Utilities Act, and mainly of s. 31, create a liability affecting the Government and rendering the latter responsible for the torts which it caused in the carrying out of its telephone system. If some governments want to undertake works which are not considered of a governmental purpose, it is no wonder that the legislature should apply to those governments the same liability which is applied to private individuals or companies carrying on the same works. It is clear to me that the legislature of Alberta has imposed upon the government the liability for damages which is now claimed by the respondent.\nFor those reasons the appeal fails and should be dismissed with costs.\nMIGNAULT J. (dissenting).\u2014All of the judges of the court below were of the opinion that the claim of the respondent against the Crown, being of the nature of an action in tort, could not be justified under the provisions of the Alberta Petition of Right Act (c. 20 of the statutes of 1906). In this I agree. The Petition of Right Act provides a remedy where liability of the Crown exists by law and creates no new responsibility. There being no liability of the Crown for a tort committed by its servants, and the latter alone being responsible for the consequent damages, such a tort confers no right of action which can be asserted against the Crown by means of this remedy.\nThe majority of the appellate court however considered that the Alberta Public Utilities Act (c. 6 of the statutes of 1915) created a liability which could be invoked against the Crown by petition of right. With this conclusion I find myself unable to agree.\nIt is of course a fundamental principle of law that the Crown is not bound by a statute unless it be specially mentioned therein. (Beal, Legal Interpretation, 2nd ed., p. 292). And in Alberta the statute of which the object is to give to the subject a right of action against the Crown by petition of right, does not include the right to sue the Crown in tort, and it thus differs from the Exchequer Court Act, sec. 20, which expressly confers on the Exchequer Court jurisdiction to hear and determine, among other matters, every claim against the Crown arising out of any death or injury to the person or to property resulting from the negligence of any officer or servant of the Crown while acting within the scope of his duties or employment upon any public work. It would therefore seem surprising, may I say so with all possible deference, that the right of an action ex delicto against the Crown, which the Petition of Right Act does not confer, should be found in another statute the object of which is certainly not to enlarge the remedies of the subject against the Crown. I will therefore very carefully examine this statute in order to see whether it is open to the construction which has been placed upon it.\nThe Alberta Public Utilities Act is a type of statute which is derived, I believe, from the United States, but which has been widely adopted in the different provinces of Canada. Its object is to deal with certain public services in which the community at large has a great interest, such as transportation, telegraph or telephone lines, and the furnishing of water, heat, light or power. The statute defines the words \"public utility\"\u2014I abbreviate\u2014as meaning and including corporations, firms, persons or associations of persons that own, operate or control any system or works for the conveyance of telegraph or telephone messages, or for the conveyance of travellers or goods over a railway, street railway or tramway, or for the production or furnishing of water, gas, heat, light or power to or for the public. The statute creates a board known as the Board of Public Utility Commissioners, which has jurisdiction over these public services or public utilities, the powers of which utilities are carefully restricted, the whole for the better protection of the public. It would certainly seem most unlikely that in such a statute should be found any interference with, or modification of, the constitutional principle that the King can do no wrong.\nBut in Alberta, as well as in some of the other provinces, the provincial government has undertaken to carry on some of the public services to which I have referred. In 1908 a statute (c. 14) was passed by the Alberta Legislature empowering the Government to purchase, lease, construct and operate telephone or telegraph systems, and we are informed that under this authority the Government took over the Bell long distance telephone line, so that, outside some municipal or local lines, the telephone service of the province is practically controlled and carried on by the Government.\nSo when the Public Utilities Act was adopted in 1915 the definition of \"public utility\" in section 2 was made to include\nalso the Alberta Government telephones now managed and operated by the Department of Railways and Telephones. And the argument is that inasmuch as by subsection 7 of section 7 of the Interpretation Act (Alberta) c. 3 of the statutes of 1906 the expression \"Government,\" \"government of the province\" or \"Alberta Government\" used in any Act whenever enacted means His Majesty the King acting for the province, the words I have quoted from the definition of \"public utility\" must be read as if the definition said \"also His Majesty's telephones in Alberta now managed and operated by the Department of Railways and Telephones.\"\nIt is sometimes fallacious to rely too strongly and without sufficient discrimination on a statutory definition for, as is expressly stated in section 2, such a definition does not apply where the context otherwise requires. And when this Public Utilities Act is carefully read, it becomes obvious that in many of its sections the expression \"public utility\" cannot be construed as meaning the Alberta Government telephones, or His Majesty's telephones in Alberta. I could give a number of instances, but will mention only a few. Thus sections 33 and 75 refer to municipal corporations owning or operating any public utility within the meaning of this Act. This obviously cannot mean the government telephone system. Sections 51 and following deal with orders made by the Board of Public Utility Commissioners, which may be orders for the payment of money to be levied by the sheriff, and which when registered shall constitute a lien and charge upon the lands of the party ordered to pay. This clearly seems inapplicable to government property. Moreover penalties are provided by sections 80 and following against persons and public utilities affected by orders of the board, and it can scarcely have been contemplated that these penalties could be levied from the Crown by reason of anything contained in the definition of \"public utility\" in the Act.\nWe now come to section 31 by which it is claimed that the Crown's liability to answer for the torts of its servants has been expressly enacted by the legislature. I will quote the whole section down to and including subsection 2.\nIn the case of a public utility which has for its object the construction, working or maintaining of telegraph, telephone or transmission lines, or the delivery or sale of water, gas, heat, light or power, the following conditions shall be fulfilled, over and above those which may be prescribed by the board, that is to say:\u2014\n(a) The public utility shall not interfere with the public right of travel, or in any way obstruct the entrance to any door or gateway or free access to any building;'\n(b) The public utility shall not permit any wire to be less than sixteen feet above such highway or public place, or erect more than one line of poles along any highway;\n(c) All poles shall be as nearly as possible straight and perpendicular;\n(d) The public utility shall not unnecessarily cut down or mutilate any shade, fruit or ornamental tree;\n(e) The opening up of any street, square or other public place, for the erection of poles, or for the carrying of wires underground, shall be subject to the supervision of such person as the municipal council may appoint, and such street, square or other public place, shall, without unnecessary delay, be restored as far as possible to its former condition;\n(f) If, in the exercise of the public right of travel, it is necessary that the said wires or poles be temporarily removed by cutting or otherwise, the public utility shall, at its own expense, upon reasonable notice in writing from any person requiring it, remove such wires and poles; and in default of the public utility so doing such person may remove such wires and poles at the expense of the public utility.\n(2) The public utility shall be responsible for all unnecessary damage which it causes in carrying out, maintaining or operating any of its said works.\nThis section is in the part of the statute bearing the title \"Restriction on powers of public utilities.\" Subsection 2 assumes that in carrying out, maintaining and operating any of its works the public utility may cause some damage or inconvenience, and its responsibility only begins when the damage caused is \"unnecessary,\" that is to say in excess of any damage which may be incident to the carrying out or operation of the work. In so far as public utilities generally are concerned, no such provision is required to render them liable for their torts, or for the negligent exercise of their statutory powers. These powers are not charters to commit torts, and so, even in the absence of the subsection, there is no doubt that under the common law the plaintiff, in a case like this one, would have an action against the public utility which the latter could not defeat by pleading the statute.\nThe question, however, is whether he has such an action against the Crown when it operates a public utility, and whether subsection 2 of section 31 takes away the King's prerogative of not being liable for the torts of his servants. Bearing in mind that the prerogatives and rights of the Crown are not affected by a statute unless they are specially mentioned therein, I would not be disposed to give to s.s. 2\u2014even considering the Alberta Government Telephones as comprised in the meaning of the term \"public utility\"\u2014the effect of conferring a right of action ex delicto against the Crown, the more so as this subsection in no way refers to claims against the Crown, but merely, and probably unnecessarily, makes public utilities generally responsible for unnecessary damage caused by their operations. This distinguishes this case from the decisions of the Judicial Committee in Farnell v. Bowman[9], and Attorney General of the Straits Settlement v. Wemyss[10], where a statute dealing expressly with claims against the Crown was construed as giving a right of action in tort.\nIt is suggested that when the Crown undertakes a commercial enterprise it should be subject to the same liability as private individuals. This, however, is a matter of policy for the consideration of the legislature, for, without appropriate legislation, the court is powerless to interfere. In the court below it was considered that sec. 31 gave a right of action in tort against the Crown, for the learned judges recognized that there must be apt legislation to permit of such action. With regret, for the respondent's claim seems to be a meritorious one, I am unable to place this construction upon the statute.\nI therefore see no escape from the conclusion that the appeal should be allowed with costs throughout and the respondent's action dismissed.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\n[1] [1922] 1 W.W.R. 907.\n[2] [1886] 11 App. Cas. 627.\n[3] [1888] 13 App. Cas. 192.\n[4] [1887] 12 App. Cas. 643.\n[5] [1882] 8 Can.

(Plaintiff) Respondent.\n1922: October 26, 27; February 6.\nPresent: Sir Louis Davies C.J. and Idington, Duff, Anglin, Brodeur and Mignault JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF KING'S BENCH, APPEAL SIDE, PROVINCE OF QUEBEC\nExpropriation\u2014Subdivision lots\u2014Five lots taken for municipal sewage plant\u2014Damages to remaining lots\u2014Compensation\u2014Nuisance\u2014Fees of counsel and expert witnesses\u2014Art. 407, 1589 C.C.\u2014Montreal City Charter, (Q) 62 V, c. 58, s. 421.\nIn 1911, the respondent bought a block of land, 347 arpents in superficies, which it laid out as a residential building subdivision containing about fifteen streets and over 3,300 lots, which was treated as one holding. For the benefit of this subdivision the respondent, in contracts of sale or agreements to purchase lots, imposed conditions prohibiting uses of the lots which might depreciate adjoining parts of the property and, with the exception of one street, restricting the buildings to be erected thereon to residential buildings constructed at least ten feet from the front of the lots. During 1912, 1913, and 1914, about a third of the lots were disposed of subject to these restrictions. In February, 1916, the city of Montreal gave public notice of the expropriation of five of these lots required for the construction of an Imhoff tank, which is a sewage filtration plant. A board of arbitrators having been named in accordance with the provisions of the city charter, the respondent claimed before it compensation in respect of, first: the actual value of the lots taken; and secondly damages arising from the expropriation because of the consequent reduction in the selling value of the other lots unsold. The allowance of $896.66 for the value of each of the five lots was not contested; but the arbitrators having declined to recognize the claim under the second head and also having refused to allow the respondent what it has paid for counsel fees and expert witnesses, the respondent brought action to set aside the award.\nHeld, that the respondent was entitled, over and above the actual value of the five lots expropriated, to compensation for consequent depreciation in the value of its adjacent lands. Although there was as much connection between the lots taken and those still owned and controlled by the respondent as existed between the lands taken and those left in the hands of the expropriated owners in the Cowper Essex Case (14 App. Cas. 153) and the Sisters of Charity Case ([1922] 2 A.C. 315), (the Holditch Case ([1916] 1 A.C. 536, being therefore quite inapplicable), the decision in the present case should not rest upon these decisions owing to differences in language between the relevant clauses of the governing statutes. (Brodeur J., however, expressing no opinion on such differences). The respondent's right to compensation for injurious affection of land must be decided by applying the principles of the general law of the province of Quebec contained in article 407 C.C. which carries that right unless it is excluded by special laws (Art. 1589 C.C.); and such right is assumed by Article 421 of the Montreal City Charter, paragraph 1 of which confers the right to expropriate lands \"required for any municipal purposes whatsoever,\" paragraph 2 authorizing the arbitrators to take into consideration any increased value of the lands still remaining with the owner and setting the same off against the \"inconvenience, loss or damages resulting from expropriation,\" and paragraph 3 prescribing the rule or measure by which indemnity for expropriation is to be ascertained and providing that the compensation shall include \"damages resulting from the expropriation.\"\nHeld, also, that in view of the provisions of the city charter, s. 436, as amended by (Q) 4 Edward VII, c. 49, s. 21, the respondent was not entitled to claim, as part of its compensation, counsel fees and the costs of expert witnesses.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King's Bench, Appeal side, province of Quebec, affirming the judgment of the Superior Court and maintaining the respondent's action.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions in issue are fully stated in the above head-note and in the judgments now reported.\nChs. Laurendeau K.C. and G. St. Pierre K.C. for the appellant.\nGeo. H. Montgomery K.C. and Paul St.-Germain K.C. for the respondent.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014I concur with my brother Anglin.\nIdington J.\u2014The respondent, as its name implies, being a company engaged in buying and re-selling at a profit, if possible, had acquired a large tract of land for the purpose of re-selling subdivisions thereof under a scheme whereby it was clearly designed to create a residential district free from any of the undesirable results likely to flow from the acquisition by any one of any part thereof, and using that so acquired for purposes of a character likely to be obnoxious to others, merely wishing to acquire and use for purposes of dwelling there. Such a scheme is sometimes aided by city by-laws and, short of that, is generally carried out by restrictive covenants binding him acquiring any part from using that he acquires in a way to destroy, or tend to destroy, the residential character so desired to be created.\nNeedless perhaps to say that such a scheme generally enhances the prices at which the lands would be sold in separate subdivisions and also facilitates the ready sale thereof.\nThe respondent had continuously and consistently acted upon this scheme and secured its due execution by selling only with such restrictive covenants on the part of each purchaser of any part of the subdivisions as to secure such result.\nIn course of doing so it had sold over a thousand lots each and every one of the purchasers being so bound. It thus became a very valuable asset in connection with the remaining lots in the way of selling same.\nWhen matters stood in that position the appellant saw fit to use its powers of expropriation for the purposes of acquiring five of said subdivisions to be used for the construction of an Imhoff Tank in connection with the city sewerage and in obedience to the representations of the Provincial Board of Health and surrounding municipalities against the city's mode of dealing with its sewage.\nThe Board of Commissioners having charge of the compensation to be awarded the respondent in respect of such expropriations, by a majority refused to allow anything to respondent in way of compensation or damages in respect of this invasion of its rights in the premises impairing the efficacy of said scheme and tending to destroy the selling value of its remaining property.\nThe respondent then brought this action in the Superior Court to restrain the homologation of the award and set same aside unless and until due consideration given by the board to the respondent's right in said regard.\nThere was another but minor item of complaint in regard to expenses to which I will later refer.\nMeantime I wish to deal only with the measure of compensation or damages arising from what I have above referred to. The article 421 of the City Charter, which governs the rights of the parties in that regard, is as follows:\u2014\nIndemnity, in case of expropriation, shall include the actual value of the immoveable, part of immoveable or servitude expropriated and the damages resulting from the expropriation but, when fixing the indemnity to be paid, the commissioners may take into consideration the increased value of the immoveables from which is to be detached the portion to be expropriated and offset the same by the inconvenience, loss or damage resulting from the expropriation.\nIt is to be observed that the language used herein is not that of the English Lands Clauses Consolidation Act of 1845 which has given rise to so very much litigation to determine the meaning of the words \"injuriously affected.\"\nThe words \"and the damages resulting from the expropriation\" are more elastic and comprehensive than in the said English Act or our own Canadian Railway Act.\nIf given a rational interpretation the language used in this article can be made to do justice between the parties concerned.\nThe learned trial judge in said action, and the King's Bench in appeal, have, in my opinion, in this regard, taken the correct view. From the latter's judgment this appeal is taken.\nThe case of Canadian Northern Ontario Railway Company v. Holditch[1], and in the appeal from our decision[2], upholding the judgment of this court, is much relied upon by appellant.\nI most respectfully submit that there is no resemblance in principle between the cases. There the question was the broad one that if a railway had expropriated a single or several lots in no way connected with the other lots in the same survey, or the ownership thereof, the proprietors of these lots, so expropriated, could not claim anything in respect of the others.\nI may be herein permitted to quote from what I said in that case. I said at p. 272 of the said reports as follows:\u2014\nThe second of these sections, 193, is as follows:\n\"193. The notice served upon the party shall contain:\n\"(a) a description of the lands to be taken, or of the powers intended to be exercised with regard to any lands therein described; and, \"(b) a declaration of readiness to pay a certain sum or rent as the case may be, as compensation for such lands or for such damages.\"\nRead this as if both lands and power were combined though apparently disjoined, and whence can we draw the power of the arbitrators to assess and award damages in respect of other lands? Each lot taken by appellant is an independent, separate and complete property in itself. It is easily conceivable that a number of such properties might be so united together as to render them one compact whole, but that is not what in fact exists here.\nIn the Act upon which the Cowper-Essex Case[3] turned, it will be observed that the injuries to \"lands held therewith\" and \"other lands\" than taken and the \"severing\" of those from lands taken, are expressly provided for as subjects of compensation.\nI abide by these expressions of opinion and applying them to the case in hand I do find, as set forth above, a connection between the ownership of those lots of which the compensation for, or damages resulting from, the expropriation thereof, has to be determined, and the other lots yet unsold.\nAnd I may also quote from the opinion of Lord Sumner, delivering the judgment of the Judicial Committee, as follows:\u2014\nThey were sold out and out. No restrictive covenants were taken. There was no building scheme other than the lay out shown on the registered plan, and this derived its fixity from the legislation affecting it, and not from any notice to the purchaser or any private obligation entered into by him. It is plain that, so far as in them lay, the proprietors of this building estate had parcelled it out in lots, made an end of its unity (other than bare unity of ownership) and elected once for all to treat this multitude of lots as a commodity to trade in.\nThe basis of a claim to compensation for lands injuriously affected by severance must be that the lands taken are so connected with or related to the lands left that the owner of the latter is prejudiced in his ability to use or dispose of them to advantage by reason of the severance.\n* * * * *\nThere was one owner of many holdings, but there was not one holding, nor did his unity of ownership \"conduce to the advantage or protection\" of them all as one holding.\nThis language of Lord Sumner not only makes clearer than I had what might be such a connecting link between that expropriated and what remained unexpropriated as to allow consideration thereof as basis for such like claims as set up herein. I cannot see what the question (seriously discussed by counsel for appellant herein) of whether or not a servitude has been created, has to do with this case.\nThe respondent has acquired rights he may enforce and protect his purchasers by way of injunction, whether a servitude exists or not.\nThere is another principle applicable to all such cases and which needs not to rely upon such narrow distinctions as may be said to be involved in that view.\nIt is this, that the compensation must be based on what the land is worth to him from whom it is taken and thus include such incidental bases of compensation as may be here in question by virtue especially of the language in art. 421 above quoted. And it is very usual in such cases of most ordinary character to add 10 per cent to the valuation to cover much less important items than respondent sets up herein and the former has in many cases been maintained by this court.\nThis case may not need to be rested at all, from that point of view, upon the term \"damages\" alone, or as interpreted in other cases depending upon other statutes.\nThe law and the relevant decisions thereupon may be found set forth in Cripps on Compensations, at pages 102 et seq. of the 5th edition.\nI am suggesting these alternatives not so much that I feel the judgment below needs them for its support, as that I see in the results ahead a possible world of litigation for the parties concerned according to the view taken of the relevant law upon which the respondent's claim is rested.\nThe judgment appealed from is, in my opinion, in this regard, absolutely correct whichever way we look at it.\nThe cross-appeal on the other question of costs of preparation and at the trial before the board, I would dispose of by saying that it has been correctly disposed of by the court below. Possibly if in that court I might not have given general costs of the appeal when the party appellant failed in what seemed to me the substantial grounds of appeal but our jurisprudence is against meddling with decisions merely as to costs. I would give no costs of this cross-appeal but I would dismiss the appeal herein with costs.\nDuff J.\u2014This appeal presents a question as to the application of sec. 421 of the Montreal Charter which, so far as material, is in the following words:\u2014\n421. (62 Victoria, chapter 58, as amended by 3 George V, chapter 54, section 20)\u2014The city of Montreal may hereafter even without any previous application from the proprietors or other interested parties, but on a report from the Board of Commissioners, approved by the absolute majority of the members of the council, acquire by mutual agreement or by expropriation of any immovable, part of immovable or servitude situated within the limits of its territory or outside of the same, which it may require for any municipal purposes whatsoever, including the opening, widening and extension of its streets through the territory of another municipality, and, to that end, may acquire the land it may deem suitable by mutual agreement or by expropriation, by following the procedure indicated in the charter.\nIndemnity, in case of expropriation, shall include the actual value of the immovable, part of immovable or servitude expropriated and the damages resulting from the expropriation; but when fixing the indemnity to be paid, the commissioners may take into consideration the increased value of the immovables from which is to be detached the portion to be expropriated and offset the same by the inconvenience, loss or damages resulting from the expropriation.\nThe respondent company is the owner of a property known as \"Montreal Park,\" a property consisting of some 347 acres which was divided into some 3,300 lots and placed upon the market. Sales ceased about 1914, up to which time about one-third of the property had been sold. In February, 1916, the appellant municipality gave public notice that it would apply for the appointment of commissioners to determine the price and indemnity to be paid for certain immovables which the city proposed, under section 421 et seq. of its charter to acquire for the construction of an \"Imhoff Tank.\" The immovables described included four of the lots forming part of Montreal Park and, at a later date, a fifth of these lots was added. The respondent company claimed compensation in respect of first: the value of the lots taken, and 2nd, damages arising from the expropriation in consequence of the reduction in the selling value of other lots in Montreal Park. The arbitrators declined to recognize the claim under the second head. Mr. Justice Maclennan, of the Superior Court, whose judgment was affirmed by the Court of King's Bench, sustained the claim of the respondent holding that damages ought to have been assessed under that head. The corporation appeals. The undisputed fact is that the market price of some, at all events, of the unsold lots of Montreal Park have suffered and will suffer depreciation by reason of the municipal work And the question is whether this loss is something in respect of which the respondent company is entitled to compensation as comprised within the elements of damage denoted by the phrase \"the damages resulting from expropriation.\" Mr. Laurendeau on behalf of the appellant municipality, contending for a negative answer to this question, puts his case in this way. Art. 421, he argues, defining the measure of the compensation the owner of an expropriated immovable is entitled to receive, limits such compensation to the damages arising \"from the expropriation\" in addition to the \"actual value\" of the immovable; and this does not, he says, include a right to compensation in respect of the use of the property taken, that is to say, for damages occasioned by the execution of the municipal purpose for which it is taken. The execution of the municipal purpose may or may not involve something which is an actionable nuisance. If it can be lawfully carried out by the municipality without calling into play any authority other than that lawfully exercisable by a proprietor, then the right of the municipality to carry it out is merely one of its rights as proprietor and in respect of doing so no compensation is justly payable beyond the actual market value of the land.\nOn the other hand, he argues, if the municipality in order to execute the municipal purpose is obliged to do something constituting as against its neighbours an actionable wrong, they have their legal remedies and the expropriated owner among them with reference to any injury he may thereby suffer in relation to the property retained by him. There is nothing, he argues, in art 421, abridging the legal rights of the municipality's neighbours, In a word, Mr. Laurendeau contends that in the circumstances of the present case the arbitrators rightly took the view that the respondent company stands, with respect to the use to which the property taken is to be put by them, in precisely the same position as that of any other neighbouring proprietor, no better, no worse.\nThis contention raises a most important question and I shall first consider it exclusively with reference to the language of this article 421, read, of course, in the light of the Civil Code and of principles which must be taken from authoritative decisions to govern the character of the right to compensation under the law of Quebec. The right to compensation is given by art. 407 of the Civil Code, an article which reproduced art. 545 of the Code Napoleon which in its terms is merely declaratory of a settled principle of the ancient law of France. It is in these words:\u2014\n407. No one can be compelled to give up his property except for public utility and in consideration of a just indemnity previously paid.\nArt. 421, then, proceeds upon the fundamental assumption that the expropriated owner is entitled to a \"just indemnity.\" Now there is one principle of compensation law affecting the question as to what is comprised in a just indemnity which is well settled in the Province of Quebec. It is stated in these words by Lord Buckmaster in Fraser v. Fraserville[4] ;\nthe value to be ascertained is the value to the seller of the property in its actual condition at the time of expropriation with all its existing advantages and with all its possibilities, excluding any advantage due to the carrying out of the scheme for which the property is compulsorily acquired\nThe Privy Council was here applying art. 5795 of the Revised Statutes of Quebec (The Cities and Towns Act) where the arbitrators are directed to ascertain the\nvalue of the immovable together with whatever goes in compensation of the value of such immovable;\nand he is stating a principle which had been adopted and acted upon by the Court of King's Bench following the judgment of the Privy Council in Cedar Rapids Manufacturing & Power Co. v. Lacoste[5], in which Lord Dunedin dealing with a case in which the compensation provisions of the Dominion Railway Act applied, said: The law of Canada as regards the principle upon which compensation for lands taken is to be awarded\n(it should be carefully noted that Lord Dunedin's observation is limited to the case in which land is actually taken)\nis the same as the law of England * * * * (and he proceeds) the value to be paid for is the value to the owner * * * * not to the taker\nIt seems almost too obvious for remark that if the public authority desiring property for a public purpose and treating with an owner for the purchase of a part of a property owned by him to be devoted to that purpose, a consideration of greater or less importance according to the circumstances entering into the determination of the price may be the nature of the purpose for which the part to be taken is required. If it is to be taken for a gas works, for example, the owner will naturally require a price which will, in some degree at all events, compensate him for the depreciation in value to his other property which remains in his hands. If he is in a position to dictate terms, nobody would call it an unreasonable thing that an owner in such circumstances should exact a price which would fully compensate him for the depreciation in value suffered by the property retained.\nWithout analyzing too closely the phrases \"actual value\" in art. 421 and \"damages resulting from expropriation,\" I cannot escape the conclusion that these words, read in the light of the article quoted above and of the principle that the value to be ascertained is the value \"to\" the owner, are sufficient to evince an intention to provide in such circumstances for full compensation; and it appears to me, moreover, not to be doubtful that such elements of depreciation as I have indicated, are elements which enter into the account for the purpose of determining the amount of such compensation. It is of little importance whether you bring such elements under the head of \"actual value\" as being an indemnity for depriving the owner of the power which his ownership in itself confers upon him to prevent the execution of the public work upon his land, or whether you treat it as falling under \"damages resulting from expropriation.\" It is true that this article itself makes no provision apparently for compensation to persons whose lands are not taken but who nevertheless suffer injury in their business or property by reason of the execution of a municipal work; but that can afford no sound reason for declining to give effect to the principle embodied in the article of the code according to the measure defined by the article of the charter.\nThe argument on behalf of the appellant municipality proceeds indeed upon the postulate that \"expropriation\" within the meaning of art. 421 is employed in the restricted sense of signifying merely the transfer of title from the proprietor of the immovable to the municipality.\nI shall briefly indicate some of the reasons which appear to me to forbid acceptance of that view. The authority given is an authority to take for some municipal purpose and in assessing compensation it must be assumed that the municipality is not abusing its power, but will devote the property taken to the purpose for which it is authorized to take it. The nature of the project is published to the world and the mere fact of taking the property for a given purpose may by reason of the public anticipations in respect of the nature of the work which is to be carried out have such an effect in giving character to the locality as to diminish or enhance the value of adjoining property. It matters not, as the Law Lords point out in Cowper-Essex Case[6] that such a result may be due to an unreasonable prejudice against localities subjected to the presence of such works. Undesirability and consequential depreciation of value arising from such circumstances is a common experience and such depreciation is something which can be quantitatively estimated. And I can think of no reason why, being as it is one of the consequences of the process of \"expropriation,\" using \"expropriation\" in the sense of the process of taking the property for the municipal purpose for which it is required\u2014it should be excluded from the class of damages falling within the purview of the article. The extent of such depreciation is, of course, a question of fact, and as such a question for the arbitrators.\nThis view is confirmed\u2014it receives indeed the strongest confirmation from the proviso in the second paragraph of art. 421, authorizing the Commissioners to take into consideration the increased value of the immovable still remaining in the possession of the owner resulting from the expropriation, and setting the same off against the \"inconvenience, loss or damages resulting from expropriation.\" Expropriation here is evidently not used in the sense merely of translation of title,\u2014indeed it seems to include not only the process of expropriation as above mentioned (the process of taking for a stated municipal purpose) but apparently the execution of that purpose as well.\nThe appellant municipality invokes as against this view the law laid down by Lord Sumner in delivering the judgment of the Judicial Committee in Holditch's Case[7]. Before discussing the effect of that judgment I think it is convenient to consider a little the question how far some of the principles and specific rules laid down by the courts in England in the application of statutes relating to compulsory purchase of land are pertinent to questions arising under art 421.\nAt the outset it may be noted that there is an important distinction to be drawn between the particular rules deducible from such decisions resting upon special provisions of the English statutes and the reasoning upon which great judges like Lord Cairns, Lord Watson and Lord Macnaghten have proceeded in applying general principles of compensation to particular circumstances. Whether or not specific rules are binding must depend upon the provisions of the statute to be construed; but the reasoning by which these great judges have governed themselves in the application of general principles to particular cases, can hardly fail to afford some measure of guidance in parallel cases where cognate principles come into operation.\nMany years ago the Dominion courts, the courts of Ontario and the courts of Quebec began to treat the specific rules laid down with reference to the construction and effect of statutory provisions such as the proviso to section 16 of the Railway Clauses Act, 1845, and sections 49 and 63 of the Lands Clauses Act, 1845, as applicable to the construction and application of Canadian statutes dealing with the subject of expropriation. This practice rather widely prevailed, but I shall limit myself to a reference to the decisions upon two statutes, viz., the Dominion Railway Act and the Dominion Expropriation Act; and to the two propositions established in Hammersmith and City Ry. Co. v. Brand[8] and The Duke of Buccleuch v. The Metropolitan Board of Works[9], respectively, viz., 1st: that \"injurious affection\" caused to land no part of which is taken for the purpose of a railway arising from the mere use of the railway as distinguished from the construction of the work does not give rise to a claim for compensation under the Railway Clauses Act, 1845, and 2nd: that where land is taken, a claim for compensation may arise under secs. 49 and 63 of the Lands Clauses Act, 1845, in respect of \"injurious affection\" of the part not taken by reason not only of the construction, but by reason also of the anticipated user of the authorized works as well.\nThese two propositions were long ago held to govern the application of the compensation clauses of the Dominion Railway Act notwithstanding the fact that there were obvious differences in language between those clauses and the clauses of the English statutes out of which the rules developed. In Holditch's Case[10] Lord Sumner refers to this course of decision and observes that the differences in language between the compensation clauses of the Dominion Act and the proviso to sec. 16 of the Railway Clauses Act of 1845 are of no importance. Lord Dunedin, as I have pointed out, in 1914 in Cedar Rapids Manufacturing & Power Co. v. Lacoste[11] treated it as settled that generally speaking the principles governing the right of compensation under the Dominion Railway Act were the same as those which were established in England under the Lands Clauses Consolidation Act. As regards the effect of the compensation clauses of the Dominion Railway Act then, the authority of the English decisions affirmed by these judgments of the Privy Council, rests upon a solid foundation, a virtual similarity between the two systems of legislation and a settled course of decision by the courts of this country under which the English decisions were given effect to as pertinent and binding.\nThe other statute to which I shall refer is the Expropriation Act, c. 143, R.S.C. That statute assumes a right to compensation for lands taken and for lands \"injuriously affected by the construction\" of public works (secs. 22 and 26) and provides a procedure for assessing such compensation. There is nothing in this statute authorizing compensation for \"injurious affection\" arising from use as distinguished from construction. There is nothing, in other words, in the statute itself explicitly dealing with the case covered by secs. 49 and 63 of the Lands Clauses Act, 1845, of \"injurious affection\" of an owner's land by reason of construction and user of a public work upon lands formerly held therewith and severed therefrom. Nevertheless in the case of the Sisters of Charity of Rockingham v. The King[12], Lord Parmoor, delivering the judgment of the Judicial Committee, applied the decisions in England under sections 49 and 63 of the Lands Clauses Act, 1845, and in particular the decisions in Cowper-Essex's Case[13] and in the Stockport Case[14], in order to determine the right of an owner to compensation in respect of injurious affection arising from the running of a railway upon a part of the land of the owner which had been severed from the rest. In that case it had been explicitly stated by the learned judge of the Exchequer Court in delivering judgment and it had been assumed in all the judgments delivered in this court that the English decisions might properly be resorted to for determining the application of the Expropriation Act, and this was founded upon the circumstance mentioned by the learned judge of the Exchequer Court and emphasized by Lord Parmoor, that in a series of cases extending over a number of years the decisions in England had been treated as binding upon the courts in applying the Act.\nAs regards these two statutes then, the Dominion Railway Act and the Dominion Expropriation Act, the law is settled; but, of course, it does not follow that the decisions upon the two English statutes mentioned can be treated as providing a code of rules governing the application of every expropriation statute passed by a legislature in this country. In England they would not be regarded as controlling section 308 of the Public Health Act and in Fletcher v. Birkenhead Corporation[15] the Court of Appeal declined to follow the decision in Brand's Case[16] as governing the construction of sections 6 and 17 of the Waterworks Clauses Act of 1847. In City of Toronto v. Brown[17], I had occasion to examine the whole subject for the purpose of passing upon a contention that section 437 of the Ontario Municipal Act, requiring municipal councils to make \"due compensation\" to the owners of land taken or \"injuriously affected by the exercise of the powers\" of a council, was limited in its application by reference to the rule laid down as above mentioned in Brand's Case16; and the decision of this court was that the plain language of the Ontario statute giving a right of compensation for the injurious consequences of the exercise of the powers of the municipality could not be restricted in its operation by a reference to a rule derived by the House of Lords from the proviso to section 16 of the Railway Clauses Act, 1845.\nComing now to article 421; it is limited, of course, in its application to cases in which property is taken, but I can find nothing in the article which requires us in applying it to enter upon such considerations as necessarily arise or must be taken into account in applying sections 49 and 63 of the Lands Clauses Act of 1845. There is nothing here limiting damages arising from expropriation to such matters as might properly be described as \"injurious affection\" of other lands, still less to the \"injurious affection\" of lands from which the lands taken are severed or with which the lands taken have been held, and there is no course of decision such as that affecting the construction of the Expropriation Act or of the Railway Act. I think it is important that one should be cautious in attempting to express an opinion not necessary to the decision in the case before one, as to the scope of such general expressions as are to be found in this article, and I refrain from doing so, but it follows, I think, from the circumstances just mentioned that the rule pronounced by the Judicial Committee in Holditch's Case[18] is not a rule which the courts are bound to apply in passing upon a claim to compensation under article 421.\nOn the other hand, I am bound to say that if one were entitled to govern oneself by Holditch's Case18, Cowper-Essex's Case[19] and the case of the Sisters of Charity[20], there appears to be abundant evidence of the existence in relation to Montreal Park of that unity of possession and control, conducing to the advantage or protection of the property as one holding, which was held to exist in Cowper-Essex's Case19, and to be absent in Holditch's Case18.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAnglin J.\u2014Are the respondents, from whom five lots forming part of a residential building subdivision in the city of Montreal have been expropriated by the appellant municipality for the construction of a sewage tank, entitled to compensation for consequent depreciation in the value of their adjacent lands, which also form part of such building subdivision? This question is the subject of the main appeal.\nAre the respondents entitled to recover from the municipality their outlay for counsel fees, witness fees, and other costs incurred in maintaining their claim to compensation before the Board of Commissioners\u2014a right accorded them by the Superior Court but denied them by the Court of King's Bench? This question is raised by a cross-appeal\nThe allowance of $896.66 made to the respondents by the commissioners for the actual value of each of the five lots expropriated is not contested. In disposing of the controversy as to the right of the respondents to compensation for depreciation in the value of their adjacent property the courts below have treated the English decisions on the Lands and Railways Clauses Consolidation Acts of 1845 (notably the Cowper-Essex Case[21]), and on the Dominion Railway Act, to which the principle of those decisions has been held to apply (Holditch v. Canadian Northern Ry.[22] ; Sisters of Charity of Rockingham v. The King[23]), as governing authorities on the construction of the relevant provisions of the charter of the city of Montreal.\nIf the principles of those English decisions should be applied, in my opinion upon the facts in evidence there was sufficient connection between the lots taken and other lots in the building subdivision still owned and controlled by the respondents to bring this case within the authority of the Cowper-Essex Case21, and the very recent Sisters of Charity of Rockingham Case (3), and to render inapplicable the decision in the Holditch Case (2).\nThe lands taken (were) so connected with or related to the lands left that the owner of the latter is prejudiced in his ability to use or dispose of them to advantage by reason of the severance.\nThe respondents\nretained such control over the development and use alike of the parcels sold and the parcels unsold as made a real and prejudicial difference between (their) ability to deal with what remained to (them) after the compulsory taking of land and (their) ability to deal as a whole with both it and the land taken before such compulsory taking.\nSee also Toronto Suburban Railway Co. v. Everson[24] The freedom of the five lots after their expropriation from the restrictions, which it was the policy of the owners to impose upon all lots purchased in the building subdivision, necessarily affects detrimentally the value of some, if not all, other lots in the subdivision. The public use to which it is proposed to put the lands so taken, and upon which the statutory authorization for such taking depends is calculated to cause further depreciation, which, I agree, is matter that the commissioners must take into account in determining the compensation to be allowed. To that extent the views expressed in the Cowper-Essex Case[25] as to what should be included in compensation for injurious affection, especially by Lord Macnaghten, at p. 177, are in point, if such compensation is recoverable under the provisions of the Montreal City Charter.\nBut, with great respect, I am of the opinion that the English decisions relied upon afford little assistance in determining the rights of expropriated landowners under that charter to compensation in respect of injury to adjacent property held by them. The right to expropriate lands \"required for any municipal purposes whatsoever\" is conferred on the city of Montreal by paragraph 1 of article 421 of its charter (62 V., c. 58). The right to compensation or indemnity for such expropriation is given by article 407 C.C.:\nNo one can be compelled to give up his property except for public utility and in consideration of a just indemnity previously paid.\nThe right to indemnity for expropriation is assumed by the City Charter, which, by the 3rd paragraph of article 421 (a \"special law\" within article 1589 C.C.), prescribes the rule or measure by which such indemnity is to be ascertained\u2014what it is to include\u2014the manner or method of the expropriation being likewise prescribed by other articles of section XX of the charter. Paragraph 3 of article 421 reads as follows :.\nIndemnity, in case of expropriation, shall include the actual value of the immoveable, part of immoveable or servitude expropriated and the damages resulting from the expropriation; but, when fixing the indemnity to be paid, the commissioners may take into consideration the increased value of the immoveables from which is to be detached the portion to be expropriated and offset the same by the inconvenience, loss or damages resulting from the expropriation.\nThe language of that enactment differs widely from that of the statutory provisions dealt with in the English cases. We find nothing in article 421 at all resembling the phrase, \"lands injuriously affected by the execution of the works\" (section 68 of the Lands Clauses Act, 1845), or the phrase \"injuriously affected by the construction thereof\" i.e., of the railway (section 6, Railways Clauses Act, 1845), which form the basis of the English decisions that injury to the claimant's property (apart from any particular use to which it may be put or any personal inconvenience suffered by the owner) must be shewn. Ricket v. Metropolitan Railway Co.[26]. Here, in addition to \"the actual value\" of the property taken, paragraph 3 of article 421 provides that the compensation shall include \"damages resulting from the expropriation.\"\nAgain we find in article 421 of the Montreal Charter neither such words as \"lands held therewith,\" i.e., with the lands taken (section 49 of the Lands Clauses Consolidation Act, 1845) nor language such as that contained in section 63 of that Act\u2014\nthe damage, if any, to be sustained by the owner of the lands by reason of the severing of the lands taken from the other lands of such owner.\nIn the English Lands and Railway Clauses Consolidation Acts lands taken and lands injuriously affected form the subjects of separate provisions; in the Montreal charter the value of the property expropriated and \"damages resulting from the expropriation\" are covered by the same sentence\u2014uno flatu. By the Montreal charter one of the city recorders becomes ex-officio president of the board; the city council nominates two of its assessors as additional members; and, although their names are to be suggested by the landowners, the city alone is empowered to apply for the appointment by the Superior Court of the two other members required to constitute the board (article 429). Under the English Acts the landowners may take all the steps necessary to obtain compensation. But a more radical difference, I think, exists in regard to the basis of the right to compensation for what is known in English law as injurious affection. Whatever may be the case in regard to the right of the owner under the English common law to be paid for land taken from him for a public purpose by due authority of law (Attorney General v. De Keyser's Royal Hotel[27] ; Commissioner of Public Works v. Logan[28] ; Western Counties Ry. Co. v. Windsor & Annapolis Ry. Co.[29]), the right, where it exists, to additional compensation for injurious affection of other land held with that taken, like the more restricted right of a proprietor whose property has been injured by a public undertaking but from whom nothing has been taken, is in England purely statutory.\nIf persons in the position of the appellants, acting in the execution of a public trust and for the public benefit, do an act which they are authorized by law to do, and do it in a proper manner, although the act so done works a special injury to a particular individual, the individual injured cannot maintain an action. He is without remedy unless a remedy is provided by statute. East Fremantle v. Annois[30].\nArticle 407 of the Quebec Civil Gode is a textual production of article 545 of the Code Napoleon (which embodied and somewhat enlarged the principle of the French constitution of 1791), and expresses a fundamental principle of the common law of France (Merlin Rep. vbo. Retrait d'utilit\u00e9 publique), which \"pourrait m\u00eame \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme un principe de droit public,\" (Baudry-Lacantinerie (3 ed.) Des Biens no. 214).\nThat law prevailed in Lower Canada before the enactment of the Civil Code, Mayor of Montreal v. Drummond[31]. Under article 407 C.C., as under article 595 C.N., the \"just indemnity\" to which an expropriated owner is entitled must cover not merely the intrinsic value of the portion of that owner's property actually taken but also that of advantages attached to its possession of which the expropriation will deprive him (S.36.1.12; S.72.2.25) and especially any diminution in value of the rest of the property not taken. S.36.2.127; S.75.1.428 and n.1.; S.77.1.277. Although these decisions deal more particularly with the laws of 1833 and 1841, they merely apply to them a principle well recognized, \"La jurisprudence et la doctrine sont fix\u00e9es dans ce sens,\" S.77.1.277, n.3; Picard, Expropriation, L'indemnit\u00e9,-pp. 292-3, 299.\n\"Juste,\" c'est-\u00e0-dire suffisante pour compenser le prejudice subi par l'expropri\u00e9; autrement, l'expropriation sera une spoliation. Baudry-Lacantinerie, ibid.\nIt would therefore seem to be unnecessary in Quebec to look in a statute authorizing expropriation for a special provision for compensation for injurious affection of land held with that taken. Art. 407 C.C. carries that right unless it is excluded by the special law (Art. 1589 C.C.). There is no similar statutory provision of universal application in English law.\nBut quite apart from this important difference the whole scheme and arrangement of the indemnity provisions of the English Lands and Railways Clauses Act of 1845 on the one hand and those of Art. 421 (3), etc., of the Montreal charter on the other, are so different and the terms in which they are respectively couched are so unlike that it would be quite unsafe to treat decisions on the former as governing the construction of the latter.\nIn North Shore Ry. Co. v. Pion[32], in dealing with the Quebec Railway Act of 1880, a statute much more nearly in pari materia with the English Lands Clauses and Railway Clauses Consolidation Acts than is the Montreal City Charter, their Lordships of the Judicial Committee said:\u2014\nThe provisions and structure of that Act are too widely different from those of the English Lands Clauses and Railway Clauses Consolidation Acts to enable their Lordships to derive aid from the cases which have been decided upon those English Acts. In the English Acts special and separate provision is made for lands not taken, but injuriously affected, and the procedure for obtaining compensation, applicable both to lands taken and to lands injuriously affected, is defined so as to enable the landowner, as well as the company, to take, or cause to be taken, in all cases the necessary steps for that purpose. But in the Quebec Act of 1880 this is not so.\nI am for these reasons, with great respect, of the opinion that in determining whether under Art. 407 C.C. and par. 3 of Art. 421 of the Montreal Charter the respondents are entitled to compensation in respect of depreciation in the value of other lots in the subdivision owned by them due to the expropriation of the five lots taken by the appellants for a sewage tank we cannot look for guidance to the English cases so much discussed at bar and relied upon in the courts below. We have to construe the words\" damages resulting from the expropriation\" in the setting in which they occur in Art. 421, and having regard to the scope and purpose of that legislation and the general law of the province of Quebec as to compensation or indemnity in cases of expropriation. In Cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al v. Robillard[33], the court of Queen's Bench held that \"damages resulting from the expropriation\" are confined to damages sustained by the owner whose lands are taken. I see no reason to question the soundness of that decision. The terms of Art. 429\n\u2014compensation to be paid to the proprietor whose building or land is to be expropriated\u2014\nseem to confirm this view, which also appears to have been held by the Judicial Committee in Mayor of Montreal v. Drummond[34]. On the other hand the damages to be compensated for must \"result from the expropriation.\" They do not extend to injurious affection \"by the exercise of the (other) powers\" conferred by the statute. (Compare ss. 49 and 63 of the Lands Clauses Consolidation Act, 1845, and ss. 6 and 16 of the Railways Consolidation Act, 1845.) In Robillard's Case33, however, although the Court of Queen's Bench expressed the further view (p. 303) that the damage to be compensated for must be\nsuch as is directly connected with the land expropriated,\nit added that \"other damage caused by the expropriation,\" while restricted to that sustained by the party expropriated, is not limited to the land taken and its actual value but includes damages caused to his remaining land as, in their opinion (p. 304), Art. 421 of the Montreal Charter,\nis a similar provision to that embodied in the statutes for railway expropriation here, under which we held in Wood v. A. & N.W. Ry. Co.[35], that a party expropriated was entitled not only to the value of his land taken but to damage caused to his remaining lands by the operation of the train service.\nWithout conceding the similarity of paragraph 3 of Art. 421 of the Montreal Charter to the compensation provisions of the Railway Act construed in the Wood Case (1), and without expressing any view on the question whether the scope of the words \"and damages resulting from the expropriation\" is or is not exhausted thereby, under the circumstances here in evidence, those words in my opinion certainly cover such depreciation in value as the taking of the five lots for a sewage tank has caused to other lots comprised in the same subdivision still held by the respondents after the expropriation. That depreciation was \"damage caused by the expropriation,\" and is \"directly connected with the land expropriated.\" The view that this is the proper construction of par. 3 of Art. 421 is strengthened by its concluding provision that\nthe Commissioners may take into consideration the increased value of the immoveable from which is to be detached the portion to be expropriated, and offset the same by the inconvenience, loss or damage resulting from the expropriation.\nIf an increase in the value of adjacent immovables due to the expropriation is to be taken account of, it would seem only reasonable that depreciation in the value of the same immovables likewise caused should form part of the loss or damages against which such increase in value may be offset.\nNor is it necessary in my opinion that the restrictive covenants taken by the respondents from purchasers should have the effect of subjecting the respective lots sold to a servitude in favour of the rest of the property comprised in the subdivision. If such a servitude were created and some of the lots already sold had been taken by the appellants the respondents might have had a claim for \"the actual value of the * * * servitude expropriated.\" What they are claiming for is \"damages resulting from the expropriation\" to their remaining property. No question of servitude is involved. The sole matter to be determined is whether depreciation in the value of such adjacent land caused by the expropriation is damage resulting therefrom within the purview of paragraph 3 of article 421. Under the circumstances in evidence I think it is.\nNor is the fact, pressed at bar, that the maintenance of the proposed sewage tank is likely to be only temporary now material, if substantial injury has been caused by taking part of the respondents' land for it. While that fact may affect the quantum of, it cannot entirely defeat the right to, compensation. Lingk\u00e9 v. Mayor, etc., of Christ-Church[36]. In estimating the compensation it must of course be assumed that ail proper precautions will be taken to prevent the use and operation of the tank becoming a nuisance to the neighbourhood. While any omission of due care resulting in injury would probably be actionable, it cannot afford a ground for statutory compensation since it would be an abuse of the statutory power and without its protection.\nIn determining how far, under the Montreal Charter, the purposes for which the municipality is expropriating should be taken into account in estimating \"the damage resulting from the expropriation,\" I prefer to adopt the reasoning of Lord Macnaghten in the Cowper-Essex Case[37], already referred to, and the line of decisions in Belgium mentioned in Picard on Expropriation, L'indemnit\u00e9 (vol. 1, pp. 293-8), rather than the narrower ideas expressed in such works as De Lalleau on Expropriation (vol. 1, no. 302), though the latter are no doubt founded on French jurisprudence. Cr\u00e9pon, Code annot\u00e9 de l'Expropriation, p. 253, nos. 164, bis., et seq.\u2014s.v. nos. 143 and 152.\nFor the reasons stated by Martin and Rivard JJ. in the Court of King's Bench, I am satisfied that the right to recover counsel fees, witness fees, etc., asserted by the respondents has been expressly taken away by article 436 of the City Charter, as enacted by 4 Edward VII, c. 49.\nBoth the appeal and the cross-appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nBrodeur J.\u2014La premi\u00e8re question qui nous est soumise est de savoir si les arbitres auraient d\u00fb indemniser la compagnie McAnulty pour les dommages r\u00e9sultant de ce qu'elle appelle le morcellement de sa propri\u00e9t\u00e9.\nLa cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al pr\u00e9tend qu'il n'y a pas de morcellement de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 par l'expropriation, qu'elle n'est tenue de payer que pour les cinq lots expropri\u00e9s et que les autres lots pour lesquels l'expropri\u00e9e r\u00e9clame une indemnit\u00e9 ne font pas partie de ces cinq lots, qu'ils en ont \u00e9t\u00e9 effectivement d\u00e9tach\u00e9s par un cadastre de subdivision qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 fait par l'expropri\u00e9e plusieurs ann\u00e9es auparavant. La compagnie McAnulty pr\u00e9tend, au contraire, que tous ces lots ne forment qu'une seule exploitation qui donne lieu au cas d'expropriation de quelques-uns d'entr'eux \u00e0 l'indemnit\u00e9 r\u00e9sultant du morcellement.\nLa preuve constate que tous ces lots de terre formaient originairement une ferme en culture, que la compagnie McAnulty s'en est port\u00e9e acqu\u00e9reur en 1911, qu'elle a pay\u00e9 une partie du prix de vente comptant, que la balance du montant d'achat est rest\u00e9e hypoth\u00e9qu\u00e9e sur tout l'immeuble, que la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 subdivis\u00e9e par la compagnie McAnulty en plus de trois mille lots \u00e0 b\u00e2tir que ont \u00e9t\u00e9 plac\u00e9s en vente sur le march\u00e9 sous le nom de \"Montreal Park,\" et que l'on dispose de ces lots par promesses de vente qui contiennent des restrictions quant \u00e0 la mani\u00e8re dont ils devront \u00eatre construits et exploit\u00e9s.\nLes commissaires charg\u00e9s de fixer l'indemnit\u00e9 ont d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de ne pas accorder de dommages ou d'indemnit\u00e9 pour les autres lots que les cinq qui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 expropri\u00e9s.\nIl me para\u00eet bien \u00e9vident que l'expropriation a caus\u00e9 des dommages s\u00e9rieux et appr\u00e9ciables aux autres lots. La construction de cette fosse Imhoff qui a motiv\u00e9 l'expropriation est destin\u00e9e \u00e0 traiter les \u00e9gouts et d\u00e9pr\u00e9cie n\u00e9cessairement la valeur des terrains avoisinants.\nL'article 407 du Code Civil \u00e9nonce le principe g\u00e9n\u00e9ral que nul ne peut \u00eatre contraint de c\u00e9der sa propri\u00e9t\u00e9 pour cause d'utilit\u00e9 publique \u00e0 moins qu'il ne soit justement indemnis\u00e9.\nQue doit comprendre l'indemnit\u00e9?\nLa valeur du terrain expropri\u00e9 et les dommages accessoires r\u00e9sultent directement de l'expropriation; et l'on range g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement dans cette derni\u00e8re cat\u00e9gorie la d\u00e9pr\u00e9ciation provement du morcellement de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9; l'article 421 de la charte de la Cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al, sous laquelle les arbitres proc\u00e9daient, \u00e9nonce le m\u00eame principe en disant que l'indemnit\u00e9 doit comprendre la valeur r\u00e9elle de l'immeuble ou partie d'immeuble expropri\u00e9 \"et les dommages r\u00e9sultant de l'expropriation.\"\nSommes-nous en pr\u00e9sence d'un immeuble expropri\u00e9 ou de partie d'un immeuble expropri\u00e9? En d'autres termes, ces terrains du \"Montreal Park\" forment-ils une seule exploitation? S'ils ne forment qu'une seule exploitation, alors l'expropriation des cinq lots en question constituerait un morcellement (severance).\nIl est bien vrai que la subdivision des terrains et leur cadastrage peut former en soi un morcellement de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 et lui enlever dans certain cas le caract\u00e8re d'exploitation unique. C'est ce qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 dit dans la cause de Canadian Northern Ry. v. Holditch[38]. Mais dans cette cause de Holditch la subdivision avait eu lieu sans aucune r\u00e9serve, le propri\u00e9taire de ces diff\u00e9rents lots avait donn\u00e9 \u00e0 chacun d'eux une existence distincte et s\u00e9par\u00e9e qui leur avait fait perdre le caract\u00e8re de seule et m\u00eame exploitation. Aussi le Conseil Priv\u00e9 (2), appel\u00e9 \u00e0 examiner notre d\u00e9cision, disait par la bouche de Lord Sumner, en discutant les faits de cette cause de Holditch :\nThey (the lots) were chiefly distinguished by the numbers assigned to them and the name of the street on which they fronted. They were sold out and out. No restrictive covenants were taken. There was no building scheme, other than the lay-out shown on the registered plan, and this derived its fixity from the legislation affecting it, and not from any notice to the purchaser or any private obligation entered into by him. It is plain that, so far as in them lay, the proprietors of this building estate had parcelled it out in lots, made an end of its unity (other than bare unity of ownership) and elected once for all to treat this multi tude of lots as a commodity to trade in.\nA la page 543, Lord Sumner continue en parlant des terrains Holditch:\u2014\nThere was one owner of many holdings, but there was not one holding, nor did his unity of ownership \"conduce to the advantage or protection\" of them all as one holding.\nSous quelques rapports, les faits de la cause de Holditch[39] ressemblent \u00e0 ceux de la pr\u00e9sente cause. Dans les deux cas, il y a achat de terrains pour op\u00e9rations sp\u00e9culatives et subdivision des lots; mais les dissemblances se manifestent quand, dans le cas Holditch, les terrains sont vendus sans conditions, et qu'il n'y a pas de plan d'ensemble pour la construction des b\u00e2tisses. Dans le cas de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 McAnulty, les terrains sont vendus avec des restrictions, les b\u00e2timents doivent avoir une certaine uniformit\u00e9, et le tout constitue une \u00e9tendue de terre connue sous le nom de Montreal Park. Il me semble alors que la d\u00e9cision Holditch ne peut pas \u00eatre avantageusement invoqu\u00e9e par la cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al. Les faits que ont \u00e9t\u00e9 prouv\u00e9s dans la cause de Cowper-Essex v. Acton Local Board[40] me paraissent plus conforme \u00e0 ceux que nous constatons dans la pr\u00e9sentte cause.\nDans cette cause de Cowper-Essex (1), le propri\u00e9taire conservait sur l'am\u00e9lioration et l'usage des parties vendues et non vendues un contr\u00f4le tel, qu'il \u00e9prouvait, comme disait Lord Summer\na real and prejudicial difference between his ability to deal with what remained to him after the compulsory taking of the land and his ability to deal as a whole with both it and the land taken before such compulsory taking.\nPour ces raisons, l'appel doit \u00eatre renvoy\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens.\nLa somme r\u00e9clam\u00e9e par la compagnie McAnulty parait \u00e0 premi\u00e8re vue tr\u00e8s \u00e9lev\u00e9e; mais il ne faut pas oublier que les Commissaires ont le droit, en fixant l'indemnit\u00e9, de prendre en consid\u00e9ration la plus-value donn\u00e9e au terrain par l'ouvrage projet\u00e9 (art. 421 Charte). Je pr\u00e9sume que cette fosse Imhoff pour la construction de laquelle on a pris certains lots facilitera l'\u00e9gout de tous les lots pour lesquels on r\u00e9clame des dommages.\nUne autre question a \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9e par un contre-appel, c'est de savoir si la compagnie McAnulty a droit d'\u00eatre indemnis\u00e9e pour ses d\u00e9penses de procureurs et de t\u00e9moins.\nCette question avait \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cid\u00e9e en 1892 dans un sens favorable \u00e0 l'indemnitaire dans une cause de Sentenne v. Cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al[41]. Mais en 1899 la legislature a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que la cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al n'\u00e9tait pas tenue de payer aucun frais de t\u00e9moins, de st\u00e9nographe ou d'avocats dans les proc\u00e9dures en expropriation. Cette disposition de la loi est tellement formelle qu'il n'y a pas lieu d'appliquer la d\u00e9cision Sentenne.\nCe contre-appel est donc mal fond\u00e9 et doit \u00eatre renvoy\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens.\nMignault J.\u2014Two questions are involved under the appeal and the cross-appeal in this case.\n1.Were the expropriation commissioners justified in refusing compensation for depreciation of the respondent's lots not taken because these lots are distinct and separate from the expropriated lots and because, in the opinion of the commissioners, the depreciation would not result from the expropriation, but from the establishment and operation of an Imhoff tank on the expropriated lots?\n2. Were the commissioners justified in refusing to comprise in the compensation counsel fees and the charges of the expert witnesses produced by the expropriated party?\nThese two questions are questions of law and the parties might have avoided the considerable expense of printing the voluminous testimony before the commissioners by agreeing on the statement of facts contained in the judgments and which they do not dispute. This is a remark that could be repeated in many cases where points of law alone are involved and where the parties could notably reduce the cost of the proceedings by sensibly agreeing on the essential facts.\nI will now examine these two questions, the first being the subject of the appeal, the second of the cross-appeal.\nFirst question. The right of the respondent to damages for depreciation of its lots which were not taken, turns on the proper construction of the expropriation provisions of the Montreal City Charter.\nIn the two courts below it was apparently considered that this question involved a choice between the decisions of the House of Lords and of the Judicial Committee respectively in Cowper-Essex v. Local Board for Acton[42], and Holditch v. Canadian Northern Ontario Railway Co.[43]. I do not mean, when I use the word \"choice,\"that it, was thought that these decisions were in conflict, but merely that they applied to different circumstances. In the former case, as well as in the recent Case of The Sisters Charity of Rockingham v. The King[44], the expropriated party, a portion of whose land was taken, was held to be entitled to compensation for the depreciation of the residue, not taken, of his land due, to the anticipated, legal use of works which might be constructed upon the lands taken. I may perhaps be permitted to add that the judgment in the Sisters' Case[45] contains a very useful .and comprehensive statement of the English case law in matters of compensation. In the Holditch Case[46] compensation was refused for injurious affection by noise, smoke or vibration to lands separate and disjoined from those taken.\nWith respect I think that the expropriation provisions of the Montreal City Charter sufficiently differ from the enactments considered in the three cases above mentioned to leave us free to place a construction on these provisions uncontrolled, I do not say not aided, by the English decisions on The Land Clauses Consolidation Act, -1845, The Railway Clauses Consolidation Act, 1845, as well as by decisions of the Judicial Committee in compensation cages arising under the Railway Act of Canada.\nThe expropriation provisions under which the appellant took the respondent's lands are contained in sections 421 and following of the Montreal City, Charter, as enacted by 3 Geo. V, ch. 54, section 20. Section 421 allows the city to expropriate lands for any municipal purpose, and paragraph 3 is very explicit as to the indemnity to which the owner is entitled:\nIndemnity, in case of expropriation, shall include the actual value of\nthe immoveable, part of immoveable or servitude expropriated and the\ndamages resulting from the expropriation; but, when fixing the indemnity\nto be paid, the commissioners may take into consideration the increased\nvalue of the immoveable from which is to be detached the portion to be expropriated and offset the same by the inconvenience, loss or damages resulting from the expropriation.\nTwo elements therefore make up this \"indemnity.\"\n1. The actual value of the immovable expropriated, and there is no dispute as to this value;\n2. The damages resulting from the expropriation. \" Damages resulting from the expropriation\" is a very wide and comprehensive, term and would include damages from severance or from injurious affection. It can no doubt be considered that the law-makers of the province of Quebec, when enacting expropriation provisions,' have in mind the cardinal principle of Quebec property law, Art. 407 C.C., that\nno one can be compelled to give up his property, except for public utility and in consideration of a just indemnity previously paid. But, standing by itself, paragraph 3 of section 421 amply suffices to determine any question with regard to the respondent's right to compensation, which as stated comprises, besides the actual value of the immovable, the damages resulting from the expropriation.\nThe facts here, according to the judgment of the learned trial judge, are that in 191.1 the respondent bought a block of land, 347 arpents in superficies, which it laid out as a residential building subdivision containing about 15 streets and over 3,300 lots, which was treated as one holding. For the benefit of this subdivision the respondent, in contracts of sale or agreements to purchase lots, imposed conditions prohibiting uses of the lots which might deteriorate adjoining parts of the property, and restricting, with the exception of one street, the buildings to be erected thereon to residential buildings constructed at least 10 feet from the front of the lots. Whether these restrictions did or did not constitute real servitudes appears to me immaterial, for they undoubtedly gave the respondent a control over the whole subdivision even after the alienation of some of the lots. During 1912, 1913 and 1914, about a third of the lots were disposed of subject to these restrictions. In February, 1916, the city of Montreal gave public notice of the expropriation of five of these lots required for the construction of an Imhoff tank, which is a sewage filtration plant. The learned trial judge found that the fact alone that the purpose of the expropriation was for the construction and operation of a sewage plant injuriously affected the remaining lots, diminished their value and made their sale more difficult, if not impossible, and specially as regards the lots in the immediate vicinity of the expropriated property.\nWith this finding of fact there can be no difficulty in coming to the conclusion that this depreciation of the remaining lots is a \"damage resulting from the expropriation\" and should have been considered by the commissioners. I therefore agree with the judgment of the two courts setting aside the award.\nSecond question.\u2014Whatever might have been the right of an expropriated party to claim as damages resulting from the expropriation, counsel fees and the cost of expert witnesses, the Quebec legislature has expressly enacted by section 436 of the Montreal City Charter, as amended by 4 Edward VII, ch. 49, sec. 21, that\nthe city is not bound to pay the fees of counsel or witnesses or any incidental costs or disbursements, other than those hereinafter mentioned, for proceedings before the commissioners or before the courts, either for the appointment of commissioners or the homologation of their report or for the withdrawal on behalf of the person indemnified of the sums of money deposited in the prothonotary's office.\nThe commissioners, appointed by the court and by law shall be entitled to fees as follows:\nFor appraising vacant immovable property, hearing witnesses, and making award : for each immovable $10 00\nFor appraising immoveable property, containing buildings, hearing witnesses, and making award: for each immoveable 15 00\nFor appraising tenants' claims: for each award 10 00\nThis enactment is somewhat obscure on account chiefly of its defective punctuation. The original section 436, as contained in 62 Vict., ch. 58, clearly stated that no fee for witnesses, stenographers, advocates or counsel for any proceedings before the commissioners should be payable by the city. In the substituted section the legislature was dealing with both the non-liability of the city for fees of counsel and witnesses, and with the right of the commissioners to charge certain fees, and, saving the expressly mentioned costs, it imposes no liability on the city to pay for fees of counsel or witnesses. I have no hesitation whatever in adopting on this point the reasoning of the learned judges of the court of appeal.\nFor these reasons I would dismiss the appeal and the cross-appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Jarry, Damphousse, Butler & St. Pierre.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Brown, Montgomery & McMichael.\n[1] (1914) 50 Can.

C.N.\nThe respondents, being the owners of a hypothec of $5,000 on a certain lot belonging to appellant, gave the latter a discharge of this hypothec and accepted in lieu thereof a transfer from appellant of part of a $22,000 mortgage, being the balance of the purchase price of three other properties. The transfer of the mortgage by appellant to respondents was made \"sans autre garantie que celle de l'existence de la cr\u00e9ance,\" the respondents also declaring themselves satisfied with the hypothec securing the sum transferred \"aux risques des dites cessionnaires qui d\u00e9clarent \u00eatre contentes et satisfaites de l'hypoth\u00e8que garantissant la somme pr\u00e9sentement transport\u00e9e sans s'en rapporter en aucune fa\u00e7on sur la solvabilit\u00e9 du c\u00e9dant.\" Afterwards, two of the above-mentioned properties were taken back by a prior owner by forfeiture proceedings under a resolutory clause and the third sold for taxes. As a result, both the appellant and the respondents lost their entire claim as mortgagees on these properties. The respondents then brought action against the appellant to annul the above-mentioned deeds of discharge and transfer.\nHeld that, under the circumstances the warranty of the existence of the debt comprised that of the existence of the mortgage, and as this mortgage was destroyed by the retroactive effect of the resolutory condition and of the sale for taxes, the respondents were entitled to recover the amount for which they had given a discharge when they accepted the transfer made them by the appellant.\nPer Duff and Brodeur JJ. and semble, per Anglin J.\u2014The transaction is also annullable as being infected by error in substantia. APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King's Bench, appeal side, Province of Quebec, affirming the judgment of the Superior Court and maintaining the respondent's action.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions in issue are fully stated in the above head-note and in the judgment now reported.\nEug. Lafleur K.C. and Louis Boyer K.C. for the appellant.\nP. C. Ryan K.C. for the respondents.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014For the reasons stated by Mr. Justice Mignault in which I concur, I would dismiss this appeal with costs.\nIdington J.\u2014I concur in the judgment of Mr. Justice Mignault in dismissing the appeal herein with costs.\nDuff J.\u2014This appeal has caused me not a little perplexity and I am still far from confident that the decision I am concurring in is the right decision. Mr. Ryan, who presented his argument with lucidity as well as the most commendable candour, in effect supported the judgment below on one ground. His contention was that the instrument of transfer, in part by its explicit language and in part by necessary implication, imports a warranty of the existence of a hypothec as an effective hypothec on the lands described in the instrument.\nWith the greatest possible respect, and with some diffidence because of the difference of opinion upon the point, I cannot satisfy myself that that is a contention to which effect should be given. The subject of warranty is expressly dealt with in a clause of the instrument. The language of that clause does not in itself admit of doubt as to its meaning. There is a warranty of the existence of the debt transferred; that as it stands, I think, necessarily excludes any warranty on the subject of the hypothec and there is nothing in the other clauses of the instrument which, in my opinion, can fairly be held to modify the effect of the warranty clause. The declaration by the transferees that they are relying on the hypothec rather than on the solvability of the debtor, does not, I think, when the context is considered, import any undertaking as to the hypothec. In the absence of an express warranty it would, no doubt, import a warranty as to the existence of the hypothec but it does not, I think, imply, when read together with, as it must be read, the warranty clause, any modification of that clause.\nThis view as to the effect of the warranty clause is not without support from authority; Baudry-Lacantinerie, Vente, no. 820. The question is, however, I think, a question of construction of language, and so treating it the result is, I think, as I have stated it.\nAssuming, however, that a warranty as to the existence of the hypothec is to be found in the terms of the instrument I am still unable to agree that a right of action is in consequence vested in the transferees.\nFor the purpose of discussing the point I concede that the existence of the hypothec for this purpose, means the existence of a hypothec which affects the lands mentioned in the instrument. I am unable to agree that such a warranty, if it be found in the instrument, is on the facts unfulfilled. Consider the situation; the creator of the hypothec was the owner of the lands under an agreement which exposed his title to extinction by the operation of a resolutive condition depending upon the non payment of the purchase money. The facts necessary to make the condition operative were not in existence at the critical time, the date of the transfer. The hypothec, it is quite plain, did in fact at the date of the transfer burden the title of the grantor of the hypothec, a title which was a title to the land subject to the resolutive condition. It was in consequence, in my opinion, an existing hypothec affecting the lands in question.\nAs against that it is said that by the law, once the condition r\u00e9solutoire went into effect, the title of the owner subject to the condition is deemed to have been non-existent ab initio. While this is quite true it is none the less the fact that at the time of the transfer there was an existing title which was a right in rem subject to be divested upon the happening of the condition. I am unable to follow the reasoning by which it is concluded that in such circumstances there was not in contemplation of the warranty clause at that time an existing right in the immoveable in question.\nI have examined with care the authorities cited in support of the proposition and I have been unable to discover a single statement of the law which supports the proposition, nor among the numerous illustrations given by the authors can I find one which supports it by analogy. I find it laid down again and again that where the specific debt which is the object of a sale is after the sale annulled by a judgment in an action en nullit\u00e9 based upon facts existing at the time of the sale that the ordinary warranty is exigible. That is perfectly intelligible. Where by reason of fraud or mistake the acte juridique upon which the debt is supposed to be founded is annulled and the case of nullity existed anterior to the sale, it is an intelligible proposition that in contemplation of the warranty clause the debt was juridically non-existent; but I can find no statement of the law in any of the authorities which justifies the proposition that where the acte juridique itself is unassailable but that by reason of the terms and conditions of the acte the rights created are subject to a resolutive condition and are put an end to by the operation of the condition, I can find no single statement which treats such a case as falling within the warranty clause. The distinction, of course, is the very clear distinction between the annulling of the acte juridique in consequence of some vice which affects it with nullit\u00e9 and the resolution of rights under the provisions of the contract which in itself is unassailable. Indeed the terms in which the subject is discussed by well known writers shew very clearly that the distinction has not been overlooked. See Baudry-Lacantinerie, no. 818.\nOn the other hand I have not been able to satisfy myself that I should be justified in dissenting from the view upon which I understand my brother Brodeur proceeds, the view namely, that the transaction in question is annullable as being infected by error in substanti\u00e2. I find myself embarrassed in considering the question by the circumstance that counsel for the respondent did not press that view upon the argument and I think I should have no great difficulty in reaching the conclusion that if the question here were to be determined by the Code Napol\u00e9on it must be decided in favour of the appellant. While under the law it might be very plausibly argued that the existence of the resolutive condition constituted a fact falling within the operation of the doctrine touching vice cach\u00e9 or vice r\u00e9dhibitoire (though the terms of the warranty would on that assumption be conclusive) it could not, I should be inclined to think, be regarded as coming within Art. 1110 of the C.N. It may seem an audacious thing to express an opinion upon a point about which there is so much difference of opinion among French authors, but the reasoning of M. Wahl (Revue Trimestrielle, 1914, at p. 13) is, in my humble opinion, conclusive; and reference may be made also to Dr. Walton's book on Obligations, vol. 1, pages 266 et seq. However, my brother Brodeur has called my attention to the circumstance that the language of the Civil Code of Quebec (Art. 992) radically differs from that of the C.N. (Art. 1110) and the difference in language affords, I think, satisfactory evidence that the code adopted the view of Pothier's doctrine taken by Baudry-Lacantinerie (Obligations no. 54) ; and that whatever objections there may be in theory to the test of error in substantia (described as the subjective test by the French authors), that is the test which has been adopted in Quebec by the Civil Code. I agree that the existence of the condition r\u00e9solutoire was a circumstance which, if it had been disclosed, would in all probability have been regarded by both parties as a defect which must be removed as a condition of the bargain which was made.\nIn the course of the argument Mr. Lafleur, in answer to questions put by myself as to this ground of support for the judgment below, urged that because the condition had become operative restitution was impossible and that consequently on that ground rescission could not be sustained.\nOn the whole, I think with much doubt, that although in fact there has been a radical change of circumstances since that change is due to the operation of the condition, that is to say, of the undisclosed defect, the right of rescission is not lost. Anglin J.\u2014It is quite clear that the respondents were wholly unaware of the resolutory provision to which the title of two of the lots on which they were induced by the defendant to accept a hypothecary security was subject. They took that security from him in exchange for another on which he was personally liable to them and which it is admitted in his factum in this court was a perfectly safe security. It is in my opinion also reasonably certain that the respondents did not assume any risk as to the legal efficacy of the hypothec which they were so acquiring as a charge on the property it purported to cover. They did expressly acquit the appellant of all responsibility towards them as guarantor of the sufficiency of the value of that property as security for their investment and of the solvency of the principal debtor. But nothing was farther from their contemplation than the acquisition of un contrat al\u00e9atoire. What they intended to buy was an interest in an absolute and indefeasible hypothecary security\u2014not in a security subject to the risk of defeasance.\nAs the sale of a debt secured by hypothec carries with it as an accessory the hypothec by which it is secured (Art. 1574 C.C.), so the warranty of the existence of such a debt, when implied by law (Art. 1576 C.C.), involves a warranty of the existence of the hypothecary security. (Fuzier-Herman, Rep. Vbo. \"Cession des Cr\u00e9ances no. 392; S. 1857. 1. 602)\u2014especially when as here it is expressly described in the instrument of transfer as so secured. A conventional warranty of the existence of a debt secured by hypothec should, I think, be given the same effect, and, notwithstanding the two cases in the Cour de Cassation in 1873-4, noted by my brother Mignault, in order to negative such warranty of the hypothec under circumstances such as the present case presents I should require a more explicit exclusion of it than is involved in the words\nsans autre garantie que celle de l'existence de la cr\u00e9ance.\nThe question is wholly one of interpretation on which in France the decision of les juges des faits is conclusive. Baudry-Lacantinerie, (3 ed.) \"De la vente et de l'\u00e9change\", No. 820, in fine. The subject of the sale in the present instance\u2014what the respondents contracted for\u2014was not merely, nor chiefly, the personal obligation of the hypothecary debtor; it was the security for their investment afforded by the charge of that obligation on certain real property. That charge was the real \"matter of the contract\"; they agreed to take not a debt, but a debt described as affecting certain named immoveables. That was the thing sold. The transfer of a debt not so secured was not a fulfilment of the essential obligation of the vendor. S. 1898. 2. 131.\nAll the circumstances of the present case make it impossible to believe that the respondents intended to forego the legal obligation of the appellant as vendor to warrant the existence of the hypothec. (Arts. 1508 and 1576 C.C.) The stipulation whereby the appellant restricted his warranty\u2014\naux risques des dites cessionnaires qui d\u00e9clarent \u00eatre contentes et satisfaites de l'hypoth\u00e8que garantissant la somme pr\u00e9sentement transport\u00e9e, sans s'en rapporter, d'aucune fa\u00e7on sur la solvabilit\u00e9 du c\u00e9dant, en ce qui concerne la somme pr\u00e9sentement transport\u00e9e, en capital, int\u00e9r\u00eat et accessoires\n\u2014is, I think, susceptible of meaning either that the purchasers assumed all risks as to the hypothec, including that of its existence, or merely that they took the risk of the sufficiency in value of the hypothecated property and of the solvency of the principal debtor. Where the purchaser did not know the danger of eviction, a stipulation excluding warranty does not entitle the vendor to retain the price unless the purchaser clearly assumed the risk. Art. 1510 C.C.; Baudry-Lacantinerie, Vente et Echange, (3 \u00e9d.) no. 401 in fine. Having regard to its terms and its place in the contract, and giving due effect to Arts. 1013, 1015 and 1020 C.C., the restrictive stipulation quoted, in my opinion, should not be regarded as excluding a warranty of the existence of the hypothec as a charge on the property it purported to cover not subject to defeasance by reason of any inherent defect existing before the sale. If the wider effect for which he now contends was intended by the defendant I should find it very difficult to acquit him of purposely entrapping the plaintiffs, which would amount to fraud. The resolutory provision to which the title of two of the three lots purported to be charged was subject was such an inherent defect existing before the sale. Baudry-Lacantinerie, (3 \u00e9d.) \"Vente et Echange\", no. 352. Its enforcement resulted in the respondents losing the greater part of their security and in a consequent breach of the warranty which in my opinion was given them by the appellant.\nThe remaining lot unaffected by the resolutory provision was inadequate as security and is not now available having since been sold by the sheriff. The appellant is not in a position to restore the respondents to their former position as holders of a hypothec securing $5,000 on lot no. 693. They have entirely lost that sum of money owing to the fatal defect to which the title they acquired from the appellant to the hypothecary security sold by him was subject. He is in my opinion liable to make good that loss.\nBrodeur J.\u2014Cette cause pr\u00e9sente une multiplicit\u00e9 de faits qui rendent d'abord un peu difficile la d\u00e9couverte des points en litige. Il y avait dans l'action des all\u00e9gations de repr\u00e9sentations erron\u00e9es et de d\u00e9faut de consid\u00e9ration qui ont n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 la preuve d'une foule de dates et de circonstances jet\u00e9es un peu p\u00eale-m\u00eale dans le dossier. La cour sup\u00e9rieure a \u00e9galement d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'il y avait eu fraude, et ce jugement a \u00e9t\u00e9 confirm\u00e9 par la cour d'appel. Je dois mentionner cependant que certains juges de la cour d'appel ont virtuellement \u00e9cart\u00e9 la question de fraude. De plus, devant cette cour, l'avocat des demanderesses a reconnu que les \u00e9l\u00e9ments essentiels de la fraude ne paraissaient pas ravoir \u00e9t\u00e9 prouv\u00e9s, et il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 d'ailleurs qu'il n'insistait pas sur ce point.\nJ'ai lu et relu bien attentivement ce dossier, et je vois qu'en effet la preuve ne saurait nous justifier de d\u00e9clarer que Chauret s'est rendu coupable de fraude.\nMais, tout en reconnaissant sa bonne foi, j'en suis venu \u00e0 la conclusion qu'il est responsable envers les demanderesses, soit en vertu de la garantie qui incombe \u00e0 tout vendeur, soit en vertu de la cr\u00e9ance hypoth\u00e9caire qu'il leur devait originairement et qu'elles auraient quittanc\u00e9es sans valide consid\u00e9ration. Les faits n\u00e9cessaires pour l'\u00e9lucidation de la cause au double point de vue que je viens de mentionner sont les suivants:\nDame Marie Joubert et sa fille avaient une hypoth\u00e8que de $5,000 sur le lot n\u00b0 693 du quartier Saint-Louis, \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al qui leur avait \u00e9t\u00e9 consentie par St-Germain, le pr\u00eate-nom de Chauret, comme propri\u00e9taire de ce lot de terre. Il y avait deux autres hypoth\u00e8ques, au montant de $8,500, qui avaient priorit\u00e9. Mais comme la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 valait environ $20,000, les demanderesses avaient raison de consid\u00e9rer leur hypoth\u00e8que comme bien assur\u00e9e.\nChauret, le 19 mai 1916, vendait cette propri\u00e9t\u00e9 n\u00b0 693 au nomm\u00e9 Rabinovitch pour la somme de $22,000 et prenait en paiement une \u00e9gale somme qui \u00e9tait due \u00e0 Rabinovitch par une dame Levitt et qui affectait les lots 671, 474 et 475 du m\u00eame quartier Saint-Louis.\nComme Chauret avait \u00e0 lib\u00e9rer le lot n\u00b0 693 de l'hypoth\u00e8que de dame Joubert et de sa fille, il s'est mis en instances aupr\u00e8s de ces derni\u00e8res, par l'entremise de diff\u00e9rentes personnes en qui elles avaient confiance, pour leur faire accepter en paiement de leur hypoth\u00e8que une somme de $5,000 qui serait prise \u00e0 m\u00eame l'hypoth\u00e8que de $22,000 que madame Levitt devait \u00e0 Rabinovitch. On a repr\u00e9sent\u00e9 \u00e0 dame Joubert et \u00e0 sa fille qu'elles auraient un plus fort taux d'int\u00e9r\u00eat et que leur cr\u00e9ance serait mieux assur\u00e9e, vu qu'elle serait hypoth\u00e9qu\u00e9e sur des immeubles qui valaient environ $75,000 et qu'il n'y avait que $36,000 ayant priorit\u00e9. Alors elles ont sign\u00e9 une quittance lib\u00e9rant le n\u00b0 693 d\u00e9chargeant Chauret, et ce dernier leur a c\u00e9d\u00e9 et transport\u00e9 $5,000 \u00e0 \u00eatre pris sur la cr\u00e9ance Levitt.\nCet acte de transport contient deux dispositions importantes.\nIl est d\u00e9clar\u00e9 d'abord dans cet acte que Chauret c\u00e8de et transporte sans aucune autre garantie que celle de l'existence de la cr\u00e9ance la somme de cinq mille piastres due par Mme Levitt et affectant les lots nos 671, 474 et 475; et \u00e0 la fin de l'acte il est d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que cette somme est transport\u00e9e\naux risques des dites cessionnaires qui d\u00e9clarent \u00eatre contentes et satisfaites de l'hypoth\u00e8que garantissant la somme pr\u00e9sentement transport\u00e9e, sans s'en rapporter d'aucune fa\u00e7on sur la solvabilit\u00e9 du c\u00e9dant en ce qui concerne la somme pr\u00e9sentement transport\u00e9e en capital, int\u00e9r\u00eats et accessoires.\nPar ces actes de quittance et de transport, Chauret se d\u00e9barrassait de son obligation personnelle, qu'il avait contract\u00e9e envers les demanderesses, et il voulait \u00e9videmment \u00e9viter la garantie contre l'\u00e9viction \u00e0 laquelle tout vendeur de cr\u00e9ance est tenu.\nCes clauses, que j'ai cit\u00e9es textuellement et qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 soigneusement mises dans l'acte par son notaire, le notaire D\u00e9rome, ont \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9videmment ins\u00e9r\u00e9es dans ce but. On ne les a pas expliqu\u00e9es aux cessionnaires, mais on s'est simplement content\u00e9 de leur dire que leur hypoth\u00e8que de $5,000 \u00e9tait mieux assur\u00e9e sur les lots 671, 474 et 475 que sur le lot n\u00b0 693. On s'est bien gard\u00e9 de leur mentionner que le cr\u00e9ancier ant\u00e9rieur, Joseph Lamoureux, avait le droit de se pr\u00e9valoir d'une clause r\u00e9solutoire qui aurait pour effet de mettre cette hypoth\u00e8que \u00e0 n\u00e9ant sur les deux lots 474 et 475.\nEn effet, Lamoureux, qui \u00e9tait le bailleur de fonds des lots nos 474 et 475, avait stipul\u00e9, dans son contrat de vente de 1913, que si l'acheteur ne lui payait pas les int\u00e9r\u00eats et le capital du prix de vente, ainsi que les taxes municipales, il pourrait faire r\u00e9silier le contrat de vente qu'il avait consenti. Par l'exercice de l'action r\u00e9solutoire il faisait dispara\u00eetre tous les droits r\u00e9els conc\u00e9d\u00e9s sur ces immeubles par des personnes qui n'en \u00e9taient devenues propri\u00e9taires que subs\u00e9quemment.\nAyant, en novembre 1916, exerc\u00e9 le droit qu'il avait en vertu de cette clause r\u00e9solutoire, Lamoureux obtenait la r\u00e9siliation de la vente, redevenant propri\u00e9taire des lots 474 et 475, et les hypoth\u00e8ques que dame Joubert et sa fille avaient sur ces deux lots \u00e9taient mises \u00e0 n\u00e9ant. (4 Aubry et Rau, p. 80, 4\u00e8me \u00e9dition.)\nNous avons \u00e0 examiner si elles ont un recours en garantie contre Chauret.\nEn vertu de la loi, le vendeur d'une cr\u00e9ance est tenu de garantir \u00e0 l'acqu\u00e9reur qu'elle existe (art. 1576 C.C.). L'article 1693, qui est l'article correspondant du code Napol\u00e9on, dit que celui qui vend une cr\u00e9ance doit en garantir l'existence au temps du transport, quoiqu'il soit fait sans garantie.\nNotre article 1576 n'a pas reproduit les mots \"au temps du transport\" que nous retrouvons dans l'article 1693 du code Napol\u00e9on. Maigre que l'article du code Napol\u00e9on ne soit pas aussi explicite que le n\u00f4tre, on est d'opinion cependant en France que cette garantie couvre m\u00eame des cr\u00e9ances qui auraient une existence juridique lors du transport mais qui serait annul\u00e9e plus tard pour quelques raisons. Guillouard, Vente, vol. 2, p. 363, n\u00b0 829, dit en discutant l'article 1693, apr\u00e8s avoir soulign\u00e9 les mots en garantir l'existence au temps du transport:\nLe c\u00e9dant est garant de droit, disons-nous, de l'existence de la cr\u00e9ance au moment de la cession.\nIl suit de l\u00e0 que si \u00e0 ce moment la cr\u00e9ance est pay\u00e9e, compens\u00e9e, nov\u00e9e, prescrite, en un mot \u00e9teinte par un mode quelconque, le c\u00e9dant sera garant.\nIl en sera de m\u00eame si la cr\u00e9ance a bien une existence juridique lors de la cession, mais qu'elle soit \u00e0 ce moment atteinte d'un vice qui en fasse plus tard prononcer la nullit\u00e9, comme l'incapacit\u00e9 du d\u00e9biteur ou l'irr\u00e9gularit\u00e9 du titre.\nIl ne peut pas y avoir de doute que si la cr\u00e9ance est annul\u00e9e plus tard le c\u00e9dant est tenu d'indemniser son acqu\u00e9reur.\nMais Chauret dit: La garantie que j'ai donn\u00e9e est conventionnelle et ne porte que sur l'existence de la cr\u00e9ance : elle ne touche pas \u00e0 l'existence de l'hypoth\u00e8que.\nQue comporte la vente d'une cr\u00e9ance? Est-ce que cela comprend les hypoth\u00e8ques? L'article 1574 C.C. nous d\u00e9clare que la vente d'une cr\u00e9ance en comprend les accessoires, tels que cautionnement, privil\u00e8ge et hypoth\u00e8que. Le contrat intervenu entre les parties \u00e9non\u00e7ait que cette cr\u00e9ance vendue \u00e9tait hypoth\u00e9caire; et il me para\u00eet bien \u00e9vident, en lisant l'acte et surtout la clause concernant la garantie, que la convention des parties portait surtout sur l'existence de l'hypoth\u00e8que et que la garantie l\u00e9gale ne portait pas seulement sur la cr\u00e9ance elle-m\u00eame.\nMais, dit le d\u00e9fendeur Chauret, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 stipul\u00e9 dans le contrat que le transport \u00e9tait fait aux risques des cessionnaires qui \u00e9taient contentes de l'hypoth\u00e8que qui garantissait la somme transport\u00e9e. Comme je viens de le dire, le c\u00e9dant qui vend une hypoth\u00e8que est oblig\u00e9 en droit de garantir l'existence de cette hypoth\u00e8que. La stipulation de non garantie ne portait que sur la suffisance de l'hypoth\u00e8que et voulait dire que si la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 ne se vendait pas \u00e0 une somme assez \u00e9lev\u00e9e pour payer les cessionnaires, ces derni\u00e8res auraient \u00e0 en souffrir; mais cette stipulation ne saurait affecter l'existence de l'hypoth\u00e8que elle-m\u00eame. Beaudry-Lacantinerie, dans son trait\u00e9 de la vente, au n\u00b0 401, 3\u00e8me \u00e9dition, dit que la clause g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de non garantie est une d\u00e9rogation au droit commun et qu'il faut revenir au droit commun chaque fois que la clause de non garantie est douteuse.\nJe citerai sur ce point un arr\u00eat de la cour d'Orl\u00e9ans confirm\u00e9 par la cour de Cassation (Dalloz, 1859, 1, 125) et qui se lit comme suit:\nAttendu, en droit, que la vente ou cession d'une cr\u00e9ance comprend tous les accessoires de la cr\u00e9ance, tels que caution, privil\u00e8ge et hypoth\u00e8que; que celui qui vend une cr\u00e9ance doit garantir l'existence, au moment du transport, non seulement de la cr\u00e9ance elle-m\u00eame, mais encore de l'accessoire l\u00e9gal ou conventionnel qui y est attach\u00e9; que cette garantie est de la nature du contrat; qu'elle est due par le vendeur, m\u00eame en l'absencede toute stipulation, parce qu'il ne peut se dispenser de livrer ce qu'il a promis sans s'exposer aux cons\u00e9quences de la condition r\u00e9solutoire, toujours sous-entendue dans les contrats synallagmatiques; que si, en mati\u00e8re de transport de cr\u00e9ances, la simple garantie de droit, exprim\u00e9e-ou non exprim\u00e9e, n'emporte pas l'obligation de r\u00e9pondre de la solvabilit\u00e9 du d\u00e9biteur, du moins est-il constant que le vendeur est tenu des \u00e9victions dont il y aurait une cause ou un germe existant d\u00e8s le temps du contrat, soit qu'elles proc\u00e8dent, soit qu'elles ne proc\u00e8dent pas du fait, du vendeur.\nJe citerai aussi Aubry & Rau, 4\u00e8me \u00e9dition, p. 442, o\u00f9 il dit:\nLe c\u00e9dant est, ind\u00e9pendamment de toute convention sp\u00e9ciale, tenu de garantir l'existence et la l\u00e9gitimit\u00e9 de la cr\u00e9ance, ainsi que son droit de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 au moment du transport. Il y a donc lieu \u00e0 garantie, non seulement dans le cas o\u00f9 la cr\u00e9ance c\u00e9d\u00e9e se trouvait d\u00e9j\u00e0, au moment du transport, soit frapp\u00e9e de prescription, soit \u00e9teinte par compensation, ou tout autre mode de lib\u00e9ration, et dans celui o\u00f9 elle n'appartenait pas au c\u00e9dant, mais encore lorsque le titre dont elle proc\u00e8de vient \u00e0 \u00eatre annul\u00e9 ou rescind\u00e9.\nVoir art. 1545-1088-1085-2038-2081 C.C.\nLe droit hypoth\u00e9caire c\u00e9d\u00e9 par le d\u00e9fendeur Chauret aux demanderesses \u00e9tant disparu par la r\u00e9solution du droit conditionnel ou pr\u00e9caire de celui qui avait consenti l'hypoth\u00e8que, il en r\u00e9sulte que les demanderesses ont le droit de se tourner contre leur c\u00e9dant et d'exercer l'action en garantie. Elles peuvent obtenir la restitution du prix ou des dommages (art. 1510, 1511 C.C.). La restitution du prix, dans le cas actuel, c'est l'hypoth\u00e8que qu'elles avaient sur le lot 693. C'est ce \u00e0 quoi Chauret a \u00e9t\u00e9 justement condamn\u00e9 par les cours inf\u00e9rieures.\nM\u00eame s'il y avait doute sur le droit des demanderesses d'exercer l'action en garantie, je consid\u00e8re que les demanderesses, dame Marie Joubert et sa fille, devraient r\u00e9ussir \u00e0 faire annuler la quittance et le transport de cr\u00e9ance qu'elles ont respectivement sign\u00e9s et accept\u00e9s.\nComme je l'ai d\u00e9montr\u00e9 plus haut, les demanderesses ont quittanc\u00e9 le d\u00e9fendeur et radi\u00e9 leur hypoth\u00e8que sur le n\u00b0 693 parce que ce dernier leur c\u00e9dait une cr\u00e9ance hypoth\u00e9caire sur les nos 671, 474 et 475. C'\u00e9tait, en d'autres termes, un \u00e9change de cr\u00e9ances hypoth\u00e9caires que les parties faisaient et elles avaient en vue l'hypoth\u00e8que comme \u00e9tant la qualit\u00e9 substantielle de la chose vendue et c\u00e9d\u00e9e. La consid\u00e9ration de la quittance sign\u00e9e par les demanderesses est donc le transport de la cr\u00e9ance hypoth\u00e9caire que Chauret avait sur les lots 671, 474 et 475.\nJe veux croire que Chauret \u00e9tait absolument de bonne foi quand il a transport\u00e9 cette cr\u00e9ance hypoth\u00e9caire affectant ces derniers lots. Les parties aux contrats \u00e9taient tous sous l'impression que cette hypoth\u00e8que \u00e9tait valide et n'\u00e9tait pas sujette \u00e0 une condition r\u00e9solutoire. Il me para\u00eet bien clair que si dame Joubert et sa fille avaient connu que cette hypoth\u00e8que \u00e9tait sujette \u00e0 une condition r\u00e9solutoire elles n'auraient pas donn\u00e9 leur quittance et elles n'auraient pas accept\u00e9 le transport de cr\u00e9ance en question. Leur consentement est donc vici\u00e9 et on doit dire alors que ces contrats sont annulables pour d\u00e9faut de consid\u00e9ration, ou plut\u00f4t pour cause erron\u00e9e. Colin et Capitant, vol. 2, pages 293-296; Pothier, Obligations, n\u00b0 17; Larombi\u00e8re, Theorie et pratique des obligations, sur art. 1110.\nLa jurisprudence en France, dans une cause rapport\u00e9e dans Sirey, 1898. 2. 131, a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que\nle contrat de cession de cr\u00e9ance, bien qu'il soit fait sans garantie, emporte pour le c\u00e9dant l'obligation de d\u00e9livrer au cessionnaire tout ce qu'il lui a promis. Chauret, dans le cas actuel, avait promis de livrer une cr\u00e9ance hypoth\u00e9caire. Or, par l'exercice d'une action r\u00e9solutoire de la part du bailleur de fonds, cette cr\u00e9ance est disparue et l'effet de cette r\u00e9solution est r\u00e9troactif (art. 1085 C.C.). Il n'a donc pas livr\u00e9 ce qu'il avait contract\u00e9.\nPour toutes ces raisons, l'appel doit \u00eatre renvoy\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens.\nMignault J.\u2014Le dossier r\u00e9v\u00e8le un \u00e9tat de choses assez extraordinaire et certainement d'une grande complication.\nLes intim\u00e9es, madame Lecompte et sa fille Blanche Lecompte, avaient une cr\u00e9ance de $5,000 assur\u00e9e par une troisi\u00e8me hypoth\u00e8que sur l'immeuble portant le n\u00b0 693 du cadastre du quartier Saint-Louis, \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al. Le 7 octobre 1915, cet immeuble fut vendu par le sh\u00e9rif et l'appelant s'en porta adjudicataire pour le prix de $11,997.10, selon le factum de l'appelant, le certificat de recherches dit $12,525.00. Le titre du sh\u00e9rif porte la date du 22 mars 1916, mais avant cette date, le 7 d\u00e9cembre 1915, l'appelant vendit l'immeuble n\u00b0 693 au nomm\u00e9 Georges St-Germain, qu'on a dit \u00e0 l'audition, sans contradiction par l'appelant, avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 le pr\u00eate-nom de ce dernier. Le prix de vente \u00e9tait $12,500.00, dont $4,000.00 comptant et $8,500.00 payables au vendeur. Le m\u00eame jour, 7 d\u00e9cembre 1915, l'appelant transporta $6,000.00 \u00e0 prendre sur les $8,500.00 au nomm\u00e9 M\u00e9dard Th\u00e9oret. Le 19 mai 1916, St-Germain revendit le n\u00b0 693 \u00e0 l'appelant pour le prix de $1,000.00, dit avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 pay\u00e9 comptant, et de plus sujet \u00e0 une hypoth\u00e8que de $6,000.00, balance des $8,500.00 susdits. Le m\u00eame jour, le 19 mai 1916, l'appelant vendit le n\u00b0 693 au nomm\u00e9 George Rabinovitch, pour $15,000.00, que le contrat d\u00e9clare avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 pay\u00e9s comptant, et de plus \u00e0 la charge de ladite somme de $6,000.00, balance des $8,500.00.\nDans sa d\u00e9fense, l'appelant all\u00e8gue que cette vente \u00e0 Rabinovitch n\u00e9cessitait le d\u00e9gr\u00e8vement partiel du n\u00b0 693. Dans son t\u00e9moignage, il d\u00e9clare que St-Germain faisait un \u00e9change avec Rabinovitch lui donnant le n\u00b0 693 contre les num\u00e9ros 671, 474 et 475 du m\u00eame quartier St-Louis. St-Germain, le 7 d\u00e9cembre 1915, le jour de son achat de l'appelant, avait consenti, devant le notaire Gratton, une obligation hypoth\u00e9caire de $5,000.00 en faveur des intim\u00e9s sur le n\u00b0 693, cette hypoth\u00e8que devant \u00eatre subs\u00e9quente \u00e0 une hypoth\u00e8que de $8,500.00. Il est \u00e0 remarquer que la vente de l'appelant \u00e0 St-Germain, le transport par l'appelant \u00e0 Th\u00e9oret, et l'obligation de St-Germain en faveur des intim\u00e9es ont eu lieu le m\u00eame jour. Il appert au t\u00e9moignage de l'appelant qu'au moment de la vente du sh\u00e9rif il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 convenu entre l'appelant et le notaire Gratton, qui repr\u00e9sentait les intim\u00e9es, que celles-ci, au lieu de r\u00e9clamer sur le prix de vente, consentiraient \u00e0 prendre une hypoth\u00e8que de $5,000.00 sur le n\u00b0 693. Les intim\u00e9es ont \u00e9t\u00e9 colloqu\u00e9es au jugement de distribution pour $4,030.99, mais elles ont renonc\u00e9 \u00e0 cette collocation pour prendre la garantie hypoth\u00e9caire susdite. En faisant consentir cette obligation de $5,000.00 en faveur des intim\u00e9es par son pr\u00eate-nom St-Germain, l'appelant \u00e9chappait donc \u00e0 la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 de payer aux intim\u00e9es le montant de leur collocation.\nLes intim\u00e9es avaient encore cette hypoth\u00e8que lorsque l'appelant vendit le n\u00b0 693 \u00e0 Rabinovitch. Mais il fallait, comme il l'all\u00e8gue dans sa d\u00e9fense, faire d\u00e9grever partiellement cet immeuble. A cet effet, l'appelant ayant obtenu, le 19 mai 1916, de Rabinovitch un transport de $22,000.00 \u00e0 prendre avec pr\u00e9f\u00e9rence sur une somme de $39,000.00, portant int\u00e9r\u00eat \u00e0 7%, que devait \u00e0 Rabinovitch une veuve Levitt, affectant les lots nos 671, 474 et 475 susdits, comme balance du prix de vente de ces lots, l'appelant fit proposer aux intim\u00e9es d'abandonner leur hypoth\u00e8que de $5,000.00 sur le n\u00b0 693 et d'accepter \u00e0 la place le transport de $5,000.00 \u00e0 prendre sur cette somme de $22,000.00, leur donnant ainsi un int\u00e9r\u00eat de 7% au lieu de 6% que comportait l'obligation de St-Germain.\nMalheureusement pour les intim\u00e9es elles se laiss\u00e8rent persuader, et ce transport fut fait devant le notaire D\u00e9rome le 23 mai 1916. On peut noter la co\u00efncidence des dates, la vente du n\u00b0 693 par St-Germain \u00e0 l'appelant, la vente de cet immeuble par l'appelant \u00e0 Rabinovitch, et le transport des $22,000.00 par Rabinovitch \u00e0 l'appelant ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 faits le m\u00eame jour, 19 mai 1916. L'entente sans doute \u00e9tait que l'appelant ferait d\u00e9grever le n\u00b0 693 qu'il vendait \u00e0 Rabinovitch. Ceci d\u00e9montre bien l'int\u00e9r\u00eat de l'appelant, que les avocats de celui-ci mettaient en doute lors de l'audition, \u00e0 faire consentir les intim\u00e9es \u00e0 abandonner leur hypoth\u00e8que sur le n\u00b0 693. Du reste, peu importe l'int\u00e9r\u00eat de l'appelant, car, telle que je l'envisage, cette cause ne pr\u00e9sente qu'une question de droit, savoir, l'effet de la garantie que l'appelant a donn\u00e9e aux intim\u00e9es.\nIl faut s'arr\u00eater un instant \u00e0 l'acte de vente des num\u00e9ros 671, 474 et 475, en date du 27 avril 1916, par George Rabinovitch \u00e0 Mme Levitt, pass\u00e9 devant le notaire D\u00e9rome, qui a cr\u00e9\u00e9 la cr\u00e9ance de $39,000 dont $22,000.000 ont \u00e9t\u00e9 transport\u00e9s \u00e0 l'appelant par Rabinovitch. Cet acte d\u00e9clare que les propri\u00e9t\u00e9s vendues sont affect\u00e9es de plusieurs hypoth\u00e8ques non d\u00e9charg\u00e9es, se montant en tout \u00e0 $136,916.60, outre les $39,000.00, balance du prix de vente. Le transport des $22,000.00 par Rabinovitch \u00e0 l'appelant n'est pas au dossier, il n'y en a qu'une note au certificat de recherches, et on ne sait pas quelle garantie elle comportait.\nC'est avec quelque difficult\u00e9 que j'ai pu tirer du dossier les renseignements que je viens de donner, car la cause n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 bien faite. Il faut avoir recours tant\u00f4t aux actes produits, tant\u00f4t aux r\u00e9sum\u00e9s d'actes non produits mais mentionn\u00e9s aux certificats de recherches, et surtout comparer les dates, pour mettre en \u00e9vidence les faits saillants de cette cause qui, on peut le dire, lui donnent une physionomie toute particuli\u00e8re.\nC'est dans les circonstances que j'ai relat\u00e9es, et toujours dans le but de d\u00e9grever le n\u00b0 693, ce qui rendait possible la transaction entre Rabinovitch et l'appelant, que celui-ci s'est adress\u00e9 aux intim\u00e9es. Madame Lecompte dit qu'on lui a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 un acte de transport tout sign\u00e9: l'appelant n'est pas s\u00fbr, mais croit avoir sign\u00e9 avant les intim\u00e9es, et sa signature est la premi\u00e8re \u00e0 l'acte. Cet acte fut pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 \u00e0 Madame Lecompte par le notaire D\u00e9rome, qui devait le recevoir, le notaire Gratton et un jeune avocat du nom d'Allan, ces deux derniers \u00e9tant suppos\u00e9s \u00eatre les \"aviseurs l\u00e9gaux\" des intim\u00e9es. Ces messieurs n'ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 entendus comme t\u00e9moins, autrement on saurait pourquoi ils ont conseill\u00e9 aux intim\u00e9es d'abandonner leur hypoth\u00e8que sur le n\u00b0 693. Il est peut-\u00eatre permis de supposer qu'on leur a repr\u00e9sent\u00e9 que les hypoth\u00e8ques d\u00e9clar\u00e9es \u00e0 l'acte de vente entre Rabinovitch et Mme Levitt avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 radi\u00e9es, car autrement le conseil qu'ils ont donn\u00e9 aux intim\u00e9es ne serait pas le fait le moins remarquable de cette cause assez extraordinaire.\nEt quant \u00e0 ces hypoth\u00e8ques, \u00e0 l'exception de celle de Lamoureux qui \u00e9tait le vendeur originaire, Mme Levitt avait obtenu du juge Bruneau, le 12 mai 1916, un jugement de radiation, mais, chose assur\u00e9ment bien extraordinaire, elle s'est d\u00e9sist\u00e9e de ce jugement, et le 14 juillet 1916, elle faisait rendre par le juge Martineau un jugement lui donnant acte de son d\u00e9sistement et ordonnant au registrateur de faire dispara\u00eetre les radiations faites en vertu du jugement du juge Bruneau. Lors de l'enqu\u00eate, Mme Levitt \u00e9tait d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9e et nous n'avons aucune explication du motif de son d\u00e9sistement.\nLes intim\u00e9es ont accept\u00e9 l'acte de transport pr\u00e9par\u00e9 \u00e0 la demande de l'appelant et le m\u00eame jour, par acte pass\u00e9 devant le notaire Gratton, elles ont donn\u00e9 quittance \u00e0 St-Germain, c'est-\u00e0-dire \u00e0 l'appelant dont il \u00e9tait le pr\u00eate-nom, de l'obligation de $5,000.00 assur\u00e9e par hypoth\u00e8que sur le n\u00b0 693. Leur garantie par le transport \u00e9tait une hypoth\u00e8que sur les num\u00e9ros 671, 474 et 475 du quartier St-Louis.\nJ'analyserai rapidement cet acte de transport du 23 mai, 1916. L'appelant y compara\u00eet et d\u00e9clare qu'il c\u00e8de et transporte aux intim\u00e9es \"sans autre garantie que celle de l'existence de la cr\u00e9ance\", la somme de $5,000.00 \u00e0 prendre apr\u00e8s $6,000.00, d\u00e9j\u00e0 transport\u00e9s ou \u00e0 \u00eatre transport\u00e9s \u00e0 Ludger Legault sur la somme de $22,000.00 transport\u00e9e au c\u00e9dant par George Rabinovitch et faisant partie du prix de vente d\u00fb \u00e0 Rabinovitch par dame Jacob Levitt, laquelle somme, dit l'acte de transport, affecte les immeubles suivants (suit la description des lots nos 671, 474 et 475). L'acte de transport expose que les cessionnaires d\u00e9clarent avoir pris communication de l'acte de vente entre Rabinovitch et Mme Levitt, en avoir compris les termes, clauses et conditions et en \u00eatre satisfaits. Et le c\u00e9dant subroge les cessionnaires dans tous droits, actions, privil\u00e8ges et hypoth\u00e8ques r\u00e9sultant des actes relat\u00e9s jusqu'\u00e0 concurrence de la somme transport\u00e9e, mais aux risques des dites cessionnaires qui d\u00e9clarent \u00eatre contentes et satisfaites de l'hypoth\u00e8que garantissant la somme pr\u00e9sentement transport\u00e9e, sans s'en rapporter d'aucune fa\u00e7on sur la solvabilit\u00e9 du c\u00e9dant.\nSuit une acceptation du transport par Mme Levitt.\nMme Lecompte et sa fille Mlle Lecompte affirment qu'on ne leur a pas donn\u00e9 communication de l'acte de vente entre Rabinovitch et Mme Levitt. On s'est object\u00e9 \u00e0 cette preuve pour la raison qu'on ne peut contredire un acte authentique que par inscription en faux et non autrement. Mais l'acte de transport se contente de dire que les intim\u00e9es ont d\u00e9clar\u00e9 avoir eu communication de cet acte de vente, le notaire ne dit pas qu'il leur a donn\u00e9 cette communication. La preuve faite ne contredit donc pas les d\u00e9clarations du notaire. mais seulement une d\u00e9claration d'une des parties, et l'inscription en faux n'\u00e9tait pas n\u00e9cessaire.\nOn le voit, l'appelant prenait toutes les pr\u00e9cautions possibles pour laisser les intim\u00e9es sans recours contre lui. Mais il a garanti l'existence de la cr\u00e9ance et l'acte d\u00e9clare que cette cr\u00e9ance affecte les immeubles d\u00e9crits en l'acte. Du reste, la garantie de l'existence d'une cr\u00e9ance comprend tous les accessoires de cette cr\u00e9ance et partant les hypoth\u00e8ques qui en assurent le paiement (Baudry-Lacantinerie, Vente, n\u00b0 820). Voyez aussi l'article 1574, code civil.\nMais l'appelant cherche \u00e0 affaiblir la garantie qu'il a donn\u00e9e de l'existence de la cr\u00e9ance en invoquant la clause cit\u00e9e plus haut par laquelle la subrogation aux privil\u00e8ges et hypoth\u00e8ques est faite aux risques des intim\u00e9es. C'est une question d'interpr\u00e9tation de l'acte, et, toujours en interpr\u00e9tant un acte d'apr\u00e8s les circonstances de l'esp\u00e8ce, on a pu d\u00e9cider en France que la clause limitant la garantie \u00e0 l'existence de la cr\u00e9ance ne comprenait pas la garantie de l'existence des hypoth\u00e8ques (Dalloz, 1873.1.407; 1874.1.75). Mais ici les circonstances de l'esp\u00e8ce d\u00e9montrent que ce que les parties avaient en vue c'\u00e9tait l'\u00e9change d'une garantie hypoth\u00e9caire pour une autre garantie hypoth\u00e9caire, et l'existence de cette derni\u00e8re garantie hypoth\u00e9caire \u00e9tait la consid\u00e9ration principale du consentement donn\u00e9 par les intim\u00e9es \u00e0 l'\u00e9change que leur proposait l'appelant. La clause de subrogation o\u00f9 se trouvent les mots \"mais aux risques des dites cessionnaires\" ajoute qu'elles se d\u00e9clarent contentes et satisfaites de l'hypoth\u00e8que garantissant la somme pr\u00e9sentement transport\u00e9e.\nPeut-on soutenir que la garantie de l'existence de la cr\u00e9ance ne comprenait pas, dans l'intention des parties, l'existence de l'hypoth\u00e8que elle-m\u00eame? Je ne le crois pas.\nC'est, du reste, je l'ai dit, une question d'interpr\u00e9tation de l'acte, et pour ma part,\u2014nonobstant les articles 1013 et suivants du code civil, qui, comme le disent les codificateurs, ne sont pas des r\u00e8gles imp\u00e9ratives mais seulement l'indication d'un moyen de d\u00e9terminer le sens d'un contrat\u2014je ne puis donner le b\u00e9n\u00e9fice du doute, si doute il y a, \u00e0 l'appelant dont la conduite dans toute cette affaire me para\u00eet pour le moins suspecte. L'appelant est un homme de profession et l'acte a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9par\u00e9 d'apr\u00e8s ses instructions et envoy\u00e9 tout sign\u00e9 aux intim\u00e9es qui ne paraissent pas bien expertes en affaires. J'interpr\u00e8te donc l'acte de transport comme garantissant l'existence de la cr\u00e9ance et de ses accessoires, c'est-\u00e0-dire l'existence de l'hypoth\u00e8que, mais comme laissant aux intim\u00e9es le risque de la suffisance de cette hypoth\u00e8que, si elle existait r\u00e9ellement au jour du transport.\nOr voici ce qui est arriv\u00e9 quant aux immeubles 474 et 475. Ces immeubles avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 originairement vendus par le nomm\u00e9 Joseph Lamoureux aux nomm\u00e9s Isaac Kauffman et Louis Raich avec une clause r\u00e9solutoire d\u00e9clarant que faute de paiement de la balance du prix de vente et de tout versement d'int\u00e9r\u00eat ainsi que des taxes, la vente serait ipso facto nulle et de nul effet au choix du vendeur. Le 13 novembre 1916, Lamoureux poursuivit Kauffman et Raich, mettant en cause tous les acqu\u00e9reurs subs\u00e9quents, y compris Rabinovitch et les h\u00e9ritiers de Mme Levitt, et demandant, en ex\u00e9cution de cette condition r\u00e9solutoire, l'annulation de la vente \u00e0 Kauffman et Raich et de toutes les ventes subs\u00e9quentes, y comprise la vente entre Rabinovitch et Mme Levitt. Jugement fut rendu le 15 janvier 1917, annulant toutes ces ventes.\nIl est \u00e9l\u00e9mentaire de dire que la condition r\u00e9solutoire s'op\u00e8re r\u00e9troactivement. Les ventes sont donc annul\u00e9es d\u00e8s l'instant qu'elles ont \u00e9t\u00e9 consenties, et toutes les hypoth\u00e8ques constitu\u00e9es par ces actes de vente sont cens\u00e9es n'avoir jamais exist\u00e9. L'appelant ayant garanti l'existence de la cr\u00e9ance et de l'hypoth\u00e8que et cette hypoth\u00e8que n'ayant jamais eu d'existence, il y a ouverture \u00e0 son obligation de garantie (Baudry-Lacantinrie, Vente no\u00b0 818. On ne peut objecter que l'appelant a vendu tout le droit qu'il avait, et partant, un droit conditionnel, que ce droit conditionnel existait lors du transport et que son obligation de garantir l'existence de la cr\u00e9ance a \u00e9t\u00e9 remplie par lui. Cette objection ne tient pas compte du principe qui domine la garantie en mati\u00e8re de vente, et qui rend le vendeur garant de l'\u00e9viction subs\u00e9quente \u00e0 la vente mais dont la cause lui est ant\u00e9rieure. C'est ainsi que l'acheteur d'un immeuble, \u00e9vinc\u00e9 par un pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent vendeur qui obtient la r\u00e9solution de la vente, a droit \u00e0 garantie (Baudry-Lacantinerie, Vente n\u00b0 352).\nIl est vrai qu'il restait encore l'immeuble n\u00b0 671, mais cet immeuble para\u00eet avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 vendu pour les taxes municipales et avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 achet\u00e9 par Lamoureux, qui \u00e9tait le premier cr\u00e9ancier hypoth\u00e9caire, pour $1,000.00. Il suffit d'ailleurs \u00e0 mon avis que les hypoth\u00e8ques sur les nos 474 et 475 soient inexistantes pour donner lieu \u00e0 la garantie qui incombe \u00e0 l'appelant.\nDans toutes les circonstances de cette cause, je ne puis donner raison \u00e0 l'appelant dans l'action intent\u00e9e contre lui par les intim\u00e9es. Il s'est fait d\u00e9charger d'une obligation valable contract\u00e9e pour lui par son pr\u00eate-nom St-Germain, et dont les intim\u00e9es auraient \u00e9t\u00e9 pay\u00e9es, si elles n'avaient pas accept\u00e9 le transport que leur a fait l'appelant. On peut dire qu'\u00e0 la demande de l'appelant, et comptant sur sa garantie de l'existence de la cr\u00e9ance hypoth\u00e9caire Rabinovitch, les intim\u00e9es ont l\u00e2ch\u00e9 la proie pour l'ombre. L'appelant a peut-\u00eatre \u00e9t\u00e9 tr\u00e8s habile, mais pas au point, \u00e0 mon avis, de priver les intim\u00e9es de la garantie de l'existence de la chose qu'il leur transportait. Et cette garantie suffit pour appuyer le jugement dont est appel.\nJe suis d'opinion que l'appel devrait \u00eatre renvoy\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: Louis Boyer.\nSolicitors for the respondents: P\u00e9lissier, Wilson & Fortier.\n",

His conviction was quashed by the Court of Appeal, which held section 215 of the Grain Act to be ultra vires of the Dominion Parliament. An application for special leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada was refused by the Court of Appeal on the ground that the case fell within the decision of the Judicial Committee in The King v. Nat Bell Liquors[2] and that there would, therefore, be no jurisdiction to entertain the appeal if leave were granted.\nTaylor K.C., for the appellant contended that by the proviso to section 41 (1) of the Supreme Court Act the Supreme Court of Canada is empowered to grant special leave to appeal \"in any case whatever\", if the validity of an Act of Parliament (inter alia) will be involved in the appeal, and that the court can, therefore, grant leave in cases in which the provincial appellate court could not do so.\nThe defendant was not represented.\nTaylor K.C., for the appellant\nThe defendant was not represented.\nThe Judgment of the Court was delivered by:\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014The majority of the court is of the opinion that the proposed appeal would be an appeal in a criminal cause within the exception in section 36 of the Supreme Court Act. The proviso to section 41 (1) enabling this court to grant special leave to appeal only \"if special leave to appeal has been refused by the highest court of final resort in the province\" implies that the application of the proviso is limited to cases in which the provincial court might properly have given such leave and is, therefore, notwithstanding the generality of the words \"in any case whatever\", restricted to cases within section 36.\nThe application is accordingly refused.

The cause of the fire can only be conjectured and is not proved by direct evidence. See Montreal Rolling Mills v. Corcoran[1]; Canada Paint Co. v. Trainor[2].\nIt is not a case of res ipsa loquitur. Grand Trunk Ry. Co. v. Griffith[3] ; McArthur v. Dominion Cartridge Co.[4].\nMilner K.C. for the respondents. Under the facts proved the inference as to the cause of the fire and the consequent negligence of the defendants is almost irresistible. See Swansea Vale v. Rice[5] per Lord Loreburn; Richard Evans & Co. v. Astley[6] at page 678. Jenks K.C. and McKenzie K.C. for the appellants.\nMilner K.C. for the respondents.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014After hearing the argument at bar I felt very doubtful whether the plaintiffs respondents had established their case.\nA careful reading of the evidence did not remove my doubts.\nThe trial judge dismissed the action as against Landels, one of the original defendants, and from that dismissal there was no appeal. As against the other two defendants the trial judge found\nthat the facts proved were more consistent with negligence on their part than with a mere accident,\nand that\nthere was sufficient evidence of negligence to enable the plaintiffs to recover.\nI confess that if I had been trying the action in the first instance, I would have found great difficulty in reaching such a conclusion, but the case was appealed to the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia sitting en banc and four of the five judges who heard the appeal dismissed it, and so confirmed the judgment of the trial judge on the ground, as I understand their judgments, that the trial judge's decision\nthat the available facts were such that an inference of negligence was more reasonable than that there was no negligence\nwas correct.\nI do not feel, however, so clearly convinced that this inference drawn by the two courts was such an improper one as to justify me in reversing it and allowing the appeal.\nIdington J.\u2014I think this appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDuff J.\u2014I cannot agree that the learned trial judge had not before him facts capable of supporting a finding against the appellants. There was evidence which, if believed, supplied a possible explanation of the origin of the fire in the probability of there being hot ashes in the boiler room. The dismissal of the action as against Landels presents a difficulty but the trial judge seems to have treated the action against Landels as based upon the assumption that he was a party to the contract of hiring and consequently as failing when that assumption fell.\nOther explanations were suggested but there was nothing in the facts pointing to any of them as an agency actually or probably operative and my conclusion is that there is sufficient preponderance of probability in the circumstances proved in favour of the trial judge's conclusion to cast the burden of explanation upon the appellants\u2014a burden of which the trial judge held they have not acquitted themselves.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAnglin J.\u2014With some doubt I concur in the dismissal of this appeal. I am not satisfied that the learned trial judge and the majority of the learned judges on appeal were clearly wrong in holding that, upon such facts as the evidence discloses, it is a more reasonable inference that the fire, which destroyed the plaintiff's mill, was attributable to some negligence of the defendant's than that it was due to some cause for which blame cannot be imputed. If the matter were res integra the contrary view taken by the learned Chief Justice of Nova Scotia would not improbably commend itself to my judgment.\nBrodeur J.\u2014The appellants as lessees of the mill belonging to the respondents Christie were bound to exercise care and see that no risk would, in the ordinary course of events, ensue. The fire which destroyed this mill is due to circumstances which render the cause of it unknown. But the evidence in the record is such that a reasonable inference leads us to the conclusion that the fire is due to the negligence of the lessees.\nIt is the conclusion reached by the trial judge and by the majority of the court en banc.\nThe lessees had left live ashes on the floor which could easily be carried by the wind to the place where the fire was first seen. No person was left there to look after the building. I would not go so far as to say that the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur should apply, because all the surrounding circumstances are not entirely within the defendants' control and the fire might be the result of a simple accident or the work of an incendiary. But the facts available are such that negligence on the part of the defendants is the more reasonable inference (Halsbury, Laws of England, vol. 21, p. 752).\nThis appeal then should be dismissed with costs.\nMignault J.\u2014This case comes here after two courts have found the appellants, Fauquier and Porter, liable for the destruction by fire of respondents' mill at River H\u00e9bert, N.S. In the appellate court the learned Chief Justice dissented, but the other judges, not however without expressing some doubt, confirmed the judgment of the trial judge who sat without a jury.\nThe respondents claimed from George Landels and from Gilbert E. Fauquier and Johnson P. Porter, carrying on business under the firm name of Fauquier and Porter, $158 for the use of a saw mill in sawing 316,000 feet of lumber, and damages for the destruction by fire of another saw mill belonging to the respondents, alleging further that the appellants had agreed to rebuild the mill. Landels, acting on behalf of Fauquier and Porter, had entered into an agreement with the respondents for the use of their mill to saw lumber belonging to Fauquier and Porter for the price of 50 cents per thousand feet. This mill was destroyed by fire on November 27th, 1917, while in the occupation of the appellants. The latter paid for the lumber which they had sawn up to the time of the fire, and the following spring erected a new but smaller mill on the same location where they cut some 316,000 feet of lumber. Regarding the new mill as belonging to the respondents by annexation to the freehold, the learned trial judge condemned Fauquier and Porter to pay $158 for this sawing, and $2,757 as damages for the destruction of the mill, in all $2,915. The action was dismissed as to Landels because he had acted as agent for Fauquier and Porter, the learned trial judge apparently not considering whether or not he was personally liable for the destruction of the mill. The respondents did not appeal from the dismissal of the action with respect to Landels. I see no reason for disturbing the judgment as to the item of $158 for use of the new mill which must be considered as belonging to the respondents.\nThe difficulty is as to the damages granted for the destruction of the old mill. The respondents alleged in their statement of claim that the appellants so negligently conducted themselves, or their agent and servant Landels so negligently conducted himself, as to cause a fire in \"the mill by reason of which it was totally destroyed. As I have said, the action was dismissed as to Landels and no appeal was taken from that part of the judgment. The appellants contend that if Landels is not liable for negligence his principals cannot be so held. I would not however deal with the case on so narrow a ground, for the liability of Landels was not considered by the learned trial judge, and the other defendants could have been sued without there being any necessity to make their agent a party to the proceedings.\nAs to the other defendants, I think the onus was clearly on the plaintiffs to prove negligence. Apparently the plaintiffs considered that it would be sufficient to establish the mere fact of the fire, for that is all they did. The learned trial judge however refused to dismiss the action at the close of the plaintiffs' case, probably because some proof had been made of a promise by the defendants to rebuild the mill. The defendants then called witnesses to testify to the circumstances of the fire and it is on that evidence alone that their liability must now be determined.\nThe conclusions of the learned trial judge on the issue of negligence may be given in his own words:\nMr. Milner contends that the defendants are liable for the loss of the mill; that this is one of the cases where the occurrence is itself evidence of negligence; and moreover, that the defendants were negligent in not having proper appliances to put out fires, and in not having a watchman on duty during the night. Mr. McKenzie for the defendants claims that the maxim res ipsa loquitur does not apply and that there is no evidence of negligence on the part of defendants. Taking all the circumstances into consideration, I think the facts proved are more consistent with negligence on the part of the defendants than with a mere accident. I think that there is sufficient evidence of negligence to enable the plaintiffs to recover.\nThis passage of the learned trial judge's reasons for judgment was much discussed at bar, but I think a fair construction is that in the opinion of the learned judge, taking all the circumstances into consideration, the negligence of the defendants was more consistent with the proved facts than that the fire was caused by a mere accident. It is true that there is no finding as to the specific act of negligence which caused the fire, but that is no reason why the whole evidence should not be carefully examined to see whether the learned trial judge could find it more consistent with the liability of the defendants than with the theory that the fire was an accidental one.\nNone of the learned judges in the appellate court thought that the mere fact of the fire was prima facie evidence of negligence and I quite agree with them. This disposes of the so called rule res ipsa loquitur as applicable to a case like the one under consideration. And had the learned trial judge, at the close of the plaintiff's case, decided the issue of negligence in favour of the defendants, I would have thought that his judgment could not have been assailed. Of course the evidence adduced by the defendants must be considered on this appeal.\nWe have now before us all the circumstances of the fire and both courts have inferred negligence therefrom. The defendants had been in possession of the mill for about a week, Landels having been placed in control of their sawing operations. The boiler with its furnace was in a shed alongside the main building and the engine room was in the centre of the mill. There were no lamps and the men worked as long as daylight permitted. On the evening in question the men left the mill between five and half-past five. Avard Christie, the fireman, went away with the others but returned about six o'clock, or a little later, and filled the boiler with water. Landels went to the mill at about a quarter to nine. He says he went into the boiler (probably the boiler room) as far as the injector and had a look around. He found that the boiler was warm and that everything was quiet. He then left to go to the cook house but being called by Mr. Christie, one of the plaintiffs, he went into his house, and had been there but a few minutes when Mr. Christie looked out the window and said the mill was on fire. They ran out and first saw the fire at the back of the boiler on the side of the mill proper. Nothing could then be done to save the building and in about fifteen minutes, Landel says, it was all over.\nThe impression which the evidence leaves on my mind is that the fire was caused by the hot ashes which the practice, McClary, the engineer, testifies, was to leave in front of the furnace, right in the building, after throwing water on them to extinguish the flames. These ashes were not carried outside as it would have been prudent to do. The night of the fire was quite windy and the mill was all open, McClary says, so the wind no doubt could reach the pile of ashes and scatter embers about. The fire was first seen at the back of the boiler, and the fact that no other cause of fire is suggested renders it probable that the fire was ignited by the hot ashes. The furnace had been cleaned out some time that day, the usual practice as to the ashes no doubt having been followed.\nUnder these circumstances, the inference appears reasonable that the fire was caused by these hot ashes. It was negligence to leave them at night where they were and where the wind could scatter them about. My conclusion therefore is that the courts below could infer that the fire was caused by the negligence of the defendants. The appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellants: John S. Smiley.\nSolicitor for the respondents: H. A. Purdy.\n[1] 26 Can.

The question whether or not the plaintiff can maintain his action must be raised by way of defence or exception.

Evidence of such decision, if admitted, would not be conclusive. Idington and Duff JJ. contra. Where in such an action the defendant submits to the trial judge the question of the right to maintain it and does so in the belief that the court has jurisdiction to deal with such question the decision of the trial judge is not that of a quasi-arbitrator and so non-appealable as it would be if the issue was submitted with knowledge of the lack of jurisdiction and the parties assent to the judge acting virtually as an arbitrator.\nJudgment of the Appellate Division (51 Ont. L.R. 166), not dealt with.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario[1] affirming the judgment at the trial in favour of the plaintiff.\nThe facts of this case are stated in the above head-note. The plaintiffs sued for damages in consequence of having contracted typhoid fever from drinking the water supplied by their employers. The trial judge held that the injury was not caused by \u201caccident\u201d and that plaintiffs could not proceed under the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act. A judgment for damages was entered against the defendant and affirmed by the Appellate Division.\nLynch-Staunton K.C. and Hobson K.C. for the appellant.\nBain K.C. and Peter White K.C. (Duggan with them) for the respondents.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014I concur with Mr. Justice Anglin.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014The respondent having claimed to have suffered from typhoid fever attributable to the use by some of them of water received from a well of appellant in such a condition as to constitute it a nuisance within sections 73 and 74 subsection (e) of the Public Health Act, and which alone served the domestic needs of respondents as dwellers in a tenement of appellant, brought this action on the 14th December, 1920, and served its statement of claim on 12th January, 1921, to which appellant pleaded on 31st January, 1921.\nOn the 12th February, 1921, the appellant\u2019s solicitor served notice that on the trial defendants would move to amend said defence by adding the following paragraph:\nThe statement of claim discloses no cause of action and the defendants will so contend at the trial. If the plaintiffs suffered the damages alleged then the plaintiffs should apply to the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Board and are not entitled to maintain this action as same is barred by the provisions of that Act.\nOn the trial thereof on the opening which began on the 4th of April, 1921, the learned trial judge allowed said amendment and at the same time allowed respondents to amend their statement of claim by making specific references to the said Public Health Act and the Factories Act, being R.S.O. 229, sec. 43.\nThe trial then proceeded and lasted till the 7th April, 1921, when the sole question of negligence and said statutes relied upon by plaintiffs\u2019 amended statement of claim were left to the jury and a verdict was rendered for the plaintiffs (now respondents) and judgment was entered accordingly without any objection thereto.\nAppellant gave on the 18th April, 1921, notice of appeal to a divisional court and that was heard before the Appellate Division on the 22nd and 23rd of December, 1921, and judgment was given on the 24th of November, 1921, dismissing said appeal with costs.\nIn that notice of appeal eight grounds of appeal were taken of which the 4th was as follows:\u2014\n4. That as to the plaintiffs, Mary Costanza, Philipine Costanza and Horace Costanza, Jr., who were in the employment of the defendant, their remedy if any was to have applied to the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Board, and this action is barred by the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act.\nThe respondents\u2019 counsel, either by reason thereof or in consequence of something which transpired during the argument thereof made an application on their behalf to the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Board which resulted in the following finding by the board:\u2014\nFriday, 25th November, 1921.\nPresent:\u2014\nSamuel Price, Chairman.\nH.J.

Price,\nChairman.\nThe appeal was taken to this court by the present appellant by notice dated 14th day of February, 1922.\nIt was set down for hearing, by order, at the foot of the Ontario list, May Term, and heard on the 1st day of June, 1922.\nThereafter on the 10th day of October, 1922, a direction was given for re-argument on the question of jurisdiction and was so partly re-argued, but that re-argument ended in a direction to counsel to file supplementary factums, which were delivered on or about the 13th November, 1922.\nDuring all the time since the action was launched, at least until judgment at trial entered, it was, by section 64 of the workmen\u2019s Compensation Act, subsection 4 (R.S.O. 1914, c. 25), which reads as follows,\n4. Where an action in respect of an injury is brought against an employer by a workman or a dependent the Board shall have jurisdiction upon the application of the employer to determine whether the workman or dependent is entitled to maintain the action or only to compensation under Part I, and if the Board determines that the only right of the workman or dependent is to such compensation the action shall be forever stayed,\nopen for appellant to have applied to the board within the terms thereof to have said action stayed.\nIt has never had the courage to apply either thereunder or under subsection (2) of section 15 of said Act as amended, and has evinced no intention of doing so.\nThe respondents, on the contrary, had done so as already stated, before the appeal to the Appellate Division had been finally disposed of, with the result above set forth. The counsel for respondents tendered on argument the said result duly certified as an answer to the appellant\u2019s argument so far as rested upon the said amended plea in the statement of defence as allowed at the trial.\nSome one objected that we had decided in Red Mountain Railway Company v. Blue[2], that we could not receive any such evidence or look at any evidence save that adduced at the trial.\nIf any one will read said report they will see that though the then Chief Justice so held in regard to what was tendered and there in question, the remaining members of the court had agreed with the judgment of Mr. Justice Duff therein holding that there should be a new trial because the learned trial judge had misdirected the jury and hence all else in that case was but obiter dicta.\nFor my part I see I took the express precaution of declining to pass upon the question now raised.\nAnd I pass no opinion now upon the question so broadly put as if only an ordinary question of hearing evidence is involved.\nSection 60, subsection (1) the Act now in question reads as follows:\u2014\n60. (1) The Board shall have exclusive jurisdiction to examine into, hear and determine all matters and questions arising under this Part and as to any matter or thing in respect to which any power, authority or discretion is conferred upon the Board, and the action or decision of the Board thereon shall be final and conclusive and shall not be open to question or review in any court and no proceedings by or before the Board shall be restrained by injunction, prohibition or other process or proceeding in any court or be removable by certiorari or otherwise into any court.\nSurely we are bound to take judicial notice of any such proceeding and not stand upon any decisions such as are cited by the former Chief Justice in his said judgment and which are also cited in some of said factums.\nI respectfully submit we must exercise a little common sense in applying any judicial expressions of opinion or decision.\nIt is proposed in defiance of the board to stay all proceedings herein notwithstanding the imperative language of the above quoted subsection declaring it shall not be open to question or review and that no proceedings by or before the board shall be subject to any proceeding in any court.\nIf the converse had been declared on an ex parte application by appellant at any time prior or up to the trial judgment and the learned trial judge had had it brought to his notice, I venture to say he never would for a moment have thought of proceeding further than to make a note of such order.\nAnd if such a thing is conceivable as his doing otherwise, and in due course such a case brought here, what would we have done? And if we had conceivably ordered judgment to be entered\u2014well, I will not pursue that inquiry.\nNor need I say that much as I esteem the due observance of the maxim audi alteram partem, there are many things which are judicially done ex parte.\nAnd if I understand correctly the daily practice of the board in discharging its duties, it must of necessity do many things of its own motion. It is not a court where counsel is heard. The aim of the whole Act is to eliminate the litigious struggle and strife and the judicial peculiarities in mode of thought and applying the law.\nA perusal of the statement of claim indicates, as counsel first conceived its nature to be, that respondents founded this action upon something as remote from the nature of an accident, within the meaning of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act, as would be an action by one of respondents for an assault and battery by his or her employer.\nI am not surprised, therefore, that counsel for appellant in first pleading thereto failed to set up the Act.\nOne is sorely tempted to surmise that the doing so was an afterthought to try it on the court. It seems to have turned out an astute and confusing move.\nIndeed when the trial proceeded after the pleading had been amended no further attention seems to have been paid to the point raised thereby, save counsel for respondents filing a letter from a member of the board which indicates that the well in question had been before it in other cases somewhat like unto those in question herein, for said letter reads as follows:\u2014 Referring to our telephone conversation to-day, I beg to say that those alleged typhoid cases which came before the Board for consideration were all employees of a firm of contractors\u2014Newman Bros., Limited\u2014who were I understand erecting some structure on the property of the Dominion Canners Co. The names of the parties whose claims were considered were:\nJ.T. Welsh. Norton E. Schurr.\nWm. J. Schurr. Norman W. Rymer.\nLloyd R. Rymer. George W. Taylor.\nThese claims were all rejected on the ground that the circumstances did not point to injury by accident within the meaning of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act.\nThis clearly indicates the correct conception the board had formed of such a disease and its relation to the said Act.\nNor in the questions submitted by the trial court was any question put to the jury bearing upon the relations between the plaintiffs and the defendant, such as should have been if that question were before the court in the sense pleaded.\nI respectfully submit that upon such a record of facts as I have recited this court is not warranted in directing a stay of proceedings unless and until appellant applies for and procures, and files, a certificate from the board.\nOf course the appellant may possibly, astutely in line with its past two years course, abstain from further troubling anybody in this case. Meantime the respondents are unjustly, as I respectfully submit, hindered and delayed.\nWe should, in the absence of any such application by the appellant for two years during which it had deliberately refrained from applying, proceed to deliver judgment in the appeal in the absence thereof, unless that which respondent\u2019s counsel has presented will do justice herein.\nPrima facie this court is seized of this case, on the evidence presented at the trial, and on the facts so found has no foundation for doing otherwise.\nI doubt very much if either section 64, subsection (4), or section 15, subsection (2), was ever intended to extend the time for making such an application as contemplated thereby to the board, beyond a reasonable time or to proceedings in this court.\nBut in any case I am decidedly of the opinion that in face of the decision of the board, already made, the matter ends, or should end. And I most respectfully submit that we have no right to criticize or assume that such decision was, or even may have been, arrived at without duly considering the question at every angle, merely because their methods of investigation do not follow our legal forms of doing so. It was to get away from such like forms and methods, and all implied therein, that the statute was enacted.\nThe past experience of the members of the board, no doubt was sufficient guide and we should at least give them credit therefor, and knowledge, by this time, of the Act, superior, I imagine, to ours.\nDUFF J.\u2014The result of my examination of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act is this. Where an action is brought against an employer by one of his employees alleging the right of reparation arising out of circumstances which may constitute an accident within the meaning of the Act, it is a complete answer to the action that the circumstances do constitute such an accident and that in respect of the accident a right of compensation is given to the workman by the statute. I think it may be an arguable question whether or not it is sufficient to establish that the circumstances do constitute such an accident but it is unnecessary to dwell upon that.\nI think the proper inference from the provisions of the statute is that where the employer raises such a defence the authority to pass upon the issue thereby created is solely vested in the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Board. The employer may, if he be so minded, apply for a decision upon the point at the earliest stage and if the decision is in his favour it is the duty of the Supreme Court or other tribunal before which the action is pending to stay the action. He may, I think also, raise the defence by plea and establish it by producing proper evidence of the decision by the board.\nOn the other hand it is open to the workman to apply for and obtain such a decision the moment his writ is issued.\nMy view, however, is that the contention that no action lies because the matter is one for compensation under the Act, in other words, that the right of action is taken away by the statute, is strictly matter of defence or exception. If the defendant permits the action to proceed to judgment without having raised the defence or without having applied for a stay then he is concluded by the judgment as with regard to other exceptions and defences, unless on appeal the Court of Appeal sees fit, in the exercise of its discretion, to permit the defence or exception to be raised there.\nSo much by way of conjectio causae. The autonomy of the board is, I think, one of the central features of the system set up by the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act. One at least of the more obvious advantages of this very practical method of dealing with the subject of compensation for industrial accidents is that the waste of energy and expense in legal proceedings and a canon of interpretation governed in its application by refinement upon refinement leading to uncertainty and perplexity in the application of the Act are avoided. The purport of s.s. 1 of s. 60 (ascribing to the words their minimum scope) seems to be that as regards any proceeding before the board and for the purpose of any such proceeding in relation to a matter in respect of which jurisdiction is given to the board, that jurisdiction is exclusive and the mastery of the board over its own proceedings is supreme. The act or decision of the board in such a case, to use the language of the section,\nshall not be open to question or review in any court.\nLanguage could not be plainer. Therefore where the board (for example) makes an order for the payment of money and under s.s. 3 the order becomes a judgment of the County Court, it becomes a judgment of that court only for the purpose of enforcing it. Therefore, with great respect, I am unable to agree with the judgment of the majority of the Court of Appeal in Manitoba delivered by the Chief Justice of that Court in Canadian Northern Ry. Co. v. Wilson[3], in which the opinion is expressed that an order of the board for the payment of compensation having been made a judgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench under the corresponding section of the Manitoba Act, that court may, if informed that some fundamental principle of procedure such, for example, as audi alteram partem, has been disregarded by the board, decline to permit the process of the court to be used for the enforcement of the order. Nobody indeed can too strongly assert the importance of observing the rules of natural justice in all legal proceedings. Nobody could imagine for a moment that the legislature contemplated the possibility of the board in exercising its judicial or quasi-judicial functions disregarding the rudimentary dictates of fair play. But what seems perfectly clear is that the legislation proceeds upon a confident assurance that a tribunal constituted by the Government for the purposes of the Act could be relied upon not to disregard such principles in its proceedings. And I can hardly believe that any tribunal composed of professional men is likely in discharging responsibilities such as those cast upon the board to fail to appreciate the importance of preserving a judicial temper and of performing its duties \u201cconscientiously with a proper feeling of responsibility\u201d to quote Lord Moulton\u2019s phrase in a passage of his judgment in Local Government Board v. Arlidge[4] at page 150 which received the approval of the Judicial Committee in Wilson v. Esquimalt & Nanaimo Ry. Co.[5], at page 211.\nThe exclusive authority of the board in respect of proceedings upon an application for compensation or in dealing with a question of assessment or the like is, indeed, quite manifest; but one must admit that the point is not so obvious when one is considering what may be called perhaps for want of a better phrase the auxiliary jurisdiction of the board, the jurisdiction to pass upon a given question for the purpose of determining an issue in a proceeding before another tribunal. It may well be argued that \u201cquestions arising under Part I\u201d is not very apt phraseology for describing an issue presented to the Supreme Court in an action brought by a workman in consequence of a defence based upon an allegation that the plaintiff\u2019s only remedy is the statutory remedy given by the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act. More apt and precise language could no doubt have been used and one might perhaps have expected more apt and precise language if s.s. 1 of s. 60 was truly aimed at such questions and the decision of them. Something is to be said, moreover, as to the effect of s.s. 4. In terms, at all events, that subsection covers all cases to which s.s. 1 applies, and yet it is difficult to believe that the legislature intended to give to the board authority to revoke a decision given upon an application made by a defendant in an action in the Supreme Court that the action is or is not maintainable. A provision having such effect might conceivably lead at times to a very regrettable confusion.\nAgain, if you are to ascribe to the language of s.s. 1 a scope which brings every question as to the construction and effect of any enactment of the Act within the exclusive jurisdiction of the board, using \u201cexclusive\u201d in its ordinary sense, some results would be produced which would to say the least, be startling. For example, a question under section 56 as to the qualification of a member of the board would become exclusively cognizable by the board itself.\nNevertheless I think the argument in favour of the view that the jurisdiction of the board is an exclusive jurisdiction to deal with the defence as to the right to maintain a particular action in the Supreme Court, or rather the question whether or not in a particular case such right has been taken away by the provisions of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act, may be put upon very solid grounds. The answer is a new answer. It is an answer given by this statute and by this statute a procedure is prescribed or rather a procedure is created by means of which the answer can be made good. It does not, I think, necessarily follow that where a defence or exception is newly created by statute and a procedure is created for putting it forward, that the defendant who desires to avail himself of it must adopt the statutory procedure. I do not think the presumption that the statutory remedy is intended to be the sole remedy is quite so strong as that which arises where a new right is created by statute and a statutory remedy is given. On the other hand when, in addition to the circumstance that the defence or exception is a new one and to the fact that the statutory procedure for establishing it is newly created, there are obvious considerations to be drawn from the object and policy of the enactment pointing to the conclusion that the procedure provided for determining the issue is intended to be the exclusive procedure, then I can see no reason why effect should not be given to that conclusion unless at all events there are practical considerations which forbid it.\nNow it is quite true that when an action is brought by a workman against his employer in a particular case the question whether or not the action is excluded by the statute is in that particular case a question which concerns the workman and the employer alone; that is to say, it is a question and solely a question whether or not the workman is entitled to be paid and the employer is bound to pay a sum of money. On the other hand, if the question as to what does or does not constitute an \u201caccident\u201d, if the question whether on a given state of facts an accident has or has not occurred in the course of the workman\u2019s employment, or whether the accident does or does not arise out of the workman\u2019s employment, if such questions are generally to be passed upon by the Supreme Court with the usual concomitants by way of appeal, it is easy to see the possibility of a jurisprudence arising marked by the not very happy characteristics of that which has grown up out of the English Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act. Add to that the possibility of conflict between the decisions of the courts and those of the board and you have potentialities which, at all events, could not be supposed to add to the favourable prospects of the system set up by the statute. Without elaborating the matter further I think there are excellent practical reasons for assuming that the legislature did not contemplate such a duplication of jurisdiction in respect of these questions.\nOn the other hand I am quite unable, with great respect to those who take a different view, to escape the conclusion that the statute as originally framed put upon the defendant, the employer, the responsibility of taking the necessary steps to enable him to raise the defence. In other words, that the onus was upon him to invoke the jurisdiction given by section 64, subsection 4. There is not a syllable in the statute which suggests that a defendant raising the question by plea, for example, could thereby deprive the Supreme Court of jurisdiction to dispose of the action. The statute gave the defendant the right to get a decision upon the issue raised by such a defence from the board and it would be the duty of the Supreme Court obviously to give the defendant due opportunity to exercise his right. But the general jurisdiction of the court over the action remains untouched, in my opinion. The statute declares that in given circumstances the action does not lie, not that the courts have no jurisdiction to deal with it, an obviously different thing. The amendment of 1915 was designed no doubt (in addition to giving a defendant in an action affected by section 9 an opportunity of applying to the board and obtaining a decision upon the question whether the action had been taken away) to give to the plaintiff the opportunity of ascertaining whether or not his action was maintainable. But I am unable to give my adherence to the view that the effect of the amendment of 1915 was to shift the burden from the employer to the workman, a result which I very much fear must follow from the decision of the majority of the court on this appeal. A workman suing in the Division Court, for example, who goes to court with his witnesses would be exposed, according to that view, to the risk of having his suit stayed because, notwithstanding the absence of any contention to that effect on the part of the defendant, it might appear to the judge that possibly there was a case within the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act. I think there is nothing in the Act which justifies a construction exposing the workman to such embarrassment in pursuing his legal rights.\nNor (it is a point which I will not elaborate) do I think there is any reason for assuming that the legislature intended to place such an embarrassing responsibility upon judges. There are cases in which the law casts responsibility upon the judge to act ex mero motu where some illegality, for example, is disclosed by the evidence; but these are cases where some public interest is concerned. I am quite unable to understand what conceivable public interest can be affected by the fact that the employer has failed to raise the defence that the plaintiff\u2019s right is taken away by the sta- tute. In such circumstances there is no decision upon the construction or effect of the Act and no possibility of conflicting interpretations. The administration of the Act is not touched, the interest involved is the interest of the parties and theirs alone.\nI cannot conceive why such a responsibility should be placed upon the judge.\nAs to the disposition of the present appeal, the parties concurred in leaving the question whether the action would lie, first to the trial judge and then to the Appellate Division. In the ordinary case of an issue being passed upon by a judge of first instance in a manner extra cursum curias there is no appeal from the judgment. But a party having taken part in an appeal from the first judgment without objection is not generally permitted to raise the objection that the matter is not further appealable. Burgess v. Morton[6] at page 142. But where the matter passed upon is one which by statute is committed to the decision of another tribunal I think different considerations apply and I think the appeal from the decision of the Appellate Division on this question ought not to be heard. And as the parties have taken their chances on a favourable decision from the court itself, I think the matter must be deemed to be concluded by what has occurred.\nThis is sufficient to dispose of the appeal except as to one point, namely, the question of the plaintiff Horace Costanza\u2019s right to recover in respect of loss of services and expenses. On that point I shall express no opinion until the moment arrives for the delivery of final judgment upon the appeal by the court as a whole.\nANGLIN J.\u2014The defendants appeal from the judgment of a Divisional Court of the Appellate Division, confirming, by a majority, the judgment for the plaintiffs rendered after trial before Rose J. and a jury. Three of the plaintiffs sued to recover damages for injuries sustained by them as the result of having contracted typhoid fever from drinking the water from a contaminated well on the defendants\u2019 premises while in their employment. The other plaintiff, Horace Costanza, sued for consequential damages suffered by him as husband of one and father of two of his co-plaintiffs.\nSeveral grounds of appeal were urged based on alleged insufficiency of the evidence to support the jury\u2019s findings that the illnesses of the plaintiffs were due to the cause assigned and that the condition of the well was ascribable to negligence of the defendants. But counsel for the appellant chiefly relied upon the plea, set up by amendment at the opening of the trial, that (except as to Horace Costanza) the present action does not lie because the case is one for compensation under the Ontario Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act (4 Geo. V., c. 25) and the right of action to recover damages is thereby taken away (s. 15 (1)). That question was determined adversely to the defendants by the learned trial judge and by a majority of the learned judges in the Divisional Court, who were of the opinion that the plaintiffs had not sustained injury \u201cby accident\u201d within the meaning of s. 3 (1) of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act. Apparently no objection was taken to the competency of either tribunal to dispose of that question. Indeed no difficulty on that score was suggested during the original argument here.\nIn the course of their consideration of the case, however, it seemed to the members of the court that there was a serious question whether the jurisdiction of the courts to determine whether or not the action is one the right to bring which has been taken away by the statute had not been ousted by the provisions of s. 60, which confers on the board\nexclusive jurisdiction to examine into, hear and determine all matters and questions arising under this Part and as to any matter or thing in respect to which any power, authority or decision is conferred upon the Board, and the action or decision of the Board thereon shall be final and conclusive and shall not be open to question or review in any court.\nPart I of the statute embraces secs. 3 to 104 inclusive. By section 15 as originally enacted, subject to three exceptions, any right of action against his employer for damages to which a workman would otherwise have been entitled is taken away wherever the statute confers on him a right to compensation, i.e., where, in any employment to which Part I applies the workman has suffered\npersonal injury by accident arising out of and in the course of his employment\n(s. 3 (1)). By s. 64 (4), which was in the original Act, an employer-defendant in any action is authorized to apply to the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Board to determine whether the plaintiff can maintain the action or is entitled to statutory compensation, and if the board should decide that his only right is to such compensation the action is \u201cforever stayed\u201d. By s.s. (2) of s. 15 (added in 1915), \u201cany party to an action\u201d is authorized to\napply to the Board for adjudication and determination of the question of the plaintiffs\u2019 right to compensation under this part, or as to whether the action is one the right to bring which is taken away by this part, and such adjudication and determination shall be final and conclusive.\nIt seems to be quite clear that the question of the plaintiffs\u2019 right to bring and maintain this action \u201carises under\u201d Part I and also that it is\na matter or thing in respect to which power, authority or discretion is conferred on the Board.\nIn my opinion by giving to the board\nexclusive jurisdiction to examine into, hear and determine\nall such matters and questions the legislature intended to oust and did oust the jurisdiction of the ordinary courts to entertain them, and required that they should be examined into, heard and determined solely by the board.\nIn reaching this conclusion I have not forgotten that the jurisdiction of superior courts is not taken away unless by express language in, or necessary inference from, a statute. Balfour v. Malcolm[7]; Oram v. Brearey[8]. I find here a positive and clear enactment that the jurisdiction of the board shall be \u201cexclusive\u201d\u2014and nothing to warrant a refusal to give to that word its full effect.\nThe purpose of the legislature apparently was to secure uniformity in the determination of what classes of cases fall within the operation of the Compensation Act by having a single tribunal deal with that question, and also to ensure that no workman injured in the course of his employment should find himself in the position of having been denied damages by the courts because he was, in their opinion, entitled to compensation under the Act, and refused compensation by the board because he was, in its view, not so entitled.\nUnder the Act as originally drawn only the defendant was empowered to obtain the adjudication of the board on the question of the plaintiff\u2019s right to maintain his action. Sec. 64 (4). With the statute in that plight there might have been plausible ground for contending that the intention probably was to require the defendant, as a condition of being allowed to plead the provisions of s. 15 in bar of the action, to obtain an adjudication of the board that the plaintiff was entitled only to statutory compensation and not to maintain the action. If, with the statute in that condition, the court should stay the action until the board should have disposed of the question of the right to bring it, the defendant could scarcely be expected to make the application; the plaintiff was powerless to do so. But a construction of s. 64 (4) that would require the court, in the absence of a certificate from the board that the case is one for compensation and that the workman is therefore not entitled to maintain the action, to assume the contrary is scarcely consistent with the explicit and unqualified language of s. 15 (1), the application of which is in no wise made dependent upon its protection being invoked by the defendant. If the defendant does not plead the statutory bar but facts stated in the pleading or adduced in evidence at the trial indicate that the case might fall within s. 3 (1) of the statute and that ss. 15 (1) and 60 (1) might therefore apply, the court would, I think, be if not obliged certainly free proprio motu, to take cognizance of those provisions and stay further proceedings in the action until the question whether the right to maintain it had been taken away by the Act should be determined by the only competent tribunal. In re Robinson\u2019s Settlement[9] at pages 727-8; Coburn v. Collins[10] at page 434; Crossfield v. Manchester Ship Canal Co.[11] Again the defendant would have no interest to have such stay removed. It was probably to meet these difficulties that s.s. 2 was added to s. 15 in 1915 enabling \u201cany party to an action\u201d to apply for the board\u2019s adjudication upon the question whether the action is one the right to maintain which is taken away by the statute.\nUnder the amended statute, in my opinion, whenever this question arises as a substantial issue in the course of an action the proper course to take is to stay proceedings in the action until it has been adjudicated upon by the board. Simpson v. Crowle[12] at pages 250, 255. In view of the provisions of s. 20 the workman-plaintiff will be well advised in every case where there is any conceivable ground for contending that his claim falls within the Act to seek the determination of the board at the earliest possible date.\nIn Scotland v. Canadian Cartridge Co.[13] this question did not arise. The plaintiff\u2019s claim to compensation had there been rejected by the board before the action was begun on the ground that he had not been injured \u201cby accident\u201d within the meaning of that term as used in s. 3 (1). This decision had been reconsidered by the board at the instance of the defendant. Certificates of the board\u2019s determination of both applications had been put in without objection. The right of the courts to deal with the action and to decide whether the plaintiff was entitled to recover was not questioned. In two recent cases before the Privy Council referred to by the appellant\u2014McMillan v. Canadian Northern Ry. Co.[14], and McColl v. Canadian Pacific Ry. Co.[15]\u2014their Lordships dealt with the appeals as submitted. The question now under consideration was not presented in either case. In the McMillan Case14 owing to the doctrine of common employment there was no right of action under Ontario law apart from the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act, and it gives only a right to compensation recoverable on application to the board: in the McColl Case15 the Com- pensation Board had determined that the case fell within the Act and that any right of action had been taken away, and its decision was accepted as conclusive in so far as the right of action was subject to provincial control.\nThe plaintiffs have applied to be allowed to put in a certified copy of the decision of the board that they\ndid not sustain personal injuries by accident arising out of and in the course of their employment with Dominion Canners, Limited,\nand accordingly disallowing claims made by them to compensation under the statute, as conclusive that their right to bring this action was not taken away by the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act. They maintain that this document is admissible, notwithstanding any rule or practice of this court to decline to receive evidence that was not before the court from which an appeal is taken (Red Mountain v. Blue[16]; Michigan Central v. Jeannette, 13th December, 1918), because it bears on the question of the jurisdiction of the court of first instance to proceed with the trial of the action and of the Divisional Court and of this court to deal with it on appeal without a determination by the board that it is not barred by s. 15 (1), and is therefore outside of the stated case on which the appeal is taken (Sup. Ct. Act, s. 73).\nThe decision of the board appears to have been rendered on the 25th of November, 1921, three weeks after the judgment of the Divisional Court had been delivered and considerably more than a year after the happening of what the plaintiffs allege to have been the accident or accidents which caused them personal injuries, i.e., some time after any claims they could have to statutory compensation had been barred (s. 20 (1)). Ex facie it is a decision rejecting a claim for compensation and not an adjudication by the board upon an application made to it under s. 15 (2). Counsel for the respondent further stated, without contradiction, that the decision of the board had been made ex parte and without notice having been given to his client and he produced a letter from the Chairman of the board stating that its decision of the 25th of November, 1921, was made in disposing of the claims before it in the ordinary course and not upon an application under section 15 (2), the board\u2019s practice on such latter applications being to have the opposite party to the litigation notified. On these grounds counsel for the respondent objected to the certified copy of the board\u2019s decision being received. He also contended that if admitted it would not be conclusive for the purposes of s. 15 (1) of the statute.\nWith the latter contention I am disposed to agree. The board in determining that the right of action assented by a plaintiff has or has not been taken away by s. 15 (1) of the Act or that a plaintiff is or is not entitled only to compensation under the statute, whether on application made under s. 15 (2) or under s. 64 (4), acts judicially. It is empowered to adjudicate upon and finally to dispose of certain rights of the parties.\nIt is one of the first principles in the administration of justice,\nsaid Erle C.J., in In re Brook and Delcomyn[17] at p. 416,\nthat the tribunal which is to decide must hear both sides and give both an opportunity of hearing the evidence upon which the decision is to turn * * * I find the master minds of every century are consentaneous in holding it to be an indispensable requirement of justice that the party who is to decide shall hear both sides giving each an opportunity of hearing what is urged against him.\nSeneca\u2019s couplet:\nQuicunque aliquid statuerit, parte inaudita altera,\nAequum licet statuerit, haud aequus fuit,\nhas often been quoted with approval by learned judges. R. v. Archbishop of Canterbury[18], at p. 559, per Lord Campbell; Smith v. The Queen[19] at p. 624, per Sir R. Collier; Marcoux v. L\u2019Heureux[20] at p. 283 per Duff J. Unless dispensed with by statute, this rule of elementary justice is of universal application. Bonaker v. Evans[21] at p. 171.\nThe laws of God and man both give the party an opportunity to make his defence, if he has any,\nsaid Fortescue J. in Dr. Bentley\u2019s Case[22] at p. 567. Nor is the application of the principle that no man shall be deprived of his rights without an opportunity of being heard, limited to strictly judicial proceedings. Cooper v. Wandsworth Board of Works[23] at p. 189.\nUnder section 60 of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act, which makes the Board\u2019s jurisdiction exclusive and its action or decision final and conclusive, the board is empowered not merely to\ndetermine all matters and questions arising under this Part, etc.,\nbut \u201cto examine into, hear and determine\u201d all such matters and questions, etc. There is here at least an implied direction that before determining any matter or question the board shall examine into and hear it. This involves the hearing of all parties interested. The judgment of Lord Lyndhurst in Capel v. Child[24] at pp. 573-4 is instructive on the import of examination and hearing. The decision of the board tendered by the plaintiff was ex parte and was not rendered in the exercise of the special jurisdiction conferred by s. 15 (2) and s. 64 (4) of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act. In my opinion it should not be accepted as conclusive of the right of the plaintiff, notwithstanding the provision in s. 15 (1), to maintain the action, if otherwise well founded. The board is given explicit authority to reconsider any matter with which it has dealt and to rescind, alter or amend any decision or order previously made: s. 60 (3).\nDuring the course of the argument it was suggested that the defendant having submitted for trial by Mr. Justice Rose the issue whether the plaintiff\u2019s right of action had been taken away by the statute and having taken the chance of its determination by a tribunal lacking jurisdiction must accept the judgment rendered as the decision of a quasiarbitrator and therefore non-appealable. Burgess v. Morton[25], Lack of jurisdiction to pronounce it deprives a judgment of any effect whatever (Archbishop of Dublin v. Trimleston[26] at p. 268, even as against the party who invoked the determination. Toronto Ry. Co. v. Toronto[27] at p. 815. Where a court is deprived of jurisdiction over a subject by statute no acquiescence\u2014not even express con- sent\u2014can confer jurisdiction upon it. The remedy against such an excess of jurisdiction by an inferior court is either by appeal, if there be provision for an appeal, or otherwise by prohibition; in the case of the High Court by appeal. Burgess v. Morton.[28] This right of appeal is not lost unless relinquished either expressly or by asquiescence such as is found when parties with knowledge of the lack of jurisdiction in the court assent to the judge hearing and determining the matter virtually as an arbitrator.\nHere there was no intention that there should be any determination of the matter extra curiam such as would exclude a right of appeal. The proceedings in the trial court and in the Divisional Court were carried on under the belief and on the assumption that those courts were entitled to take cognizance of, and had jurisdiction to adjudicate upon, the issue raised by the plea based on section 15 (1) of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act. The parties clearly meant to keep themselves in curia; the trial judge and the Divisional Court so understood the position; and both courts and parties thought an appeal was open. This is not a case of mere deviation from the cursus curiae in dealing with a subject-matter over which the court had jurisdiction\u2014a case in which the taking of an intermediate appeal without challenging the original jurisdiction might preclude its being questioned on further appeal. Bickett v. Morris28; Cornwall v. Ottawa & N.Y. Ry. Co.[29] On the contrary, it is a case in which the courts have been divested by statute of jurisdiction over the subject-matter, and in which they have assumed the duty of another tribunal. Pisani v. Attorney General[30] at p. 522. The plaintiffs are therefore not entitled to have the judgment which they hold treated as unappealable and conclusive in their favour, Simpson v. Crowle[31] at pages 250, 252-3, 255, 257, as they would have been had there been conscious assent to the question whether the action was one which the statute had taken away their right to maintain being dealt with by the trial judge extra curiam. The judgment of the Divisional Court is a final judgment appealable to this court under s. 36 of the Supreme Court Act; it is our duty to pronounce the decision at which the Divisional Court should have arrived (s. 51, Sup. Ct. Act); and that court in turn should have dealt with the question now before us as the trial judge should have done. Ont. Judicature Act, s. 27 (1).\nMaking the order which the trial judge, in my opinion, should have made when the issue under s. 15 (1) came to his notice, I would direct that proceedings upon the pending appeal should be stayed to permit of an application being made to the board under s. 15 (2) for its.\nadjudication and determination * * * as to whether the (present) action is one the right to bring which is taken away by\nPart I of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act. I see no reason why a certificate of the board\u2019s decision should not be filed with the registrar.

The purchase price of the shares was to be paid as follows: $100,000 on transfer to the purchaser and the balance by instalments at specified dates and the commission was to be paid out of the respective instalments. A clause in the contract provided that if the payments were not made by the purchaser W. would be under no liability to pay the commission. The initial payment of $100,000 was made and the commission thereon paid to C. When the next payment fell due the purchaser defaulted and shortly after was placed in liquidation under the Winding-Up Act. The liquidator offered the assets for sale and accepted the tender of W. and H.W., a creditor who had advanced money to the insolvent company for its operations. The successful tenderers received all the assets of the estate including the stock sold by C. and other stock in the Orr Co. and paid the claims of the other creditors. In an action by C. for the balance of his commission there was no evidence that the assets had a cash value equivalent to the amount of the unpaid purchase price of the shares.\nHeld, Idington J. dissenting, that W. had not received payment for the shares sold to the Kirkland Co. and the commission was not earned.\nPer Duff J. By the transaction with the liquidator the contract sale of the shares to the Kirkland Co. was virtually rescinded and the evidence fails to show that what C. received in purchasing the assets was received or given in the performance by the Kirkland Co. of its obligation under the contract of sale of shares.\nHeld, also, that there is nothing on the record to show that C. did anything to prevent the contract for sale of the shares from being carried out.\nPer Idington J. There should be a reference to ascertain the value of the assets purchased from the liquidator. APPEAL from a decision of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario affirming the judgment at the trial in favour of the respondent.\nThe facts are fully stated in the above head note.\nSlaght K.C. and G.F. Macdonnell for the appellant.\nGlyn Osler K.C. and Munnoch for the respondent.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014After giving full consideration to the argument at bar of Mr. Slaght for the appellant, I remain of the conclusion I reached at the close of the argument that the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nThe reasons for the unanimous judgment of the Court of Appeal, affirming the judgment of the trial judge, Middleton J., were stated by Mr. Justice Ferguson. In these reasons the learned judge reviewed all of the somewhat complicated facts out of which this litigation has arisen. I do not think it of any advantage to restate these facts as I fully concur in his conclusions.\nThe pith of the learned judge\u2019s reasons is contained in the latter part of them, which I quote in full:\nHaving read the evidence, I am of the opinion that none of the parties to the purchase and sale between Wills and Wettlaufer on the one part, and the liquidator on the other part, looked upon the transaction as a cash sale for $611,000 cash, that none of them considered the bonds and the assets pledged therefor as securities or properties that could be sold or dealt with so as to realize $600,000 cash, or anything like that sum, and unless we must give effect to the form and disregard the substance, I do not think it could be reasonably suggested, let alone found, that the bonds held by the defendant were realized upon in cash\u2014or in something which the defendant voluntarily elected to take instead of cash; the defendant had to save as much as he could from the wreck, and make the most of a difficult situation\u2014and I do not think that in doing so he can, because of the form of his offer, be held to have realized cash or been paid in cash as was contemplated he should be paid before the plaintiff became entitled to commission under the agreement sued upon. It was for the conversion of the plaintiff\u2019s property into cash that the plaintiff was to be paid.\nAdmittedly the shares have not been converted into cash, and I can find nothing in the evidence to suggest that anything the defendant did prevented such a conversion. What the defendant got by his purchase was merely salvage of a part of his property, but not cash.\nIDINGTON J. (dissenting).\u2014Since this action was instituted and tried, Henry Cecil, the plaintiff therein and later appellant, has died and been succeeded, as appellant herein, by his widow who is executrix of his last will and testament.\nThe said late Henry Cecil and respondent entered into the following agreement:\nThis agreement made this Fifth day of September, 1918.\nBetween:\u2014\nCONRAD E. WETTLAUFER, of the City of Buffalo, in the State of New York, hereinafter called\nThe First Party;\nand\nHENRY CECIL, of the City of Toronto, in the County of York, hereinafter called\nThe Second Party.\nWITNESSETH that in consideration of the efforts of the said Second Party in making the sale of stock of Orr Gold Mines, Limited, the First Party agrees to pay to the said Second Party Ten per cent. (10%) upon five hundred and thirteen thousand two hundred and 40\/100 dollars, the purchase price thereof, out of the proceeds of said sum as follows:\u2014\n(a) Five thousand dollars ($5,000) to-day in cash out of the first payment under an agreement made between the First Party hereto and Kirkland-Porphyry Gold Mines Limited. The receipt of which is hereby acknowledged.\n(b) Ten thousand dollars ($10,000) out of the second payment to be made under said agreement on the 1st day of September, 1919, when such payment shall have been made; and\n(c) Thirty-six thousand three hundred and twenty and 40\/100 dollars ($36,320.40) out of the third payment under said agreement of three hundred and thirteen thousand two hundred and 40\/100 dollars, when such payment shall have been made.\nShould said payments not be made by the said Kirkland-Porphyry Gold Mines Limited, the First Party shall be under no liability to the Second Party for the payment of any commission by reason of said sale.\nTHIS AGREEMENT shall enure to the benefit of and be binding upon the parties hereto, and their respective heirs, executors, administrators and assigns.\nIN WITNESS WHEREOF the parties hereto have hereunto set their hands and seals.\nSigned, sealed and delivered in the presence of Wm. J. Magavern.\nConrad E. Wettlaufer (Seal).\nH. Cecil. (Seal).\nThis action was brought, on the 22nd of July, 1922, to recover from respondent the balance due in respect of the $46,320.40, balance of commission due under said agreement. The respondent and said Kirkland-Porphyry Gold Mines Limited, on the same date as the above agreement was made, entered into a long agreement in writing whereby said respondent agreed to sell and did sell to said company, which agreed to buy and did buy from him, 873,000 shares of Orr Gold Mines, Limited, for $513,200.40, payable as follows:\u2014\n\u201c(a) One hundred thousand dollars ($100,000.00) on the transfer of the shares referred to in paragraph 1 hereof.\n(b) One hundred thousand dollars ($100,000.00) on or before the 1st day of September, 1919; and\n(c) The balance of three hundred and thirteen thousand and two hundred 40\/100 dollars ($313,200.40) on or before the first day of September, 1920.\u201d\nThe said first payment thereunder, $100,000.00, was made and the late Cecil then got the $5,000.00 mentioned in above quoted agreement on account of his said commission, but the second and third payments were not made by the said company. They had been secured, not only by the terms of the said agreement, lastly mentioned, but by the promissory notes of the said company, and the collateral security bonds of said company to the amount of $420,000.00 charged upon all the assets of the Kirkland-Porphyry Gold Mines Limited, which, of course, would bind the stock transferred to it in the Orr Gold Mines, Limited, and furnish a controlling interest therein. Practically the respondent thus and thereby got not only the control of the Kirkland-Porphyry Gold Mines Limited for the full amount of this balance of $413,200.40 due him, but also, indirectly, of the Orr Gold Mines, Limited.\nThe remarkable thing happened, however, that he formed an alliance with one Wills, which I suspect originated before the event of liquidation of the company, on which this case has turned in the courts below.\nThough the said Wills had put into the said Kirkland-Porphyry Gold Mines Limited, at and after the time of said agreements and later to develop its resources, a total sometimes stated to be $190,000.00 and at other times said to be $290,000.00, yet he put it (according to the statement of the case herein) into liquidation shortly after the first of said promissory notes became due.\nThereupon in due course of time an offer was made by the respondent and said Wills which led to the liquidator transferring to them the entire assets of the said company which as already stated practically meant the control of and, I imagine, practically the entire assets of the Orr Gold Mines, Limited, save a possibility not cleared up of rights of its remaining shareholders.\nThis successful tender was, so far as respondent\u2019s share thereof is concerned, based entirely on the surrender of his bonds held as collateral security for the payment of the balance due him.\nThe learned trial judge held he could not, on his construction of the agreement above quoted, see how the plaintiff then before him could rest at all on the result of said purchase from the liquidator. The price had not been paid by the company and thus the matter ended unless in the case of fraud, which was not charged.\nIn somewhat like terms the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario dismissed the appeal thereto and characterized that got as wreckage.\nWith great respect, I submit that the true interpretation and construction of the agreement above quoted in full is not, though I admit quite capable of such a construction as given it, been correctly construed and applied in light of the relevant facts and surrounding circumstances.\nIf to be read in an exceedingly narrow sense and, in the last analysis, effect only to be given to the clause which reads as follows,\nshould said payments not be made by the said Kirkland-Porphyry Gold Mines, Limited, the First Party shall be under no liability to the Second Party for the payment of any commission by reason of said sale,\nI can, though not agreeing therewith, quite understand the conclusion of one so reading it.\nI should not be surprised to find now-a-days a contract expressly so constituted and be quite agreeable to enforcing it. But it would be of such an unusual character that I would expect it to be framed in other terms than that before us. I interpret that in the circumstances presented quite otherwise. It, to my mind, clearly intended not the actual payment of dollars on the dates specified, but the realization of that which would produce in equivalent dollars the stated values.\nIf the respondent chose to take in exchange another gold mine worth, beyond dispute, double the sum specified, I do not think he could, under this agreement, escape payment of this commission by any such subterfuge. And if the undisputed evidence is to be our guide, that is practically what he has done.\nIt was not the actual dollars to be paid but the amount in actual dollars to be realized that in fact was present to the minds of the contracting parties now in dispute herein.\nThe commission was to be derived \u201cout of the proceeds of said sum\u201d which I interpret to mean as the words imply.\nAnd the concurrent agreement between the respondent and the company clearly indicates this was what the parties had in view for the respondent was given a predominant power over the operations of the company to whom he was selling, in section 9 thereof, as follows:\u2014\n9. IT IS EXPRESSLY AGREED as a condition precedent to the entering into of this agreement, that all expenditures made by the Second Party for salaries, development, mill and plant shall be approved of by a majority in number of a committee of three, two of whom shall be appointed by the First Party and one by the Second Party; it being agreed, however, that one of the consenting members of said committee shall be the nominee of the Second Party. It is also further agreed that the Second Party shall deliver to the said committee all of the bonds of the Company, except those referred to in clauses 2 and 8 of this agreement, such bonds so delivered to the said committee to be released by a majority in number thereof, of whom one shall be the nominee of the Second Party, only as required for financing the Second Party in its operations. It is further agreed that none of the treasury shares of the Second Party shall be sold or disposed of without the approval and consent of the majority in number of said committee, one of whom shall be the nominee of the Second Party. This committee shall exist with full authority in the premises until the notes given to the First Party for four hundred and thirteen thousand two hundred 40\/100 dollars ($413,200.40) are fully paid.\nIt was out of the operative results so produced or otherwise in the course of events to be developed that he expected to be paid and out of that payment be obliged to pay the late appellant his commission. It is in that light I should look at, interpret and construe this contract.\nAnd hence in the events which have ensued the respondent should pay on the basis of his successful use of that he got and agreed to pay a commission upon.\nWhat that result is appears from the uncontradicted evidence of the late plaintiff, which is as follows:\u2014\nQ. How close to the lines of the Orr property is shaft of the Kirkland Gold?\nA. 60 feet. I sunk it there for the purpose of proving their property.\nQ. Sixty feet from the boundary line of the Orr?\nA. Yes.\nQ. Is it a vertical shaft, or nearly so?\nA. It is so.\nQ. And on the 12th of June, 1920, when Wills and Wettlaufer bought the assets, to what depth had this shaft on the Kirkland claims adjoining, what depth had that shaft been sunk?\nA. Over 900 feet.\nQ. Had there been much lateral work done on that property?\nA. Oh, yes, a great deal. They had about two years and a half of ore in sight.\nQ. Have you been underground and familiar with it?\nA. Yes.\nQ. And what were the results and depth on the adjoining property, the Kirkland Claim Gold Mine, at the time in June, 1920\u2014had it proven to be valuable?\nA. It would have doubled the value of the Orr, absolutely doubled their value.\nQ. It would have doubled the value of the Orr\u2014you mean the ore in the ground, or what?\nA. The shares of the Orr, or the exposure of the ore, would have doubled the value of the price of stock or the price of the mine.\nQ. Would have doubled the value of the price of the mine, I should have asked you before we left it\u2014take the Orr Mine itself that you have told us about, being 400 feet down, and lateral work done, did the values\u2014were there rich values or otherwise, at the 400 foot level on the Orr property?\nA. Yes, we had about $23.80 across twelve feet.\nQ. $23.80 across twelve feet\u2014$23.80 to the ton?\nA. To the ton.\nMr. Osler: That is on the Kirkland.\nMr. Slaght: No, on the Orr?\nA. On the Orr.\nQ. On the Orr itself, yes?\u2014A. On the hanging wall of that there is six inches of stuff that would go over $700, not included in that assay.\nIt seems quite clear that out of the pitiable wreckage the Appellate Division could only see there is much more in sight and probably by this time realized. I should therefore direct a reference as to the facts and if so found declare the respondent\u2019s obligation to pay under said agreement.\nIf that is not the practical meaning of the results of the contract in question I fail, with great respect, to understand why so much time and labour was wasted upon it in the courts below.\nIf to be valued by the last clause alone and the terms of the concurrent contract for bringing about which the commission was to be paid must be discarded and only cash to be considered no more can be said; for then no use of all the effort of respondent\u2019s counsel at the trial and in appeal to justify the course of his client.\nIf that is the meaning of the contract the case is of the simplest character for no one pretends that the actual dollars were ever received.\nI would direct a reference to ascertain if the foregoing statements of the late plaintiff are true in substance and in fact, or what are the actual facts.\nIf as the result thereof it be found that the sale by him to the said company has produced the receipt by respondent of that which is beyond all doubt such as to render him in justice liable to pay said balance of commissions the court on further directions should so declare, and I would reserve such further directions and costs in order that the proper remedy be given.\nIf the respondent at any stage had got, in lieu of cash, let us say, for example, victory bonds or the like unexceptionable assets, in his dealings with what bonds as were given him as collateral security could he thereby escape the payment of the balance of commission now in question because he had not received actual cash?\nI submit not and I question much if the manipulations he has joined in have not produced the equivalent of such victory bonds.\nI respectfully submit our law is not so poverty stricken as to render it impossible to produce justice in such a case.\nThe learned trial judge at the trial ruled out any such evidence expressly on the ground that it would be admissible only upon a reference. I may remark that the question of any set-off arising out of the previous dealings and claims so made does not seem to me open in this case for whatever may be the facts the assignment thereof to respondent was made two days after the writ was issued in this case and seems out of the case.\nThere is another aspect of that and it is this, if an account were taken thereof it would involve not only the share of this commission but all the dealings between the deceased and Wills, or him and another.\nSurely there has been enough invoked of what is or is not relevant, if the simple reading of this contract is all that is in question and so clear as found by the courts below, to settle the matter.\nI cannot accede to that reading of the contract and therefore would allow the appeal and direct the reference I suggest to ascertain the actual facts as to the value of what the respondent has got as the proceeds of what he bargained for and if it is such as in justice to entitle appellant to claim the promised commission and reserve further directions and costs.\nThe facts so far as developed shew that what was got in the way of assets by the bargain of respondent and Wills with the liquidator, was six mining claims, assignment of lease made by Orr Gold Mines, Limited, to Kirkland-Porphyry Gold Mines Limited, and $29,000 worth of plant, besides the 873,334 shares of stock in the Orr Gold Mines, Limited.\nThe result was further so manipulated between them that respondent got immediately after the sale of the three first items of said assets to the Orr Gold Mines, Limited, not only his 873,334 original shares therein but also a further issue of treasury stock of said company in which he shared to a large amount.\nIt would require such a reference as I suggest to clarify all these manipulations and determine the actual resultant value of what respondent got thereout as the proceeds of the said sum referred to in the above quoted bargain for commission.\nDUFF J.\u2014By the agreement which is the foundation of the appellant\u2019s claim the respondent undertakes to pay 10% of $513,240, the purchase price of certain shares of stock in the Orr Gold Mines, Limited, out of the proceeds of the sale, in a fixed series of instalments, $5,000 in cash out of the first payment of purchase money, $10,000 out of the second payment and $36,000 odd out of the third payment. The appellant has received only the sum of $5,000 first payable and sues to recover the balance. It is admitted that the second and third instalments of purchase money were never in fact paid conformably to the provisions of the agreement of sale; and there can be no doubt that according to its literal terms the last clause of the agreement between the appellant and the respondent (which reads as follows\nshould said payments not be made by the said Kirkland-Porphyry Gold Mines Ltd., the First Party shall be under no liability to the Second Party for the payment of any commission by reason of said sale),\nwould come into operation.\nIt was contended, however, by Mr. Slaght in a forcible argument that, although the purchase money had not been paid strictly in pursuance of the terms of the agreement of sale, the respondent had accepted in satisfaction and in effect in payment of bonds received by him from the purchaser, the Kirkland-Porphyry Company, as security for the payment of the purchase money certain assets of that company and that this must be regarded as payment of the purchase money for the purpose of giving effect to the contract for commission. Alternatively Mr. Slaght contended that the respondent by his conduct had prevented the execution of the agreement for sale or at all events had interfered with it in a material way and that consequently according to the principle of Burchell v. Gowrie and Blackhouse Co.[1], and Upper Canada College v. Smith[2], the plaintiff was entitled to succeed in the action. As to the second of these grounds, I may say at once I can find no evidence to justify a finding that anything done by the respondent seriously augmented the improbability that the sale would be carried out.\nAs to Mr. Slaght\u2019s first point, the appellant could, I think, succeed only by establishing one of two things, either a real conversion of the property which was the subject of the sale into money, or the acceptance by the purchaser in substitution for cash of something that was truly considered by the parties to be the equivalent of cash.\nNow Mr. Slaght rightly pressed upon us the fact that the bonds held by the respondent as collateral security for the performance of the purchaser\u2019s obligations under the agreement for sale were, by the very terms of the arrangement with the liquidator, treated as paid and discharged. But while prima facie important this fact ceases to be of any decisive significance when it becomes reasonably clear, as I think it is, that in substance, by the transaction with the liquidator, the sale instead of being carried into effect was put an end to. It is true that the transaction did not assume the form of rescission. Moreover another purchaser was interested with the respondent and another property was involved, but I agree with the court below that it is impossible to find on the evidence that what the respondent received was received or given as performance by the purchaser of its obligation under the contract of sale. It seems sufficient to say that it appears to me to be beyond controversy that the transaction with the liquidator did not involve \u201cpayment\u201d of the purchase money in any sense contemplated by the contract upon which the action is brought.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nANGLIN J.\u2014In my opinion the conditions of the contract under which the appellant asserts the right to recover a balance of commission have not been fulfilled. The portion of the proceeds of sale out of which alone such balance of commission was made payable never came to the hands of the respondent. Excluding all idea of fraud or collusion, of which there is not the slighest evidence, I find it a little difficult to appreciate how a transaction by which the vendor took back the subject-matter of the sale can be regarded as the carrying of that sale to completion. Neither has it been demonstrated that the assets of the purchasing company, which the vendor acquired, had a cash value equivalent to the unpaid balance of the purchase price. Nor am I convinced that satisfactory proof on that point would have entitled the appellant to recover.\nOn the other aspect of the case I see nothing to warrant a conclusion that the insolvent Kirkland-Porphyry Company would or could have paid, or been made to pay the balance of purchase money due to the respondent if he and Wills had not taken over its assets.\nI would dismiss the appeal.\nBRODEUR J.\u2014I concur in the result.\nMIGNAULT J.\u2014The appellant\u2019s argument was directed to show if possible, that the facts here come within a well known rule of law which may be stated in the words of Willes J., in Inchbald v. Western Neilgherry Coffee Plantation Co.[3] at page 741:\nWhenever money is to be paid to another upon a given event, the party upon whom is cast the obligation to pay is liable to the party who is to receive the money, if he does any act which prevents or makes it less probable that he should receive it.\nThe appellant entered into an agreement in writing with the respondent on September 5th, 1918, whereby he was to be paid by the latter a commission of five per cent. on the payment to the respondent by the Kirkland-Porphyry Gold Mines Limited, of the purchase price of 873,000 shares of Orr Gold Mines, Limited. These shares were on the same date sold to the Kirkland Company by the respondent for $513,200.40, of which $100,000 was paid immediately on the transfer of the shares, $100,000.00 was made payable on September 1st, 1919, and the balance, $313,200.40 on September 1st, 1920. The agreement between the appellant and the respondent was that the latter would pay the former\u2019s commission out of the proceeds of the purchase price, and the appellant received $5,000.00 out of the cash payment of $100,000.00. The contract contained the following clause:\nShould said payments not be made by said Kirkland-Porphyry Gold Mines Limited, the First Party (the respondent) shall be under no liability to the Second Party (the appellant) for the payment of any commission by reason of said sale. The last two instalments were never paid by the Kirkland company, which, on the petition of one Hamilton B. Wills, who had advanced it considerable sums of money, and notably the money for the first payment of $100,000.00, was put in liquidation as being insolvent.\nThe appellant\u2019s claim for his commission under his contract is based on what happened subsequently to the liquidation proceedings.\nWills and the respondent were both large creditors of the Kirkland company and held between them some $600,000.00 (nominal value) of its bonds. The respondent by the agreement which he made with the Kirkland company on September 5th, 1918, for the sale of the Orr Mines\u2019 shares, had received as collateral $420,000.00 (nominal value) of the company\u2019s bonds, this of course being to the knowledge of the appellant who signed the agreement as president of the company. And Wills also held bonds of the company as security for his advance.\nWhen the Kirkland company went into liquidation, the liquidator, Mr. Clarkson, advertised its assets for judicial sale, and Wills and the respondent tendered for the same at an amount equivalent to the liabilities of the company, which they stated they understood to be in the neighbourhood of $610,000.00 or $611,000.00. They added that they were bond creditors in the amount of about $600,000.00, having filed their claims therefor.\nThis tender was accepted by the official referee on the advice of the liquidator, and a formal agreement was entered into between the liquidator and Wills and Wettlaufer for the sale to them of the assets of the Kirkland company (which included the Orr Mines\u2019 shares) at an amount sufficient to pay the expenses of the winding-up proceedings and the creditors\u2019 claims against the company. These expenses and claims, outside of those of Wills and Wettlaufer, amounted to some $11,000.00 which was paid in cash, the purchasers, of course, not having to pay over money which represented their own claims.\nIt is evident that this was not a payment by the Kirkland company to the respondent of the balance of the price of the Orr Mines\u2019 shares. The condition of the contract between the appellant and the respondent was therefore never fulfilled, and under the express terms of the contract the respondent was under no liability for payment of the appellant\u2019s commission.\nDid the respondent do any act which prevented or made it less probable that the appellant should receive the money payable under the above condition?\nIt is conclusively demonstrated that the Kirkland company was hopelessly insolvent and could never have met these payments. What money it ever had, as well as the money used for the first payment to the respondent, was furnished by Wills who was under no obligation to continue to finance the company.\nBut the appellant urges that the respondent used the company\u2019s bonds of the nominal value of $420,000.00, which he had received as collateral, to purchase jointly with Wills the assets of the Kirkland company comprising the Orr Mines\u2019 shares.\nThe answer is that these bonds were given to the respondent as collateral in order to secure the payment of the balance of the price of the Orr Mines shares, to wit, $413,200.40, and he could have disposed of them under a contract which he made with the Kirkland company contemporaneously with the sale agreement and which the appellant signed as president of the company. It is not suggested that these bonds ever had any value. There certainly was no payment by the company of the amount which it owed the respondent, and which it was unable to pay, but at the most a taking back of the property for which it had not paid and a surrender of the collateral security the respondent had received. And in no way did the respondent prevent his debtor from paying for the Orr Mines\u2019 shares. No other offer was received for the purchase of the assets than that made by the respondent and Wills, and it seems perfectly idle to contend now that a better arrangement could have been made.\nIt is entirely beside the question to say that Wills and the respondent have made money out of their purchase of the assets of the Kirkland company, and still have the Orr Mines shares and that these shares have increased in value. The appellant had a conditional contract the condition of which was never fulfilled and the respondent did nothing to prevent its fulfilment. There is no basis for the appellant\u2019s action.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: Arthur G. Slaght.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Blake, Lash, Anglin & Cassels.\n[1] [1910] A.C. 614.\n[2] 61 Can. S.C.R. 413.\n[3] 17 C.B. N.S. 733.\n",

Grand Trunk Pac. Railway Co., [1923] S.C.R. 84\nDate: 1922-11-27\nPremier Lumber Company (Plaintiff) Appellant ;\nand\nGrand Trunk Pacific Railway Co. (Defendant) Respondent.\n1922: October 10, 11; 1922: November 27.\nPresent: Sir Louis Davies C.J. and Idington, Duff, Anglin, Brodeur and Mignault JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR BRITISH COLUMBIA\nCarriers\u2014Railways\u2014Misdelivery\u2014Liability\u2014\"Loss\"\u2014Meaning\u2014Absence of Notice.\nThe appellant had purchased at Vancouver lumber from the G.W.M. Co. and had sold it to the U.S.L. Co. of Portland, Oregon. The lumber was shipped from Prince Rupert, B.C. to Minneapolis by the G.W.N. Co., consigned to itself, to be carried by respondent's line of railway to Winnipeg and thence to destination by that of the Canadian Pacific Railway Company. The bills of lading were in the standard form known as a \"straight bill of lading\" approved by the Board of Railway Commissioners for Canada. Each bill was indorsed as follows: \"Deliver to Premier Lumber Company, (sgd.) the G.W.N. Co.\" The bills of lading were held in Vancouver by the Standard Bank of Canada, from whom the appellant had borrowed money, to be handed over to the purchaser on payment being made. The C.P. Ry. Co. without requiring or obtaining surrender of the bills of lading, allowed possession of the lumber to be taken by, or on behalf of, the U.S.L. Co. The appellant company, not having been paid by the U.S.L. Co. for the lumber seeks to recover the price of it from the respondent company, the original carrier, as being responsible under the conditions of the bills of lading for the fault or misfeasance of the second carrier in wrongfully handing over the lumber. The main defence was the failure of the appellant company to give notice of loss which by the bills of lading was made a condition of the respondent's liability.\nHeld, that the respondent company was not liable.\nPer Davies, C.J. and Duff and Brodeur JJ.\u2014Upon the evidence, the U.S.L. Co. obtained delivery of the lumber, without presenting the bill of lading, to the knowledge and with the consent of the appellant company.\nThe second section of the conditions indorsed on the bills of lading provided that \" the carrier * * * shall be liable for the loss * * * caused by, or resulting from, the act, neglect or default of any * * * carrier * * *.\" Per Duff J.\u2014Loss by reason of mis\u2014delivery is \"loss\" within the meaning of section 2 for liability by the initial carrier. Anglin J. contra.\nThe 4th section of the conditions endorsed on the bills of lading provided that \"notice of loss, damage or delay must be made to the carrier at the point of delivery, or to the carrier at the point of origin, within four months after the delivery of the goods, or in the case of failure to make delivery, then within four months after a reasonable time for delivery has elapsed. Unless notice is so given the carrier shall not be liable.\"\nPer Davies C.J. and Idington, Brodeur and Mignault JJ.\u2014The absence of notice of loss is fatal to the appellant's claim.\nPer Duff J.\u2014The notice clause although applicable in the circumstances of the case would afford no defence because after the carrier under a certain clause in the bill of lading had become liable as warehouseman; any \"failure to make delivery\" could only be a failure after demand by or on behalf of the consignee, and \"a reasonable time for delivery\" could only mean a reasonable time after demand; there is no evidence of any demand having been made except by the persons to whom delivery was made and consequently the time prescribed never began to run.\nPer Anglin J.\u2014\"Loss\" in sections 2 and 4 means physical loss of the goods as by accident during transit, or through negligence, or by theft, but does not cover non-delivery due to an intentional parting with the goods by the carrier amounting to a wilful misfeasance. The second carrier having wilfully handed over the goods to a party not entitled to receive them, the respondent cannot assert any right to the protection of the notice clause in respect to such an act of misfeasance which did not cause a \"loss\" within section 2 of the conditions.\nJudgment of the Court of Appeal ([1922] 2 W.W.R. 181) affirmed.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1] affirming the judgment of the trial court and dismissing the appellant's action.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions at issue are fully stated in the above head\u2014note and in the judgments now reported.\nEug. Lafleur K.C. for the appellant.\nD. L. McCarthy K.C. for the respondent.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014For the reasons stated by my brother Brodeur, in which I fully concur, I would dismiss this appeal with costs. Not only do I think that the action fails because no notice was given to the carrier at the point of origin, namely the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway Company, within the four months prescribed by the bill of lading in order to maintain an action against the carrier for the alleged failure to make delivery, but the evidence and the exhibits disclose to my mind, that a business custom and practice existed between the Premier Lumber Company and the United States Lumber and Box Company and the Soo Railway Company which fully justified the Soo Railway Company, as between it and the Premier Lumber Company, in delivering the five cars of lumber in question to the United States Lumber and Box Company, or their nominees, without the production of the bills of lading. On this point, see specially the letter from the Premier Lumber Company to the United States Lumber and Box Company where the latter company is instructed to communicate directly to the Soo Railway Company the destination to which they were to forward the lumber and mentioning at least two of the cars now being sued for on the ground of misdelivery as awaiting such forwarding instructions.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014This is an appeal from the Court of Appeal for British Columbia maintaining the judgment of the learned trial judge who dismissed the action of the appellant against the respondent.\nThe action was brought by appellant claiming to recover damages for breaches of several contracts to carry a car load of lumber to Minneapolis, Minnesota, each entered into by the respondent with the G. W. Nickerson Co., Ltd., and each evidenced by a bill of lading made pursuant to the form approved by the Board of Railway Commissioners for Canada, by order no. 7562 of the 13th July, 1909, and subject to the conditions indorsed thereon. These were what are known by the terms of said order of the board as straight bills of lading\u2014original\u2014not negotiable.\nThe said Nickerson Company nevertheless indorsed these several bills of lading to the appellant company, which claims to have bought the lumber in question five or six months before shipment from the said Nickerson Co. The appellant company in turn, shortly after said purchase, had agreed to sell same to the United States Lumber and Box Company of Portland, Oregon.\nThese five carloads were but a fractional part of the entire transactions so respectively entered into between the said several parties, for each sale so made covered in all something like two hundred and fifty cars.\nAs the bills of lading in question were of the kind above described and declared to be not negotiable, I imagine the objection, amongst others, taken in argument herein, that the appellant could not recover is rather a formidable obstacle in the appellant's way of recovery herein; but upon the conclusion I have reached, it is not necessary I should deal therewith.\nIt is admitted that these five carloads passed, shortly after reaching Minneapolis in July, 1920, into the possession of the said United States Lumber & Box Co., of Portland, Oregon, as did many other like shipments.\nThe first condition indorsed on each of said bills of lading is as follows:\u2014\nSec. 1.\u2014The carrier of any of the goods herein described shall be liable for any loss thereof or damage thereto, except as hereinafter provided.\nOne of these exceptions appears in the 4th condition indorsed, and the part thereof so providing is as follows:\u2014\nNotice of loss, damage or delay must be made in writing to the carrier at the point of delivery, or to the carrier at the point of origin, within four months after the delivery of the goods, or in the case of failure to make delivery, then within four months after a reasonable time for delivery has elapsed. Unless notice is so given the carrier shall not be liable.\nNo such notice was given until the 4th of February, 1921, and the learned trial judge held that the failure to give same was fatal to the claim of the appellant.\nThere is abundantly well founded inference of fact, to be drawn from evidence in the numerous letters and telegrams adduced in evidence which satisfies me that a reasonable time for delivery had elapsed more than four months before the inquiry, dated the 4th February, 1921, could have reached the respondent at Prince Rupert, B.C., where it was addressed to, from Vancouver, even if that otherwise could be held such a form of notice as required. For example, the appellant wrote on the 24th August, 1920, to the United States Lumber & Box Co. that the Canadian Pacific Ry. Co. had advised the appellant that certain cars named had reached destination Minnesota Transfer, and are awaiting instructions, and said,\nthis also applies to car G.T.P. 312071\u2014shipped July 26th.\nThis latter is one of the five cars now in question and appears in a list given in a long letter of 16th October, 1920, from appellant to said United States Lumber & Box Co., which list is preceded by the following sentence:\u2014\nNow the situation yesterday previous to receiving these remittances from you this morning was that the following cars shew unpaid on our books, that is unpaid for in full, although heavy payment had been made against them by trade acceptances and in various ways.\nCars nos. 23479, 308798 and 207350, which are others of the five sued for, also appear on same list.\nThis gives rather an unpleasant impression of the honesty of the claim now made against the respondent.\nI need not say that that impression is deepened by reading the letter of the 22nd September, 1920, from the said United States Lumber & Box Co. to appellant relative to car no. 708798, and reply by appellant thereto of the 27th September, 1920.\nThe letter from the United States Lumber & Box Co. to appellant of the 12th September, 1920, relative to no. 87370, one of those sued for and referred to therein and in argument as the \"Huttig Car\" and the reply thereto by the appellant dated 13th September, 1920, demonstrate how little the latter had to complain of the holding of the courts below, or of anything relative thereto.\nThe truth would seem to be that the appellant after making claims, possibly unsuccessfully on others, conceived the idea that it could use the possession of respondent's bills of lading as a means of extorting from it what it had looked to others for.\nI do not think I need follow out in detail all the inferences to be drawn from these letters or dwell upon the telegrams that it chose to ignore, pretending it did not know who Hodson, wiring on behalf of the Canadian Pacific Ry. Co., was\nI think this appeal should be dismissed with costs. DUFF J.\u2014The first question for consideration is whether or not there was a breach of duty by the Soo Line in respect of which the respondents would be responsible to the appellants, if notice had been duly given.\nUnder this head I shall consider whether, assuming there was a misdelivery constituting a breach of contract or an actionable wrong on part of the Soo Line, the respondents are responsible for it. By the contract which is called a \"straight bill of lading\" the respondents undertook to carry the goods shipped to \"its usual place of delivery\" at the destination mentioned\nif on its road, otherwise to deliver to another carrier on the route to said destination.\nAnd it was further agreed by section 2 of the conditions as follows:\u2014\nSec. 2.\u2014In the case of shipments from one point in Canada to another point in Canada, or where goods are shipped under a joint tariff, the carrier issuing the bill of lading, in addition to its other liability hereunder, shall be liable for any loss, damage or injury to such goods from which the other carrier is not by the terms of the bill of lading relieved, caused by or resulting from the act, neglect or default of any other carrier to which such goods may be delivered in Canada, or under such joint tariff, or over whose line or lines such goods may pass in Canada, or under such joint tariff, the onus of proving that such loss was not so caused or did not so result being upon the carrier issuing the bill of lading. The carrier issuing this bill of lading shall be entitled to recover from the other carrier on whose line or lines the loss, damage or injury to the said goods shall have been sustained the amount of such loss, damage or injury as may be required to pay hereunder, as may be evidenced by any receipt, judgment or transcript thereof. Nothing in this section shall deprive the holder of this bill of lading or party entitled to the goods of any remedy or right of action which he may have against the carrier issuing this bill of lading or any other carrier.\nBy section 6 of the conditions it is also stipulated:\u2014\nSec. 6.\u2014Goods not removed by the party entitled to receive them within forty-eight hours (exclusive of legal holidays) or in the case of bonded goods, within seventy-two hours (exclusive of legal holidays) after written notice has been sent or given, may be kept in the car, station or place of delivery or warehouse of the carrier, subject to a reasonable charge for storage and to the carrier's responsibility as warehouseman only, or may at the option of the carrier (after written notice of the carrier's intention to do so has been sent or given), be removed to and stored in a public or licensed warehouse at the cost of the owner, and there held at the risk of the owner and without liability on the part of the carrier, and subject to a lien for all freight and other lawful charges, including a reasonable charge for storage. It is admitted that the goods in question were delivered conformably to the terms of the contract to another carrier (the Soo Line), en route to the destination named in the contract. It is essential therefore to the right of the appellant to recover that the language of section 2 is comprehensive enough to impose upon the respondents liability for \"loss\" by misdelivery by the Soo Line. Before entering upon a critical examination of section 2 it will be convenient first to notice that by section 6 once a notice of the arrival of the goods at their destination has been given or rather within 48 hours after the giving of such notice, except in the case of bonded goods, the responsibility of the Soo Line for such goods \"in car, station or place of delivery or warehouse of\" its own is to be measured by the responsibility of a warehouseman. Notice was duly given and the responsibility of the Soo Line therefore was the responsibility of a warehouseman at the time of the misdelivery, which, as above mentioned, I am assuming took place. The responsibility of a railway company as warehouseman for goods received at their destination and held by the company awaiting the consignee's demand for them seems to include responsibility for misdelivery. As Bramwell L.J. said in Hiort v. London & North Western Ry. Co.[2],\na misdelivery by a carrier was a conversion. I cannot see therefore why a misdelivery by a warehouseman is not a conversion.\nThe dictum of Bramwell L.J. is supported by a decision of the Queen's Bench in Devereux v. Barclay[3]. In such circumstances the railway company is not an involuntary bailee responsible only as regards misdelivery for ordinary care on part of its servants. It is an act in breach of its contract of bailment, to deliver possession of the property the subject of the bailment to anybody but the bailor or somebody acting with the authority of the bailor.\nAccordingly, on the assumption that there was misdelivery, that is to say, assuming the United States Lumber & Box Company had no right to possession either derivatively from the appellants or otherwise, there was a breach of duty by the Soo Line. Is this a breach of duty in re- spect of which a responsibility under the terms of the bill of lading falls also upon the respondent? That depends, as I have said, on the scope and effect of section 2 of the conditions. The precise point is whether there was \"loss\" by reason of such misdelivery constituting \"loss **** caused by or resulting from the act, neglect or default\" of the Soo Line. \"Loss\" may mean the being deprived of, or the failure to keep something or the fact that something can no longer be found or, on the other hand, it may mean the detriment or disadvantage involved in being deprived of something, or simply pecuniary detriment or disadvantage. I am giving in substance the pertinent dictionary definitions from the \"Oxford Dictionary.\"\nNow it is quite clear that \"loss\" here means loss of the goods; it does not mean loss in the sense of pecuniary disadvantage sustained by the shipper by reason of the carrier's default. I do not see any reason why it should not be read in the sense of \"being deprived of\"; and I see no reason why the scope of the phrase should be so restricted as to exclude \"loss\" in that sense by reason of misdelivery. I think therefore that loss by reason of misdelivery may be \"loss\" within the meaning of section 2. To hold otherwise indeed would be inconsistent with a dictum of Lord Blackburn and with a decision based upon it as long ago as 1888. In Morritt v. North Eastern Ry. Co.[4], Blackburn J. (as he then was) had to consider the effect of the exemption in the \"Carrier's Act,\" 11 Geo. IV and 1 Wm. IV, ch. 68, sec. 1, under which no stagecoach proprietors and other common carriers were exempted from liability for \"the loss of or injury to\" certain enumerated kinds of articles unless certain conditions existed which were not present in that case and at p. 308 he says:\u2014\nIt was urged by counsel for the plaintiff that in several cases it had been decided that if a carrier delivered goods to the wrong person by mistake, this was a conversion, and that it followed therefore that the \"Carriers Act\" did not protect him. I do not think this follows at all. It seems to me that if the Act protects the carrier from loss or injury, it should protect him whether the liability is charged in an action on the case, or in an action of trover, or in an action on the contract. I think this is fortified by considering that he is still liable for anything done feloniously. If it could be maintained that carriers were not protected where the act was done negligently so that a railway company were to be answerable if their servant honestly forwards goods to the wrong person, it would be unnecessary to say that they are to be answerable if the servant hands them to another for the purpose of stealing them.\nThis expression of opinion was followed by a Divisional Court in 1888 (in the case of Skipwith v. Great Western Ry. Co. [5]. In that case it was held that the railway company having received at its cloak-room a certain bag for safe custody (on the terms that the company was not in certain circumstances to be answerable\nfor loss or detention of or other injury to any article or property exceeding the value of 5 pounds)\nwas responsible for the loss occasioned by the delivery of the bag to a person not entitled to receive it. I think therefore that if there is \"loss\" of the goods in consequence of a misdelivery the respondents are responsible for that \"loss\" under section 2 of the contract.\nAn important question arises however whether such \"loss\" has been proved.\nThe goods were consigned to Nickerson & Co. who had authorized the appellants to receive them. Prima facie the appellants, I agree, proved a case of misdelivery and consequent \"loss\" (within the sense above mentioned) by proving the failure of the company to deliver on demand coupled with the admission indeed made by counsel that the lumber had been delivered to the United States Lumber & Box Co. Prima facie the appellants thereby brought their case within the conditions of liability under the contract.\nOther facts, however, developed during the course of the trial, the effect of which it is necessary to consider. The United States Lumber & Box Co: were the purchasers of the goods in question and while as between the railway company and themselves the appellants retained possession of the goods by having them consigned to Nickerson and deliverable to themselves it seems probable that the property had passed to the United States Lumber & Box Co. The five cars in respect of which the dispute arises were only five out of 250 sold by the same shippers to the same purchasers, all of which were delivered by the railway com- pany to the United States Lumber & Box Co. There is some documentary evidence that with the knowledge and acquiescence of the appellants goods shipped under similar bills of lading were delivered to the United States Lumber & Box Co. without the production of the bills of lading and without any special direction from the appellants. I think the proper inference from the whole of the evidence is that the claim against the railway company followed as a result of unsuccessful efforts to obtain payment from the United States Lumber & Box Co. after possession had to the knowledge of the appellants passed to the purchasers by delivery by the Soo Line. The bills of lading, it must be remembered, are not bills under which the company agreed to deliver the goods shipped to the order of the consignee and in consequence they are not in any sense negotiable instruments. The railway company was entitled to deal with the person entitled to possession of the goods in the absence of notice of some dealing affecting that person's rights.\nI think the circumstances in evidence rebut the prima facie case made by the appellant because I think they point to the conclusion that assuming there was technically a misdelivery it was a misdelivery from which no \"loss\" would have resulted within the meaning of the conditions but for the assent of the appellants to what was done.\nIn this view it is not necessary to consider the question whether the clause in respect of notice applies. But as the other members of the court have dealt with it I shall give my opinion upon it.\nThe contention grounded upon the principle of London & North Western Ry. Co. v. Neilson[6], and the decisions of which it is the culmination seemed at first sight well founded but reflection has convinced me that effect should not be given to it. It is always a question whether or not the language employed is sufficiently clear. The exception contained in the contract in question in Neilson's Case[7] was to go into effect only when\nloss, damage, misconveyance, misdelivery, delay or detention (of the goods) during any portion of the transit or while left in the possession of the railway company. The goods were diverted from the course of the agreed transit and the word \"misconveyance\" was chiefly relied upon. The question was treated in the House of Lords as Lord Sumner observed as \"a matter of construction\" (p. 279). Lord Dunedin said that the contention of the railway must fail unless the word \"misconveyance\" was to\nbe given a meaning so wide as to override the idea of the agreed transit\n(p. 271). The question is here has the word \"loss\" in the notice clause a meaning wide enough to \"override the idea\" of the \"agreed\" delivery to the consignee?\nIt was argued that here delivery to the consignee or some other person authorized by the consignee to receive the goods is fundamental, is an essential element in the performance of the contract; and that loss by reason of failure in respect of this essential term is not \"loss\" against which the carrier is protected by the condition. The cases already cited were cases in which in general terms the defendant was protected against liability for \"loss\" of the goods and loss was considered to include loss in consequence of misdelivery.\nTreating the question as a matter of construction, what is the natural meaning of the word \"loss\" in the notice clause? By the first section the carrier is made liable for \"loss or injury to the goods;\" the phrase \"loss or injury to the goods\" is repeated in the second section and more than once through the contract. The first section is an affirmation of the liability of the carrier at common law but it is nevertheless an express declaration of his responsibility and I have the greatest difficulty in holding, indeed I am unable to find any satisfactory ground upon which I can hold, that the word \"loss\" in the notice clause has a signification less comprehensive than the same word in section 1 and section 2.\nA somewhat analogous case is presented in a series of decisions culminating in the decision of the House of Lords in Atlantic Shipping & Trading Co. v. Dreyfus[8]. The decision of the House of Lords is relevant only as shewing (see the judgments of Lord Dunedin and Lord Sumner) that the House approved of the principle of the judgments in an earlier decision of the Court of Appeal given in Bank of Australasia v. Clan Line Steamers[9]. The dispute arose there with respect to the interpretation of a clause in a bill of lading in these words,\nno claim that may arise in respect of goods shipped by this steamer will be recoverable,\nunless made at a stipulated place and within a stipulated time. It is settled that such a stipulation is subject in its operation to the underlying condition of the bill of lading which is that the shipowner shall furnish a ship reasonably fit to perform the contract of carriage, in other words, that stipulation has no application to a claim arising in consequence of damage which is due to the fact of the ship being unseaworthy. This is settled, that is to say, where the claim of the shipper rests upon the condition of seaworthiness attached by law to the bill of lading. The question considered by the Lords Justices was the question whether (the responsibility of the shipowner in respect of unseaworthiness having been explicitly declared in the bill of lading) a claim based upon an allegation of unseaworthiness could be treated as outside the scope of the clause whose construction was in dispute; and the view taken, the view which I have already said was afterwards approved by the House of Lords, was that the clause relied upon must be read as applying to all claims based upon the explicit provisions of the bill of lading. At p. 53 Pickford L.J said:\u2014\nThe first part of the clause does not seem to me to do more than express in terms what would be the obligation if it were not there, and it may be said, and it has been said with some force, that that cannot make any difference. If you write in what otherwise must be taken as impliedly written in, it is exactly the same as if you had not written at all. There is great force in that argument, but I do not think it is really sound because I think the effect of writing it in, instead of leaving it to be implied, is that it makes it an express term of the bill of lading which was not so in either of the cases to which I have referred and, making it an express term of the bill of lading, it is more likely that the meaning of the bill of lading exception is that it shall apply to the term which is expressly put into the bill of lading. The decision of the Court of Appeal, of course, is not strictly an authority upon the question of the meaning of the bill of lading which it is our duty to pass upon but a similar process of reasoning applied in this case leads to a similar result.\nThe principal difficulty I have felt with respect to the application of the notice clause arises in this way. The goods in question undoubtedly did arrive at the destination signified. We must assume that notice was duly given within section 6 and after the expiration of 48 hours after notice the carrier became responsible as warehouseman. Any \"failure to make delivery\" after that could only be a \"failure\" after demand by or on behalf of the consignee and a reasonable time for delivery could only mean a reasonable time after demand. It seems singular (the goods having arrived at destination, notice having been given of their arrival and demand made by the consignee) that further notice should be required of the fact of nondelivery in consequence of that demand. Still there is no practical difficulty in putting the clause into operation in such circumstances, there is no absurdity, there is no repugnancy and I think one must hold that the clause does apply after arrival at destination and notice to the carrier, in other words, that \"delivery\" means not delivery at destination but delivery to the party entitled to receive the goods.\nIn the result the notice clause although applicable in the circumstances of the case would afford no defence be cause there is no evidence of any demand having been made except the demand by the purchasers and consequently the time prescribed never began to run.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nANGLIN J.\u2014The plaintiff sues as indorsee of five bills of lading issued by the defendant company at Prince Rupert to the G. W. Nickerson Company as shippers and consignees of five cars of lumber to be transported, one to Minneapolis and four to Minnesota Transfer. The cars were hauled by the defendant company to Winnipeg and were there delivered to the Canadian Pacific Railway Company to be taken to their respective destinations. The plaintiff company had sold the lumber to the United States Lumber & Box Co. but had not been paid for it. The bills of lading were held by the Standard Bank to be handed over to the purchasers on payment being made. The Canadian Pacific Railway Company, without requiring or obtaining surrender of the bills of lading and, so far as the evidence discloses, without any direction either from the G. W. Nickerson Co. or the plaintiff company, allowed possession of the lumber to be taken by, or on behalf of, the United States Lumber & Box Company, who in turn sold it to its customers by whom it was eventually taken over. The plaintiff company now seeks to recover the price of the lumber from the defendant railway company asserting that under section 2 of the conditions of the standard bills of lading it is responsible for the fault or misfeasance of the second carrier which resulted in the wrongful handing over of the goods and the loss to it of the price thereof.\nThe chief defence made to the action is the failure of the plaintiff company to give the notice prescribed by the following clause in the bills of lading:\nSec. 4. Notice of loss, damage, or delay must be made in writing to the carrier at the point of delivery, or to the carrier at the point of origin, within four months after delivery of the goods, or, in case of failure to make delivery, then within four months after a reasonable time for delivery has elapsed. Unless notice is so given, the carrier shall not be liable.\nIt may be assumed that more than four months after a reasonable time for delivery had elapsed before any notice of loss or claim was given by the plaintiff company. In the trial court and on appeal failure to give this notice was held to afford a complete defence to the action.\nIt is in my opinion at least very doubtful whether upon the facts of this case it falls within the purview of the clause I have quoted. It is not in respect of every \"failure to make delivery\" that this clause is applicable, but only where the failure to deliver is due to \"loss,\" total or partial, of the goods. The notice must always be of \"loss, damage or delay.\" There is no suggestion that this case is one of \"damage\" or of \"delay\" since under these terms delivery either in an injured state or after an undue lapse of time is contemplated. Here there was no delivery what- ever. I have no doubt that \"loss\" in this clause means physical loss of the goods and not money loss suffered by the plaintiff. It means loss of the goods either by the carrier or to the owner or the person entitled to delivery. If the loss be temporary only, it may result merely in delayed delivery. But I am not satisfied that the case is one of loss within the stipulation for notice, where, as here, the inability of the carrier to make delivery is due to his having by the act of himself, or of his servants acting on his behalf, wilfully divested himself of the charge of the goods. \"Loss\" within the meaning of the stipulation may occur by accident during transit, or it may happen through negligence from which the element of wilfulness is absent, or even by the theft committed either by employees or by strangers. But I doubt that this term, if fairly construed, covers non-delivery due to an intentional parting with the goods by the carrier or his servants amounting to a wilful misfeasance. The provision under consideration applies alike to the case of loss, damage or delay due to the fault of the original or of a later carrier and both are equally entitled to the benefit of it. I find it very difficult to believe that it was intended to enable a carrier who wilfully hands over freight to a person not entitled to receive it to assert a right to the protection of this notice clause in respect of such an act of misfeasance. Goods which have been thus deliberately disposed of by the carrier and of which the situation after such disposition is fully known would not commonly be spoken of as having been \"lost.\" Bayley J. in delivering the judgment of the Court of King's Bench, so indicated in Garnett v. Willan[10], determined over 100 years ago. I am by no means convinced that there was a \"loss\" of the goods here in question within the meaning of the stipulation for notice.\nBut was there a \"loss\" of them within the meaning of that term as used in the second section of the conditions indorsed on the bills of lading?\nSec. 2.\u2014In the case of shipments from one point in Canada to another point in Canada, or where goods are shipped under a joint tariff, the carrier issuing this bill of lading, in addition to its other liability here- under, shall be liable for any loss, damage or injury to such goods from which the other carrier is not by the terms of the bill of lading relieved, caused by or resulting from the act, neglect or default of any other carrier to which such goods may be delivered in Canada, or under such joint tariff, or over whose line or lines such goods may pass in Canada, or under such joint tariff, the onus of proving that such loss was not so caused or did not so result being upon the carrier issuing this bill of lading ***.\nIn my opinion this is not a case of \"loss\" within the meaning of that provision. The preposition \"of\" has been carelessly or accidentally omitted after the word \"loss\" I have no doubt that physical loss (in this instance by the carrier) of the goods themselves is the case dealt with and not pecuniary loss sustained by the owner of them. This is a provision which subjects the original or issuing carrier to a greater burden than the common law would impose upon him. Moreover, the section contains an unusual stipulation as to the burden of proof casting not on the plaintiff but on the defendant, the original carrier, the onus, in the case of loss, of proving that it was not caused by the act, neglect or default of any other carrier engaged in the transportation.\nPrima facie, in my opinion, the word is here used in the sense of \"mislaying\" or of \"deprivation of possession by misadventure or mere negligence.\" It may well be that it was thought proper in framing the standard bills of lading which are approved by the Board of Railway Commissioners, to impose on the original carrier liability for loss of the goods in that sense occurring through the fault of the subsequent carrier but not responsibility for the consequences of the latter wilfully parting with the possession of them to a person not entitled to delivery. In construing this clause we should not, I think, treat it as imposing so wide a liability unless upon a fair reading of it the intention to create such an extended responsibility is adequately expressed. In my opinion it is not, and the defendant is on that ground entitled to succeed.\nTaking this view of the scope of section 2 does not result in any real hardship to the owner or consignee of the goods. It merely prevents his pursuing an original carrier who has fully discharged his own obligations and leaves unaffected whatever redress the common law may afford him against the later carrier to whose fault is attributable the non\u2014delivery of which he complains.\nI would, on this ground, affirm the judgment dismissing this action.\nBROUDEUR J.\u2014In July, 1920, the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway Co. issued straight bills of lading for five cars of lumber consigned to the G. W. Nickerson Company in Minneapolis, Minnesota, or in the Minnesota transfer which is near Minneapolis.\nThese bills of lading were on forms approved by the Board of Railway Commissioners in 1909.\nThe routes mentioned in the bills were the G.T.P. and the C.P.R. Soo line.\nThese bills, though not negotiable, were indorsed by the consignees in favour of the Premier Lumber Co. and were transferred to a bank in Vancouver which seems to have kept them.\nIt is in evidence that the Premier Lumber Co. had a contract with a United States company called the United States Lumber & Box Co. for a very large number of cars, about 250, and the shipping of these cars was made in different ways. Some were shipped on straight bills of lading not negotiable; some others were carried on order bills of lading negotiable.\nThe five cars in question in this case were issued on straight bills of lading which should not have been negotiated by indorsement. But they were however transferred to the bank in Vancouver and kept there.\nWhen the cars arrived at the point of destination, the C.P.R., on whose line they were, then notified the Premier Lumber Co. of their arrival and asked for delivery instructions for some of them, if not for all; and the Premier Lumber Co. simply transferred this notice to the United States Lumber & Box Co. which obtained from the railway company the delivery of the cars. Some correspondence was later on exchanged between the Premier Lumber Company and the purchaser of the lumber, the United States Lumber & Box Co., as to some shortage which was found in these cars. These facts shew very conclusively that the appellant company intended that these cars should be handed over to this United States Company.\nSome difficulty arose later on between these two lumber companies as to the payment for these cars. Then the Premier Lumber Co., the shipper, gave, in February, 1921, notice to the G.T.P. that they were holding the bills of lading for these five cars and that they wanted to know what had happened to them. They later on, in September, 1921, instituted the present action against the G.T.P. for the price of these five cars.\nThe defendant railway company pleaded that they were not liable for the value of these cars, that they were duly delivered to the C.P.R. Co. and that under the bill of lading the plaintiff was bound to give notice in writing for any loss within four months and that their failure to give such notice prevents them from making any claim.\nThe action was dismissed by the trial judge and his judgment has been confirmed by a majority judgment in appeal.\nThe case turns largely upon the provision of the bills of lading concerning the notice. This provision reads as follows:\u2014\nNotice of loss, damage, or delay must be made in writing to the carrier at the point of delivery, or to the carrier at the point of origin, within four months after delivery of the goods, or in case of failure to make delivery, then within four months after a reasonable time for delivery has elapsed. Unless notice is so given the carrier shall not be liable.\nThe circumstances of this case are such that the claim made by the Premier Lumber Co. does not look to me as being a very honest claim. They knew that these cars had arrived at destination and it was their duty to take delivery of them from the C.P.R. in presenting the bills of lading if they were negotiable. But though these bills of lading were not negotiable, they had advances made on these bills by their bank. They would have to reimburse the bank for these advances in order to obtain possession of these bills of lading. They virtually suggested to their purchaser, the United States Lumber Co. to obtain delivery of these cars without presenting the bills of lading. Their purchaser obtained delivery to their knowledge and with their consent, and several months later they tried, in view of some trouble which arose as to payment of this lumber to claim its value from the original carrier.\nIf, by the acts of the consignee, the shipper is misled as to the person to whom delivery should be made, the carrier should be excused from liability for a misdelivery caused thereby. Corpus Juris, vol. 10, p. 267.\nThe railway company is entitled to plead the failure of notice within four months after a reasonable time for delivery has elapsed.\nThe shipper being aware that the goods had been handed over to his purchaser should have in due time protested against the railway company making delivery of the cars to the United States Lumber Co. But they did nothing of the kind. On the contrary, they concocted plans with their purchaser for deceiving to a certain extent the bank which had made advances on these cars.\nThey rely on certain decisions in England where the courts had to consider bills of lading in which the carriers endeavoured to limit the general liability cast upon them as carriers by inserting special exceptions; these exceptions were very rigidly construed and, in case of doubt, were construed against the carrier who had stipulated. It is to be noted that in Canada the bills of lading at issue were promulgated by the Board of Railway Commissioners under the authority of the law and should be construed according to the spirit of fairness which the board intended to establish in the relations between the shipper and the carrier.\nI do not think then that these English decisions could always be invoked in the construction of the Canadian bills of lading which are the result of a quasi judicial enactment.\nThe appeal fails and should be dismissed with costs.\nMIGNAULT J.\u2014The question here is as to the liability of the respondent on five bills of lading covering the shipment of the same number of cars loaded with lumber and which the appellant alleges were not delivered in accordance with the bills of lading. The appellant, a company carrying on business at Vancouver, had purchased this lumber from the G. W. Nickererson Company, Ltd., and had sold it to the United States Lumber and Box Co., of Portland, Oregon. The bills of lading were in the standard form known as a \"straight bill of lading\u2014original\u2014non-negotiable,\" approved by the Board of Railway Commissioners for Canada, and they stated that the lumber was shipped from Prince Rupert, B.C., by the G. W. Nickerson Co., Ltd., and consigned to that company. Each bill was indorsed as follows:\nDeliver to Premier Lumber Co., Ltd. (Sgd.) the G. W. Nickerson Co., Ltd., M. F. Nickerson.\nFour of these cars were to go to Minnesota Transfer and the fifth to Minneapolis, both places in the State of Minnesota, the carriage being by the respondent's line of railway to Winnipeg and thence by what is known as the Soo line of the C.P.R. The appellant had sold and shipped some 200 or 250 cars of lumber to the said United Lumber & Box Co., certain of these shipments having been made on open bills of lading, and the lumber was sent to Minneapolis or to Minnesota Transfer, in order that the purchasers might ship the cars to their customers in different parts of the United States. The bills of lading in question remained in Vancouver and were in the hands of the Standard Bank from whom the appellant had borrowed money, and the appellant expected that the United States Lumber & Box Co. would pay for the lumber there and thus get possession of these bills of lading.\nThe five cars arrived at their destination in August, 1920, and so far as the record shews they were delivered to the United States Lumber & Box Co. by the C.P.R. without the bills of lading having been obtained and produced by the former company. How and under what circumstances this delivery was made is not disclosed, but I cannot doubt that the appellant was aware of the arrival of the cars, and I also think (as shewn by telegrams and letters received by the appellant from the Lumber & Box Co., complaining of shortage) that the appellant must have known that the United States Lumber & Box Company had obtained delivery of at least two of these cars. Un- doubtedly the appellant expected that the latter company would pay for this lumber, but it not having done so, this action was taken against the respondent more than a year after the shipment. The substance of the complaint is that the respondent did not deliver the lumber to the appellant, and the demand is for the value of the goods, to wit, $6,903.54.\nThe fault here was admittedly that of the connecting carrier, the C.P.R., and the appellant seeks to render the respondent responsible for this fault under section 2 of the bills of lading, the effect of which, in cases where as here the shipment is made under a joint tariff, is to make the initial carrier liable for any loss, damage or injury to the goods from which the connecting carrier is not relieved by the terms of the bill of lading, caused by or resulting from the act, neglect or default of such carrier. And this condition gives the initial carrier the right to recover from the connecting carrier the amount which he may be required to pay for the loss, damage or injury to the goods sustained on the line of the connecting carrier. This liability of the initial carrier for the fault of the connecting carrier is of course in addition to that which he incurs for loss, damage or injury sustained on his own line.\nThe principal defence is that no notice of loss or failure to deliver in accordance with the bills of lading was given as required by the fourth paragraph of section 4 of the bills of lading which is as follows:\u2014\nNotice of loss, damage or delay must be made in writing to the carrier at the point of delivery, or to the carrier at the point of origin, within four months after delivery of the goods, or in case of failure to make delivery, then within four months after a reasonable time for delivery has elapsed. Unless notice is so given the carrier shall not be liable.\nThis condition is eminently a reasonable one, especially where, as here, the fault is that of the connecting carrier, in view of the liability for that fault of the initial carrier who should have prompt notice thereof in order to secure his right of indemnity against the connecting carrier. And it is obviously important that he should be afforded the opportunity to inquire into the circumstances surrounding the loss or want of delivery of which he may well have had no knowledge.\nBut the appellant refers us to a long line of decisions whereby it has been held that the carrier cannot rely on conditions limiting or taking away his common law liability, where he has not carried out the contract of carriage, but the loss was sustained while he was doing something different from what he had contracted to do. The rule may be stated in the language of Scrutton L.J. in the recent case of Neilson v. London & North Western Ry. Co.[11].\nWhen a carrier seeks to protect himself by exceptions, unless they are so worded as to indicate clearly a contrary intention, they only apply where the excepted events happen in the course of his carrying out the contract, and do not apply where they happen while he is doing something which he has not contracted to do *** If a carrier wishes to protect himself from liability for the negligence of his servants, he must do so in clear and unambiguous language.\nThe cases where the carrier has not been allowed to rely on a notice posted up in his office or a condition of the contract restricting his common law liability are cases of gross negligence or of a departure from the contract of carriage, and no case had been cited where the condition, as here, was not a limitation of the common law liability of the carrier, but merely the requiring of a notice of loss as a condition of a claim against the carrier.\nHere the appellant has not shewn under what circumstances the lumber which was carried over the prescribed route to the point of destination, was delivered to the purchasers, so no case of gross negligence or of departure from the contract of carriage is established. And, as I have said, the condition as to notice is not a limitation of the common law liability of the carrier, but a most reasonable requirement of the contract of carriage. If any intimation can be said to have been given to the respondent that the lumber had not been delivered in accordance with the bills of lading, it was only on February 4, 1921, more than four months after the arrival of the goods and a reasonable time for delivery had elapsed, when the appellant wrote to the respondent asking what happened to these cars. This, in my opinion, is a bar to the action of the appellant. A question has arisen during consideration of this case whether what happened to these five cars can properly be described as a \"loss\" of the goods, so as to bring it under the operation of the condition requiring notice. The word \"loss\" is also contained in section 2 of the bills of lading on which the appellant's action is based, and it would not help the appellant to exclude the condition as to notice, if section 2 would also be inapplicable, by reason of there not having been a \"loss\" within the meaning of the section. It is difficult to believe that the \"loss\" contemplated is not of the same nature in the condition requiring notice as in section 2. If I am wrong therefore in thinking that the condition can fairly be applied in this case as a bar to the appellant's action, it would follow that section 2 does not give the appellant the right of action which it has asserted. In any event the appellant could not succeed.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Mayers, Stockton & Smith.\nSolicitor for the respondent: R.
