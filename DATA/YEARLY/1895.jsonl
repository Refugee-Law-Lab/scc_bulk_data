Howard, and the appellant Frank B. Howard con demined for the further sum of $2,264, and interest individually.\nThe causes of action as set up in the declaration and the pleas are fully stated in the judgments hereinafter given. Martin and Gilman for appellants.\nGreen shields Q C. for respondent.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014I am of opinion that this appeal must be dismissed with costs.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014The respondents, a New York company, the plaintiffs in this case, claim from the appellants, Angus & Howard, a sum of $8,864 upon the following state of facts. Howard, on the 18th of April, 1889 being the owner of a United States patent for improvements in apparatus for manufacturing hollow ware from pulp, entered into an agreement with the company, respondent, by which he agreed to assign and excuse to the company an exclusive license to manufacture and sell in the United States cans for holding kerosene oil under the said patent. This agreement, which is contained in a writing sous seing priv\u00e9 is a clumsily drawn document, and one that re quires a close examination before being perfectly under stood. However the parties themselves do not substantially differ about the conditions of their contract. The controversy is as to what happened subsequently and as to the legal result of the failure of what I may term their joint enterprise.\nHoward, by a separate instrument of the same date, duly executed a license or transfer of his patent to the company, as he had agreed to do, but the company claim that this patent was worthless, and that a merchantable and useful can for holding kerosene oil could not be manufactured under it as he had covenanted to do; that the article he manufactured was worthless and rejected by the trade; that Howard, under a subsequent agreement dated the 24th April, 1889,was obliged to refund to the company the they advanced to him at different times, amounting sums to $18,000, of which $8,864 are due; that Angus, the other defendant, agreed on the 24th April, to become surety to the company for the repayment of those advances up to $6,000. The defendants pleaded separately, alleging that Howard had duly fulfilled all his part of the agreement, and that, if the article manufactured is worthless he is not responsible for it. It results from the evidence, as found by the Superior Court and the Court of Appeal that the company's allegations of fact are fully borne out. It would be useless for me here to give the details of an enqu\u00eate, a great part of which is itself utterly use less. Of the one hundred and twelve documents filed and the nineteen witnesses examined, more than half might well have been left out. One fact is clear. It is that the cans manufactured by Howard are altogether unsalable, and why he should not refund to the company the advances they made to him under their agreement is what he has, to my mind, altogether failed to establish.\nThe company has certainly disbursed these sums, and has as certainly received no consideration whatever for them. The judgment in their favour against Howard for $8864 is in my opinion unassailable.\nAs to Angus, he was not Howard's partner in this matter, as found in the court below, and consequently the judgment against him can only be, as it is for the amount of his guarantee, $6,000.\nIt was argued by the appellants that the respondents should have exercised the option given them under the contract to have taken out a license for the manufacture of other pulp ware goods under other patents owned by Howard, and that, had they done so, they might have saved the loss that they are now seeking to recover. This point, however, is not in any way raised by the pleadings, and cannot avail the appellants. The respondents would perhaps have been able to prove that these other patents Were as valueless as the one in question, had they had the opportunity. The appellants' contention that the judgment of the Superior Court does not set aside the contract as prayed for by the declaration, though founded in fact does not help them in law. If anyone can complain that the judgment does not grant all the relief demanded by the declaration it is not the appellants. They also argued that, under this judgment, the company will get back their money and still retain Howard's patent for the whole of the United States Here again there is no issue of the kind raised by the pleadings. Had the appellants asked for it the company would undoubtedly have filed immediately a re-transfer of the patent. The appellants are entitled to it however and an order will be added to the judgment, if desired, that the patent is to be re-transferred to them and all the company's rights to it under the agreement in question put an end to, said re-transfer, however, to operate and have effect only upon payment of the amount of the judgment.\nGWYNNE and SEDGEWICK JJ. concurred.\nKING J.\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Queen's Bench of Quebec, affirming a judgment of Mr. Justice Mathieu condemning the appellants, inter alia to pay to the respondents the sum of $6000 with interest from 13th May 1891.\nOn 18th April, 1889, an agreement was entered into between the company and Howard, by which Howard agreed to execute an exclusive license to the company (subject to conditions of agreement) to manufacture and sell in the United States cans for holding kerosene oil to replace those then sold in the market, which were made from glass, tin and other materials, also all articles then manufactured by the company that could be made from pulp under a patent owned by Howard.\nHoward also agreed to do all acts to the best of his ability, necessary to maintain and protect the validity of the patent to furnish drawings and specifications necessary to build and erect machinery and fixtures for the manufacturing of said articles, to give his time and all necessary information for the building and erecting and starting of said machinery and fixtures free of charge, upon expenses paid, to discount drafts in certain banks, and to grant to the company a new license to manufacture and sell in the United States some other lines of goods that could be manufactured from pulp under his patents in case it should be found that within two months from the company receiving cans then being made by the Howard Pulp Co., that the trade would not accept and buy them.\nThe company, on their part, agreed to proceed with due diligence to build and erect buildings, machinery and fixtures necessary and suitable to manufacture at least 1,500 one gallon oil cans (or its equivalent in large cans) per day and thereafter to manufacture all the said cans or goods that could be sold in the United States at a fair business profit, provided that the trade accept and buy the cans then being made for the company by the Howard Pulp Ware Company.\nThere were other agreements by the company, relating to the mode of making up accounts, keeping books, opening the factories to Howard, &c., and for the manufacturing near Chicago if a larger profit could be realized.\nThen there follows this agreement:\nSaid party of second part further agrees to advance from time to time in amounts as may be needed by said party of first part, any amounts, the total of which shall not exceed $6,000 by accepting time drafts drawn by said party of 1st part on said party of 2nd part, and by accepting renewal time drafts drawn, &c., from time to time as may be needed to carry said advance of $6,000 or any part thereof until such time as the profit accruing to the party of the first part under this agreement shall be sufficient to pay said drafts.\nIt was also agreed that Howard's share of the net profits should be retained by the company and applied to the payment of the advance and renewal drafts until same are paid in full.\nBy another agreement of same date referring to that already mentioned it was agreed that in case \" Angus will not sign an agreement to repay the company any amount that may be advanced Howard (under said agreement) within 12 months from this date then the said agreement shall be null and void and a new agree ment shall be entered into between Howard and the company.\"\nOn the 24th ApriI 1889 Howard addressed to the company a letter saying:\nI hereby agree that if from the cause set forth in my agreement with you, dated April 18th, 1889, it should occur that you were unable to carry out your part of said agreement, that then, and in such case I will repay you on or before the 18th day of April, 1890, the total amount that you may have advanced to me under said agreement of 18th April, 1889.\nIt is understood that this agreement shall form a part of said agreement of 18th April 1889.\nOn the same day, viz., April 24th, 1889, Angus signed the following guarantee:\nWhereas F. B. Howard has entered into an agreement dated April 18th, 1889, with Union Gas and Oil Stove Company of New York, for the manufacture and sale of` articles from pulp under Howard's Patent by the conditions of said agreement Howard is to obtain from said company an advance loan up to the amount of $6,000 by his drafts on them on time. The undersigned being fully aware of all the conditions of the agreement between the said Howard and the company above referred to, hereby agrees to become surety to the said company for the repayment of said drafts within 12 months from date of said agreement, in case it should transpire that if (sic) from the reasons incorporated in said agreement, it should not be carried out.\n(Signed) WM. ANGUS. The advance of $6,000 was duly made by drafts which after certain renewals the company were obliged to pay.\nThe cans made for the company by the Howard Pulp Ware Company were supplied to the respondent company between the date of the agreement and August of the same year, and were sold by the company to their customers, wholesale jobbers, by whom they were sold to the retail dealer, through whom they got into the hands of the consumers. Presently large numbers of them came back to the respondent company, being returned by the buyers who found that they would not hold oil. In the process of making them the pulp can was subjected to an indurating or hardening process by a coating of oxydized linseed oil. But it was found that after a while the kerosene oil stored in them found its way through the indurated surface and soaking into the pulpy substance destroyed their efficiency. The consequence was that the goods were thrown back upon the hands of the company and became worthless. In the meantime the company having proceeded to build and having built and filled a factory for the manufacture of the cans in Connecticut and having manufactured a large number of the cans found themselves with a useless factory and use less stock on their hands. The evidence clearly shows that the venture was a business failure entirely through the inutility of Howard's patent for the induration of pulp oil cans.\nThe want of mercantile value in the oil cans manufactured under Howard's patent and license disabled the company in a mercantile sense from carrying out their undertaking to manufacture and sell the goods, and this is from \" a cause set forth in the agreement \" within the meaning of those words as used in Howard's letter to the company of April 24th, 1889. Consequently under the terms of that letter Howard became bound to repay to the company on or before 18th April, 1890, the total amount advanced to him under the agreement of 18th April, 1889. The amount so advanced to Howard exceeded the $6,000 named in the agreement. It was in fact $8,000 and upwards and for that sum he is indebted to the company and liable to make to them payment in accordance with the terms of his letter.\nThen as to the guarantee of Angus. It recites the fact of the agreement of April 18th, 1889, for the manufacture and sale of articles made from pulp under Howard's patent, and Angus, having knowledge of all the conditions of the agreement \"agrees to become surety to the said company for the repayment of said drafts within 12 months from date of said agreement in case it should transpire that (if) from the reasons incorporated in said agreement it should not be carried out.\"\nWas the agreement not \"carried out,\" and if so, was this \"from the reasons incorporated in it?\"\nWhat was the contemplated failure of the agreement? and what were the reasons incorporated in the agreement as being likely to cause the contemplated failure to carry out the agreement. Manifestly the profitable manufacture and sale of the wares was the chief object of the agreement. It was through this that both parties sought the business advantage they contemplated, and it was through this that Howard was able to obtain the advance, and that the company was willing to make the advance, relying upon Howard's share of the profits as a further security.\nThe contingency of the cans not being acceptable to the trade was in terms expressed, and is made the subject of certain stipulations. I think therefore that the only thing intended by the clause referred to in Angus's guarantee was a possible failure to manufacture and sell the wares by reason of the trade not taking to them.\nThe object of the guarantee apparently was to protect the company in case the manufacturing scheme broke down from the inutility of Howard's patent or invention.\nThis result has happened, and therefore Angus as surety is bound to indemnify the company against the advance.\nIt was argued that under clause 13 the only recourse of the company was to apply for another license to manufacture other pulp goods under Howard's patent. But this clause is one giving an option to the company and binding Howard to performance if the option is exercised, but it in no way deprives the company of the right to repayment of the advance.\nThen it was argued that under clause 20 the debt was to be paid out of a fund viz., the profits. The answer is twofold. 1st, that the fund is not made in exclusion of personal liability and responsibility, but is an additional security, and 2ndly, if the fund is pre vented from being formed by reason of Howard's patent turning out worthless, for the purpose intended, it is not for him or his surety to say that the fund is the only way through which the advance is to be repaid. Then it is said that as within two months next after the company received the cans from the Howard Co., the cans had been purchased and had not been returned, therefore the plaintiff could not insist upon the guarantee. But the 20th clause only seems to apply to the exercise of the option referred to.\nUpon a broad and useful reading of the agreement I think that the facts of the case as proved and as found by the court below are within its terms and that \"from the reasons incorporated in the agreement it was not carried out.\" The scheme of manufacturing failed through the defects of Howard's invention.\nI therefore think that the company are entitled to recover.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants : Girouard, Foster, Martin & Girouard.\nSolicitors for respondent : Greenshields & Greenshields.\n"}

D.K. & Z.' or the words 'John DeKuyper & Son, Rotterdam, & Co.' as per the annexed drawings and application,\" In the application the trade mark was claimed to consist of a device or representation of an anchor inclined from right to left in combination with the letters \"J.D.K. & Z.\" or the words \"John DeKuyper &c., Rotterdam,\" which, it was stated, might be branded or stamped upon barrels, kegs, cases, boxes, capsules, casks, labels and other packages containing geneva sold by plaintiffs. It was also stated in the application that on bottles was to be affixed a printed label, a copy or facsimile of which was attached to the application, but there was no express claim of the label itself as a trade-mark. This label was white and in the shape of a heart with an ornamental border of the same shape, and on the label was printed the device or representation of the anchor with the letters \"J. D. K. & Z.\" and the words \"John De Kuyper & Son, Rotterdam,\" and also the words \"Genuine Hollands Geneva\" which it was admitted were common to the trade. The defendants' trade mark was, in the certificate of registration, described as consisting of an eagle having at the feet \"V. D. W. & Co.\" above the eagle being written the words \"Finest Hollands Geneva;\" on each side are the two faces of a medal, underneath on a scroll the name of the firm \"Van Dulken Weiland & Co.\" and the word \"Schiedam,\" and lastly at the bottom the two faces of a third medal, the whole on a label in the shape of a heart (le tout sur une \u00e9tiquette en forme de c\u0153ur). The colour of the label was white.\nHeld, affirming the judgment of the Exchequer Court, that the label did not form an essential feature of the plaintiffs' trade mark as registered but that, in view of the plaintiffs' prior use of the white heart-shaped label in Canada, the defendants had no exclusive right to the use of the said label, and that the entry of registration of their trade mark should be so rectified as to make it clear that the heart shaped label formed no part of such trade mark. Taschereau and Gwynne JJ. dissenting on the ground that the white heart shaped label with the scroll and its constituents was the trade mark which was protected by registration and that the defendants' trade mark was an infringement of such trade mark.\nAppeals from a decision of the Exchequer Court of Canada[1] by John De Kuyper & Son, the plaintiffs in the action, and by Van Dulken, Weiland & Company, the defendants.\nThe action was begun in the Exchequer Court by statement of claim, on 19th January, 1892, after the coming into force of the Acts chaptered 26 and 35 of the Parliament of Canada, passed in 1891.\nThe plaintiffs complain in their action that the defendants' registered trade mark is an infringement and an imitation of that of the plaintiffs, and that the registration of the defendants' trade mark was improvidently allowed to be made, and they ask for a declaration and judgment accordingly, as well as for the cancellation of defendants' trade mark and for an injunction and for damages, and also for a declaration of ownership in favour of plaintiffs, apart from the registered title.\nThe pleadings are fully stated in the report of the case in the Exchequer Court Reports (1.) In 1875 plaintiffs applied for the registration of their trade mark under the Act then in force, viz., the Trade Mark Act of 1868.\nThe application was as follows:\u2014\nTo the Minister of Agriculture,\nOttawa.\nSir,\u2014I, John De Kuyper for and on behalf of the firm of John De Kuyper & Son, carrying on business as distillers in Rotterdam, Kingdom of the Netherlands, hereby furnish a duplicate copy of a trade-mark, which I verily believe is the property of our firm on account of having been the first to make use of the same.\nThe said trade-mark consists of a device or representation of:\nOn the casks containing our Geneva is marked near or under bung,\nhot iron brand.\nJ.

LOWE,\nDeputy of the Minister of Agriculture.\nOttawa, Canada, ce 7\u00e8me jour de janvier A.D. 1893. The Exchequer Court held that the heart-shaped label was not an essential part and feature of plaintiffs'; registered trade mark, and that defendants were not entitled to claim or to register a heart-shaped label as an essential feature of their trade mark (which the judgment declared they had done);' and ordered that the registration of their trade mark should be varied by I striking out therefrom the words \"en forme de c\u0153ur\"; and further ordered the defendants to pay the general costs of the action and of the issue upon which the variation of defendants' registration was directed; but giving no other relief to the plaintiffs.\nThe plaintiffs appealed from the whole judgment, and the defendants from that portion of it which directs the registration of their trade mark to be amended, and which orders them to pay the general costs of the action; and they also appealed from the judgment on the question raised by the demurrer in the first instance and again at the trial as to the jurisdiction of the court and the insufficiency in law of the case as alleged by the plaintiffs.\nThe two appeals were argued together.\nAbbott Q.C., Campbell with him, for the plaintiffs.\nWe appeal from that part of the judgment of the Exchequer Court which holds that the plaintiffs' trade mark cannot be protected except so far as registered, and that all that was registered was the anchor and the name of the firm; and we also claim that more of the defendants' label should have been cancelled.\nIn the first place, the most striking feature in the whole device is the shape and arrangement. The heart-shaped scroll is of itself unusual, whether upon a label cut of that shape or not. Then the scroll-work, it will be observed, is parallel to the cut border of the label, and therefore accentuates its effect. In the second place, the scroll work itself is constructed in a peculiar and identical way in the two labels, that is to say, it consists of a similar alternation of one oval and two round links. The next point of similarity is the way in which in one case the words \"Genuine Hollands,\" and in the other the words \"Finest Hollands\" are placed in a curve in the upper portion of the label in identical type and with a scroll beneath. Then the printing of the word \"Geneva\" is in similar type, and the type itself is of an unusual character, that is to say, whilst the letters are in black, there is a line of shading drawn around the margin of each letter at a certain distance from it, which undoubtedly has the effect of catching the eye. Then the name of the makers is affixed on a curved scroll or ribbon similarly arranged and in the same position in each label. In fact, all the constituent parts of the labels occupy the same relative positions in each with the result that the tout ensemble or general appearance of the two labels constitutes a striking resemblance with part differences in the details which would not be noticed by an ordinary purchaser. To sum up, the defendants' label is of the same shape, the same colour, the same size and the same general design as the plaintiffs' and contains similar words and devices, which, though differing in detail, are combined in such a manner as to give the same appearance.\nAn examination of the two labels will show the marked similarity, not only in general effect but in detailed work, between them.\nThe statute authorized the plaintiffs to register a label and in the present case they did actually produce a label.\nThe label is far more explicit than any descriptive words. The actual drawings and written description, however, to-day stand registered in the books of the department, as appears by the evidence of the custodian of the original. This evidence is sufficient to clear away the ambiguity of the deputy minister's certificate relied on by the court below, if any there be, for if the minister register, as he was bound to do under the statute, and as this certificate shows he did in this case, neither he nor his deputy, by limiting the form of the certificate, could take away the rights of the parties. Nothing could give to any person examining the books a better idea as to what the plaintiffs' label really was than the label itself, and this was actually attached to and formed part of the description and is the best drawing possible. It is therefore erroneous to say that the certificate limits them to their name or initials and the anchor, or that they have accepted any such limitation, if by acceptance is meant that they have acquiesced and are in some way estopped now from rejecting it. See Fouillet on trade marks, No. 37[2].\nFurther, upon a strict application of the rules of pleading as enforced under the Judicature Acts, which are the rules in force in the Exchequer Court, the issue raised by the defendants did not go to the question of the actual registration of the label, and it must be held to be admitted that all they say is that we are not entitled to the exclusive right of issuing this white heart shaped label.\nUnder the circumstances, looking at both labels which are in evidence, we cannot come to any other conclusion than that any ordinary incautious person would be deceived; that we are \"an aggrieved person\" and entitled to contend that the defendants' label was wrongly on the register and that a judgment should be entered ordering the cancellation of the defendants' trade mark[3]. Powell v. Birmingham Vinegar Co.[4].\nFerguson Q.C. and Merrill for defendants.\nOur first point is that the heart-shaped label of the plaintiffs was not registered, and that issue has been clearly raised by our defence. This point has been found in our favour, but the court went further and held that under the Exchequer Amendment Act of 1891 our trade mark should be corrected, as the heart-shape was in public and common use, and that part of the judgment we object to by our appeal. The jurisdiction of the Exchequer Court is confined to causes of action arising out of registered trademarks or with regard to trade marks which it is sought to register or to amend the registration of.\nInfringement or imitation by defendants of the plaintiffs' trade mark must, in order to create a cause of action over which this court would have jurisdiction, be an infringement or imitation of plaintiffs' registered trade mark. The only imitation or infringement in reality complained of by the plaintiffs is the adoption by the defendants of a heart-shaped label as part of their registered trade mark and the use of it by them in their business.\nThere is no statement by any witness that the plaintiffs were the owners, or were the first to use the heart-shaped label. No member of plaintiffs' firm gave any evidence at all in the case; and the declaration filed on their application to register their trade mark does not state that they were the sole owners of the right to use this shape of label as a trade mark, or as a part thereof, or that they had first used it; whilst, on the other hand, there is ample evidence to show that such a shaped label had been used by other manufacturers of gin for years, without question or objection on plaintiffs' part. The court should not by implication or inference read into the claim for, or record of the registration of, a trade mark elements or features not expressly claimed in the application for registration as a part of the mark, or not expressly mentioned in the certificate of registration as being a part of the trade mark.\nThere is not the slightest reference in the certificate granted by the department to a label of any kind as being a part of the trade mark, but the mark is referred to as consisting of \"the representation of an anchor,\" with certain letters and words. The anchor is apparently the essential and really the only distinctive device in the trade mark, the words or letters being merely descriptive and used in connection with the anchor, the only reference to a label being the same as is made to stamping or branding, that is to indicate how the trade mark may be put upon bottles to take the place of branding or stamping in applying it to other packages.\nApart from the heart-shape of the label the plaintiffs do not seriously pretend that the defendants' registered trade mark is an imitation or infringement in any respect of the plaintiffs' trade mark.\nThe learned counsel referred to R.S.C. ch. 63, sec. 19.\nThe judgment of the majority of the court, the Chief Justice and Sedgewick and King JJ., was delivered by:\nKING J.\u2014This is an action in the Exchequer Court to restrain defendants from infringing plaintiffs' trade mark. Both parties reside in Holland and are distillers of gin.\nIn 1875 plaintiffs applied for the registration of their trade mark under the Act then in force[5]. In 1884 the defendants applied for registration of their trade-mark under the Act then in force[6].\nWhat is in contest in this action is the label as used by the respective parties upon the bottles containing their gin.\nThe plaintiffs contend that their registered trade mark, as applied to bottles, consists in a heart-shaped label \"upon which, around and parallel to the border is printed a scroll, also heart-shaped, with at the top, in the semi-circle at each side of the heart, the word \"genuine\" on the one side, and \"Hollands\" on the other, with a slight scroll underneath each word; across the top of the centre of the label the word \"Geneva,\" in large letters, beneath which are the anchor and letters as in the hot iron brand with a flourish on each side of the anchor, and on the bottom part of the centre of the label the words \"John De Kuyper & Son,\" below which is the word \"Rotterdam,\" and below that a leaf pattern.\nThey complain that defendants' label is in its essential particulars the same as the said trade mark of plaintiffs, and is an infringement on and an imitation of the registered brands and trade marks of the plaintiffs, and so resembles the same as to be likely or calculated to deceive and to mislead the public, both by reason of its shape and colour (white), and the scroll, garland and words upon it, and its general appearance, and because that the registration of it conflicts with the registration of the brands and trade marks of plaintiffs, and was made without sufficient cause.\nThe defendants deny that the plaintiffs are entitled to the exclusive right to use a heart-shaped label either by virtue of the registration of their trade mark or by prior ownership, and allege that heart-shaped labels were in common and general use in the spirit trade long prior to plaintiffs' registration. They also allege that the essential features of plaintiffs' trade mark, and those by which plaintiffs' Holland gin was known, are the design of the anchor and the name \"De Kuyper,\" while the essential and distinctive features of defendants' trade mark are the design of the eagle and the name \"Weiland,\" and that neither the heart-shape of the label or the scroll, either separately or together, are essential features by which either plaintiffs' or defendants' gin is known or asked for in the market. They allege that the essential features of the trade marks are different, and that defendants' trade mark is in no respect calculated to mislead or deceive the public, &c.\nThe learned judge of the Exchequer Court was of opinion that the essential particular of plaintiffs' trade mark is the anchor in combination with the letters J. D. K. & Z., or with the words, John De Kuyper & Son, Rotterdam, and that the plaintiffs had not claimed to register a label, or claimed the form of the label as part of the trade mark.\nHe also thought that the differences between the labels were such as to prevent persons of reasonable care and caution from mistaking one for the other, while at the same time holding that \"the fair inference from the facts and circumstances disclosed by the case is that the defendants, while not perhaps attempting to sell their Geneva as that of the plaintiffs, thought to gain a trade advantage by adopting and using a label which in shape and colour resembled that used by the plaintiffs, though otherwise distinguishable from it.\"\nThe learned judge therefore declined to give plaintiffs the relief asked for, but at the same time declared that the defendants were not entitled to claim or to register as an essential feature of their trade mark a heart shaped label, as they had done in their application, and ordered that the entry of the registration of defendants' trade mark be varied by striking therefrom the words \"en forme de c\u0153ur.\" Ordering also that defendants pay the general costs of the action and of the particular issue involved in the paragraph respecting the form of defendants' trade mark.\nBoth parties have appealed, each from so much of the order as is against them respectively.\nFirst as to plaintiffs' appeal. What is plaintiffs' registered trade mark? And has it been infringed by defendants? A label is a vehicle for a common law trade mark rather than a common law trade mark of itself. But by 31 Vic. c. 55, the Trade Mark Act of 1868, it is enacted that \"for the purposes of the Act all marks, names, brands, labels, packages or other business devices which may be adopted for use by any person in his trade, &c., for the purpose of distinguishing any manufacture, product or article by him manufactured, produced, &c., packed or offered for sale, no matter how applied, whether to such manufacture, product or article or to any package, parcel, case, box or other vessel or receptacle containing the same shall be considered and known as a trade mark and may be registered, &c.\"\nThe conditions and mode of registration are defined in sec. 1. The minister of agriculture, it is enacted, shall keep a trade mark register in which any proprietor of a trade mark may have the same registered by depositing with the minister a drawing and description in duplicate of such trade mark together with a declaration that the same was not in use to his knowledge by any other person than himself at the time of his adoption thereof, and the minister on receipt of the fee thereinafter provided shall cause the trade mark to be examined to ascertain whether it resembles any other trade mark already registered; and if he finds that such trade mark is not identical with, or does not so closely resemble as to be confounded with, any other trade mark already registered, he shall register the same and shall return to the proprietor thereof one copy of the drawing and description with a certificate signed by the minister or his deputy to the effect that the trade\" mark has been duly registered in accordance with the provisions of the act, &c.\"\nThe fee referred to is provided by sec. 28, and is the sum of $5 on every application to register a (design or) trade mark including certificate.\nThe Act seems to contemplate that but one trademark shall form the subject of any single application. The plaintiffs' contention is that at least two distinct trade marks formed the subject of their application, that consisting of the anchor with name or initials, and that consisting of the label.\nAs already stated, the Act authorizes the registration of a label as a trade mark. In such case it would appear requisite that the label should, in analogy with the general law of trade marks, have a distinctive character. It would be only thus that the person could be said to be proprietor of it.\nIn the case of a label registered as a trade mark the trade mark does not he in each particular part of the label, per Lord Esher in Pinto v. Badman[7], but in the combination of them all.\nIn the case before us, if the plaintiffs have registered their label they are to be protected against any imitation with mere colourable variations of the label as a whole. If it is registered and if it has been imitated in a way calculated to deceive ordinary purchasers of the article, the rights of the plaintiffs as the holders of the registered trade mark are to be protected. I must say that from looking at the two labels I am inclined to go further than the learned judge, and to hold that defendants' label is calculated to deceive persons into thinking that they are purchasing the goods of the plaintiffs. Upon the evidence I think that the defendants' label was prepared for the purpose of coming as closely as defendants thought they could safely come to that of the plaintiffs. Although Anderson's evidence was broken down to some extent, the fact that defendants sought and obtained a commission for the express purpose of contradicting it, and then did not follow it up, leads me to place some reliance upon it. The learned judge has himself said that defendants sought to get a trade advantage by using a label which in shape and colour resembled that used by plaintiffs. What trade advantage would there be in it unless the shape and colour were associated in the minds of the ordinary purchasers with goods of the plaintiffs?\nIn my opinion courts ought not to hesitate to defeat tricks of trade whenever brought in question.\nBut then comes the most serious question in the case, viz., whether the plaintiffs' label was registered as a trade-mark.\nThat they intended to register the anchor with name or initials there can be no question. Did they also intend to register another trade mark, i.e. the label? And if so, did they meet the requirements of the Act in reference thereto?\nThe application wherever it uses definite language points to a single trade mark as its subject. Thus the applicant, one of the plaintiff firm, says: \"I hereby furnish a duplicate copy of a trade mark which I verily believe is the property of our firm on account of having been the first to make use of the same.\" Then it is said in the application that \"the said trade mark consists of a device or representation.\" I omit for the present a reference to what is so shown as a device or representation, merely drawing attention to what is stated in plain language. Then it is added that \"the whole or any part thereof forms our said trade mark,\" and that \"the said device may be branded or stamped upon barrels, kegs, cases, boxes, capsules, corks, labels, and other packages containing Geneva sold by us, and I hereby request the said trade mark to be registered in accordance with law.\" All this points to a single device, a single representation, a single trade mark; and the affirmation required by the statute is of the firm's ownership and first use of a trade mark, not of two or more trade marks. It is true that a representation is given of the label, which is heart-shaped, and has certain words and scrolls arranged in a certain way upon it, and it is not entirely easy to see why this should have been represented at all if it was not intended to register the label. But, on the other hand, the label has shown upon it the distinctive device of the anchor, with initials and name, which form the essential feature of the trade mark indisputably intended to be registered for use at least on casks, cases, boxes, &c., and it may be that the label was shown as indicating the way in which the anchor trade mark was accustomed to be, and was proposed to be, used upon bottles, just as the colour of the wax on the corks is mentioned: \"and the corks green waxed and sealed with the seal\nJOHN DE KUYPER & SON,\nJ. D. K. & Z.\"\nAt all events, the applicant has left the matter in some doubt as to what he intended. This being so let us see how it was treated by others and by himself. The minister gave a certificate of registration, treating the application as one for the registration of a single trade mark, describing it as an anchor with the name or initials, and the plaintiffs acquiesced in this for years. This has a clear bearing on the question of intention.\nBut further, the Act requires as a condition of registration that the applicant shall deposit with the minister a drawing and description, in duplicate, of such trade mark. Two things are required, a drawing and a description. The section speaks twice of both a drawing and a description. Here there is a drawing but no description, for the word description, as distinguished from drawing, means a verbal description. It is true that in many cases a drawing would be self-explanatory and of itself quite as plain as a verbal description, but in other cases this might not be so, and the statute in all cases requires both drawing and description.\nIt is true, as I mentioned to counsel on argument that such objection would appear to be against the anchor as a trade mark as well as the label. But really this is no answer. It was sufficient for Mr. Ferguson to say that he was not attacking the anchor as a trade mark. The objection is one of substance, for it is an objection that the Act has not been complied with. And further, if the proposed trade mark or trade marks had been described there would have been no doubt as to what was intended, and if the label as a proposed trade mark had been described we should have seen that, notwithstanding the apparent intention to claim one trade mark what was sought to be registered was not a single trade mark but two trade marks.\nBut this was not done. The omission to give a description was apparent at once in the certificate of the minister. He took it that what was intended to be registered was the anchor and name or initials, and again, I beg leave to repeat, the plaintiffs have for years acquiesced in this departmental view of it. I conclude, therefore, that the label as a trade mark was never duly registered, and that plaintiffs' appeal should be dismissed.\nNext, as to the cross-appeal by defendants. The case of Powell v. Birmingham Vinegar Co.[8], cited by Mr.] Abbott, shows that the plaintiffs are within the proper meaning of the term aggrieved parties. As to the other points involved in the cross-appeal, I am upon the whole inclined to think that the order should not be disturbed.\nBy reason of its merely colourable variation from a known, though not registered, label of plaintiffs I think that the defendants were not really proprietors of it.\nIn the result both appeals should, in my opinion, be dismissed.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014This case comes up upon appeals by the plaintiffs and defendants respectively.\nThe parties are both gin manufacturers in Holland and large exporters to Canada. The matter in dispute between them is the question of the right to a trade mark. Since the year 1865, the plaintiffs have used upon the ordinary square black bottle, in which Holland gin is sold in this country, a white, heart shaped label which is undoubtedly a striking label used in the way in which it is. On the 21st April, 1875, they registered this label under the Act of 1868. The defendants at one time used an entirely different shaped label, but on the 2nd April, 1884, they registered under the Act of 1879 a white, heart shaped label which the plaintiffs say is an infringement upon their trade marks.\nThe two labels are as follows[9]:\u2014 The plaintiffs set forth in their statement of claim the deposit by them in duplicate with the minister of agriculture, in the usual way, of the drawings and description in duplicate of their trade mark, and allege that they were the sole proprietors of the mark for years previously, and acquired by the registration a further exclusive statutory right to the same, and that the label was well known and of great advantage to them in their business, that in 1884 the defendants registered their mark, which plaintiffs say is in its essential features the same, and so resembles the plaintiffs' mark as to be likely or calculated to deceive and mislead the public, both by reason of its shape and colour, and the work upon it and its general appearance, and they allege that the registration of it was made, in the words of the statute, without sufficient cause. They ask to be declared the owners, that the defendants' label be declared an infringement, that an injunction issue against them, that the judgment order the cancellation of the defendants' trade mark, and that they have such other relief as may seem just.\nThe defendants answer that the plaintiffs have not got an exclusive right to the heart shaped label by virtue of the registration of their said trade mark, or by prior ownership of such heart shaped label, alleging that heart shaped labels were in common and general use in the spirit trade long prior to the alleged registration by the plaintiffs of their trade mark. They go on to say that only in respect of the shape of the label and the words \"Hollands\" and \"Geneva\" do the marks resemble each other, and that those words are descriptive; that the essential features of the trade mark of the plaintiffs is really the design of the anchor and the name of De Kuyper, whilst the distinctive features of their trade mark are the design of the eagle and the name \"Weiland,\" and that neither the heart shape of the label, the colour of the label or the scroll are essential features; and they deny that their mark is calculated to deceive. They allege that they are entitled to the full enjoyment of their mark, which they have enjoyed, they say, for more than twenty-five years, and they allege knowledge on the part of the plaintiffs, and laches and delay in seeking relief.\nBy their reply the plaintiffs say that they are entitled to the exclusive use of the heart shape, as set forth in their claim, and deny that labels of that shape were in common and general use in the spirit trade prior to the registration. They further say that the whole label, as described by them, is essential, and that their gin was and is particularly known by the shape of its label, but that the essential and distinguishing feature by which the defendants' gin is known was the design of the eagle and the name, but say that by the adoption of the white heart shape with the scroll, in the plaintiffs' statement of claim referred to, the same has become liable to be sold in the place of the plaintiffs' Holland gin, and the public thereby deceived and misled.\nI may here incidentally remark that no attempt has been made by the defendants to prove their allegation that heart-shaped labels were in common and general use in the spirit trade prior to the registration by the plaintiffs of their trade mark, or that they themselves have used the heart-shaped label for upwards of twenty-five years.\nThese two allegations must, therefore, be dropped out of consideration.\nBy the evidence, it appears that the way this gin trade is carried on and how the plaintiffs suffer from the defendants' dealing, is as follows:\u2014\nThe gin is shipped out from Holland in wooden cases containing a dozen or more bottles. On the outside of these cases there is nothing to show what sort of label is on the bottles. The cases are generally branded with initials and some kind of mark, the plaintiffs branding one of their registered brands on their boxes, and the defendants an eagle on theirs. In the wholesale trade, therefore, attention is not called to the labels. The different qualities of the gin are distinguished by the colours of the boxes, and the goods are known by their names. It is not contended by the plaintiffs that the wholesale trade are liable to be deceived. What they say is, that the goods, when taken out of the cases and exposed for sale are liable to be mistaken one for the other. A given number of bottles of their gin are more expensive than a similar number of bottles of the defendants' gin, and contain more gin, leaving aside the question of quality. The gin is sold by the retailers in two ways, first, by the whole bottle, and secondly by the glass. When sold by the glass it is usual to hand down the bottle to the customer. Sometimes gin from casks is put into bottles with the labels affixed and handed down in that shape. The retailers have two distinct interests in passing off the defendants' gin instead of the plaintiffs'; in the first place, if they sell it by the bottle, they have paid less for the bottle than they would for similar bottles of the plaintiffs' gin. The bottles look as if they contain the same quantity but as a fact, the defendants' bottles contain less, and therefore, the retailer makes more money by the transaction than he otherwise would do; secondly, if the goods are sold by the glass, over the counter, the cheaper quality of the defendants' gin gives him a greater profit, if he can get the same price for it per glass, and as long as he sells the defendants' gin in the defendants' bottles, under their label, he avoids committing an offence which he would commit, were he to sell the defendants' gin in the plaintiffs' bottles.\nThe judgment of the Exchequer Court finds that there might be, and probably was, a number of the purchasers of gin who would be likely to be misled and deceived, by the general resemblance of the two labels; that the plaintiffs' was well-known and had acquired a reputation throughout the province, and was known in some sections and amongst some classes by the heart-shaped label; and that the fair inference from the facts and circumstances disclosed by the case, is, that the defendants, while not perhaps attempting to sell their Geneva as that of the plaintiffs', thought to gain a trade advantage by adopting and using a label which in shape and colour resembles that used by the plaintiffs, though otherwise distinguishable from it. The court, however, concluded that it had no jurisdiction to restrain the defendants unless the use of the labels or devices constituted an infringement of a registered trade mark, and upon a consideration of the registered documents, determined that the shape had not been claimed by the plaintiffs as a part of their marks. The injunction was therefore refused, but a rectification in the entry of the defendants' trade mark was ordered by striking out therefrom the words en forme de c\u0153ur. Is the heart shape of the label a registered part of the plaintiffs' trade mark? is the question raised by them on their appeal. I am of opinion that it is; that the heart shape is an essential feature of it and that there is error in that part of the judgment of the Exchequer Court, which holds that nothing was registered by the plaintiffs but the anchor and the names or initials of their firm. The most striking feature in the whole device of the plaintiffs' trade mark, it seems to me is the shape and arrangement[10]. The heart shaped scroll of itself is unusual whether upon a label cut of a that shape or not. Then the scroll work is parallel to the cut border of the label, and therefore accentuates its effect. And the scroll work itself is constructed in a peculiar and identical way in the two labels, that is to say it consists of a similar alternation of one oval and two round links.\nThe next point of similarity is the way in which in one case the words \"Genuine Hollands\" and in the other the words \"Finest Hollands\" are placed in a curve in the upper portion of the label in identical type and with a scroll beneath. Then the printing of the word \"Geneva\" is in a similar type, and the type itself is of an unusual character, that is to say, whilst the letters are in black there is a line of shading drawn around the margin of each letter, at a certain distance from it, which undoubtedly has the effect of catching the eye, Then the name of the makers is affixed on a curved scroll or ribbon similarly arranged and in the same position in each label. In fact, all the constituent parts of the labels occupy the same relative positions in each, with the result that the ensemble or general appearance of the two labels constitutes a striking resemblance, with part differences in the details which would not be noticed by an ordinary purchaser. To sum up, the defendants' label is of the same shape, the same colour, the same size, and the same general design as the plaintiffs', and contains similar words and devices, which, though differing in detail, are combined in such a manner as to give the same appearance.\nAn examination of the two labels will show the marked similarity, not only in general effect but in detailed work, between them.\nNow, when the plaintiffs deposited that heart-shaped label to register a trade mark, they clearly, it seems to me, claimed the shape as a part of their trade mark. The Act 31 Vic. ch. 55, under which the plaintiffs proceeded, provides that the proprietor of a trade mark might have the same registered by depositing with the minister a drawing and description, in duplicate, of such trade mark, together with a declaration that the same was not in use to his knowledge by any other person than himself at the time of his adoption thereof. The minister was to cause the trade mark to be examined, to ascertain whether it resembled any other trade mark already registered, and if he found that the same was not identical with and did not so closely resemble as to be confounded with any other mark already registered, he should register the same. By section two, he had power to make regulations and adopt forms for the purposes of the Act, and all documents executed according to the same and accepted by the minister were to be held valid so far as relates to the official proceedings under the Act. By section three, for the purposes of the Act, marks, names,, brands, labels, packages or other business devices which might be adopted for use by any person in his trade * * * for the purpose of distinguishing any manufacture * * * should be considered and known as trade marks, and might be registered for the exclusive use of the party registering the same, and thereafter he was to have the exclusive right to use the same. It is to be noted that the depositing of the drawing and description is the only act required of the party effecting registration, except the declaration that the same was not used by any one else. It is a condition precedent apparently that the party registering is to be the proprietor of the mark. The minister's duties are to examine the trade mark, and if he finds that it is not identical with, and does not closely resemble, any other he is bound to register it. No provision is made for his altering or modifying it in any way. In the present instance the defendants sought to make an argument out of the words of the deputy minister's certificate. It is true that the deputy minister certified to the registration of this mark in terms that at first sight appear to be ambiguous. It reads as follows:\u2014\"This is to certify that this mark which consists of the representation of an anchor with the letters J. D. K. & Z. or the words John De Kuyper & Son, Rotterdam, &c., &c., as per annexed drawings and application, has been registered, &c., &c.\" The actual drawings and written description however to-day stand registered in the books of the department, as appears by the evidence of the custodian of the original. This evidence is sufficient to clear away the ambiguity of the deputy minister's certificate, if any there be, for if the minister register, as he was bound to do under the statute, and as this certificate shows he did in this case, neither he nor his deputy, by limiting the form of the certificate, could take away the rights of the parties. Nothing could give to any person examining the books a better idea as to what the plaintiffs' label really was than the label itself, and this was actually attached to and formed part of the description and is the best drawing possible. An examination of the drawings and description and of the certificate, however, show that there is no ambiguity.\nThe certificate, in fact, says that all the trade mark as it appears by the drawings is registered and that, in my opinion, includes the shape of it. By the very fact of presenting the unusual shape of a heart the plaintiffs gave notice that they claimed that shape as a part of their trade mark. In the case of the Leather Companies[11], great stress was laid in the House of Lords on the fact that the shape of the trade mark there impeached was different from the shape of the plaintiffs' trade mark. The case of Wotherspoon v. Currie[12] is no authority for the proposition that the shape of a mark may not be registered as a part thereof.\nIn my opinion the plaintiffs have made a clear case. The defendants have used and registered a mark so I nearly resembling the mark of the plaintiffs as registered as to deceive unwary purchasers. Barsalou v. Darling[13]. They should be restrained from doing so, and the rectification in the registration of their trade mark ordered by the judgment appealed from should also of course be maintained.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014I entirely concur in this judgment.\nAppeals dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for DeKuyper & Son: Abbotts, Campbell, & Meredith.\nSolicitors for Van Dulken, Weiland & Co.: Duhamel & Merrill.\n[1] 4 Ex.

To satisfy the judgment the bank issued a writ of execution in the district of Iberville against the lands and tenements of Charles Arpin.\nEdouard Arpin, a third party, who up to that time had not been a party to the suit, filed an opposition to the seizure. His attorney of record was the Honourable A. N. Charland, then an advocate, and who was since appointed a judge of the Superior Court. The opposition of Edouard Arpin was contested by the plaintiffs the Union Bank of Canada, and when it came up for proof and hearing the Honourable Judge Charland, who was holding the court, made a written declaration of the ground of recusation which existed against him, and in consequence it was ordered that the record in that suit be sent to the Superior Court of the district of Montreal.\nAt Montreal Edouard Arpin's opposition was heard and dismissed.\nIt then became necessary for the plaintiffs to issue a writ of venditioni exponas. This was done but the writ was not issued by the Superior Court of Iberville, where the judgment had been rendered and remained of record, but by the Superior Court at Montreal\nThe sale took place and the property was adjudged to the respondents in the present case.\nAppellant having refused to deliver up the property respondent made a petition to obtain possession thereof, which petition was contested by appellant.\nLajoie for appellant proceeded to argue that the question which arose on this appeal was as to the proper construction to be put on art. 188 C. C. P. and that the sheriff's sale under a writ of venditioni exponas issued by the Superior Court for the district of Montreal was an absolute nullity when the court stated they would not call upon Mr. Campbell counsel for the respondent, but would proceed to deliver judgment.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014This is a mere point of practice. An opposition having been filed to a sale of lands under execution upon a judgment in the Superior Court, recovered in the district of Iberville the judge of that district, Mr. Justice Charland, was recused, and the action and contestation of the opposition was thereupon removed to Montreal where the opposition was dismissed. Then a writ of venditioni exponas was issued by the Superior Court in the district of Montreal. This was held to be regular by the Superior Court. (Gill J. ) and the Court of Appeal (Boss\u00e9 J. dissenting,) affirmed the Superior Court.\nWe have always said that on points of practice like this we will follow the course of the Privy Council, as laid down in the Mayor of Montreal v. Brown and Springle ([1]), and we have already acted on that principle in the cases of Gladwin v. Cummings ([2]), Dawson v. Union Banc ([3]) and Scammell v. fames ([4]).\nI am of opinion that this case, in which there is a consensus of decision in the two courts below, is eminently one for the application of the same rule. Therefore the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nHad I to enter upon the merits of the question raised I should unhesitatingly agree with the learned chief justice of the Queen's Bench in the interpretation which he has placed on the 188th article of the code of procedure. By the provision contained in that article the court to which the proceedings have been remitted is to remain seised of the cause. This in my opinion, means that the whole record shall be considered as remaining in that court, and not that it shall be seised merely of the record limited to the incidental proceeding for the purpose of deciding which the removal had been made. But I do not enter on the merits. Without saying we have no jurisdiction we decline to interfere with the successive adjudications in the two courts below.\nFOURNIER, TASCHEREAU, SEDGEWICK and KING.

In re Local Option Act (18 Ont. App. R. 572) approved. Gwynne and Sedgewick JJ. dissenting.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] reversing the judgment of Galt C.J., who quashed a by-law of the township of South Norwich as being ultra vires. The appeal was first argued as to the validity of the by-law under the Municipal Act[2], and the court held, affirming the decision of the Court of Appeal, that the objections were insufficient to quash the by-law in question[3].\nThe question as to the constitutionality of sec. 18 of 53 Vic. ch. 56 (O.), as explained by sec. 1 of 54 Vic. ch. 46, also having been raised on this appeal, was by order of the court subsequently argued.\nDuvernet and Galt, for appellant. Maclaren Q.C. and Titus, for respondent.\nThe court reserved judgment until after the argument of the special case submitted by the Governor General in Council in the matter of prohibition of the trade in intoxicating liquors, in which the same question as was involved in this case came under consideration[4].\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014All questions involved in this appeal, save that relating to the constitutional validity of the 18th section of the Ontario statute, 53 Vic. ch. 56, entitled: \u201cAn Act to improve the Liquor License Laws,\u201d as explained and limited by the Ontario statute, 54 Vic. ch. 46, sec. 1, have been already disposed of[5]. This remaining point we have now to determine.\nI am of opinion that these enactments were intra vires of the provincial legislature. The learned judges of the Court of Appeal, in the case of The Local Option Act[6], have dealt fully with this identical question, and I so entirely agree with both their reasons and conclusions that I might well have contented myself with a reference to that case without adding to the mass of judicial decisions already accumulated on the subject. There appear to me, however, to be some additional reasons, which I will state as succinctly as possible.\nWe are precluded, by the decision of the Privy Council in the case of Russell v. The Queen[7], and by that of this court in The City of Fredericton v. The Queen[8], from holding that under subsection 8 of section 92 of the British North America Act the exclusive power of prohibiting the sale of liquor by retail, including the enactment of what are called local option laws, was given to the provinces as an incident of the police power conferred by the words \u201cmunicipal institutions.\u201d That those words do confer a police power to the extent of licensing and regulating was decided by the Privy Council in the case of Hodge v. The Queen[9]. The question then is narrowed to this: Have the provinces, under this subsection 8, a power concurrent with that of the Dominion to enact prohibitory legislation to be carried into effect through the instrumentality of the municipalities or otherwise, either generally or to the extent of the power of prohibiting which had been conferred on municipal bodies by legislation enacted prior to confederation and in force at that date?\nIt is established by Russell v. The Queen[10] that the Dominion, being invested with authority by section 91 to make laws for the peace, order and good government of Canada, may pass what are denominated local option laws. But, as I understand that decision, such Dominion laws must be general laws, not limited to any particular province. It is not competent to parliament to draw to itself the right to legislate on any subject which, by section 92, is assigned to the provinces by legislating on that subject generally for the whole Dominion, but this is of course not done where, in the execution of a power expressly given to it by section 91, the federal legislature makes laws similar to those which a provincial legislature may make in executing other powers expressly given to the provinces by section 92. Therefore it appears to me that there are in the Dominion and the provinces respectively several and distinct powers authorizing each, within its own sphere, to enact the same legislation on this subject of prohibitory liquor laws restraining sale by retail, that is to say, the Dominion may, as has already been conclusively decided, enact a prohibitory law for the whole Dominion, whilst the provincial legislatures may also enact similar laws, restricted of course to their own jurisdictions. Such provincial legislation cannot, however, be extended so as to prohibit importation or manufacture, for the reason that these subjects belong exclusively to the Dominion under the head of trade and commerce, and also for the additional reason that the revenue of the Dominion derived from customs and excise duties would be thereby affected. That there may be, in respect of other subjects, such concurrent powers of legislation has already been decided by the Privy Council in the case of Attorney General of Ontario v. Attorney General of Canada[11], where this question arose with reference to insolvency legislation. I venture to think the present even a stronger case for the application of such a construction than that referred to. To neither of the legislatures is the subject of prohibitory liquor laws in terms assigned. Then what reason is there why a local legislature in execution of the police power conferred by subsection 8 of sec. 92 may not, so long as it does not come in conflict with the legislation of the Dominion, adopt any appropriate means of executing that power, merely because the same means may be adopted by the Dominion Parliament under the authority of section 91 in executing a power specifically given to it? It has been decided by the highest authority that there are no reasons against such a construction. This is indeed even a stronger case for recognizing such a concurrent power than the case of the Attorney General of Ontario v. Attorney General of Canada11, because bankruptcy and insolvency laws are by section 91 expressly attributed to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Dominion. In the event of legislation providing for prohibition enacted by the Dominion and by a province coming into conflict the legislation of the province would no doubt have to give way. This was pointed out by the Privy Council in the Attorney General of Ontario v. The Attorney General of Canada[12], and although the British North America Act contains no provision declaring that the legislation of the Dominion shall be supreme, as is the case in the constitution of the United States, the same principle is necessarily implied in our constitutional act, and is to be applied whenever, in the many cases which may arise, the federal and provincial legislatures adopt the same means to carry into effect distinct powers.\nThat a general police power sufficient to include the right of legislating to the extent of the prohibition of retail traffic or local option laws, not exclusive of but concurrent with a similar power in the Dominion, is vested in the provinces by the words \u201cMunicipal Institutions in the Province\u201d in subsection 8 of chapter 92 is, I think, a proposition which derives support from the case of Hodge v. The Queen[13]. It is true that the subject of prohibition was not in question in that case, but there would seem to be no reason why prohibitory laws as well as those regulating and limiting the traffic in liquors should not be included in the police power which under the words \u201cMunicipal Institutions\u201d it was held in Hodge v. The Queen13, to the extent of licensing, the provinces possessed. The difference between regulating and licensing and prohibiting is one of degree only.\nAs regards the objection that to recognize any such right of legislation in a province not extending to the prohibition of importation and manufacture would be an infringement of the power of the Dominion to regulate trade and commerce, I am not impressed by it. The retail liquor traffic can scarcely be regarded as coming directly under the head of trade and commerce as used in the British North America Act, but as the subjects enumerated in section 92 are exceptions out of those mentioned in section 91 it follows that if a police power is included in subsection 8 of the former section, the power itself and all appropriate means of carrying it out are to be treated as uncontrolled by anything in section 91. Moreover, Hodge v. The Queen[14] also applies here for, although in a lesser degree, yet to some extent, the restriction of the liquor trade by a licensing system would affect trade and commerce. On the whole I am of opinion that the provincial legislatures have power to enact prohibitory legislation to the extent I have mentioned, though this power is in no way exclusive of that of the Dominion but concurrent with it.\nIf I am wrong in this conclusion it is sufficient for the decision of this appeal to hold, as I do, that the legislature of Ontario had power to repeal and re-enact the legislation in force at the date of the Confederation Act, which gave municipal councils the right to pass by-laws absolutely prohibiting the sale of liquor by retail within certain local limits. Having regard to the history and objects of confederation I can scarcely think it possible that it could have been intended by the framers of the British North America Act to detract in any way from the jurisdiction of the provinces over their own several systems of municipal government. If the words \u201cMunicipal Institutions\u201d in subsection 8 are to have any meaning attributed to them they must surely be taken as giving authority to repeal, re-enact and remodel the laws relating to all municipal legislation then in force. In Re Slavin and Orillia[15] this was the view of the Ontario Court of Queen\u2019s Bench, and Chief Justice Richards, in his judgment on that case, puts forward powerful arguments in support of that conclusion. These reasons, as well as those given for the judgment of the Court of Appeal in the Local Option Case, have convinced me that at least to the extent last mentioned (even if I am wrong in my first proposition) the provinces have the power to legislate. As the enactments now in question are reproductions of those in force at the date of confederation they were therefore intra vires of the Ontario legislature. In the case of Severn v. The Queen[16] I expressed some doubt as to the decision in Re Slavin and Orillia15, upon the ground that the effect of that case would be to make the law vary in the different provinces. These observations were not material to the judgment I then gave, which was founded entirely on the 9th subsection of section 92, and I have now come to the conclusion that they were not well founded.\nThe appeal must be dismissed with costs.\nFOURNIER J.\u2014I concur.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014In view of the declaratory Act of 1891, 54 V. c. 46, Ont., the appellant\u2019s contentious that the by-law in question prohibits entirely the sale of intoxicating liquors in South Norwich, and that sec. 18 of 53 V. c. 56 empowers the municipal councils to enact a total prohibition of the liquor traffic within their territorial limits, have to be considered as abandoned. The only question therefore now to be determined here is as to the power of municipalities, in Ontario, to prohibit the retail traffic of liquors within their respective limits, as it was vested in them before confederation.\nIn my opinion the answer to the question thus limited is correctly given by the Court of Appeal in this case and in Re Local Option Act[17]. The powers which the provincial legislatures and the municipal authorities have exercised in the matter since the coming into force of the British North America Act, now over 26 years, with the acquiescence of the federal authority, a power expressly sanctioned in numerous instances in Ontario and Quebec by judicial authority, might be curtailed or affected more or less by a federal prohibitive law if parliament has the power to pass one, but that is not the question here, and it will be time enough to consider it when parliament shall have legislated in that sense, if it ever does.\nSuffice it for me to say, for the purposes of this case, that, in my opinion, under subsec. 8 of sec. 92 of the British North America Act, the legislation in question and the by-law assailed by the appellant are intra vires. As said in The Queen v. Taylor[18] by Wilson J., whose language I cannot do better than to borrow:\nThe act of the Ontario legislature in imposing a tax for a license on shop-keepers, and tavern-keepers and others of the like class for selling by retail, or for continuing the power to municipalities to prohibit the retail of spirituous liquors, is not in excess of the provincial power, although I conceive it to be partly a regulation of trade and commerce, because before and at the time of the confederation of the provinces the different municipalities in this province possessed that power and privilege, and it was not taken away or qualified in any way by the Confederation Act. That act, too, was in fact passed, and must be presumed to have been passed by the Imperial Government with a full knowledge at the time of the state of our law which was affected by the Imperial Act then under consideration, and among other matters, that part of our law which related and relates to municipal institutions, as they existed at that time, because over \u201cmunicipal institu- tions in the province\u201d exclusive power was then conferred by it upon the Provincial Legislature.* * And I am of opinion that the right to regulate the sale of such liquors by retail, and also the entire prohibition of their sale in any municipality, relates to a matter of a merely local or private nature in the province.* * It partakes largely of a police regulation.\nThese remarks of Mr. Justice Wilson are in no way affected by the decision of this court in Severn v. The Queen[19], where that case of The Queen v. Taylor[20] was under review.\nA valuable opinion by Richards C.J., in the sense of Mr. Justice Wilson\u2019s aforesaid remarks, is to be found in Re Slavin and Orillia[21]. And later, in this court, in Sulte v. The Corporation of Three Rivers[22], Mr. Justice Gwynne said:\nI cannot doubt that by item no. 8 of sec. 92, which vests in the provincial legislatures the exclusive power of making laws in relation to municipal institutions, the authors of the scheme of confederation had in view municipal institutions as they had already been organized in some of the provinces, and that the term, as used in the British North America Act, unless there be some provision to the contrary in sec. 91 of the act, comprehends the powers with which municipal institutions as constituted by acts then in force in the respective provinces, were already invested for regulating the traffic in intoxicating liquors in shops, saloons, hotels and taverns, and the issue of licenses therefor, as being powers deemed necessary and proper for the beneficial working of a perfect system of self-government. Unless, then, there be some provisions in the British North America Act to the contrary, the legislature of the Province of Quebec had full power in any act passed by it creating a municipality, or in any act amending or consolidating the acts already in force incorporating the city of Three Rivers, to insert the provisions in question here, which are contained in the 74th, 75th and 101st sections of 38 Vic. ch. 76.\nNow, the 75th section of the Act so referred to by the learned judge as being intra vires of the provincial legislation, enacts that: The said council shall have power to make by-laws for restraining and prohibiting the sale of any spirituous wines, alcoholic or intoxicating liquor.\nMr. Justice Henry, in the same case, said:\nIt has been argued that because a prohibitory act of the legislature of any of the provinces, would be an interference with trade and commerce * * such an act would be ultra vires * * I cannot adopt that proposition\u2026\nThe City of Fredericton v. The Queen[23] does not determine, as seems to be assumed by the appellant, that the Dominion Parliament has alone the power to prohibit the sale of liquor. The only point determined in that case is that the Temperance Act of 1878 is constitutional. Anything that was said outside of that question in that case, as well as in many others relied upon by the appellant, was obiter dictum and of no binding authority. And the reporter\u2019s summaries in some of those cases are misleading.\nThe case here is unfettered by any authority. In answer to the contention that by its decision in Russell v. The Queen[24], where Fredericton v. The Queen23 was under review, the Privy Council had determined that the whole subject of the liquor traffic was given to Parliament, Sir Barnes Peacock in Hodge v. The Queen[25], said:\nIt appears to their Lordships however, that the decision of this tribunal in that case has not the effect supposed, and that, when properly considered, it should be taken rather as an authority in support of the judgment of the Court of Appeal.\nAnd is it not evident that when holding, as they did, the Liquor License Act of 1883 to have been ultra vires of the Dominion Parliament, their Lordships cannot have been of opinion that the whole control over the liquor traffic was vested in the Dominion Parliament? The inference from their decision on that license Act, I take it, is all the other way. And, in this court Mr. Justice Gwynne, in Sulte v. The Corporation of Three Rivers[26], said:\nIt seems to be supposed that the judgment of this court in the City of Fredericton v. The Queen[27], is an authority to the effect that since the passing of the British North America Act it is not competent for a provincial legislature to restrain or prohibit, in any manner, the sale of any spirituous liquors.*** But the City of Fredericton v. The Queen27 raised no such question, nor is any such point professed to be decided by our judgment in that case.* * What was decided was that the provincial legislatures had not jurisdiction to pass such an Act as the \u201cCanada Temperance Act of 1878,\u201d and that the Dominion Parliament alone was competent to pass it; and of this opinion also, was the Judicial Committee in Russell v. The Queen[28].\nAnd Mr. Justice Ramsay in Montreal must have shared in this opinion when he said in that same case in the Court of Appeal[29], in reference to the Privy Council\u2019s decision in the case of Russell v. The Queen28: \u201cIt has not, either expressly or by implication, maintained that the Dominion Parliament can alone pass a prohibitory law.\u201d\nThe appellant\u2019s contentions have, it seems to me, been rendered the more untenable by the decision of the Privy Council of February last in the Ontario Insolvency case[30].\nIt results from that case, if I do not misunderstand it, that there are, under the British North America Act, subjects which may be dealt with by both legislative powers, and that the provincial field is not to be deemed limited by the possible range of unexercised power by the Dominion Parliament, so that a power conferred upon the latter, but not acted upon, may, in certain cases, be exercised by the provincial legislatures, if it fall within any of the classes of subjects enumerated in section 92. In my opinion these propositions, which are now the law of the country, have here their full application.\nAnd where would the provinces be on this question of the liquor traffic if it were not so? At the mercy of the federal power, that is to say, at the mercy of each other. Ontario, for instance, might desire to prohibit the liquor traffic through the municipal authorities, as they had the power to do before confederation, but Ontario would be unable to do so if the other provinces, either by directly refusing it in parliament or simply by not dealing at all with the question, refused to permit it.\nThat is surely not Canada\u2019s constitution.\nThe inaction of the Dominion law giver cannot have such consequences.\nIt cannot be that, simply because the Dominion authority will not prohibit all over the Dominion, the trade must be permitted everywhere in the provinces. It does not follow that because the provinces have the right to license they must license. Questions of power, as said by Marshall C.J., in Brown v. State of Maryland[31], cannot depend on the degree to which it may be exercised; if it may be exercised at all it must be exercised at the will of those in whose hands it is placed.\nIn cases of implied limitations or prohibitions of power it is not sufficient to show a possible or potential inconvenience; there must be a plain incompatibility, a direct repugnancy, or an extreme practical inconvenience, leading irresistibly to the same conclusion[32].\nAnd I cannot see any such incompatibility or repugnancy in allowing one authority to prohibit when the other does not, though it might have the power to do so. It has earnestly been urged on the part of the appellant that, as a consequence of the Dominion Temperance Act of 1878, the provinces are now deprived of any power that they might previously have had of prohibiting or empowering the municipalities to prohibit the liquor trade.\nBut I fail to see such a consequence attached to that Act. There is it seems to me no incompatibility between the two, between that Act and the power of the municipalities to prohibit.\nHow can that Act of 1878 be deemed to be more incompatible with this power of the municipalities, than was the Temperance Act of 1864, with the same powers of the same municipalities? In the main, this Act of 1878 is but a reproduction of the Act of 1864; or, at least, both are based on the same principle. Now, in 1864, when the Temperance Act was enacted by the same legislature that had unlimited control as well over the municipalities as over the liquor traffic, the provisions of that Temperance Act were not deemed to be incompatible with the powers already possessed by the municipalities on the subject, which remained intact. And that they were not incompatible, I apprehend, will not be gainsaid. A statute, like the Dominion License Act of 1883 to license the trade or authorize the municipalities to license it, might be, and in fact would be, in the absence of the necessary provisions to avoid it, repugnant to or inconsistent with a prohibitory Act. But I fail to see that two prohibitory Acts, assuming the Temperance Act of 1878 to be a prohibitory Act, must necessarily be repugnant to one another, even where enacted by different authority, or even where the power to prohibit is conferred on two different bodies, specially where the jurisdiction of the two is not territorially the same, as is the case with this double legislation on this matter. For, by the federal Act of 1878, it is only to county and city municipalities and federal electors that is granted the power to prohibit, whilst by the Ontario Act, it is in local municipalities and provincial electors that the power is vested. In Quebec it is the municipal electors, when a submission to the people is ordered.\nThe Privy Council in Hodge v. The Queen[33] considered that the Ontario License Act does not conflict with the federal Temperance Act of 1878. A fortiori would I say, two prohibitory Acts need not necessarily conflict with one another.\nI do not lose sight of the fact that, as a local municipality forms part of a county municipality, where the federal Act of 1878 is put into operation in a county it necessarily follows that it is in operation in every one of the local municipalities included in it. The only consequence of this, however, is that the working of the provincial Act, or of a by-law under it, or the machinery by which it is put in operation, may be superseded or suspended in the municipalities where the Act of 1878 is in force, but I do not see in that any inconsistency with the power of the province to pass it, as long as the Act of 1878 is not acted upon, and revive it when the other one ceases to operate where it has been put in operation.\nThe federal Act cannot at all be considered as legislation over the powers of the municipalities. It does not purport to be anything of the kind. It has no connection whatever and could have none with the municipal system of the different provinces. It is controlled altogether by a majority of federal electors, but that, it is obvious, may not be at all the majority of municipal electors in a municipality, when that is required as in the province of Quebec and, in fact, cannot be under the statutes at present in force in some of the provinces whereby women, for instance, are entitled to vote at municipal but not at federal elections. Likewise, for the provincial electors, where as in Ontario these by-laws under the provincial Act depend on their votes. The majority of them may not be at all a majority of federal electors, or vice versa.\nAnd the respondents, I assume, would not have any objection to submit to the Temperance Act of 1878, if it was put into force in the county of which they form part. All that they claim is home rule, the right to put a stop to drinking and to taverns within their own territorial limits, even if the rest of the province, or all the other municipalities of their own county, choose to do otherwise for their own people. They should be as free to do so now as they were before Confederation, though the provinces of British Columbia, Prince Edward Island, Quebec, or all of them and all the other municipalities of Ontario, may favour, within their territorial limits, a different policy. Whenever the federal Parliament prohibits entirely the liquor traffic in the Dominion, assuming always for the purposes of this case that they have the power to do so, the respondents will not complain; the very object they are now contending for will be attained. What they ask is to be at liberty to do so for themselves till Parliament does so for the whole Dominion.\nAnd again: By an express provision of the Temperance Act of 1878, if the Act is rejected by the federal electors it cannot be submitted to them again for a period of three years. Now, if within these three years, a local municipality, and a majority within it of the provincial or municipal electors where that is required, desire to prohibit the liquor traffic within its limits, is there anything, in allowing them to do so, inconsistent with the Temperance Act of 1878, or repugnant to it? It is all the other way, it seems to me. It perfects it: it aims at the same result; it provides for the promotion of temperance, where the Act of 1878 fails; it promotes temperance wherever the Act of 1878 cannot penetrate, it replaces it in any county, where a majority of the federal electors will not allow it to come in, or where no attempt is made to put it in operation. And is there, in that case, any inconsistency, or danger of a clashing of powers, in conceding to a local municipality the power to prohibit within its own limits though the rest of the county is in favour of licensing?\nAnd can it not be said of the enactment now under consideration, what their Lordships said of the statute in Hodge v. The Queen[34], that it is \u201cconfined to municipalities in the Province of Ontario and is entirely local in its character and operation.\u201d\nThe federal Parliament has, for instance, the right, I presume, of prohibiting the sale of dynamite or opium or any other poison all through the Dominion. The appellant would contend that, if Parliament has not enacted such a law, the provincial legislature cannot authorize the municipalities to prohibit the sale of such articles within their limits. Such a contention cannot prevail. There are a large number of subjects which are generally accepted as falling under the denomination of police regulations over which the provincial legislatures have control within their territorial limits, which yet may be legislated upon by the federal Parliament for the Dominion at large. Take, for instance, the closing of stores and cessation of trade on Sundays. Parliament, I take it for granted, has the power to legislate on the subject for the Dominion, but, until it does so, the provinces have, each for itself, the same power.\nThis shows, it seems to me, that the world \u201cexclusively\u201d in section 92 of the British North America Act is not susceptible of the wide construction that the appellant would put upon it. Then here, all that the respondent contends for is the municipal power to prohibit the liquor trade, or the power to prohibit as a part of the municipal institutions of the province, and that the power of the provincial legislatures over those institutions and the municipal system in general is exclusive. The federal parliament cannot in any way touch them.\nOn the appellant\u2019s contention that such a prohibition by the municipalities is a regulation of trade and commerce, and therefore ultra vires of the provincial legislature, I need not dwell.\nIt is settled that these words \u201cregulation of trade and commerce\u201d in the British North America Act do not bear the wide construction that the appellant would here contend for. Citizens Ins. Co. v. Parsons[35]; Hodge v. The Queen[36]; Bank of Toronto v. Lambe[37]; Bennett v. The Pharmaceutical Assoc. of Quebec[38]; Pillow v. The City of Montreal[39].\nIt was likewise held by the United States Supreme Court, in Cooley v. The Board of Wardens[40], that a state law, establishing certain pilotage regulations conceded to be regulations of commerce, was valid until superseded by the federal legislative power. And, as said by Mr. Justice Field, in Sherlock v. Ailing[41]:\u2014\nLegislation, in a great variety of ways, may affect commerce and persons engaged in it, without constituting a regulation of it within the meaning of the constitution.\nCases to that same import are Ex parte McNeil[42]; Willson v. The Blackbird Creek Marsh Co.[43], and Gilman v. The City of Philadelphia[44]. If the provinces were deprived of the right to all legislation whereby it might be said that trade and commerce are in some way regulated, or more or less affected, very shadowy indeed would be many of the powers conferred upon them in express terms by sec. 92 of the British North America Act:\nTo apply to this case what Mr. Justice Swayne, delivering the judgment of the United States Supreme Court in Railroad Co. v. Fuller[45], said of the United States constitution on the same subject, assuming that this statute in question constitutes, in a sense, a regulation of trade and commerce, it is a regulation of such a character as to be valid until superseded by the paramount action of the federal authority. And it may very well be, notwithstanding what was said in this court in City of Fredericton v. The Queen[46], that if Parliament has the power to prohibit the liquor trade for the whole Dominion, it is not at all under the words \u201cregulation of trade and commerce\u201d of section 91 of the British North America Act that it gets it. However, that is not the question here. I may, nevertheless, notice what Mr. Justice Harlan, of the United States Supreme Court, said before the Behring Sea Tribunal, on the question whether a power to regulate includes a power to prohibit:\u2014\nThe British counsel contended that it is beyond the power of the arbitrators to prescribe regulations of that character (to prohibit). They argued that the tribunal could not do indirectly what they could not do directly; that prohibition, in terms or by the necessary operation of regulations, is not regulation; that the power to regulate is not a power to prohibit\u2026 When enforcing the view last stated, counsel asked us whether a power given by the legislative department to a municipal corporation to regulate, within its limits, the sale of ardent spirits would give to such corporation authority to prohibit all sales of such spirits. Perhaps not. But the case put does not meet the one before the tribunal... It is mere play upon words to say, in respect to this treaty, that prohibition is not legislation[47].\nI now pass to the provincial statutory laws on the subject.\nThe learned judges of the Court of Appeal, in the Local Option Case[48], have said all that can be said upon the Ontario municipal law of any import on this question. Let us see now what light a Quebec candle, or a reference to the Quebec law of municipalities, might throw upon it.\nIn 1774, by the 14th Geo. III. c. 88, s. 5 (see 35 Geo. III. c. 88, of Lower Canada, and 13 & 14 Vic. c. 27, of the late province of Canada), a license fee was imposed by the Imperial Parliament upon the sale of liquors in the Province of Quebec as then constituted. That Act is still in force in Quebec, if not in Ontario. The revenues from these licenses were to fall into the provincial fund, but in 1845, by the 8 Vic. c. 72, the legislature of the late Province of Canada decreed that the revenues from houses of public entertainment and tavern licenses were thereafter to be appropriated for municipal purposes.\nIn 1847, by 10 & 11 Vic. c. 7, the municipalities were given de novo the power to increase the price for liquor licenses.\nIn 1851, by 14 & 15 Vic. c. 100, a larger control over the liquor traffic was assumed by the legislature, and a new system of tavern licenses was established. Its main feature consisted in this that traffic in liquor was prohibited everywhere, except when allowed by the discretionary powers of municipal councils and municipal electors. Smart v. The Corporation of Hochelaga[49]. By section 21 the revenue from liquor licenses was again given to the municipalities. In 1853, by 16 Vic. c. 214, an Act to the same effect, with certain modifications, was passed for the cities of Montreal and Quebec.\nIn these cities the power to grant or refuse licenses was by that Act vested in the police magistrates, but they had no power to license except upon the petition of a certain number of municipal electors. All the license Acts in the province have since, likewise, made the granting of licenses dependent upon the municipal councils or municipal electors.\nI need only refer for this to the Consolidated Statutes of Lower Canada c. 6 s. 9, and to arts. 829-835, and following, of the Revised Statutes of 1888, in both of which these License Acts are all condensed. A provision is to be found in every one of them that no licenses are to be issued in the municipality wherein a prohibitory by-law is in force. So much for the License Acts.\nNow for the Municipal Acts. In 1855, by 18 Vic. c. 100, whereby the present municipal system of the province was inaugurated, local councils were empowered in express terms, section 23, sub-section 6, to prohibit absolutely the retail traffic in liquors within the territorial limits of the municipality. In 1856, by 19 & 20 Vic. c. 101, sec. 8, the county councils were authorized to prohibit entirely, in March of each year, the sale of spirituous liquors within the county. And by section 11 the local councils were authorized to pass such a by-law for their own municipalities whenever the county council had allowed the month of March to expire without having passed one for the county.\nIn 1860, by 23 Vic. ch. 61, the Municipal Act was consolidated, but the above provisions of the statute of 1856 were left intact. Also in the Consolidated Statutes of 1861, ch. 24, these enactments are re-enacted with- out any alterations; as secs. 26 sub-secs. 10 and 11, and sec. 27, sub-sec. 16, respectively.\nThe terms are unequivocal: \u201cEvery municipal, county (or local) council may make by-laws for prohibiting and preventing (to prevent or prohibit) the sale of any spirituous liquors.\u201d In 1866 (29 & 30 Vic. ch. 32), sec. 16 of sec. 27 of the Consolidated Municipal Act of 1861, ch. 24, above referred to, was repealed, and replaced by a provision giving to local councils, before the second Wednesday of March of each year, the power to prohibit the sale of any spirituous liquors.\nThis Act, passed only two years after the Temperance Act of 1864, must be taken as another unequivocal declaration of the legislature of the late province of Canada that the power of the municipal authorities had not been, in any way, diminished or restricted by the said Temperance Act, and that these powers were not inconsistent with or repugnant to those conferred by the said Act.\nSuch was, in the province of Quebec, the state of the statutory law, on the subject, at confederation.\nI need hardly say that it results clearly from it, whatever its consequences may be on the question now under consideration, that the whole system of legislative supervision over the liquor traffic was so closely identified with the municipal system of the province and so blended with it that they formed only one. The \u201cconstitutional connection\u201d between the two, to use Mr. Justice Burton\u2019s expression, was complete. And up to the present day the two are so worked and put in operation as one that every year, in a large number of the municipalities, the only, or at least the principal, question at the election for councillors is prohibition or no prohibition. This is a matter of public notoriety in the province. Now, not long after the coming into force of the British North America Act the Quebec Legislature, in 1870, enacted a municipal code and, in continuance of the policy that had theretofore prevailed in the Province of treating the control over the liquor traffic as a part of the municipal institutions, and leaving it to be as theretofore a marked feature of the power vested in the municipal authorities, it conferred upon each local council, by sec. 561 thereof, the power to prohibit and this, by extension of the power, \u201cat any time\u201d during the municipal year, the retail sale of intoxicating liquors. And that enactment, with slight amendments (art. 6118, Rev. Stat. of 1888), has remained in force up to the present day unchallenged by the federal authority and has been acted upon through the Province in a number of municipalities.\nAnd at this very moment there are no less than 158 localities in the province, as I gather from official sources, where the retail sale of liquors is entirely prohibited under that statute. That has been in the province the average yearly number of such by-laws since 1867. And, as in Ontario, I may remark, the enforcement of all such regulations, restrictions and prohibitions is performed by the police force of the locality where such force exists, and forms a part of the police duties, under the control of the police courts and police commissioners. In fact, in many of the rural municipalities, the only annual police regulation is a prohibitory by-law.\nIf the appellant\u2019s contentions were to prevail all this legislation, all these hundreds of by-laws passed every year since 1867, were and are each and every one of them perfect nullities, not worth the paper they were written upon.\nThe legislature of Quebec, besides the statutes I have referred to, has since the municipal code, and after the passing of the federal Temperance Act re-enacted, in 1888, as law enforced in the province, the Temperance Act of 1864, by art. 1095 of the Revised Statutes which reads as follows:\u2014\nThe municipal council of every city, town, township, parish or incorporated village, shall have the power under the authority and for the enforcement of this section, and subject to the provisions and limitations, at any time, to pass a by-law prohibiting the sale of intoxicating liquors,\nwithout submitting it to the electors. The legislature of Ontario, in 1887, by the Revised Statutes, likewise considered the Temperance Act of 1864 as still in force within that province.\nNow, what is the jurisprudence on the question in the province of Quebec?\nI will refer, of course, only to the Court of Appeal.\nI find only two cases, in that court, on the question, but they are both so express and clear that unreversed as they stand, they settle, beyond doubt, the jurisprudence, as far as the province goes.\nIn Sulte v. The Corporation of Three Rivers (1882)[50], the Court of Appeal, in Montreal, unanimously held that, at the time of confederation, the right to prohibit the sale of intoxicating liquors was possessed by the municipal authorities, and consequently is to be deemed included in the powers vested in the provincial legislatures, under the words \u201cprovincial institutions \u201cof subsec. 8, sec. 92 of the British North America Act, and this in no equivocal terms.\nWe hold then, said Mr. Justice Ramsay for the court, that the right to pass a prohibitory liquor law for the purposes of municipal institutions has been reserved to the local legislatures by the British North America Act.\nThat case was affirmed in this court[51], though not upon the ground taken by the Montreal Court of Ap- peal. The point was not dealt with one way or the other.\nIn 1891, in the case of the Corporation of Huntingdon v. Moir and the Attorney General intervening party upon the constitutional question[52], the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench again unanimously determined, reversing the judgment a quo, that art. 561 of the Municipal Code vesting the local councils with the right to prohibit the retail traffic in liquors within their territorial limits, is intra vires of the provincial legislature, and that a by-law passed under the provisions to prohibit such traffic is in all respects legal and binding.\nIt is impossible to get two decisions more directly in point.\nThis court has never had occasion to pass on the question, but in the case of Bergeron v. Lassalle[53] it may not be amiss to remark, the power of the legislature of Quebec to prohibit the sale of liquors in Three Rivers and other cities of that class, relied upon by the respondent, was not questioned either at bar or on the bench, and the court gave due effect to such a prohibition.\nThe appeal should, in my opinion, be dismissed with costs.\nI have only to add that, in my view of the case, the appeal must fail even if the appellant\u2019s contentions as to the unconstitutionality of the Ontario legislation in the matter were to prevail.\nFor, if the province of Ontario had not the power to re-enact the sections in question of the Municipal Act, it cannot have had the power to repeal them expressly or impliedly; and consequently they are now in force as they stood at confederation in the Municipal Act of 1866. No reasons to quash the by-law of the municipality respondent as being against the provisions of the statute as it then was, have been assigned by the appellant.\nAs I conclude this opinion, I am informed by the registrar that a reference to this court which will probably involve the question in issue in this case has been ordered by the federal authorities. I think, however, that the parties here should not be prejudiced by this action of the federal power, and that they are entitled to a judgment on the case they submitted to us.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014After the argument of this case upon the first of the questions involved in it, certain questions were submitted to us under an order in council of the 26th of October, 1893, in the matter of prohibition of the trade in intoxicating liquors under the provisions of the statute in that behalf, which questions contained one which raised the precise point in issue in this case and in consequence all further action in this case was deferred until the hearing and argument of the questions submitted by the order in Council. The argument therefore upon the questions so submitted, constituted in effect, in my opinion, a reconsideration and as it were, a rehearing of the questions involved in this case. I have entered fully in my judgment on the questions so submitted into my reasons for my conclusions upon the said questions which include that in this case which judgment contains the only judgment I have to deliver upon every one of the questions therein involved, namely, that they all must be answered in the negative[54].\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellant: Du Vernet & Jones.\nSolicitors for respondent: O\u2019Donohoe, Titus & Co.\n[1] 19 Ont.

Has a provincial legislature jurisdiction to prohibit the sale within the province of spirituous, fermented or other intoxicating liquors?\n2. Or has the legislature such jurisdiction regarding such portions of the province as to which the Canada Temperance Act is not in operation?\n3.

If a provincial legislature has not jurisdiction to prohibit sales of such liquors, irrespective of quantity, has such legislature jurisdiction to prohibit the sale, by retail, according to the definition of a sale by retail, either in statutes in force in the province at the time of confederation, or any other definition thereof?\n6. If a provincial legislature has a limited jurisdiction only as regards the prohibition of sales, has the legislature jurisdiction to prohibit sales subject to the limits provided by the several subsections of the 99th section of \"The Canada Temperance Act,\" or any of them (Revised Statutes of Canada, chapter 106, section 99)?\n7. Had the Ontario Legislature jurisdiction to enact the 18th section of the Act passed by the legislature of Ontario in the 53rd year of Her Majesty's reign, and intituled:'\" An Act to improve the Liquor License Acts,\" as said section is explained by the act passed by said legislature in the 54th year of Her Majesty's reign, and intituled: \"An Act respecting Local Option in the matter of Liquor selling\"?\nThe court stated its opinion to the effect that all the said questions so referred as aforesaid should be answered in the negative, and the reasons therefor appear from the opinions delivered by their Lordships Mr. Justice Gwynne, Mr. Justice Sedgewick and Mr. Justice King, hereinafter given. His Lordship the Chief Justice, and his Lordship Mr. Justice Fournier, dissenting from the opinion of the majority of the court, were of opinion that the said questions should be answered in the affirmative, with the exception of questions three and four, which they were of opinion should be answered in the negative, and the reasons therefor appear from the opinions of the Chief Justice and Mr. Justice Fournier, also hereinafter given.\nCurran Q.C., Solicitor-General of Canada for the Dominion.\nCartwright Q.C., Deputy Attorney General, and Maclaren Q.C., for Ontario.\nCannon Q.C., Assistant Attorney General, for Quebec.\nMaclaren Q.C, for Manitoba.\nWallace Nesbitt and Saunders, for the Distillers and Brewers' Association by leave of the court under 54 & 55 Vict. ch. 25 sec. 4.\nThe Solicitor-General.\u2014The main question to be decided upon this reference is, whether a provincial legislature has jurisdiction to prohibit within the province the sale, manufacture or importation of spirituous, fermented or other intoxicating liquors?\nIt is hardly necessary to discuss whether the province has the right to prohibit the sale of liquor irrespective of quantity. By the British North America Act the regulation of trade and commerce is absolutely within the power and jurisdiction of the Dominion Parliament, and for a province so to prohibit would be an infringement upon the powers that have thus been conferred in a distinct and positive manner upon that parliament.\nIt is true that the Dominion License Act, 1883, was held by the Privy Council to be ultra vires, and it has been contended that the judgment in that case was in conflict with Russell v. The Queen[1] which held the Canada Temperance Act to be intra vires, but that tribunal pointed out that there was no conflict, that in deciding the Canada Temperance Act case they proceeded upon a certain line, and in deciding the License Act case they were proceeding upon a different line. I wish to refer to a statement made by the Chief Justice in a case many years ago, one of the very first cases in this court, Severn v. The Queen[2], which I think is of some importance:\nSome arguments addressed to the court seem to have been intended to elicit opinions as to the locality of the power of prohibiting legislation with reference to the trade in spirituous liquors, wine and beer. This, so far as retail trade is concerned must depend upon the proper answer to two questions:\u2014First, do the local legislatures possess what is called the police power? Secondly, if they do, does it authorize them to legislate so as to prohibit or only to regulate the retail traffic in liquors? The decision of this case does not call for any answer to either of these questions, and I therefore forbear from expressing any opinion upon them.\nI quote this to show that this case presents a feature which comes up for the first time and I am satisfied that there will be found in the decisions of the Privy Council reasons why there should be, for the proper adjudication of this question and the determination of where the power to prohibit lies, a definition given, as I think a definition has already been given in the Canada Temperance Act[3], of what is wholesale and what is retail, and my first contention is that the power to determine that must lie in the authority having the regulation of trade and commerce, the superior power. In Russell v. The Queen[4], the Privy Council, in affirming the judgment which maintained the constitutionality of the Temperance Act, gave their concurrence and sanction to the definition which was given by the Dominion Parliament as to what is wholesale.\nIn the case of Citizens Insurance Co. v. Parsons[5], the Privy Council say that in construing the words \"regulation of trade and commerce\" they would include political arrangements in regard to trade requiring the sanction of parliament, the regulation of trade in matters of inter-provincial concern, and it may be that they would include the general regulation of trade affecting the whole Dominion.\nThe legislation with regard to trade and commerce, to my mind, gives to the Dominion the control of the importation and manufacture of intoxicating liquors. That is a branch of the subject which I think requires but very little elaboration. The definition Which I have just read here stating that this would include political arrangements in regard to trade requiring the sanction of parliament, seems to be self-evident. If we wish to make a treaty of commerce with France with regard to wines, or with the United States with regard to our trade relations, the Dominion Parliament has in the past, without any question, made such arrangements, and there is no doubt that here the judgment of their Lordships comes directly into play when they speak of arrangements in regard to trade requiring the sanction of parliament, the commerce or trade in matters of inter-provincial concern; here we have the manufacture of liquors in our country, a very large industry, in which persons in the different provinces are engaged, and in our inter-provincial trade these commodities play a very important part. They say this would include the general regulation of trade affecting the whole Dominion. The wholesale traffic, at all events, is one which involves every province, and which needs to be regulated by a parliament having jurisdiction over the whole area of the country.\nI may state here that we have also, in the classification of these subjects in the statutes of old Canada prior to confederation, something that may guide us, to some extent at all events, in arriving at our conclusion upon this point. If we take up the Consolidated Statutes of Canada of 1859, we find there that the subjects which fell under the general control, which affected the two provinces generally, were disposed of in the general consolidation of the statutes, including all the legislation regarding the importation and manufacture of liquors. The excise laws are side by side with the customs enactments showing that such importation and manufacture were subjects of general concern in which the trade and commerce of the united provinces were involved.\n[The learned Solicitor General then referred at length to the case of Suite v. Three Rivers[6]; Lareau[7]; Clements on the Canadian Constitution[8]; and In re Local Option Act[9]; contending that the power of prohibiting by retail was given to local legislatures under the words \"municipal institutions\" in section 92 British North America Act.]\nAll parties in discussing this question, the local legislature in legislating upon it, the Dominion in legislating upon it, have felt that there was an absolute necessity to draw a distinction between wholesale and retail.\nThe constitution will be utterly unworkable if you cannot draw a distinction between wholesale and retail. If, under municipal institutions, the legislature of a province could delegate to a municipality the power to prohibit, to absolutely prohibit by retail, I say that in logic, and common sense, it must have that power vested in itself. No doubt I am met by the argument that the Privy Council has decided that there is no distinction as to retail at all. The regulation of trade and commerce is vested in the Dominion Parliament, and there is no more important or essential element in the regulation of trade and commerce than the definition as to what is wholesale and what is retail. There must be some authority.\nThe sixth question is: \"If a provincial legislature has a limited jurisdiction only, as regards the prohibition of sales, has the legislature jurisdiction to prohibit sales, subject to the limits provided by the several subsections of the 99th section of the Canada Temperance Act, or any of them?\"\nI have sought to point out that the 99th section of the Canada Temperance Act was the governing and the defining point. The answer to this must be in the affirmative.\nMy learned friends, who represent the distillers, say that this is an ambiguous question, and proceed to discuss it as though they were discussing the second question over again. Tinder this section 99 it will be noticed that the Dominion Parliament was very careful in all its subsections with regard to the rights which were dealt with. There was the question, for instance, of religious liberty, and there was the one exception made with regard to the manufacture or importation or sale of wine for sacramental purposes.\nThe Dominion Parliament having within its control the protection of the civil and religious liberty of the people in this Dominion, and the peace, order and good government of the people, no local legislature could prohibit, for instance, the sale of wine for sacramental purposes, and thus deprive some of the largest bodies of christians in the Dominion of the right of exercising freely their religious ideas and convictions. So it would be, under trade and commerce, with regard to that subsection which states that intoxicating liquors or alcohol may be sold for the purpose of mechanical developments of various kinds. Alcohol may be necessary in the carrying on of a whole host of trades in the country and have none of the attributes of alcoholic beverages when manufactured. No local legislature could possibly have the power to prohibit the use of alcohol in carrying out those works which are necessary for the development of trade and commerce in the Dominion.\nAs to the last point I agree that the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario is good and sound in every respect.\n[The Chief Justice: I shall call upon counsel in the order of precedence of the lieutenant governors. I will call upon Ontario first.]\nMaclaren Q.C. I appear for the province of Manitoba as well as Ontario. My learned friend Mr. Cartwright appears for Ontario with me. I appear for Manitoba alone. My instructions from the two Attorneys General are the same.\nWith regard to the position of this question, I submit, may it please your Lordships, that it is useful to look at the state of matters at the time of confederation. The British North America Act of 1867 was no doubt passed with a view to the existing state of things.\nThe phrases that are there used are largely taken from the headings of legislation that was then on the statute book of old Canada, among them being trade and commerce and \"municipal institutions\"\u2014so that I would first ask your Lordships to interpret the expression used in those sections of the British North America Act based on the Quebec resolutions not by an Imperial dictionary exclusively but by a Canadian dictionary, so to speak.\nLooking then at the state of the law before confederation, which, I think, we may do, we find, for instance, the Consolidated Statutes of Lower Canada which have been referred to by the Solicitor General giving the power of prohibiting the sale of spirituous liquors to the municipal council. (Chap. 24.) The state of the law apparently in Upper Canada at this time was that a prohibitory law could be passed prohibiting shop and tavern licenses, but not the sale in original packages. I am not aware exactly where this importation in original packages came from, but you could not sell 100 gallons provided it was not in the original packages, in other words, if bulk was broken; it would then cease to be protected. With regard to the other two provinces of which the Dominion was originally composed I speak with less certainty and positiveness; but, so far as I am able to understand the statutes of those provinces, there were for the rural parts at least, not the same kind of municipal institutions as had been adopted or adapted to Lower and Upper Canada.\nSo far as I can form an opinion from looking over the statutes of the provinces of Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, it seems to me that to this day, for instance in Nova Scotia, they deal directly with a good many matters relating to roads and the like which in the provinces of Ontario and Quebec were, even before confederation, left to municipal authorities. I notice money grants and the like. I infer from the state of legislation that some of the details of this legislation were not so fully or generally carried out as they were in Upper and Lower Canada at the time of confederation.\nThe province of Manitoba has adopted in entirety the Ontario municipal system, but it has been created since the British North America Act, which it cannot therefore help to interpret.\nSo that my argument on that point is that when the legislatures of the provinces, and the British North America Act legislating respecting those provinces, used that title \"municipal institutions,\" we may assume they used it giving to it the well established meaning it had in the country with regard to which they were legislating.\nHowever, we have to admit this, that some of the enumerated subjects in section 91 were matters that were formerly under the head of \"municipal institutions,\" and I could not pretend to argue that those subjects which are given by name to the Dominion, such as \"weights and measures\" in section 91, are not taken out of the respective categories in section 92 under which they might otherwise fall, but my argument is that that is limited to those subjects which are taken out by name.\nThen, as to clause 9, it may have been inserted giving the legislature the license power for the purpose of revenue for this reason: the Dominion is given, under section 91, the right to raise a revenue by any system of taxation, and the only power given to the local to tax is by direct taxation within the province. The Privy Council has decided, in the insurance and other cases, that licenses are a sort of indirect taxation, so that if they had not put in that section (subsection 9) it might be presumed that the local legislatures were not authorised to raise a revenue by that indirect means of taxation, viz., licenses. Then with regard to this question of \"municipal institutions,\" one of the clearest utterances of the doctrine is that laid down by the first Chief Justice of this court in an Ontario case, Re Slavin and Orillia[10], which puts this matter better than I could do.\nI would also refer to the case mentioned by his Lordship the Chief Justice, The Queen v. Taylor[11] where there is a very thorough discussion of this branch of the subject. It is practically the same case as came before this court later in Severn v. The Queen[12]. See also Suite v. Three Rivers[13].\nI have to admit that the regulations by \"municipal institutions\" before confederation were very largely of what might be considered retail, not exclusively, but in a general sense. In the province of Ontario, for instance, original packages were exempt from municipal supervision in case the original package contained a certain quantity. Prior to the decision in the License Act of 1883 it might have been open to argument, as the Solicitor General has argued, that there was a difference between wholesale and retail, but I respectfully submit that since the decision in the Liquor License Act case we are justified in assuming, for such purposes as we are arguing to-day, that there is really no difference between wholesale and retail, and that the two must stand or fall together. I am speaking now only of the sale. That I claim is the effect of the decision in the case of the License Act of 1883, the McCarthy Act, and the amending Act of 1884. When the matter was argued before this court the wholesale trade was referred to as properly coming under the matter of regulation of trade and commerce, but not shop or tavern licenses, or the retail trade; your Lordships were drawing a line of distinction and demarcation which was swept away by the Privy Council; they said in effect, that not only was the retail trade to be licensed, and regulated at least, by the provinces, but the wholesale trade as well.\nThere is a case as to the difference between wholesale and retail which I would like to refer to as a part of my argument. It is the case of Lepine v. Laurent[14] decided in 1891.\nThe next point I would refer to is this, that in the case of Russell v. The Queen[15], which was cited by my learned friend, and which I think will be used by our friends on the other side to show that we have not the power of prohibiting, the case of \"municipal institutions\" was not considered; that appears from the report itself.\nIn this case we are not called upon to reconcile conflicting legislation. That may come up hereafter, but for the present your Lordships are only asked whether the provinces have such power, assuming that the Dominion has not exercised it. That, I think, is a fair way of putting the questions which have been submitted by His Excellency in the present case, and for that purpose I think it is useful to remember, in considering Russell v. The Queen(2), that what was in question there was a Dominion Act, and the expression used in Hodge v. The Queen[16] is particularly applicable, because I claim that prohibitory legislation is one of those very questions or subjects which, in one aspect and for one purpose, may well fall within section 92, and in another aspect, and for another purpose, may fall within section 91. In Hodge v. The Queen(3) the possible conflict is referred to and their Lordships base their decision on the ground that there is no conflict (The learned counsel then reviewed the argument of counsel and the effect of the decision of the Privy Council on the McCarthy Act)\nWith regard to the question of regulation, I think this much can be said, that the decision in Hodge v. The Queen[17], and the decision on the McCarthy Act, at least have settled this, that the licensing and the regulation of the liquor traffic are in the provinces. That, I think, is the outcome of these discussions. I think they have decided that they have the regulation. My argument is that the power to prohibit is involved in the power of regulation, and I attach some importance to that principle. I do not know that I have ever seen that more tersely put than by his Lordship the late Chief Justice of this court in the case of Fredericton v. The Queen[18].\nIt is difficult to say that a provincial legislature can prohibit 499 people out of 500 from engaging in something, but that they cannot prohibit the 500th.\nThe powers which we are now claiming for the provincial government are the powers which all the provinces have since confederation exercised, almost without challenge, regarding the sale of poisons and such substances under the Pharmacy Acts that have been passed in the various provinces. For instance, in the Ontario Act, which is chapter 151 of the Revised Statutes of Ontario, section 26 makes provision as to the sale of these poisons. The only case of which I am aware where the validity of these acts came up, and where the constitutional question was raised, was in the province of Quebec, in the case of Bennett v. The Pharmaceutical Association of the Province of Quebec[19].\nWe claim provincial authority on this subject of prohibition under the head of \"matters of a local and private nature\" in subsection 16, as well as under \"municipal institutions.\" If it should be objected to us on the other side that this is really an interference with the Canada Temperance Act, or with the authority of Russell v. The Queen[20], our answer to that is this, that we have the authority of the Privy Council not only for the principle laid down in Hodge v. The Queen[21], but also that this power of legislation may exist concurrently in the two bodies.\nThe first case in which, I think, that principle was clearly laid down, was L'Union St. Jacques v. B\u00e9lisle[22]. Lord Selborne gave the judgment in that case. The next case in which the same doctrine was laid down, is Cushing v. Dupuy[23]. I refer particularly to page 415.\nWe find this same rule laid down in the recent case regarding the Assignment Act of Ontario, 1894[24]. So that our argument on this ground is, that so long at least as the Dominion Parliament has not passed a prohibitory law, that it is competent for the local legislature to pass such a prohibitory law as is referred to in the questions before your Lordships.\nAssuming then that the province might have the power, under one or other of those heads in section 92, to pass it, if it be not taken out of their hands by something that is found in section 91, the only one of the enumerated classes that have been suggested on the other side as interfering with it, is the regulation of trade and commerce. Now, I submit that such a law as your Lordships are now asked about does not properly come within the regulation of trade and commerce, within the meaning of section 91 of the British North America Act.\nIf we are looking for the origin of things, it is possible that the words \"trade and commerce\" may have been taken from the Consolidated Statutes of Canada. There are 22 chapters of the Consolidated Statutes of Canada that are grouped together under the title of \"trade and commerce.\" It is instructive to notice that, with I think two exceptions, all the subjects that are treated of in the Consolidated Statutes of Canada, under the head of \"trade and commerce,\" are assigned to the Dominion. One is the protection of persons dealing with agents, and the other is as to limited partnerships.\nAs to the meaning of the words \"regulation of trade and commerce,\" the first authoritative definition of the meaning of the words \"trade and commerce\" is that found in Citizens' Ins. Co. v. Parsons[25]. There their Lordships laid down a definition which, I think, is very strongly in favour of the position taken by us to-day,, I think the words were taken from this side of the Atlantic, and the key to the interpretation, if they are used in any technical sense, is rather to be sought on the continent of America than on the continent of Europe.\nThe only other discussion as to the meaning of trade and commerce, to which I will refer, is found in Bank of Toronto v. Lambe[26]. On this question relating to the sale, there are a number of cases in our own courts, as The Queen v. Taylor[27]; Ex parte Cooey[28]; Blouin v. Corporation of Quebec[29]; Molson v. Lambe[30]; Poulin v. Corporation of Quebec[31]; Danaher v. Peters[32].\nSo far I have spoken of the sale exclusively. Nearly all that has been said regarding the sale applies also to the manufacture, with this exception, I think, that manufacture is in a certain sense more local in its nature than even sale.\nSo far as it is a question of power, I think if the local legislature found it necessary, to effectually carry out the power of prohibiting the sale to prohibit the manufacture, it would so extend.\nAnd the fact that the Dominion Parliament has the right to tax imports, or to put an excise tax upon manufactures, is no ground for withdrawing this from the local authority.\nThe only other remaining question which I think it necessary to refer to specially is the last, as to the validity of the Local Option Act, which I will do very briefly.\nA great deal of that which I said with regard to the sale, in the earlier part of my argument, will apply to this seventh question; in fact, I found it impossible to separate the discussion of the first question submitted to your Lordships from the last question. I have put in the factum the principal points upon which I rely, in addition to those that were urged in the case of Huson v. South Norwich.\nI refer especially of course to the reasons given by the Court of Appeal in the Local Option Case[33].\nI would also refer to a decision of the Court of Queen's Bench of Quebec Corporation of Huntingdon v. Moir[34], on article 561 of the Municipal Code, corresponding to the Local Option Act, and to the analogous case in Nova Scotia of Keefe v. McLennan[35].\nThe other ground to which I would refer with regard to this local option matter, is that the Ontario local option law may be sustained as a license law. Briefly, I put it in this way. Under the Ontario license law there are three classes of licenses to be given, wholesale, shop and tavern. Under the Local Option Law you may abolish shop, leaving wholesale and tavern, or you may pass a by-law abolishing tavern, leaving wholesale and shop; or you may pass a by-law or by-laws abolishing shop and tavern, leaving only wholesale. I submit that that is still a license law, and that under the authority to pass a license law the province of Ontario had power to pass the local option law, and that it may be sustained as a license law. That, briefly, is the ground upon which we claim the validity of the local option law of Ontario.\nUnder that Act wholesale licenses may issue, and cannot be prohibited, so that the point I am making is that this may be sustained as a license law inasmuch as wholesale licenses may issue in any event.\nCartwright Q.C.\u2014My learned friend has gone so very fully into the matter that really there is very little with which I need trouble your Lordships. As I judge from the factums, we are all agreed that the important question is the question of sale; but, before passing to the question of sale, I would just make this observation with regard to the question of importation. It will, I think, be argued on behalf of the brewers and distillers that the right to import, if that be found to be in the Dominion, would necessarily include the right to sell. That, I submit, by no means follows. It is contrary altogether to the decisions in the United States, and I think it is contrary to the observations which have been made by the Privy Council. In two cases, Citizens Insurance Co. v. Parsons[36] and Colonial Building and Investment Association v. Atty. Gen. of Quebec[37], it has been suggested that while the Dominion may have the power to incorporate companies, with power to deal in lands and so forth, throughout the Dominion, it may still be quite possible that a company so incorporated could do no business in any province in consequence of the laws of the province with regard to land preventing them from so dealing. That, I submit to your Lordships, would be entirely analogous to the question of importation carrying with it the right to sell.\nThen, it may be that those corporate bodies so constituted, and given, to some extent, life, have to go to the provinces to get further legislation in order to enable them to really fulfil the purposes for which they were principally incorporated.\nComing to the other question, as regards the right to sell, that of course would be claimed under the head of \"municipal institutions,\" subsec. 8 of sec. 92, and what I suggest to your Lordships as the true view is, to look at \"municipal institutions,\" if I may say so, historically, and see what \"municipal institutions\" included at the time the British North America Act was framed.\nLooking at the British North America Act, there is no indication of anything to show that it was in any way intended to cut down or modify the powers that were then possessed by the various provinces with regard to their own affairs, but that all the powers that were then possessed with regard to the municipalities were intended to be continued. Then we find that in Ontario, Quebec and Nova Scotia these powers were found in the Municipal Acts, or the Acts relating to municipal affairs, and the highest courts of all those provinces have held that these powers remained in the provinces. That, I submit to your Lordships, is a strong argument in favour of the power, to the extent to which it is found in existence in 1867.\nThen, if it is said that the question of trade and commerce in any way comes in conflict, I submit that \"trade and commerce\" must be modified, so far as may be necessary, in order to give full effect to what is covered by \"municipal institutions.\" Because, looking at section. 92, the particular phrase at the beginning of the section is, \"that in each province the legislature may exclusively make laws in relation to matters coming within the classes of subjects next hereinafter enumerated.\" So that their power is to cover all those matters that necessarily, or for convenience, come within these purposes.\nThen we find \"municipal institutions\" followed, in section 92, with the provision about licensing shops, and so on. That is really, I think, the only mention that there is of anything, in terms, which relates to liquor.\nThen, turning to the decisions, I submit nobody can deny now that the whole question of regulation, by way of licensing and so forth, is entirely in the hands of the province in the most absolute form. The Dominion cannot interfere with it, and it would be strange if under the power to regulate concerning trade and commerce the Dominion could prohibit a traffic which it cannot regulate.\nThe mere fact that such an Act as the Canada Temperance Act was held to be valid and within the power of the Dominion Parliament does not of itself, looking at that decision, take away the prohibitory power of the province.\nTo a certain extent licensing Acts include prohibitory provisions. For instance, sales are not allowed on Sundays or on polling days, nor are sales allowed to be made to particular persons. Nobody disputes that such legislation by the provinces is perfectly valid, and yet, if you can prohibit selling on Sunday, why not on Monday? And if on a polling day, why not on some other day? Whether it be wholesale or retail, there is nothing to show that that power was intended to be taken away, and that it comes in, reasonably and properly, under the term \"municipal institutions,\"\nAs the points have been so fully gone over by my learned friend I do not think I need further occupy your Lordships' time.\nCannon Q. C.\u2014Although the question in this case is a most important one to the province of Quebec, on account of the position taken by the Dominion Government in the factum filed in this court, and also the position taken by the learned Solicitor General of Canada in his argument, the remarks which I have to offer to this court on behalf of the province of Quebec will be very brief. The Dominion of Canada, and the Solicitor General, have admitted all the rights which the province of Quebec claim on this question; they have even admitted a little more, on one point, than the province of Quebec claims.\nIn the light of the different decisions rendered on these questions of prohibitory liquor laws, and of the different cases cited, the province of Quebec has interpreted the question now before the court in the following manner, or has assumed that it had, on this question of prohibitory liquor laws, the following power:\u2014\nFirst of all, the province of Quebec claims the right of licensing the wholesale and retail sale of liquor; and it does now, practically, under the laws in force in the province.\nSecondly, the province claims the right of limiting the number of liquor licenses throughout the province, and does so through the medium of municipal councils. It does so throughout the province under the authority of the Municipal Code, and in the larger cities and towns through the medium of license commissioners, at least for Quebec and Montreal. Thirdly, the province claims the absolute right of prohibiting the retail sale of liquor.\nThroughout the province of Quebec we claim the right to absolutely prohibit the retail sale of intoxicating liquors, and, practically, we have been doing so since confederation.\nThen comes the question of the definition of wholesale and retail. Because of the arguments which have been presented to this court by the different learned counsel who have preceded me I think I should say a few words on behalf of the province of Quebec.\nWe have, to a certain extent, in the province of Quebec, defined retail sale. Our definition may be wrong but, of course, we will hold to it, until we are corrected by this court, or perhaps later on by the Privy Council. The definition of retail sale is found in the laws of the province of Quebec, article 561 of the Municipal Code. Under that article power is given to all municipal councils, by means of a by-law, to prohibit the sale of intoxicating liquors within its limits under a quantity of two imperial gallons, or twelve bottles of three half pints. That is the definition which the province of Quebec gives to wholesale and retail liquor selling; two gallons is wholesale and under that quantity is retail according to this provision of our Municipal Code.\nIn numerous instances municipalities have prohibited the retail sale of intoxicating liquors. And the law provides that when such a by-law has been passed a copy of it is forwarded to the collector of the provincial revenue of the district in which the municipality exists, and from the date of the receipt of this by-law, until its repeal, the collector of the provincial revenue is debarred from issuing licenses for the sale by retail of intoxicating liquors in that municipality. The only thing which the province claims in respect of sale by wholesale is to make the vendor take out a license for the purposes of revenue and that is what we have done for years past, under our license law which is now embodied in our Revised Statutes. Every wholesale vendor of intoxicating liquors is bound to take out a license; and now, the only preliminary for the taking out of that license is the payment of the fee fixed by the Quebec license law.\nI would further add, that the government of the province of Quebec is of opinion that total prohibition is the cessation of trade and commerce in a certain article, intoxicating liquors for instance, and that the cessation of trade and commerce in that certain article must necessarily be regulating trade and commerce, and that, consequently, total prohibition by a provincial legislature is ultra vires. I cover by those words the prohibition of manufacture and importation.\nThe learned counsel for the province of Ontario claim that there is no difference between wholesale and retail as to licenses under municipal institutions. The government of the province of Quebec, in the past legislation which has been adopted, and which is still in force, has not adopted that view of the question. It being a matter of the regulation of trade and commerce the provincial legislature thinks it has no right to totally prohibit the manufacture or importation of intoxicating liquors. We do not claim that right before this court now, nor do we claim the right of prohibiting the wholesale sale of spirituous liquors, thinking that that also would be regulating trade and commerce, which is not within the purview of the powers of the local legislature.\nWe consider that the retail prohibition of the sale of spirituous liquors is rather in the nature of a municipal regulation, within the powers of the local legislature. As I before stated, the power of prohibiting the retail sale of spirituous liquors we have claimed in the past, and have enacted legislative provisions to enforce such retail prohibition in whatever municipalities wish to do so. We still claim that we have the power to do so in the future.\nWallace Nesbitt for the Brewers and Distillers Association:\u2014\nAs I understand the principle of construction that has been adopted, both by your Lordships' court and by the Privy Council it is, first to inquire whether the particular matter falls within the exclusive jurisdiction of the province because, if your Lordships find that it does not fall within any of the specially enumerated clauses of section 92, then, so far as these questions are concerned, the court is done with it. For that canon of construction I refer to Russell v. The Queen[38].\nThen the next canon of construction to which I ask your Lordships' attention is this: If it fall within any of the classes enumerated in sec. 92, then the further question would arise, viz., whether the subject of the Act does not also fall within one of the enumerated classes of subjects in section 91, and so does not still belong to the Dominion Parliament.\nA further canon of construction has been laid down in Atty. Gen. of Ontario v. Atty. Gen. of Canada[39], and in Tennant v. Union Bank[40]. If it falls within section 91 and you find it legislated upon, then this follows:\u2014That although it may be within section 92, if it has already been legislated upon by the Parliament of the Dominion, under section 91, then the local legislation is of no effect.\nNow, I take the canons of construction, as laid down in the Privy Council up to date, to be these: First, you are to look at the character of the legislation and see if it comes within section 92. If it comes within section 92 you may legislate, subject to this, that if it is inconsistent in the slightest degree with ancillary legislation under section 91, then the legislation of the local must go. Lastly, until it conflicts, either with ancillary legislation, or direct legislation, it may be good under a certain aspect of section 92. If I am correct in that the following result is patent:\u2014If this is really prohibitive legislation that you are asked to pass upon, and it does not fall within any one of the sections of 92, then my task is done; but, supposing your Lordships do not follow me to that extent, if I am able to demonstrate that it conflicts with legislation as to which the Dominion Parliament has a power to legislate, even ancillary legislation, if I may so describe it, and that the Dominion has already taken up the field, then again my task is accomplished, and all these questions must be answered in the negative.\nMy first proposition therefore, is, that this does not come within section 92 in any particular, under any one of the heads, that it is in fact prohibitive legislation that your Lordships are asked to say the provinces are entitled to pass. If I am right in that, and it does not come under section 92, as I say, I am through; but, I go a step further, and say, even if it could be said to be under sec. 92 it conflicts directly with a piece of legislation which has already been declared to be valid by the Privy Council, which is in force, viz., the Scott Act, and the two cannot consistently stand together.\nNow, Russell v. The Queen[41] decides that prohibition belongs to the Dominion, Hodge v. The Queen[42] that licensing belongs to the province, and the McCarthy Act case that neither one conflicts with the other, but that the McCarthy Act was simply a piece of legislation of the type and character, if I may so describe it, of a licensing Act, and was therefore ultra vires, because it conflicted with the exclusive power which was granted to the legislatures.\nThen, if the provinces claim also a field of legislation as to that, we say it has already been taken up with the Scott Act.\nNow, if the Privy Council has decided anything it has decided this, that there can be no line of demarcation drawn between wholesale and retail. Therefore what you are asked to decide here is: Can they pass a prohibitive law? Your Lordships are not asked to say whether they can pass a retail prohibitive law. That is not the question submitted. Dealing with question 1, it is a prohibitive law, as such, irrespective of quantity, and as such, we ask your Lordships' answer.\nThen that brings me to the particular argument as to whether this in fact does come within any of the clauses of section 92.\nMr. Justice Burton, in the Local Option Case, said that the sub-head of \"municipal institutions\" had never been drawn to their Lordships' attention. All I can say in answer to that is, that in the McCarthy Act case their Lordships of the Privy Council say that they think the subject of \"municipal institutions\" has nothing whatever to do with the subject of prohibition.\nFor the purpose of this argument there can be no distinction between wholesale and retail. The provinces have not the power to prohibit retail traffic, and cannot create the power by saying it is part of \"municipal institutions,\" because it only relates to a bottle. It must, in the same way, relate to fifty gallons or fifty barrels, if it is part of municipal power. I submit, therefore, that the effect of the British North America Act upon that is simply this, that under the head of \"municipal institutions,\" subsection 8 embraces everything which inherently belongs to municipal institutions, not inconsistent with the power assigned to the Federal Parliament under section 91.\nThen when you find the Privy Council, in express words, saying in Russell v. The Queen[43] that this prohibition legislation does not fall within section 92, when you find their attention drawn expressly to subsection 8 in Hodge v. The Queen[44], and they again affirm Russell v. The Queen (1), and still again in the McCarthy Act Case, surely it cannot be said that in their Lordships' opinion, under \"municipal institutions,\" anything in relation to prohibition of the liquor traffic could be said to come. Then, if it does not come under that head, I do not understand it is pretended it can come under any other head of section 92, and that of course would relieve me from following the discussion any further, as to the right of the local to pass a prohibitive law.\nIf a province can pass prohibition it can, in effect put a tax upon other provinces, because it destroys the ability to raise a revenue by the Dominion, and therefore it becomes interprovincial, as a matter of trade and commerce. Take, for instance, the illustration given by one of your Lordships this morning, supposing all the distilleries and breweries in this province were to be closed by prohibition, absolutely closed, they could neither manufacture nor sell, because it is that broad class of legislation that you are asked to deal with, if such a course were adopted the result would be, that the taxes or revenue would have to be raised in some other way, and the other provinces would, either directly or indirectly, have to contribute to the general deficit that would occur. We can also invoke what is called the historical argument on the subject of the liquor traffic, and I submit that you find in that very section 92 the liquor case expressly dealt with by subsection 9. Therefore, it is only fair to assume that all that was delegated to the local legislatures was that which was expressly delegated by the very words, viz., the regulation of the traffic, by the licensing of shops, saloons, taverns and so on. Is that not a fair argument? If you find they give express power on the subject of liquor, is it fair to ask under some other term, as to which it cannot be said to be inherently connected, an implied power to be given beyond the express power of section 9?\nI would refer to the cases of Bennett v. Pharmaceutical Society[45]; The Queen v. Justices of King's[46]; Re Barclay and The Township of Darlington[47]; Re Brodie and Bowmanville[48]; Ex parte Gooey[49].\n[The learned counsel then argued that the right was with the Dominion as a \"regulation of trade and commerce.\"]\nSaunders follows on the same side:\u2014I propose to deal in the brief argument which I shall address to your Lordships, solely with question no. 7, which has been before this court in the case of Huson v. The Township of South Norwich.\nQuestion no. 7 purports on the face of it to deal with only retail trade, but, according to all the authorities that have been cited, there is no distinction between wholesale and retail as to this question. This must be so for it would be impossible to define what is wholesale and retail. There is no harmony on the matter in the legislation of the different provinces or even in different legislative acts of the same province. Therefore, although this question deals with retail, it is illusory, because in dealing with retail it deals with the whole question; and, however question seven is answered, question one must be answered in the same way. That I apprehend would be a sufficient answer perhaps to this point, but I am prepared to go further, and to submit that even if you were prepared to concede absolute prohibition to the province, and the right to control it, still I should be entitled to ask your Lordships to hold that the legislation referred to in question no. 7 was ultra vires, because it comes into conflict with the most important provision of the Canada Temperance Act.\n[The learned counsel then dealt at some length with the Local Option Act pointing out that it was not in any way ancillary to the Canada Temperance Act but an independent piece of legislation, and the two could not stand together.]\nMy learned friend Mr. Maclaren, suggests that your Lordships can treat it as a License Act. That, of course, would be perfectly impossible. You cannot alter the character of it by tacking it on to a License Act. The character of this prohibition clause is prohibition. The question was gone over very fully in the McCarthy Act Case, and the Privy Council would not hear of it for a moment.\nMy learned friend Mr. Nesbitt has already referred to the Quebec cases, and I think it is shown that they do not constitute any sort of guide, because, according to the argument of my learned friend Mr. Cannon, they did what was clearly irregular. While the Dunkin Act was in existence they dealt with prohibition under statutes of their own. The Attorney General of Ontario, no mean authority upon constitutional law, did not do that. In 1874, so soon as he assumed the office of Attorney General, he had that altered. He has recognized all along the existence of the doubt, which within twelve months he has he has given expression to, as to whether the province of Ontario or any province has the right to pass any prohibition law whatever.\nI wish for a moment to refer to the judgment of Mr. Justice Burton, who is perhaps, with the exception of the late lamented member of this court, Mr. Justice Henry, the strongest provinciality we have had upon the bench, and he also concurs in upholding this judgment, and, in the course of it, in order that he might not be misunderstood, he makes use of words, as he says, much against his will, to the effect that it would be utterly impossible to hold that prohibition is in the province.\nI have only a few other observations to make in connection with the points that I have already suggested as to the conflict that arises, and it incidentally established another point which is important in this way:\u2014During the course of this argument we have heard a great deal about the pre-confederation argument as to \"municipal institutions.\" It is said that the powers that they exercised before confederation are powers they are still to continue to exercise, unless they are specially transferred to the Dominion Parliament. If there is a conflict, as I say there is, as to cities it follows of course that that contention is unsound. So soon as you begin to apply it, what follows? Why, a conflict of the clearest and most unequivocal kind. If that is not an answer to the pre-confederation argument it seems impossible that any answer can be made. The conflict is clear and distinct. If it produces a conflict it is unsound in principle; if unsound in principle, it cannot be supported.\nJust one word with regard to the position taken by the learned Solicitor General. I submit, my Lord, that his position here is untenable. He has either gone too far or not far enough. The concessions he makes here, and I consider that they are concessions, and nothing but concessions, should not affect this question. The question is, not what he is willing to concede to the provinces, but: What is the strict construction of the British North America Act? And that is particularly necessary in view of the fact that this question is very likely to be carried to the Privy Council. We ask for a strict construction of the British North America Act, because if they are merely concessions made these concessions could of course be withdrawn. Independent of these concessions we ask for a strict construction of the British North America Act. We think it is of the greatest importance not only respecting our client, but in the public interest. The concessions which the learned Solicitor General has thought fit to make, if they are concessions, should have nothing whatever to do with the matter.\nThe Solicitor-General\u2014I desire to say one word as to the very important statements made by my learned friend Mr. Nesbitt regarding the action or intention of the legislature of the province of Quebec, concerning the Dunkin Act, in which he has been entirely misled by the interpretation which he has given to the judgments referred to, amongst others the judgment in the case of Ex parte Cooey[50]. The opposite is exactly the fact, and it is most important to note it.\nThe court in that case held that the provisions of the Temperance Act of 1864 had not been repealed or amended by the Municipal Act, or the subsequent legislation so as to prevent enactment of a by-law thereunder for the sale of intoxicating liquors, or to prevent prohibition, but pointed out that the legislature had shown its authority by interfering most directly and legislating most clearly upon very many of the most important sections of the Dunkin Act. There is another holding, that the regulation of the traffic in intoxicating liquors is within the jurisdiction of the Parliament of Canada. My learned friend in his main argument the other day went on to quote from the Canada Temperance Act to show that the Dominion Parliament had undertaken by that to say that sections 1 to 10, both inclusive, of the Temperance Act of 1864, were repealed as to every municipality, and so forth, and he argued that no exception having been taken it was a concession, on the part of all concerned, that the Dominion Parliament had the right.\nBut in 1870, two or three years after confederation, the province of Quebec had already enacted exactly the same thing, that is to say, by subsection 12 of section 197 of the License Act of the province of Quebec, it was decreed that the act 27 & 28 Vic. ch. 8, should be repealed. If your Lordships will refer to the Revised Statutes of the province of Quebec, you will find that statement made. I refer to vol.'2, appendix A, 27 & 28 Vic. sections 1, 10, 37, 38, 50, 51 and 53. These are all important sections of the Canada Temperance Act (the first Canada Temperance Act), which was the Act of 1864, known as the Dunkin Act, which were not only interfered with, but have actually been repealed, by the legislature of the province of Quebec, and it is the universal holding that our provincial authorities have all the powers that were granted under that Act, and they may either repeal them or leave them in force, or re-enact them if they have been repealed. I have just made that little digression, because I wished to correct what I thought was a false impression at the time made by my learned friend, no doubt, simply by taking the instructions from the statutes that he had quoted instead of referring directly to the repealing section of the statutes themselves. The province of Quebec is with the position assumed by the Dominion of Canada upon all points except one, that is to say, who shall have the right to determine what is wholesale and what is retail. My learned friends from Ontario, of course, differ from us on the point I have just mentioned. The question of wholesale and retail is one that has occupied the attention of the legislatures from the time the first Act was passed. From the very first Act that was passed until the last, which resumed pretty much all the former legislation, they all contained provisions defining the difference between wholesale and retail.\nTo sum up, I contend, first of all, that the Dominion has power to pass a general law for the peace, order, and good government of the Dominion, such as the Canada Temperance Act. That has been decided. The licensing power has been determined as being in the hands of the provinces. But the question of prohibition, either partial or total, has never come up yet; and the important point, I think, to be determined is that one point, as to where the power lies to fix the difference between wholesale and retail.\nThe Dunkin Act has been referred to here, and its bearing upon this question is extremely forcible. We can look at it to see what were the extraordinary powers exercised at that time by the municipalities of the province of Canada.\nIf the legislature of the province which had absolute power to pass a prohibitory by-law, in so far as the retail trade is concerned, were to pass legislation of that kind, and the Dominion Parliament, under its general power which has been granted to it for the peace, order and good government of this community, were to pass a general law, would that kill the local act? Supposing that a legislature had passed an Act within its power for prohibition, would that, as my learned friends here contend, render that law of the legislature a nullity? Not at all. It might cause it to be dormant. The superior power, having passed a law which necessarily would come into effect for the peace, order and good government of the country, according to the judgment rendered in Russell v. The Queen[51], that law would extend its influence, and its effect, over the whole Dominion. But supposing that two or three provinces of the Dominion, by concentrating the votes of their representatives in Parliament, were to secure the repeal of the whole of that legislation, would the province where the former legislation had passed be deprived of the expression of the will of the people, having perhaps, in the Dominion Parliament, through its representatives voted against a repeal of the law? Would not that law which already was on the statute-book, which remained dormant, just as the by-law I have referred to in the Dunkin Act, not revive again, in so far as the local matters of that province were concerned? I contend that it would, and that no logical reason can be advanced to the contrary.\nDealing now for one moment again with the question of concurrent jurisdiction, which my learned friends here scout, I think that looking not only at the British North America Act, but at the judgments that have been rendered, that over and over again it has been held, as it must be, that there are special powers confided to each, and concurrent powers, and that sometimes the exercise of one power must over-ride the other. I will just refer your lordship to a case of Cote v. Paradis, in the Court of Queen's Bench (Quebec)[52], in 1881, and what was there held.\nThen what has happened in our own country? When the insolvency legislation which began under the Abbott Act was all swept away, some time about 1878, I think, the provincial legislation revived, and has been in force ever since, and has been changed and modified from time to time by the province of Quebec and other provinces.\nIn conclusion, I will remark that the learned counsel for the brewers and distillers, whom I have listened to with a good deal of attention, and who have certainly put a great deal of learning into their arguments, have put this difficulty before the court:\u2014They say, look at the effect upon the revenue; look at the provisions which were made by the British North America Act, and the obligations that were entered into upon one side and the other. Are they to be upset by prohibitory legislation, such as it is said the provinces have a right to pass? It would prohibit the right of the Dominion to levy money, and where are the funds to come from to meet these obligations they have contracted towards the provinces? All that, no doubt, presents a difficulty, but it is not one that can influence this court for one moment, because, if the Dominion were to exercise the power which these learned gentlemen say it undoubtedly has, of passing the general prohibitory law, which we all admit it has, to strike out the manufacture, the importation, and sale generally of intoxicating liquors, that would interfere with the right of the provinces to levy, by way of license, and so forth, direct taxation. But that would have simply to go by the board. New arrangements would have to be made by the legislatures and parliament. They would have to face a new state of affairs. That, I contend, is no argument at all, and cannot affect for one moment the principle that is at stake in this discussion. And if the legislature cripples to some extent the Dominion, the Dominion on the other hand, by exercising its still larger power, may destroy, to a very great extent, and perhaps entirely, the principal source of revenue of the province. That being the case, the people of Canada, through their representatives having exercised their indubitable right, those who are charged with the administration of public affairs as statesmen will have to face the new difficulty, and solve it, as they have other things in the past.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE\u2014My reasons for the foregoing answers will appear from my judgment in Huson v. South Norwich[53]. I have only to add that I do not think any statutory definition of the terms \"wholesale\" and \"retail\" is requisite, but if legislation is required for such purpose it is vested in the Dominion as appertaining to the regulation of trade and commerce.\nI answer the third and fourth questions in the negative, because the prohibition of manufacture and importation would affect trade and commerce, and so must belong to the Dominion; and further, for the reason that prohibition to that extent would affect the revenue of the Dominion derived from the customs and excise duties\nFOURNIER J.\u2014I concur in the conclusions arrived at by the Chief Justice of this court, and adopt his answers to the seven questions submitted.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014[After stating the questions submitted His Lordship proceeded as follows:]\nIn construing the language of the British North America Act of 1867 defining the jurisdiction of the Dominion Parliament and of the provincial legislatures we must never lose sight of the fact that this language is that of the resolutions adopted in 1861 by the provincial statesmen assembled in Quebec by the authority of Her Most Gracious Majesty for the purpose of framing the provisions of a constitution for federally uniting the British North American provinces into one government under the British Crown and that the British North America Act was passed merely for the purpose of giving legislative form to the terms and provisions of a treaty of union between the respective provinces forming the confederation and the Imperial Government, as such terms and provisions are expressed in the resolutions adopted by the framers of the constitution and by the respective legislatures of the provinces of Canada, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, and by the Imperial Government. So likewise must we keep ever present to our minds the fact that the main object of these provincial statesmen, who were the authors and founders of our new constitution, in framing their project of confederation, was to devise a scheme by which the best features of the constitution of the United States of America, rejecting the bad should be grafted upon the British constitution; and to vest in the provincial legislatures exclusive jurisdiction over all matters of a purely provincial, local, municipal and domestic character, and in the general or central legislature exclusive jurisdiction over all matters in which, as being of a general, quasi-national and sovereign character, the inhabitants of the several provinces might be said to have a common interest distinct from the particular interest they would have in matters affecting the local, municipal and domestic affairs of the particular province in which each should reside.\nThat this was the main design of the scheme of confederation proposed by the framers of our constitution, and as intended by the resolutions adopted by them, is abundantly apparent from the speeches accompanying the submission of the resolutions to the legislatures of the provinces for their adoption. The late Sir John Macdonald, the chief of the provincial statesmen engaged in framing the resolutions, when presenting them to the legislature of the province of Canada for their adoption, says:\nWe must consider the scheme in the light of a treaty; the whole scheme of confederation, as propounded by the conference, as agreed to and sanctioned by the Canadian government, and as now presented for the consideration of the people and the legislature, bears upon its face the marks of compromise.\nAnd again:\nIn the proposed constitution all matters of general interest are to be dealt with by the general legislature, while the local legislatures will deal with matters of local interest.\nAgain, referring to the constitution of the United Sites of America, he says:\nWe can now take advantage of the experience of the last seventy-eight years during which the constitution of the United States has existed, and I am strongly of opinion that we have in a great measure avoided in this system which we propose for the adoption of the people of Canada the defects which time and events have shewn to exist in the American constitution.\nAnd again:\nWe have strengthened the general government, we have given the general legislature all the great subjects of legislation, we have conferred on them not only specifically and in detail all the powers which are incident to sovereignty but we have expressly declared that all subjects of general interest not distinctly and exclusively conferred upon the local government and local legislatures shall be conferred upon the general government and legislature.\nAnd again:\nI shall not detain the House by entering into a consideration at any length of the different powers conferred upon the general Parliament as contra-distinguished from those reserved to the local legislatures, but any honorable member in examining the list of different subjects which are to be assigned to the general and local legislatures respectively will see that all the great questions which affect the general interests of the confederacy as a whole are confided to the Federal Parliament while the local interests and local laws of each section are entrusted to the care of the local legislatures. The late Mr. George Brown, then president of the executive council of the province of Canada, and also one of the delegates who framed the constitution, said:\nAll matters of trade and commerce, banking and currency and all questions common to the whole people we have vested fully and unrestrictedly in the general government.\nAnd again:\nThe crown authorized us specially to make this compact and has heartily approved of what we did.\nAnd he ascribed the terms of the scheme of confederation as embodied in the resolutions to Lord Durham's report wherein he suggested a union of the provinces\nupon a plan of local government by elective bodies subordinate to the general legislature and exercising complete control over such local matters as do not come within the province of general legislation, and that a general executive upon an improved principle should be established, together with a supreme court of appeal for all the North American colonies.\nAnd again he said that:\nNo higher eulogy could be pronounced upon the scheme produced than that which he had heard from one of the foremost of British statesmen, namely, that the system of government which we propose seemed to him a happy compound of the best features of the British and American constitutions.\nSir Geo. Etienne Cartier, then Attorney General of Canada East and another of the framers of the constitution for the proposed confederacy, said as to the proposed scheme in advocacy of its adoption by the Canadian legislature:\nQuestions of commerce, of international communication and all matters of general interest would be discussed and determined in the general legislature.\nAnd again he said that in all their proceedings the framers of the constitution had the approbation of the Imperial Government, and in fine he said:\nI have already declared in my own name and on behalf of the Government that all the delegates who go to England will accept from. the Imperial Government no act but one based upon the resolutions if adopted by the House and will not bring back any other.\nThe resolutions having been adopted by the legislatures of Canada, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick were transmitted to the Imperial Government and at the request of that Government a conference was held upon them in England between delegates from those provinces and the Imperial Government at which conference the resolutions were adopted almost verbatim, with a slight modification as to the power of the executive government of the confederacy introduced at the suggestion of the Imperial Government for the purpose of still further strengthening the central executive of the proposed confederacy, such modification consisting in expunging the 44th resolution which proposed to vest in the provincial executive the power of pardon of criminal offences, as to which resolution Sir John Macdonald had said, when submitting the resolutions to the Canadian legislature, that this was a subject of imperial interest and that if the Imperial Government should not be convinced by the argument they would be able to press upon them for the continuance of the clause (the 44th resolution) they could, of course, as the overruling power, set it aside;\u2014accordingly at the conference in England it was, with the assent of the provincial delegates, set aside and expunged, and that power of pardon was vested in the central or general government and in other respects the language of the resolutions was not only substantially but almost verbatim et literatim embodied in a bill agreed upon by the provincial delegates and the Imperial Government as the bill to be presented to parliament to be passed into an Act.\nIn Her Majesty's address to both houses upon the opening of parliament in February, 1867, she was pleased to refer to the proposed scheme of confederation in the following manner:\u2014\nResolutions in favour of a more intimate union of the provinces of Canada, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick have been passed in their several legislatures and delegates duly authorised and representing all classes of colonial parties and opinion have concurred in the conditions upon which such a union may be best effected. In accordance with their wishes a bill will be submitted to you which by the consolidation of colonial interests and resources will give strength to the several provinces as members of the same empire, and animated by feelings of loyalty to the same sovereign.\nLord Carnarvon, then colonial minister, in presenting this bill to Parliament, explained its intent and purpose, saying, among other things, with reference to the said resolutions, that they, with some slight changes, formed the basis of the measure he was submitting to Parliament; that to those resolutions all the British provinces in North America were consenting parties, and that the measure founded upon them must be accepted as a treaty of union. Then, referring to the distribution of powers, he said:\nI now pass to that which is perhaps the most delicate and most important part of this measure, the distribution of powers between the central government and the local authorities; in this I think is comprised the main theory and constitution of federal government; on this depends the principal working of the new system.\nAnd again:\nThe real object which we have in view is to give to the central government those high functions and almost sovereign powers by which general principles and uniformity of legislation may be secured in those questions that are of common import to all the provinces, and at the same time to retain for each province such an ample measure of municipal liberty and self-government as will allow, and indeed compel, them to exercise those local powers which they can exercise with great advantage to the community.\nAnd again:\nIn this bill the division of powers has been mainly effected by a distinct classification; that classification is four-fold: 1st. Those subjects of legislation which are attributed to the central parliament exclusively; 2nd. Those which belong to the provincial legislatures exclusively; 3rd. Those which are the subject of concurrent legislation; and 4th. A particular subject which is dealt with exceptionally.\nThen, as to the subjects of concurrent jurisdiction, he says:\nThere is as I have said a concurrent power of legislation to be exercised by the central and the local parliaments. It extends over three separate subjects\u2014immigration, agriculture and public works.\nThen in reply to a question asked by a noble lord,\nwhether by the terms of arrangement that had been come to, Parliament was precluded from making any alteration in the terms of the bill?\nHe said that:\nIt was of course within the competence of parliament to alter the provisions of the bill, but he should be glad for the House to understand that the bill partook somewhat of the nature of a treaty of union, every single clause of which had been debated over and over again and had been submitted to the closest scrutiny, and in fact as each of them represented a compromise between the different interests involved, nothing could be more fatal to the bill than that any of those clauses which were the subject of compromise should be subject to such alteration; that of course there might be alterations which were not material and which did not go to the essence of the measure and he would be quite ready to consider any amendments that might be proposed in Committee, but that it would be his duty to resist the alteration of anything which was in the nature of a compromise, and which if carried would be fatal to the measure.\nAccordingly the bill was passed as introduced, without any alteration whatever, as the British North America Act of 1867.\nFrom the above extracts it is apparent that that Act is but the reduction into legislative form of a treaty, after the fullest deliberation previously agreed upon between the provincial statesmen who where the originators and framers of the scheme of confederation contained therein and Her Majesty's Imperial Government, and such being the history of the origin of the scheme and of the treaty of union and of its embodiment in an Act of Parliament, when a question should arise which should create any doubt as to whether a particular subject of legislation comes within any of the items enumerated in section 92, and so under the exclusive jurisdiction of the provincial legislatures, or within section 91 and so under the exclusive jurisdiction of the Dominion Parliament, the doubt must be solved by endeavouring to ascertain the intention of the framers of the scheme and the parties to such treaty. From the above extracts it is also apparent that the essential feature of the scheme of confederation was that the legislative jurisdiction conferred upon the central and provincial legislatures respectively should be exclusive upon all subjects placed under the jurisdiction of each, save only the three subjects which were made the subjects of concurrent jurisdiction; and that such exclusive jurisdiction conferred upon the central legislature, that is to say, the Dominion Parliament, extended over all matters of a quasi national and sovereign character and over all matters of common import and general interest, which affect the general interests of the confederacy as a whole, that is to say, over all matters in which the people of the confederacy as a whole may be said to have a common interest; and that the exclusive jurisdiction of the provincial legislatures was restricted to matters of a merely private, provincial, municipal and domestic character, all of which matters are comprehended in the subjects enumerated in the several items in section 92 of the Act, which under the heading \"Exclusive Powers of Provincial Legislatures\" declares that:\nIn each Province the Legislature may exclusively make laws in relation to the matters coming within the classes of subjects hereinafter enumerated. Then follow sixteen items, every one of which can with the utmost propriety be said to relate to subjects of a purely local, private, provincial, municipal and domestic character. But by section 91, it is declared that:\nIt shall be lawful for the Queen by and with the advice and consent of the Senate and House of Commons to make laws for the peace, order and good government of Canada in relation to all matters not coming within the classes of subjects by this act assigned exclusively to the legislatures of the provinces, and for greater certainty but not so as to restrict the generality of the foregoing terms it is hereby declared that, notwithstanding anything in this act, the exclusive legislative authority of the Parliament of Canada extends to all matters coming within the classes of subjects next hereinafter enumerated, that is to say.\nThen follow twenty-nine items, the second of which is:\nThe regulation of trade and commerce.\nThe section then closes with this provision:\nAnd any matter coming within any of the classes of subjects enumerated in this section shall not be deemed to come within the class of matters of a local or private nature comprised in the enumeration of the classes of subjects by this Act assigned exclusively to the legislatures of the provinces.\nIt has been sometimes, and still is by some, suggested that this provision refers grammatically only to item 16 of sec. 92; but this is a too critical construction of the Act, for what the enactment plainly says is that any matter coming within any of the classes of subjects enumerated in sec. 92 shall not be deemed to come within the class of matters of a local or private nature comprised in the enumeration of the classes of subjects by this Act exclusively assigned to the legislatures of the provinces, thus, as I submit\u2014and if I may be permitted the expression\u2014explicitly implying that, as the fact in truth appears to me to be, all the matters exclusively assigned to the provincial legislatures by the enumeration contained in section 92 were (within the intent of the framers of the scheme of confederation and so within the meaning of the British North America Act, 1867) of a purely local and private nature, that is to say, of a purely provincial, municipal and domestic character\u2014as distinguished from matters of common import and general interest to the people of the confederacy as a whole. The true effect of this provision in section 91 is plainly, as it appears to me, to give expressly to the Dominion Parliament, for the purpose of exclusive legislation upon all matters coming within the several subjects enumerated in section 91, legislative power, if required, over all of the subjects enumerated in the 16 items of section 92, every one of which relates to matters of a purely provincial, municipal, private or domestic character, that is to say, \"of a local and private nature,\" so that legislation by the Parliament upon any of the subjects comprehended within any of the items enumerated in section 91 may be complete and effectual notwithstanding that for such purpose interference with some or one of the subjects comprehended in the enumeration of subjects in section 92 should be necessary, and such interference by the Dominion Parliament with any of the subjects enumerated in section 92 shall not be deemed to be an encroachment upon or interference with the legislative powers conferred upon the provincial legislatures.\nNow according to the canons of construction as laid down by this court in Fredericton v. The Queen[54] and by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in Russell v. The Queen[55] (between which I do not find there is any substantial difference) if the jurisdiction to prohibit absolutely the carrying on of the trades under consideration, or of any trade, whether by retail or wholesale, is not comprised in some or one of the items enumerated in sec. 92 of the act the provincial legislatures have no such jurisdiction, but the same is expressly and exclusively vested in the Dominion Parliament; and even though a particular subject of legislation may be capable of being construed to come within sec. 92 reading that section by itself still if that subject comes within any of the items enumerated in sec. 91 it is taken out of the operation of sec. 92 which in such case is to be construed as not comprehending such subject.\nNow the several questions in the case submitted to us are resolvable into this one, namely: Is jurisdiction to prohibit absolutely the manufacture in any province of the Dominion of Canada, or the importation into the province, or the sale therein either by wholesale or retail, of spirituous, fermented or other intoxicating liquors vested in the Dominion Parliament or in the legislatures of the respective provinces? In Fredericton v. The Queen[56] this question directly arose and the judgment of this court therein proceeded upon two grounds. 1st, that the provincial legislature had no jurisdiction over any subject matter not coming within some or one of the classes of subjects specially enumerated in sec. 92 of the Act and that upon principle and the authority of the judgment of the Supreme Court of the province of New Brunswick in the Queen v. The Justices of King's County[57], which judgment this court approved of and affirmed, the subject of absolute prohibition of the sale of intoxicating liquors (such being the character and purpose of the Act then under consideration) did not come within any of the classes of subjects particularly enumerated in, and contemplated by, sea 92 as being placed under the jurisdiction of the provincial legislatures; and 2nd, that jurisdiction over such subject, that is to say, absolute prohibition of the trade in intoxicating liquors was expressively and exclusively conferred upon the Dominion Parliament by the 91st sec, item no. 2. In Russell v. The Queen[58], wherein the same question arose as in Fredericton v. The Queen,[59] the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, while proceeding wholly upon the first of the above grounds, guard themselves from being considered as dissenting from the second ground, upon which this court proceeded in Fredericton v. The Queen (2), as follows:\nTheir Lordships having come to the conclusion that the act in question does not fall within any of the classes of subjects assigned exclusively to the provincial legislature, it becomes unnecessary to discuss the further question whether its provisions also fall within any of the classes of subjects enumerated in section 91. In abstaining from this discussion, they must not be understood as intimating any dissent from the opinion of the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Canada and the other judges who held that the act, as a general regulation of the traffic in intoxicating liquors throughout the Dominion, fell within the class of subjects \"the regulation of trade and commerce\" enumerated in that section, and was on that ground a valid exercise of the legislative power of the Parliament of Canada.\nIt has, however, frequently been and still is contended by some, but in my opinion without any sufficient grounds, that there are passages in some of the judgments of their Lordships of the Privy Council upon the construction of the British North America Act, 1867, which tend to the conclusion that the judgment of this court in Fredericton v. The Queen (2) cannot be sustained upon the second of the above grounds upon which this court proceeded, namely, that the Act under consideration there being for the absolute prohibition of the trade in intoxicating liquors (although by adoption of the principle of local option) was within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Dominion Parliament under sec. 91 item no. 2 of the British North America Act which enacts that \"notwithstanding anything in the Act the exclusive legislative authority of the parliament of Canada extends over all matters coming within,\" among other items, that of \"the regulation of trade and commerce.\"\nIt is true that their Lordships of the Privy Council in the Citizens Insurance Company v. Parsons[60] upon a very different subject from that of prohibition of the exercise of the trade in intoxicating liquors threw out merely the suggestion that possibly the expression \"the regulation of trade and commerce\" in item no. 2 of sec. 91 may have been used in some such sense as the words \"regulations of trade\" in the Act of Union between England and Scotland[61], and as those words in the Acts of state relating to trade and commerce, but in construing expressions used in the British North America Act, 1867, we must never, as I have already observed, lose sight of the fact that those expressions are but the embodiment of the terms and provisions of the treaty prepared by the provincial statesmen asembled at Quebec by authority of Her Majesty the Queen, and concurred in by Her Majesty's Imperial Government, for the purpose of federally uniting the British North American provinces into one government, and we must always keep prominently present to our minds that the object of the framers of our constitution in framing its terms and provisions was, as abundantly appears from the above extracted passages from their speeches, to adopt the best features of the constitution of the United States of America, the only federal constitution with which they were familiar, and to which they would naturally look for light as to what they should adopt and what alter or reject, when engaged in the task of distributing the legislative powers between the Dominion Parliament and the legislatures of the confederated provinces. Contemplating, as they were, the engrafting of what they considered the best features of the constitution of the United States of America upon the British constitution, for the purpose of framing a federal constitution for the union of the British North American provinces into a confederacy under one central government, it is, to my mind, with great deference I say it, altogether inconceivable that the framers of our constitution should have had present to their minds the Act of Anne, or any act of state of the Imperial Government; neither the one nor the other of these could be expected to throw any light upon the subject in which they were engaged, namely, the distribution of legislative powers between the central or Dominion Parliament and the legislatures of the provinces of the proposed confederacy, while, on the contrary, it was quite natural and to be expected that they should have had constantly present to their minds the constitution of the United States of America, the best features of which they desired to adopt, and to alter or reject those which did not seem to them to be desirable to be adopted. We must therefore, I submit, be excused if we confidently affirm that in making provision for the distribution of legislative powers between the Dominion Parliament and the legislatures of the confederated provinces, and in such distribution making provision that the Dominion Parliament should have exclusive jurisdiction in all matters coming within \"the regulation of trade and commerce\" in item no. 2 of sec. 91, neither was the Act of Union between England and Scotland, nor any Act of state of the Imperial Government relating to trade and commerce, ever present to the minds of the framers of our constitution, but that what in fact was so present was the constitution of the United States of America, the best features in which they were engaged in grafting upon the British constitution for the purpose of forming a new and more perfect constitution for the proposed confederacy of the British North American provinces; and that what they intended by the particular expression under consideration was to place \"fully and unrestrictedly\" (to use the language of the late Mr. George Brown above extracted), unlimited and exclusive jurisdiction in the Dominion Parliament over all matters of trade and commerce in every part of the Dominion, and that what they had in view in so doing was to strengthen the central parliament and to effect thereby an improvement in the constitution of the proposed confederacy over that of the United States of America, the central legislature of which has jurisdiction only over interstate trade and commerce and that with foreign countries. If the framers of our constitution had contemplated conferring upon the Dominion Parliament only such a limited jurisdiction as that possessed by the Congress of the United States they would have had no difficulty, and doubtless would not have failed, in so expressing themselves; on the contrary the language they have used is of a most unlimited character and exhibits no intention of having such a limited construction. No argument in favour of such a limited construction can, I submit, be fairly drawn from the fact that jurisdiction is independently given by items 15, 18 and 19 of section 91, over banking, bills of exchange, interest and the like, which may be said to be matters coming within the classes of subjects coming under the terms \"trade and commerce\" for this repetition of powers involved in the enumeration of items appears to have been inserted for greater certainty, and there is, I think, an intention sufficiently manifested on the face of the Act, that the enumeration of particulars should not be construed so as to limit and restrict the operation and construction of general terms in which the particulars may be included.\nThen it was contended that a passage in the judgment of the Privy Council in Hodge v. The Queen[62] is in favour of the contention that the jurisdiction to declare that the trades of manufacturing and that of importing and that of selling intoxicating liquor shall be illegal and shall not be carried on, is vested in the provincial legislatures under sec. 92. If it be, it must be, under the express terms of the Act, exclusively so vested.\nNow the passage relied upon in support of this contention is that wherein their Lordships say\nthat the principle established by their judgment in the Citizens Insurance Co. v. Parsons and Russell v. The Queen is that subjects which in one aspect and for one purpose fall within sec. 92 may in another aspect and for another purpose fall within sec. 91\nWhat this passage conveys simply is that a particular subject matter may have two aspects in which it may be viewed and that viewed in one of such aspects jurisdiction over it may be exclusively vested in the provincial legislatures under sec. 92, and that viewed in the other of such aspects jurisdiction over it may be exclusively vested in the Dominion Parliament, and what I understand their Lordships by that passage to say is that for the purpose of determining whether a particular subject having two aspects in which it may be viewed comes under sec. 91 or sec. 92 regard must be had to the aspect in which the particular subject, for the time being under consideration, is to be viewed, not that a subject which according to the true construction of sec. 91 comes within one of the classes of subjects there enumerated and which is therefore under the exclusive jurisdiction of the Dominion Parliament, by the express terms of this section, can, nevertheless, by force of section 92, be under the jurisdiction of provincial legislatures. What is the true construction of the term \"the regulation of trade and commerce,\" as used in section 91, item 2, is a matter which of course is fairly open to argument, and is to be determined, in my opinion, for the reasons already given, by ascertaining the intent of the framers of our constitution, which intent is, in my opinion, as I have above stated; but once it is determined that a particular subject under consideration does come within that term, the jurisdiction over it is vested exclusively in the Dominion Parliament, and being so, cannot be legislated upon by a provincial legislature. There is no concurrent jurisdiction given to both, save only over the three subjects specially designated as subject to concurrent jurisdiction.\nThe subject which we have now under consideration is the right of absolutely prohibiting the carrying on of the trades of manufacturing, importing and selling spirituous liquors, the right, in fact, of declaring by legislative authority that these trades, or some or one of them, shall not be carried on; that the carrying of them on shall be absolutely unlawful. This subject does not admit of two aspects. Between pronouncing the carrying on of a particular trade to be absolutely unlawful, and prescribing the manner in which, and the persons by whom, that trade, being lawful, shall be carried on, there is a vast difference. Fredericton v. The Queen[63] and Russell v. The Queen[64] are cases dealing with the former of such subjects, and Hodge v. The Queen[65] and Suite v. Three Rivers[66] are cases dealing with the latter. In Fredericton v. The Queen (1) and Russell v. The Queen (2) the question was as to jurisdiction in the case of prohibition. In the former of those cases this court held that the provincial legislatures had had not under section 92 any jurisdiction to pass the Act then under consideration, the purpose of which was to legislate upon that subject; and that by force of section 91, item 2, the Dominion Parliament had expressly exclusive jurisdiction to pass it. In Russell v. The Queen their Lordships of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, while expressing no opinion as to the applicability of section 91, item 2, held that there was nothing in section 92, conferring on the provincial legislatures jurisdiction to pass the Act in question, the sole purpose of which was in relation to the absolute prohibition of the trade. In Hodge v. The Queen on the other hand they held that the provincial legislatures had exclusive jurisdiction over the regulation of the manner in which and the persons by whom the trade, being a lawful one, might be carried on, a subject matter as different as it is possible to conceive from jurisdiction legislatively to declare the carrying on of the trade to be absolutely unlawful. Here then we have an illustration of the application of the language of their Lordships in the passage above extracted from their judgment in Hodge v. The Queen, namely, if we regard the traffic in intoxicating liquor, in the aspect of total jurisdiction of the carrying on of the trade, that is to say, eliminating it from the category of lawful trades, in that aspect the jurisdiction is exclusively in the Dominion Parliament; but if we regard it in the aspect of regulating the manner in which and the persons by whom the trade, being a lawful one, may be carried on in a particular province, or a particular locality of a province, that is a subject exclusively within the jurisdiction of the provincial legislatures. Between the judgments in these cases there is no contradiction, nor have I been able to see in any of the judgments of their Lordships of the Privy Council anything which can be said to manifest judicial dissent from either of the grounds upon which the judgment of this court in Fredericton v. The Queen[67] proceeded. It seems however to be a matter of no importance whether the question, as to where is vested jurisdiction over total prohibition of the trade, is rested upon both of the grounds upon which this court proceeded in Fredericton v. The Queen (1) or upon the single ground upon which their Lordships of the Privy Council proceeded in Russell v. The Queen[68]. The report of the proceedings in the Privy Council of the case of the Liquor License Acts of the Dominion Parliament of 1883 and 1884 which has been laid before us as part of the present case contains observations of their Lordships recognizing the distinction, which I confess to my mind appears very plain, between the right to prohibit the carrying on of a particular trade and so to destroy it and deprive it of lawful existence and the right to regulate the manner in which and the persons by whom the trade, being a lawfully existing one, shall be carried on. Sir Montague Smith there in the course of the argument of counsel said:\nThe distinction, if it be one, between the Act in Russell v. The Queen (1) and this Act (the Act of 1883 then under consideration) is that that (in Russell v. The Queen (2)) was a prohibition Act applying to the whole of the Dominion regardless of what had been done and prohibiting the liquor traffic. I do not wish to say how it is but the question is whether this (the Act of 1883) is not, whatever terms it may use in the preamble, really regulating in each province the local traffic.\nAnd again:\nof course you must look at every Act and see what is the scope and object and purpose of it. This (the Act of 1883) is not really to prohibit but it is to limit.\nAnd again:\nthe main object of the Act is not to prevent the liquor traffic but to regulate it. And again:\nto my mind there is a distinction between the two Acts\nthat is to say between the prohibition Act under consideration in Russell v. The Queen, and the Dominion Liquor License Act of 1883 which was but a regulating Act. The fact that the latter Act applied to the whole Dominion made no difference for it may, I think, be said to be obvious that the Dominion Parliament never could acquire jurisdiction over a subject matter placed by sec. 92 under the exclusive jurisdiction of the provincial legislatures by assuming to legislate upon such subject for the whole Dominion. So neither could a provincial legislature acquire jurisdiction over a subject coming within any one of the classes of subjects enumerated in sec. 91 by restricting the application of an Act of the provincial legislature upon such subject to the limits of the province.\nBut it is argued that neither in Fredericton v. The Queen nor in Russell v. The Queen was the item no. 8 of sec. 92 referred to or considered and that therefore their Lordships' judgment in Russell v. The Queen and that of this court in Fredericton v. The Queen are open to review upon the question of prohibition now under consideration. From the fact that this item was not relied upon in those cases it may fairly be inferred that it never was considered by the courts or the bar to be applicable. The jurisdiction conferred by that item seems to be, that of establishing and maintaining municipal institutions. When the framers of our constitution were conferring upon the provincial legislatures exclusive jurisdiction to make laws in relation to \"municipal institutions in the province,\" they had no doubt in view municipal institutions such as existed at the time of confederation, but this item no. 8 sec. 92 says nothing as to the powers with which such municipal institutions may be invested; that seems to have been left to the discretion of the provincial legislatures to be exercised within the limits of their own jurisdiction and would reasonably comprehend within such limits all such powers as were then possessed by such municipalities and which were essentially necessary to the good working of such institutions or had always been possessed by all such institutions, as for example the power of issuing licenses to the persons to be engaged in the traffic in intoxicating liquors and the power of regulating the manner in which such persons should carry on the trade in shops, saloons, hotels or taverns, which as being matters of purely provincial, municipal and domestic character were subject to, jurisdiction over which was intended to be exclusively vested in, the provincial legislatures; and this is what Suite v. Three Rivers decides and what was intended to be conveyed by the passage from my judgment in that case which was cited by the learned counsel who argued the present case upon behalf of the province of Ontario; but a special power only then recently for the first time conferred upon municipalities in the province of Canada and which had never been conferred upon municipalities in any of the other provinces could never be said to be a power essentially necessary to the good working of such institutions; such power therefore cannot be held to be comprehended in item 8 of that section.\nIn this subject is involved the particular consideration of the last of the questions submitted to us, namely, whether the 18th section of the Act of the legislature of Ontario. 53 Vic. chap. 56, is or is not ultra vires. The jurisdiction assumed to be exercised by the Ontario legislature in this section is not a jurisdiction which is claimed to be conferred upon provincial legislaures by anything expressed in section 92 of the British North America Act, but a jurisdiction which it is contended is impliedly vested in the Ontario Legislature, arising from the fact that municipalities in the late province of Canada had at the time of confederation, by virtue of special Acts of the legislature of that province, power to prohibit, by by-laws to be passed and adopted in the manner prescribed by the special Act, the sale by retail of spirituous liquors within the limits of the municipality passing such by-laws, a power which was not possessed by municipalities in the province of Nova Scotia or in that of New Brunswick, and such Acts being repealed it is contended that the legislature of Ontario has jurisdiction to revive their provisions. That the legislature of the late province of Canada had jurisdiction to pass an Act in prohibition of all traffic in intoxicating liquors or in any other article of trade may be admitted to be unquestionable, but I apprehend it cannot admit of doubt that unless the provincial legislatures have, all of them, under their new constitution, jurisdiction to pass an act de novo for the purpose of prohibiting absolutely within their respective provinces the sale of intoxicating liquors, the legislature of Ontario has no special jurisdiction to invest municipalities with such a power by passing an Act purporting to revive the provisions of an Act passed by the legislature of the late province of Canada within its jurisdiction, and which conferred such a power upon municipalities of the said late province of Canada. The question therefore involved in the seventh question is precisely the same as that involved in the first and subsequent questions, namely: Have provincial legislatures of the confederacy, under their new constitution, jurisdiction to make laws in prohibition of the trades of manufacturing, of importing or of selling spirituous liquors by wholesale or by retail? The precise history of the legislation recited in the 18th sec. of the Ontario Act 53 Vic. ch. 56 and upon which the legislature of the province rest the jurisdiction assumed by them in enacting the provisions of that section is as follows: The legislature of the late province of Canada by a special Act passed in 1864, 27 & 28 Vic ch. 18, conferred power upon the councils of municipalities to pass by-laws in prohibition of the sale of intoxicating liquors within the limits of the municipality, subject to certain conditions involving the adoption of the principle of what is called local option. The provisions of the said Act 27 & 28 Vic ch. 18 were consolidated in 1866 as sec. 249 subsec. 9 of the consolidated Municipal Act, viz., 29 & 30 Vic ch. 51. The whole of this section 249 was expressly repealed by an Act of the Ontario Legislature passed in 1869, 32 Vic. ch. 32, but its terms were, either inadvertently or by design, repeated in subsec 7 of sec. 6 of the latter act. In 1874 the legislature of Ontario passed another Act 37 Vic ch. 32 intituled \"An Act to amend and consolidate the law for the sale of fermented and spirituous liquors,\" and thereby the said Act 32 Vic ch. 32, and another Act 32 Vict. ch. 28, and also an Act 36 Vic ch. 48 intituled \"An Act to amend the Acts respecting tavern and shop licenses\" were wholly repealed and new provisions were enacted, but among such provisions there was nothing of the nature of the provisions which had been in subsec. 7 of sec 6 of the repealed Act 32 Vic ch. 32, but in lieu thereof provision was made for regulating the issue of licenses for the sale of intoxicating liquors in each municipality by an officer to be appointed by the lieutenant governor to be called \"the issuer of licenses.\"\nNow, upon and from and after the passing of this Act, the only authority, if any there was, which municipalities in the province of Ontario had, or could claim to have, to pass a by-law in prohibition of the sale of intoxicating liquors was in virtue of the provisions of the above recited Act of the legislature of the late province of Canada, 27 & 28 Vic. ch. 18, of 1864, and of sec. 129 of the British North America Act, 1867, which enacted that:\nExcept as otherwise provided by this Act, all laws in force in Canada, Nova Scotia or New Brunswick at the union, &c., shall continue in Ontario, Quebec, Nova Scotia or New Brunswick respectively, as if the union had not been made, subject nevertheless, except with respect to such as are enacted by, or exist under, Acts of the Parliament of Great Britain, or of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, to be repealed, abolished or altered by the Parliament of Canada or by the legislatures of the respective provinces, according to the authority of the Parliament and of the legislatures under this act.\nIt being then only in virtue of this Act, 27 & 28 Vic. ch. 18, that municipalities in the province of Ontario possessed, if they possessed, the power to pass by-laws in prohibition of the sale of intoxicating liquors, such power must necessarily absolutely cease upon the repeal of that Act. But in 1878 the Dominion Parliament, regarding the prohibition of the sale of intoxicating liquors to be a subject over which exclusive jurisdiction was conferred upon the Parliament and in exercise of the right reserved to parliament by said sec. 129 of the British North America Act, passed the Canada Temperance Act of 1878, whereby, as is recited in the said 18th section of the Ontario Act, 53 Vic. ch. 56, the above Act of 1864, 27 & 28 Vic. ch. 18, was absolutely repealed, save as regards localities where the Act had then already been acted upon, and power is conferred by the Act of 1878 upon all electors in every municipality in every province of the Dominion qualified and competent to vote at the election of members of the House of Commons, upon certain conditions, and in adoption of the principle of local option, to prohibit the sale of intoxicating liquors in every municipality adopting the provisions of the Act. This Act, as an Act of prohibition, has been held by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in England in Russell v. The Queen[69], and by this court in Fredericton v. The Queen[70], to have been within the jurisdiction of the Dominion Parliament and not to have been within the jurisdiction of a provincial legislature; the object sought to be attained by the said 18th section of the Ontario statute 53 Vic. chap. 56, would seem to be to re-open the question adjudicated upon in those cases, and mainly upon the suggestion that item 8 of section 92 of the British North America Act was not considered by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council or by this court in those cases. In my opinion there is nothing in this item no. 8 of section 92 or in any part of the British North America Act which calls for or justifies any qualification of the language of their Lordships of the Privy Council as above cited from their judgment in Russell v. The Queen (1); and the principle established by that judgment is, in my opinion, that jurisdiction over the prohibition of the trade in intoxicating liquors, whether it be in the manufacture thereof, or the importation thereof or the sale thereof either by wholesale or retail, is not vested in the provincial legislatures, but is exclusively vested in the Dominion Parliament. If the provincial legislatures have jurisdiction to prohibit absolutely the sale of intoxicating liquors it must, I think, be admitted that they have like jurisdiction over the manufacturing, and also over the importation thereof; may more, as the act gives them no more jurisdiction over the prohibition of the exercise of one trade than of another they would equally have jurisdiction to prohibit the manufacture of tobacco, cigars, &c., the importation of opium, and the manufacture, importation and sale of any other article of trade, and so in fact they would have that sovereign legislative jurisdiction over every trade, and over those general subjects in which the people of the confederacy as a whole are interested, and thus the main object which the authors and founders of the confederacy had in view in framing the terms and provisions of our constitution as to the distribution of legislative jurisdiction between the Dominion Parliament and the legislatures of the provinces would be defeated. In addition to the ground upon which their Lordships of the Privy Council proceeded in Russell v. The Queen[71], this court held, as already observed, in Fredericton v. The Queen[72] that exclusive jurisdiction over the prohibition of the sale of spirituous liquors which was the subject matter of legislation in the Canada Temperance Act of 1878 was a subject placed expressly under the exclusive jurisdiction of the Dominion Parliament by sec. 91, item 2, of the British North America Act. That judgment has never been reversed, nor, in my opinion, shaken, and while it stands unreversed by superior authority I consider this court to be bound by it. If ever it should be reversed it will in my opinion be a matter of deep regret, as defeating the plain intent of the framers of our constitution and imperilling the success of the scheme of confederation.\nUpon the whole then, in answer to the several questions submitted to us I am, for the reasons above stated, of the opinion that upon principle\u2014that is to say upon the true, construction of the British North America Act, 1867, apart from all authority\u2014and upon authority that is to say upon the authority of the judgment of the Privy Council in Russell v. The Queen (1) apart from Fredericton v. The Queen[73] and upon the authority of the judgment of this Court in Fredericton v. The Queen (1) apart from Russell v. The Queen[74], the several questions submitted to us in this case must be all answered in the negative.\nSEDGEWICK j.\u2014A study of sections 91 and 92 of the British North America Act leads one to the conclusion that the following proposition may be safely adopted as a canon of construction, viz.:\u2014\nWhen a general subject is assigned to one legislature, whether federal or provincial, and a particular subject, forming part or carved out of that general subject, is assigned to the other legislature, the exclusive right of legislation, in respect to the particular subject, is with the latter legislature. For example, Parliament has marriage, but the legislatures have the solemnization of marriage. On that subject they are paramount and supreme. So, too, the legislatures have \"property and civil rights,\" words in themselves as wide almost as the whole field of legislation; but, parcelled out from that wide field, Parliament has a number of particular and specific subjects where it likewise is paramount and supreme. Among them is \"the regulation of trade and commerce.\" So far Parliament has complete and exclusive jurisdiction as to that. But we have to go farther. We have to turn again to section 92, and we find that \"shop, saloon, tavern, auctioneer and other licenses,\" a subject carved out of \"trade and commerce,\" is given to the legislatures. If the principle above enunciated is sound, then Parliament can only regulate the liquor trade or legislate in respect to it, subject to the paramount and controlling right of the local legislatures in respect to liquor licenses for revenue purposes. The enumeration and assigning of the particular subject to the one body overrides and controls the other body, although charged with the general subject, and that, too, without reference to the question of subordination or co-ordination between the two bodies.\nAnother principle of construction in regard to the British North. America Act must be stated, viz., it being in effect a constitutional agreement or compact, or treaty, between three independent communities or commonwealths, each with its own parliamentary institutions and governments, effect must, as far as possible, be given to the intention of these communities, when entering into the compact, to the words used as they understood them, and to the objects they had in view when they asked the Imperial Parliament to pass the Act. In other words, it must be viewed from a Canadian standpoint. Although an Imperial Act, to interpret it correctly reference may be had to the phraseology and nomenclature of pre-confederation Canadian legislation and jurisprudence, as well as to the history of the union movement and to the condition, sentiment and surroundings of the Canadian people at the time. In the British North America Act it was in a technical sense only that the Imperial Parliament spoke; it was there that in a real and substantial sense the Canadian people spoke, and it is to their language, as they understood it, that effect must be given.\nCan a local legislature absolutely prohibit the traffic in intoxicating liquors? That is the substantial question before us. The correct solution of the problem is largely affected (although not concluded) by the meaning that is to be given to the words \"the regulation of trade and commerce\" in section 91. That these words in their plain and ordinary meaning are wide enough to include the liquor traffic is unquestioned; the making of liquor, its sale, that is a trade or business, the dealing in it, the buying and selling of it for purposes of profit, that is commerce. But was this particular trade, the liquor business, intended to be included in the general words? That is the question. And as I have already suggested, the true answer is to be sought not so much from the rules of statutory construction laid down in the text books in regard to ordinary enactments, as by reference to provincial statutes and jurisprudence at the time of the union, and to the circumstances under which that union as well as its particular character took shape and form\nIt was in 1864 that the Quebec convention was held. Upper and Lower Canada, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island and Newfoundland were represented. The Quebec resolutions were passed, and these resolutions having been adopted by the three legislatures of Canada, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick formed the basis of the Union Act of 1867. The union was a federal not a legislative union. The English speaking provinces (considering Upper Canada as a province) were in the main in favour of a legislative union, but Lower Canada properly tenacious of \"its language, its institutions and its laws,\" secured as they had been by international treaty and imperial enactment, desired a provincial legislature in order to the perpetuity of these rights, rights which it was thought might be invaded were they to be left to the mercy of a sovereign and untrammelled legislature, the large majority of which would necessarily belong to the English speaking race. And so the question was, a federal union or none at all. That being decided the question of distribution of powers arose. To what powers shall the federal Parliament succeed, what powers shall the provincial legislatures retain? The American civil war was just closing, a conflict which from a legal standpoint had its origin in a dispute as to the constitution of the United States, the question of State rights; that controversy was not to be a ground of strife in the new nation and so first and foremost it was agreed that the central parliament was to have plenary legislative authority and that the local legislatures should have jurisdiction over such subjects alone as were expressly enumerated and in terms assigned to them. I have said that the Lower Canadian delegates were determined to maintain their peculiar institutions by means of a local legislature; but they were none the less desirous of giving the central authority all jurisdiction compatible with that determination, including generally those subjects that would be common to the whole Canadian people irrespective of origin or religion. Now the English criminal law was the law of Lower Canada; it had become part of that law in 1764; and Lower Canada was satisfied with it. It would therefore be the common heritage of the new Dominion, and by common consent it was given as a subject of jurisdiction to the central Parliament.\nThen, too, the Lower Canadian legislature and people had long previously adopted of their own free will the general principles of English commercial law. As early as 25 Geo. III, they had made the laws of England the rules of evidence in all commercial matters. They had adopted, practically without variation, the English law respecting bills of exchange and promissory notes, partnerships, the limitations of actions in commercial cases and even the statute of frauds. In 1864 they had accepted a general law of bankruptcy limited, however, to traders only, and had previously adopted the practice of the English courts in the trial of commercial cases. Commercial law was not in that class of \"institutions and laws \"which they regarded as peculiarly their own, and they were willing and anxious, seeing how the future progress and prosperity of the country would largely, depend upon its trade and commerce, upon the growth, manufacture and interchange of commodities throughout the whole Dominion, irrespective of and untrammelled by provincial boundaries or provincial enactments, that the federal parliament should alone legislate in respect thereto, so that as there would be a common criminal law throughout Canada there should be a common commercial law as well. And that was in fact the common aim and object of all the provinces. But how give expression to this aim? In making that clear what form of words should be used? A question not difficult of solution.\nFive years previously the statute law of the then province of Canada had been revised, consolidated and classified in three volumes, one volume containing the statute law common to the united province, the others the statute law applicable exclusively to Upper and Lower Canada respectively. This revision and classification, the work of the most eminent jurists in the province, became by Act of Parliament the statute law of the country, the classification having the same legal force as the statutes classified, just as if there had been a substantive enactment to the effect that thereafter in Canadian legislation the specification of a general subject in the general classification should include all the specific and particular subjects enumerated under that specification.\nReading this classification in the three volumes referred to and comparing it with sections 91 and 92 indubitable evidence will be found that the compilers of the Quebec resolutions were largely aided by the work of 1859, in the selection of words by which the distribution of powers was described. The language of a large proportion of the 45 enumerated subjects is substantially identical with the language of the classification in the Canadian consolidation.\nNow let us examine this classification. In the Consolidated Statutes of Canada the whole subject matter of legislation is divided into 11 titles of which \"trade and commerce\" is the 4th. Under this title are included among other subjects, navigation, inspection laws in relation to lumber, flour, beef, ashes, fish, leather, hops, &c., weights and measures, banks, promissory notes and bills of exchange, interest, agents, limited partnerships, and pawn brokers. In the Consolidated Statutes of Upper Canada under \"trade and commerce\" are included among other subjects, commercial law, written promises, chattel mortgages and trading and other companies. And in the Consolidated Statutes of Lower Canada under the same designation of \"trade and commerce\" are included the inspection of butter, the measurement and weight of coals, hay and straw, partnerships, the limitation of actions in commercial cases, and the Statute of Frauds.\nLet us turn now to Nova Scotia; a few weeks before the convention in Quebec, the Nova Scotia legislature had passed the Revised Statutes of Nova Scotia (third series) divided as in the case of Canada into parts, titles and chapters. One of the titles is \"of the regulation of trade in certain cases,\" and under it are among others, the following subjects:\u2014partnerships, factors and agents, bills of exchange, currency, mills and millers, regulation and inspection of merchandise, and weights and measures. This classification was practically the same in the first revision in 1851, so that for at least 13 years the expression \"regulation of trade\" had no uncertain meaning.\nIn the Revised Statutes of New Brunswick of 1854 there was practically the same classification. Under \"the regulation of trade in certain cases\" were included statutes relating to lime, bark, flour, weights and measures, and lumber, the Interpretation Act (cap. 161 sec. 35) enacting that parts, titles, &c., should be deemed as parts of the statutes.\nIt will be observed that in no case is reference made to the liquor traffic under \"trade and commerce\" or \"the regulation of trade.\" In the Canadian consolidation it is placed under \"revenue and finance\" (subhead) \"Provincial duty on tavern keepers.\" In the Upper Canada consolidation it is referred to in the Municipal Act (cap. 54, 1866,) and in two ways; first under the head of \"shop and tavern licenses,\" and secondly under the head of \"prohibited sale of spirituous liquors.\" In the Lower Canada consolidation it is referred to under \"fiscal matters.\" In the Nova Scotia revision under \"the public revenue,\" the Revised Statutes of New Brunswick containing no chapter regulating the liquor traffic.\nNow, we have here, I think, a clear indication of what at the time of confederation the Canadian people and legislatures understood to be included within the words \"trade and commerce.\" They included, unquestionably, the carrying on of particular trades or businesses, and I think commercial law generally. The actual legislation under \"trade and commerce\" in regard to certain staple articles of commerce, such as bread, fish, coals, &c., indicates that any other legislation in the same line respecting any other article of commerce would come under the same description, so I take it that the regulation of the liquor traffic, whether by licensing it or prohibiting it altogether, has to do with \"trade and commerce.\"\nSuch being the state of the existing legislation and the view that the different legislatures had of the all-inclusiveness of the phrases \"trade and commerce\" and \"regulation of trade,\" what better collocation of words could be used for the purpose of making it clear that Parliament was to have exclusive jurisdiction in all matters relating to trade and relating to commerce, including the importation, manufacture and sale of all kinds of commodities, than that combination of the two phrases, the one from the sea board, the other from the inland provinces, to be found in sec. 91 \"the regulation of trade and commerce\"? And the words having that meaning, having been placed there for that object, are we not bound to give them the intended effect?\nI am not attempting to even criticize the correctness of the conclusion to which their Lordships of the Privy Council came in Citizens Ins. Co. v. Parsons. I may be permitted, however, with all deference, to suggest that some of the considerations to which I have referred were not presented to their Lordships when the effect of the words under review was being discussed[75]. All I suggest is that, inasmuch as the British North America Act was an Act materially affecting, modifying, repealing, pre-existing Canadian statute law, and revolutionizing the constitution of the component provinces, in interpreting that Act reference may and must be had to provincial statute law, rather than to imperial statute law, and that where, as in the present case, the constitutional Act uses a phrase which for years had had a well defined meaning in Canadian legislation, that is the meaning which should be given to it when used in that Act.\nAnd I have this further observation to make. The judgment referred to contains the following: \"If the words (trade and commerce) had been intended to have the full scope of which, in their literal meaning, they are susceptible, the specific mention of several of the other classes of subjects enumerated in section 91 would have been unnecessary; as \"15 banking, 17 weights and measures, 18 bills of exchange and promissory notes, 19 interest, and even 21, bankruptcy and insolvency.\"\nNow, circumstances existing in Canada, the then state of jurisprudence, for example, rendered it wise, if not absolutely necessary, that the classes just referred to should be specifically mentioned. The provinces had \"property and civil rights\" given them. In one phase or another, almost every enactment in some way affects property and civil rights; the raison d'\u00eatre of constitutional society, the motif of the social contract, is the protection of property and civil rights. Criminal law, fiscal law, commercial law, in fact, all law at some point, or in some way, touches or affects property and civil rights. Leave out several of the subjects mentioned in 92, and there would have been a perpetual conflict between \"property and civil rights\" on the one hand, and many of the enumerated subjects of 91, on the other; so wisdom suggested ex abundanti cautel\u00e2 what was done.\nBesides, in Lower Canada, there had been a long course of jurisprudence as to what constituted \"a commercial matter.\" Some business transactions were held to be commercial matters, others not. In a dispute between an officer of the British army and his wine merchant, a promissory note given for a wine bill was held to be a non-commercial matter. So, I suppose, interest on such a note would be held to be non-commercial. Nor would the case be altered if the note were discounted at a bank. All these questions, and difficult and important many of them have been, were wisely ended, so far as the constitution was concerned, when banking, bills and notes and interest were expressly given to the Dominion. So, too, with weights and measures the duty of making by-laws, or enforcing statutes in respect to weights and measures was in some cities and provinces under municipal control. The question would be, is this subject a \"matter of trade and commerce,\" or a municipal matter? Its insertion in 91 settled it. And lastly as to bankruptcy and insolvency. This subject was wisely inserted in 91 in view of the fact already pointed out that in Lower Canada bankruptcy legislation applied to traders only (the phrase \"insolvent\" being limited in its use to non-traders) and in view too of the further fact that in the jurisprudence of the United States where the constitution gave \"the matter of bankruptcies\" to congress, it was held that \"insolvency\" belonged to the state legislatures. The insertion of both in 91, settled for Canada that particular question.\nI have ventured to make these observations merely with the view of inviting further consideration and investigation as to the proper functions and jurisdiction of the federal authorities in regard to trade and commerce,\" and to the line of delimitation between that subject and \"property and civil rights.\"\nAssuming however, that the prohibition of the liquor traffic is a matter of \"trade and commerce,\" the question is not ended. \"Property and civil rights\" is controlled by the \"regulation of trade and commerce,\" but is there anything in section 92 which controls or modifies \"trade and commerce\"? In my view there is much. First, there is \"direct taxation within the province in order to the raising of a revenue for provincial purposes.\" That involves the right of taxing, even unto death, institutions incorporated under Dominion law (as was decided by the Privy Council in the Lambe case[76], such institutions obtaining corporate rights in all cases excepting banks, not because of any express powers given to Parliament, but either under \"trade and commerce\" or under its general authority to legislate in respect to \"peace, order and good government,\" it being clear that the legislatures may incorporate such companies as are formed for provincial objects only (article 11).\nSecondly, there is (article 9) \"shop, saloon, tavern auctioneer and other licenses in order to the raising of a revenue for provincial local or municipal purposes.\"\nThe effect of this article is practically to give the regulation of the liquor traffic to the legislatures.\nSo long as such regulating legislation has as its main object the raising of revenue, it may contain all possible safeguards and restrictions as ancillary to the main object, the effect of which may be to repress drunkenness, and promote peace, order and good government generally. If, however, a fair examination of an Act purporting to be of this kind leads inevitably to the conclusion that the object of the legislature in passing it was not the raising of revenue and the licensing and regulating of the traffic for that purpose, but the suppression of the traffic altogether, in other words, that it was intended to be not regulative but prohibitory, such an Act will find no support for its validity from this article. (I will presently inquire whether that support can be found elsewhere). And a fortiori, the legislatures cannot under this article pass an Act of absolute prohibition, for that would be in direct conflict with the expressed object for which the power was solely given. The destruction of the traffic would entail the destruction of the revenue, not the raising of it.\nExcept for the decision of the Judicial Committee in Russell v. The Queen[77] (the Scott Act case), much might be said to favour the view that the right of the legislatures to regulate the liquor traffic for revenue purposes was unlimited and could not be taken away by virtue of anything in 91, whether \"peace, order and good government,\" or \"trade and commerce,\" or even \"the criminal law\"; that the central Parliament could not, by virtue of any of its powers, destroy a special power given to the local legislatures for a special and particular purpose, and that the Scott Act itself was an infringement of the provincial rights.\nIt might be urged that neither body could of itself, by virtue of its given powers, pass a prohibitory law, but that independent legislation on the part of both would be necessary, the Dominion passing an Act prohibiting the traffic in so far only as it had a right to prohibit it, but reserving to the provinces the fullest and freest right under article 9 to raise revenue from it, and the provinces thereupon passing legislation abrogating the license system, and surrendering their right to revenue from it.\n(The theory that if, under our constitution, one body cannot pass an Act upon any given subject the other necessarily can is a fallacy. A subject may be so composite in its character, may be formed of one or more elements assigned to the one legislature and of one or more elements assigned to the other, that neither one can effectually deal with the combination. For example, neither legislature could pass an Act abolishing direct taxation for municipal purposes and authorizing the raising of revenue by means of octroi or imposts upon all goods coming in through the city gates, or an Act authorizing a province to raise and collect its revenue by indirect taxation. This disability is a necessary incident of the federal system, and if it is to be got rid of that can only be effected by abolishing the system itself.\n[Page 242\nThe view which has pressed itself upon my mind is that prohibition may be a question of that character, but as it was not so held in Russell v. The Queen[78], and as it does not substantially affect the result of this reference, I take it for granted that the fallacy to which I have referred is not an element in the present case.)\nThe question now arises: Is the general right of the federal Parliament to legislate in regard to the liquor traffic, further restrained by article 8 of sec. 92, \"municipal institutions in the province\"? In other words, can a provincial legislature by virtue of that article, absolutely prohibit the traffic?\nAt the time of the union the province of Canada had given to municipalities in both sections the right of passing by-laws prohibiting the sale of liquor. In that province there was also then in force an act known as the \"Dunkin Act,\" an enactment similar in scope and object to the present Canada Temperance Act, the principle of local option being allowed to operate to its fullest extent. But neither in Nova Scotia nor New Brunswick (as I understand the facts) did local option prevail. It is true that an applicant for license had to comply with certain conditions, one of them, in Nova Scotia, being that his application had to be accompanied by a petition from a fixed proportion of the ratepayers of the locality. To that extent only did local option (if that is local option) exist.\nSuch was then the state of the law, but some historical facts may also be mentioned as haying relation to the matter. The question of prohibition had then for years been a vital political question in the maritime provinces; the public mind had been in a perpetual state of turmoil about it, the ablest statesmen of the time had been in public antagonism over it; elections had been won and lost upon it. For two successive years prohibitory legislation had been introduced in the Nova Scotia legislature, and a bill of that character was on one occasion successfully carried through the lower house. In New Brunswick a prohibitory law had actually passed and remained in operation for a year. It was then repealed with a reversion to license law. Such then was the attitude of the public mind in two of the three confederating provinces at the time of the union.\nWhat meaning then is to be given to \"municipal institutions in the province\"? Three answers may be advanced. First, it may mean that a legislature has power to divide its territory into defined areas, constitute the inhabitants a municipal corporation, or community, give to the governing bodies or officers of such corporations or communities, all such powers as are inherently incident to or essentially necessary for their existence, growth and development, and confer upon them as well all such authority and jurisdiction as it may lawfully do under any of the enumerated articles of sec. 92. That is the narrowest view. Or, secondly, it may mean that a legislature may also confer upon municipalities, in addition to these powers, all those powers that were possessed or enjoyed in common by the municipalities or municipal communities of all the confederating provinces at the time of the union, the jus gentium of Canadian municipal law; or, finally, it may mean that a legislature may confer upon municipalities all those powers which in any province, or in any place in a province, any municipality at the time of the union, as a matter of fact, possessed by virtue of legislative or other authority.\nAnd the argument in the present case is that because at the time of the union one of the three provinces had given the right of local prohibition to municipalities it must be assumed that the framers of the Act and all the provincial legislatures as well as the Imperial Parliament itself, must have intended by the use of the phrase \"municipal institutions\" to give to the local legislatures the right to pass prohibitory legislation, and that, too, without reference to municipalities at all. I dissent from this wide proposition. The first view, in my judgment, is the proper one, a view which gives scope for liberal interpretation as to what may constitute the essence of the municipal system, and give due effect in that direction to the municipal jus gentium of the three old provinces; and I entertain the strongest doubt if it ever was contemplated by the use of the words \"municipal institutions\" to make any particular reference to the liquor traffic at all. The following considerations point, I think, in that direction:\n(a.) The question of the liquor traffic was dealt with, and I think disposed of, by article 9 in relation to licenses. In the Quebec resolutions and in the proceedings of the three assenting legislatures, the article read \"shop, saloon, tavern, auctioneer and other licenses\" only; the limitation as to revenue was an addition made in London, with the assent of the colonial delegates there, just before the Act became law[79]. The article as first framed would have had a much broader application than it has in its present shape, and possibly might have given prohibitory powers to the legislatures, and I can only suggest that the limitation was imposed for the very purpose of clearly limiting the provinces to regulation only. Besides, if the right to prohibit as well as to regulate is involved in \"municipal institutions,\" if that phrase includes all powers previously given municipalities, including the issuing of all the licenses referred to in article 9, why particularly specify these licenses in a separate article? I have always understood it to be a rule of statutory construction that where special provisions are made in regard to a particular matter and there are in the same statute general provisions broad enough apparently to cover the same matter, the special provisions govern, not the general; the particular intent prevails[80].\n(b.) The collocation of articles 8 and 9, and the sources from which the phraseology was probably taken point to the same conclusion; the article relating to licenses follows the one relating to municipal institutions as if the former were of the less moment. In the Municipal Act of Upper Canada (1866), at page 583, there is a sub-title \"shop and tavern licenses\" and in the same section and on the same page there is another sub-title \"Prohibited sale of spirituous liquors.\" May it not be properly suggested that this particular subject was designedly omitted?\n(c.) Considering that the question of prohibition was a vital social and political question (and almost as much so in 1864 as to-day); considering especially the history of the question in the lower provinces; I can scarcely bring myself to believe that it was omitted from 92 by reason of \"municipal institutions\" containing it. If it had been intended that the provinces should have it it would have been expressly enumerated. Regulation by means of license was. Why omit prohibition?\n(d.) The jurisprudence on the question also throws light. In Keefe v. McLennan[81] decided in Nova Scotia in 1876, nine years after confederation, a most able judgment was delivered by the learned Equity judge upon the whole question, and neither in the argument, nor in the judgment was it even suggested that the power claimed came under \"municipal institutions.\" The same observation applied to Fredericton v. The. Queen in the Supreme Court of New Brunswick[82].\nWhy this long silence? The words \"municipal institutions\" were there in section 92, as prominent then as now, but no one in the maritime provinces ever dreamed that \"prohibition\" was concealed or wrapped up within them. Their Lordships of the Privy Council seemed of like opinion in Russell v. The Queen[83], decided in 1882, even although at that time Re Slavin and Orillia[84] had been decided in the Queen's Bench of Ontario, and the question was at the argument expressly raised as stated by the present Lord Chancellor at the argument of the McCarthy case. I take the reason to be that the phrase \"municipal institutions\" had no such broad meaning as is now contended for.\n(e.) But there are more weighty considerations than these. Prior to the union powers of many diverse kinds and varieties were from time to time given to municipalities. The legislatures conferring them were then supreme. There was then no possible question of jurisdiction or right of legislation; their authority was as unfettered as that of the Imperial Parliament itself. And so it happened that many municipal councils had authority to deal with matters since transferred to the central Parliament, for example, weights and measures, the inspection of staple articles of commerce, the regulation and control of navigable rivers, and in the case of St. John, N.B., and of the whole of Upper Canada, of public harbours. The preparation of the electoral lists was for the most part with them. In some instances they had authority to deal with the criminal law, with the violation of the dead and cruelty to animals, and so in many other cases they possessed powers in respect to subjects now transferred to Parliament.\nWhen the change came and the field of legislation was parcelled out, one portion to the Dominion and the other to the provinces, the municipalities retained all their powers, but the local legislatures did not. If before the union they had given a municipal council power to regulate a harbour, or to make a by-law respecting weights and measures, they lost the power of taking it away by virtue of the union Act, the right being transferred to Parliament alone. There can be no doubt about this, the possession by a municipality of a certain power at the time of the union affords no guide in the inquiry as to which legislature may subsequently deal with it. The only test is: Is the power referred to within the subjects of 91 or of 92? Regulations made by Dominion law as well as by local law, must be enforced by some sort of machinery. Parliament, I think, may use existing municipal machinery for this purpose; may in respect to those subjects committed to it, such e.g., as weights and measures, the fisheries inspection, navigation, &c., give to municipal councils power to make by-laws. But however this may be it is out of the question, it is absolutely futile, to argue that because before confederation the old legislatures had given power to the municipalities to make regulations in respect to certain subjects they still have that power, although with their consent these powers were by the constitutional Act, in so many words, taken from them and given exclusively to Parliament. It follows then that if prohibition is not an essentially component part of the subject matter described by the phrase \"municipal institutions,\" and is \"a regulation of trade and commerce,\" it is a matter for Parliament alone to deal with. (f). But it is argued that what is called \"the police power\" is possessed by the provinces under \"municipal institutions,\" and that the right in question is a mere incident of \"the police power.\" Now, if by \"police power\" is meant the right or duty of maintaining peace and order and of seeing that law, all law whether of imperial, federal or local origin is enforced and obeyed, then I agree that that power is wholly with the provinces. But it is with them, however, not because it specially belongs to \"municipal institutions,\" but because they are charged with the \"administration of justice.\" The legislatures may delegate this duty to municipal functionaries, but the mode of administration is purely a matter of provincial concern.\nIf, however, that wide meaning is given to \"the police power,\" which the jurisprudence of the United States has given to it, the power of limiting or curtailing without compensation the natural or acquired rights of the individual for the purpose of promoting the public benefit, the power, for instance, which enables a state legislature to regulate the operation and tolls of a grain elevator in Chicago, or to compel a company to use interlocking switches upon its line of railway, then, I say, the provinces do not exclusively possess it. It is the common possession of both, to be exercised by both in their respective domains for the common weal.\n(g). The cases decided in the Privy Council, in my view, practically conclude the question. Russell v. The Queen[85] decided that the Canada Temperance Act, a prohibitory Act, was such an Act as the Dominion Parliament might properly pass. It has been put forward, I have already suggested, that provision should have been made for the preservation of the provincial right to raise a revenue by means of liquor licenses, but that judgment is conclusive as it decides, in so many words, that the Act in question \"does not fall within any of the subjects assigned exclusively to the provincial legislatures.\"\nThe judgment of the Privy Council on the McCarthy act was inevitable. That Act unquestionably was an invasion of provincial rights. Its provisions were regulative only. It purported to legislate in respect to liquor licenses and the raising of revenue therefrom, as well as to municipal regulations theretofore prescribed under provincial legislation, its practical effect, if valid, being to make invalid all local statutes then in force having reference to the liquor traffic. It purported to create the machinery, to prescribe the method by which the local authorities might raise a revenue from liquor licenses, a right unquestionably the prerogative of the provincial legislatures, and it therefore fell, destroyed by its own inherent and manifest illegality.\nIn the Hodge case[86], the question there being:\u2014Was the Ontario Provincial Act regulating the traffic intra vires of that legislature? the decision of the Privy Council was that it was intra vires. When the McCarthy Act came up, a Dominion Act also purporting to regulate the traffic, the Privy Council as a necessary sequence, held that it was ultra vires of the Dominion Parliament. It is true their Lordships in the Hodge case intimated that the Ontario License Act came within articles 8, 15 and 16 of section 92, as doubtless many of its provisions in one way or another did, but I do not assume, because article 9 was omitted, that it was intended to be laid down that that article had no relation to the subject of legislation. Many of the provisions of the Act were municipal in their character, and therefore came under 8, were penal in their character and therefore under 15, merely local, and therefore under 16, but the whole Act was an Act regulating liquor and other licenses with a view of raising a revenue, and therefore under 9 as well. And there, up to the present time, so far as our ultimate appellate tribunal is concerned, and so far as the liquor traffic is concerned, the question rests.\nNow, having regard to these decisions of the final appellate tribunal, I cannot help asking myself this question: Supposing the Ontario legislature passes an Act absolutely prohibiting the sale of intoxicating liquors in the province, whether by retail or wholesale for the present purpose makes no difference, but making no exception as in the Canada Temperance Act in favour of liquors sold for sacramental, chemical or medical purposes, and that the Canada Temperance Act is in force, say in the city of Ottawa, and suppose that a lawful sale for such purpose is made; in that case we would have Parliament saying, the sale is legal; the Ontario legislature saying, it is not; which is the valid legislation? There can be but one answer to this question.\nWhether the recent decision of the Privy Council in The Attorney General of Ontario v. The Attorney General of Canada[87] has a bearing upon the present case, may be questioned. It was there decided that the Ontario legislature having, under \"property and civil rights,\" enacted certain provisions as to the legal consequences of a general assignment for the benefit of creditors, the same provisions that in a federal bankruptcy law as ancillary thereto might constitutionally be enacted by the federal Parliament, was within its constitutional right, but only because the federal Parliament had not taken possession of the field by dealing with the subject. Now, admitting that under \"municipal institutions,\" or \"the police power,\" or \"property and civil rights,\" a province may prohibit the traffic can it now do so in view of the Canada Temperance Act?\nThe federal Parliament has already seized itself of jurisdiction. It has passed the Scott Act. It has prescribed the method by which in Canada prohibition may be secured and is not any local enactment purporting to change that method or otherwise secure the desired end, for the time being inoperative, overridden by the expression of the controlling legislative will.\nIn my view the provincial legislatures do not possess the right to prohibit the liquor traffic.\nReferring now to the specific questions set out in the reference, I have but few observations to make. I cannot in the absence of a specific enactment on the subject, recognize any distinction, from a constitutional point of view, between the selling of liquor and its manufacture or importation. If it is admitted that a provincial legislature under \"municipal institutions\" has power to absolutely prohibit the selling of liquor it must have incidentally the right of prohibiting the having of it, and as incidental to that right the right as well of making or importing it.\nNeither can I, in the absence of a specific enactment on the subject, recognize any constitutional distinction between sale by wholesale and sale by retail notwithstanding the case of Re Slavin and Orillia[88]; that, apparently, was subsequently conceded with the full concurrence and approval of the Privy Council in \"the Dominion Liquor License Act\" case (the case on the McCarthy Act). In the light of which particular provincial candle are we to investigate the question? In Upper Canada a sale of liquor to the extent of five gallons, or one dozen bottles, was considered a wholesale transaction, the question as to the origin of the\n[Page 252)\npackage being of vital moment but the capacity of each bottle immaterial. In Lower Canada there was no question as to \"original packages,\" but it was doubtless the case that a sale of three gallons or upwards was \"wholesale,\" the character of a sale between three gallons and three half pints being left doubtful. In Nova Scotia the line was apparently drawn at ten gallons, but inasmuch as \"shop\" licensees could not sell in quantities less than one gallon and as the distinction between \"wholesale\" and \"retail\" did not there receive express statutory recognition, it is left an open question whether the constitutional line between wholesale and retail was at one gallon or ten. In New Brunswick the minimum amount that a wholesale licensee might sell was one pint. Now in view of this diverse legislation in the several provinces, the five gallons of Ontario, the three gallons of Quebec, the ten gallons of Nova Scotia and the pint of New Brunswick, how can this court arbitrarily define the line or fix the limit between a wholesale and a retail transaction? How can we in the exercise of judicial office determine the delimitating boundary? The constitutional Act in my view imposes on us no such duty. It does not give colour even to the idea that the right of legislation in either body is to be determined by such questions as quantity or quality, and in my view no such distinction exists.\nNeither in my view is there any distinction between those places in Canada where the Canada Temperance Act has been put in force (as the phrase is) and those places where it has not. The whole Act is an Act applicable to all Canada. Certain cities or municipalities may take advantage of its provisions to secure the kind of prohibition therein contemplated, but it is a law providing for prohibition everywhere. To admit the right of a legislature to enact a law: for the same purpose applicable only to localities that have failed to place themselves under Canadian prohibition, is to make the constitutional authority of a legislature dependent on the whim or fancy for the time being of the public sentiment, a principle in support of which I can find neither authority nor reason. For the reasons stated, I think the 7th question must be answered in the negative, and in my judgment an affirmative answer can be given to none.\nKING J\u2014Upon this continent there are two methods of dealing with the liquor traffic, viz., by license and by prohibition. The latter may be general, or exercised through what is called local option. The licensing system is one of regulation, with only so much of suppression as is incidental to regulation. Prohibition has suppression as its primary and distinct object. No one is likely to confuse the two things.\nThe licensing system is exclusively within provincial powers. All that is fairly incident to its effectual working goes with it, as a branch of local police power. In Hodge v. The Queen[89], their Lordships, after summarizing the clauses of the Ontario License Act then in question, say of them:\nThey seem to be all matters of a merely local nature in the province and to be similar to, though not identical in all respects with, the powers then belonging to municipal institutions under the previously existing laws passed by the local Parliaments. Their Lordships consider that the powers intended to be conferred by the Act in question, when properly understood, are to make regulations in the nature of police or municipal regulations of a merely local character for the good government of taverns, etc., licensed for the sale of liquors by retail, and such as are calculated to preserve in the municipality peace and public decency, and to repress drunkenness, and disorderly and riotous conduct. As such they cannot be said to interfere with the general regulation of trade and commerce which belongs to the Dominion Parliament, and do not conflict with the provisions of the Canada Temperance Act, which does not appear to have as yet been locally adopted. The subjects of legislation in the Ontario Act of 1877, ss. 4 and 5, seem to come within the heads of nos. 8, 15 and 16 of section 92 of the British North America statute 1867.\nThe Dominion Parliament having in 1883 passed a general licensing Act applicable to the entire country, this, with an amending act of 1884, was held ultra vires upon a reference of the subject to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council.\nThen, with regard to prohibition, the Canada Temperance Act[90] is a local option prohibitory Act. It gives to each county and city throughout the country (or electoral division in Manitoba) the right of determining, by a vote of the parliamentary electors therein, whether or not the prohibitory clauses of the Act shall be adopted. These clauses prohibit (with some exceptions not material to be now stated) the sale of intoxicating liquors entirely. When locally adopted they continue in operation for three years, and thereafter until withdrawn upon like vote. On the other hand, a vote adverse to local adoption bars the subject for a like period. In City of Fredericton v. The Queen[91], the Act was held valid, chiefly as relating to the subject of trade and commerce. In Russell v. The Queen[92], it was sustained on other grounds. Their Lordships, approaching the subject from the side of provincial powers, held that the provisions of the Act did not fall within any of the classes of subjects assigned exclusively to the provincial legislatures. It was therefore, in their opinion, at least within the general, unenumerated and residual powers of the general Parliament to make laws for the peace, order and good government of Canada in relation to all matters not coming within the classes of subjects assigned exclusively to the provincial legislatures. \"It was not doubted,\" say their Lordships in Hodge v. The Queen[93], referring to their decision in Russell v. The Queen,[94] \"that the Dominion Parliament had such authority under sec. 91 unless the subject fell within some one or more of the classes of subjects which by sec. 92 were assigned exclusively to the legislatures of the provinces.\"\nReferring to the grounds of decision in City of Fredericton v. The Queen[95], their Lordships (who had shortly before in Citizens Ins. Co. v. Parsons[96] referred to the words \"trade and commerce\" in a way that is sometimes sought to be put in opposition to the views of this court in City of Fredericton v. The Queen) (3), say: \"We must not be understood as intimating any dissent from the opinion of the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Canada and the other judges who held that the Act fell within that section.\"\nIn treating of the exclusive powers of the provincial legislatures, clause 8 of sec. 92 respecting municipal institutions, was not in terms referred to in Russell v. The Queen (2), and this fact has sometimes been made use of in the way of criticism of that case. Indeed, in the argument of the Dominion License Act, one of their Lordships expressed the opinion that clause 8 of sec. 92 had not been argued in Russell v. The Queen (2), but the counsel then arguing (the present Lord Chancellor) stated that it appeared from a shorthand note of the argument that the point had been distinctly urged. When City of Fredericton v. The Queen (3) (which is known to be substantially the same case) was before this court, the point was argued. Mr. Lash Q.C., one of the counsel for the Act, thus alludes to the argument as adduced by the other side: \"It is also contended that this law, having for its object the suppression of drunkenness, is a police regulation, and so within the powers of municipalities,\" etc. In Reg. v. Justices of Kings[97], Chief Justice Ritchie had previously dealt with the like contention, and in City of Fredericton v. The Queen[98], adhered to that decision. To that case I beg to refer.\nBut what is more pertinent is the fact that, after clause 8 of sec. 92 had been fully considered and given effect to in Hodge v. The Queen[99], their Lordships, as though it might be thought to make a difference with Russell v. The Queen[100], took occasion to reaffirm that decision: \"We do not intend to vary or depart from the reasons expressed for our judgment in that case.\"\nNow it is important to note that the substantial thing effected by the Canada Temperance Act is the suppression of the liquor trade-in the municipalities severally by a separate vote of each. What is effected is local prohibition in all its local aspects. It could not have been really meant by their Lordships that this was outside of the classes of subjects by section 92 assigned to the provincial legislatures simply by reason of the Act having operation as a local option Act throughout Canada, while a provincial Act is necessarily limited to the province. That would indeed have been a short road to a conclusion, but it would have confused the boundaries of every subject of legislation, besides rendering unnecessary the particular provisions of the British North America Act[101] respecting concurrent legislation on certain specified subjects. This was recognized in the decision upon the Dominion License Act, where it was held that where a subject, such as the licensing system, is within a class of subjects assigned exclusively to the provinces, the Dominion does not, by legislative provisions respecting it applicable to the entire Dominion, draw it at all within their proper sphere of legislation.\nBut it is argued that prohibition may in one aspect and for one purpose fall within section 91, and for another purpose and in another aspect fall within section 92. And inasmuch as it is not possible by general words to enter into the complexities of transactions, and distinguish entirely one subject from another in all its relations, the cases clearly establish that legislative provisions may be within one or other of these sections, according as, in one aspect or another, they may be incidental to the effectual exercise of the defined powers of parliament or legislature. In the effectual exercise of an enumerated power it may be reasonably necessary to deal with a matter which, apart from its connection with such subject, would appear to fall within a class of subjects within the exclusive authority of the other legislature, and in such case there is the ancillary power of dealing with such subject for such purpose, as explained and illustrated in Attorney General of Ontario v. Attorney General of Canada[102]. In the application of this principle, the Dominion legislation overrides where the same subject is dealt with through ancillary powers; and, pending the existence of Dominion legislation, the provincial legislation, if previously passed, is in abeyance. If subsequently passed it is ultra vires. In all such cases regard is to be had to the primary purpose and object of the legislation, and (except in the few cases where concurrent legislation is authorized, of which this is not one), the primary object is to be attained through one of the legislative authorities, and not indifferently through either. Now, prohibitory acts are very single in their aim. Those who favour them may be influenced by variant motives, although probably these vary but little; but the direct, well understood and plain purpose is the suppression of the liquor trade. This is accustomed to be effected, not incidentally in the effectual carrying out of some larger project of legislation, or as ancillary to something else, but as a principal political object in itself.\nIf this power exists in the provinces, it must be found either in the enumerations of section 92, or in what is reasonably and practically necessary for the efficient exercise of such enumerated powers (subject to the provisions of section 91), otherwise it can in no aspect be within the sphere of provincial legislation.\nThe power in question is not an enumerated one. On the contrary, what indirect reference there is to the liquor traffic is made in connection with the license system; and licensing does not import suppression, except, at most, as incidental and subordinate to it.\nThen, is the power to prohibit reasonably or practically necessary to the efficient exercise by the province of an enumerated power? It is urged that this is so with regard to clause 8 respecting municipal institutions. The licensing system is ordinarily associated with that subject, and licensing is also pointed at in clause 9; but there is no inherent or ordinary association of prohibition with municipal institutions. Neither in England nor the United States is this so. The state of things in the confederating provinces at the time of union will be referred to hereafter. What is reasonably incidental to the exercise of general powers is often a practical question, more or less dependent upon considerations of expediency. The several judgments of the Privy Council have placed the respective powers of the Dominion and provinces upon the subject on a wise and practical working basis; affirming, on the one hand, the exclusive right of the provinces to deal with license and kindred subjects, and affirming, on the other, the right of the Dominion to prohibit, either directly, or through the method of endowing the several provincial municipalities with a faculty of accepting prohibition or retaining license. Wherein is it reasonably necessary for purposes of municipal institutions that the provinces should have like power of suppression, to be exercised either directly upon the entire province or through the bestowment of a like faculty upon the municipalities? Why (in any proper constitution) should a considerable trade be subjected to prohibition emanating from different legislative authorities in the one country? The suppression of a lawful trade impairs the value of the power to raise revenue by indirect taxation. Prim\u00e2 facie the power that levies indirect taxation has the power to protect trade from suppression and the sole power of suppression. And in a system of government where the provinces receive annual subsidies out of the Dominion treasury, it seems repugnant that the provinces should, through mere implications respecting municipal institutions, possess the power to destroy a large revenue bearing trade. It is for the Dominion to determine for itself whether or not such a trade shall be suppressed, and if so, how, and to what extent. The Dominion has so expressed itself. It has entered every municipality and offered to it the suppression within it of the liquor trade under sanctions of Dominion law.\nIt is further contended, however, that prohibition is local and municipal because that, at the time of the union, two out of the three original members of the union (having then, of course, full power of legislation) had conferred upon the municipalities a local option of prohibition (within wider or narrower limits), and had incorporated this provision in the municipal Acts. Even had this been general with all the provinces, I do not think that the conclusion drawn from it is warranted, in view of the whole of the British North America Act; nor perhaps would it support the claim to deal with the matter otherwise than through the like method of municipal local option. But, assuming that a common understanding of words in an unusual sense might be inferred from such a state of things, if it had been general, the fact that in one of the confederating provinces (New Brunswick) there was no such provision, deprives the argument of the weight that only an entire consensus could give to it. In New Brunswick there were at the union two groups of municipal institutions, the representative kind (as in Upper and Lower Canada), throughout part of the province, and the system of local government of counties through the justices in session (as in Nova Scotia), throughout the remaining part. But in neither kind was there vested the power of suppressing the liquor trade. The Act in force in New Brunswick was 17 Vic. c. 15, as from time to time revived and continued[103]. This is important, for temperance legislation had gone further in New Brunswick than in any other province. In 1855 an Act was passed[104] prohibiting throughout the province the importation, manufacture and traffic in intoxicating liquors. This was repealed in 1856[105] amid great political excitement, and the absence of local option at the time of the union was not a casual omission. Notwithstanding the great weight of judicial authority the other way, I cannot, in view of this, give to the words \"municipal institutions,\" as used in the British North America Act, a meaning not inherent in them, simply because of this extension of power to the municipalities in several, but not all, of the confederating provinces. It seems to me that the contention in question comes to this, that the words \"municipal institutions\" are to be read not only as meaning everything inherent in or ordinarily associated with them, but also all other powers exercised by the municipalities of any of the confederating provinces. I must add that, even if the practice had been general, such an excrescence on the municipal system would be removed by the other provisions of the British North America Act.\nAssuming, however, that there is such a right in the provinces, and that, in some aspects, prohibitory legislation is within their powers, I agree with Mr. Nesbitt, (who was permitted to address us on behalf of the Brewers Association), that no such legislation could have validity while the Canada Temperance Act is in force. The provisions of that Act giving the option are in force throughout the entire country. The option is exercisable everywhere and at any time, and these options (with such other law as is in force) represent what parliament deemed adequate upon the subject. Why, then, should there be competing local options established under provincial legislation, or a competing system of provincial prohibition?\nThe Dominion Parliament, in passing the Act, declared an intention to enact a uniform law upon the subject. It assumes the right to prohibit and fixes the conditions. The freedom of the trade (subject to license and any other unrepealed law), if the conditions are not met, is correlative with its suppression if they are. Mr. Nesbitt has well stated the confusion in the working out of the Canada Temperance Act that would follow upon absolute prohibition by the province, or prohibition through different local options. The result would be very far from uniformity. As to a distinction between prohibition of the retail trade and that of the wholesale trade, it is a difference of degree and not of kind. The wholesale trade could not long survive the extinction of the retail business throughout a province. The matter has to be looked at broadly, without too much refinement or distinction.\nAs to the power to prohibit importation, that manifestly and directly affects \"trade and commerce\" and the power of raising revenue by customs duties. As to the suppression of the manufacture of liquor, this contention interferes with excise and subjects the argument respecting the implied powers of municipal institutions to a great strain.\nThe question regarding the Ontario Act of 1890 remains. It has already been incidentally considered. No doubt much latitude ought to be given to the exercise of the licensing power, in the way of restriction or regulation. Prevention of selling in certain ways, at certain times or places, to certain persons, etc., etc., is greatly removed from prohibition proper. But, as I read it, the Act appears to go beyond license and regulation or restriction. It seems substantially to give the power to prohibit altogether. It is true that the Act is expressed to be merely the revival of provisions in force at the union, and since assumed to be repealed by the provincial legislature. But, if the power to pass the Act as a new provision of law does not exist, no more does the power to revive the old law, which, on the other hand, needs no revival so far as Ontario legislation is concerned, inasmuch as it was never effectually repealed by such legislation.\nI therefore answer each of the questions submitted in the negative, with deep acknowledgments to the learned counsel who have been heard on behalf of the several interests before the court.\n[1] 7 App. Cas. 829.\n[2] 2 Can.

The action was brought by William McLachlan and Francis W. Radford, as co-partners, under the style of McLachlan, Bros. & Co., for ten thousand dollars under an accident insurance policy.\nThe case was originally appealed to the Supreme Court from an order for a new trial made by the Court of Queen's Bench for the purpose of eliciting further information as to the facts and the appeal was quashed for want of jurisdiction, on the ground that the judgment appealed from was not a final judgment and did not come within the exceptions allowing an appeal in cases of new trials.\nThe facts are given in the former reports of the case ([2]) and in the judgment of Mr. Justice Taschereau hereinafter given.\nAbbott Q.C. and Geoffrion Q.C. for appellant.\nCross Q.C. for respondents.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014I am of opinion that this appeal must be dismissed with costs.\nTASCHEREAU J. This is the same case that came before us in 1890, upon a first jury trial, sub nomine, McLachlan v. The Accident Insurance Co. (1).\nIt now comes back to us upon a motion for a new trial by the plaintiffs the Court of Review in Mon treal, by a judgment confirmed in appeal, having dismissed their action upon the finding of the jury that at the time of the death of John McLachlan he had ceased, since the 10th April preceding to be a member of the firm of McLachlan Bros. & Co. Caldwell the present appellant, represents the original plaintiffs by reprise d'instance, as curator to their insolvent estate This however does not make any difference in the case which has to be considered, as to parties, upon this appeal, precisely as it stood before the reprise d'instance, and I will treat it in its original form.\nOnly one question of law arises on the present appeal : Had the plaintiffs the right to prove by oral evidence that John McLachlan had not ceased at his death to be a member of the said firm? The courts below held that they had not and from this holding they now appeal. The case turns upon the application and construction of art. 1835 of the civil code and c 65 C.S.L.C., which enact that the allegations contained in a registered declaration of partnership made under the statute cannot be controverted by any person who has signed the same, an enactment, I take it, which creates against any such signer a presumption juris et de jure.\nIt appears that there never was a registered firm of McLachlan Bros. & Co. composed of John McLachlan, William McLachlan, F. W. Radford, and Thomas Brophy, as mentioned in the policy of insurance in question. However, no point is made on this, nor is there anything in it that affects this case.\nIt is conceded that there was only one firm of McLachlan Bros. & Co.\nin October, 1881, a declaration was filed of a partnership between John and William McLachlan, under the name of McLachlan Bros. & Co. By a notarial deed of October, 1885, between the said four parties mentioned in this policy it appears that John McLach Ian and William McLachlan continued then to be the only members of the firm of McLachlan Bros. & Co. On the 12th April following a few months after the issue of the policy in question, the said John and William McLachlan filed in the office of the Superior Court a declaration dated the 16th signed by them both, that the partnership theretofore existing between them under the name of McLachlan Bros. & Co. had been dissolved by mutual consent. Public notice in the Montreal Gazette, signed by the two parties, was given of this dissolution of partnership.\nOn the 20th of the same month a declaration was filed of the formation of a new partnership under the same name, by William McLachlan and Radford, the two plaintiffs in the present case.\nIn express terms, according to the statute, ch. 65 C.S.L.C., sec. 1, subsec. 2, they certify by the said declaration that they were the only members of the firm.\nIt is these two registered declarations that the plain tiffs would now controvert by oral evidence, that is to say, they offer to prove that it is not true that the partnership between John and William McLachlan was dissolved on the 16th April 1886 and that it is not true that they, the plaintiffs, were the only members of the firm of McLachlan, Bros. & Co., as stated in the declaration registered on the 20th of April, and that, notwithstanding these declarations the deceased John McLachlan had not, at the time of his death, ceased to be a member of the said firm.\nThey would contend that these declarations were simulated that they were made in fraud of the law; that they contained falsehoods; that they were, in fact false altogether; that they were made to impose upon the public, to make the public believe what was not true. They offer to prove that their obedience to the statute was only colourable, and this in face of an express enactment that any of the allegations in these registered declarations cannot be controverted by any evidence whatsoever, as against any party, by any person who has signed the same. Sec. 4, c. 65, C.S.L.C.; sec. 5635 et seq. R.S.Q.; art. 1835 C.C.; Cassidy v. Henry ([3]); Stadacona Bank v. Knight ([4]); Hodgson v. La Banque d'Hochelaga ([5]) Now, are not these two plaintiffs the persons who have signed the declaration that, on the 14th of April, 1886, they were the only two members of this firm? Can they now controvert the truth of that declaration, and prove that John McLachlan was a third member of the firm? Did not William McLachlan, the plaintiff, sign the declaration of dissolution of partnership between him and the deceased John McLachlan? Can he now be admitted to contend that he knowingly certified to an untruth? I say, unhesitatingly, no. Even without the statute I would be inclined to think that the plaintiff would be estopped from doing so. They gave notice to this company that John was no more a member of the firm; the notice to the public by the registration itself was a notice to the company; and when did they ever notify the company that they had done this only to deceive? Immediately upon getting this notice the company cancelled another policy which they carried on John's life payable to himself and duly notified him of it. As to the policy in favour of the partnership, they had no notice to give the policy remained in force. It is only the insurance on John himself that ceased by his withdrawal from the firm, notified to them by the registration in the public registers kept for that purpose. The plaintiffs would now argue that the company should not have believed their solemn statements. The judgment rejecting their contention, and dismissing the action is unquestionably right, and the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nGWYNNE, SEDGEWICK and KING JJ. concurred.\nAppeal dismissed with costs\nSolicitors for appellants : Abbotts, Campbell & Meredith\nSolicitors for respondents : Hall, Cross, Brown & Sharp\n[1] Q.R. 3 S.C. 230 sub nom.

Sec. 55 of the Act 55 & 56 Vic. ch. 51 enumerates in subsections from a to j the kinds of taxes authorized to be imposed, subsec (6) authorizing the imposition of a business tax on all trades, occupations, &c., based on the annual value of the premises and subsec. (g) providing for a tax. on persons, among others, of the occupation of the petitioner. At the end of subsec. (g) is the following: \"the whole, however, subject to the provisions of the Quebec License Act.\" The Quebec License Act (art. 927 R.S.P.Q.) limits the powers of taxation for any municipal council of a city to $200 upon holders of licenses.\nHeld, affirming the judgment of the court below, that the power granted by 55&56 Vic. ch. 51, to impose the several taxes was in dependent and cumulative, and as the special tax did not exceed the sum of $200, the by-law was intra vires, the proviso at the end of subsection g not applying to the whole section. Taschereau and Gwynne JJ. dissenting.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada (appeal side) reversing a judgment of the Superior Court.\nThe proceedings were commenced in the Superior Court by a petition to annul a municipal by-law taken under section 4339 of the Revised Statutes of Quebec. By the judgment of the first court one section only of the by-law viz. section 3, which imposes a special tax of $200 a year on hotel-keepers, &c., was declared ultra vires and illegal, and was set aside and annulled.\nThe judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench reversed this judgment and declared the said section and the tax thereby imposed to be intra vires of the municipal council. The clauses of the by-law and sections of the statutes under consideration on the present appeal are referred to at length in the judgments hereinafter given ([1]).\nPanneton Q.C. for appellants, contended that the clauses 1 and 3, taken conjunctively, impose upon the hotel and restaurant keepers of the city of Sherbrooke \" an annual tax, license, impost duty \" exceeding two hundred dollars per year in connection with their occupation as hotel and restaurant keepers, in direct contravention of the clearly expressed provision of the law contained in the Quebec License Act, 927 b, 54 Vic. ch. 13 as amended by 55 & 56 Vic. ch. 11, sec. 26, by which it is enacted that it shall be lawful for the \" municipal council of any city or town to levy by by-law resolution or otherwise, any license, tax, impost or duty not exceeding two hundred dollars in any one year upon the holders of license for the sale of intoxicating liquors for the occupation for which they hold such license\"; and that the charter of the city of Sherbrooke under which said by law was enacted is subject to the provisions of the Quebec License Act.\nThe learned counsel referred to Endlich on Interpretation of Statutes ([2]); art. 4389 R.S.P.Q. and Dillon on Municipal Corporations ([3]).\nBrown Q.O. for respondents, contended that the general powers of taxation conferred by the special Act. could not be taken away by implication, and that the general tax imposed under clause 1 of the by-law, although hotel-keepers may be included in its terms, is not a tax imposed on the occupation of hotel-keeper as such, for the confirmation of a certificate or otherwise, but is a contribution to the revenues of the city that he in common with all other classes is called upon to make, irrespective of the nature of the business he carries on.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE was of opinion that the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench should be affirmed for the reasons given by King J.\nTASCHEREAU J. In 1892 the corporation of Sherbrooke passed a by-law for the purpose of imposing certain taxes in virtue of the powers conferred upon it by its special charter, 55 & 56 Vic. c. 51.\nBy sec. 1 of said by-law an annual business tax of five per cent on the annual value of the premises occupied, is imposed upon every person carrying on any trade, occupation or business in the said city.\nBy sec. 3 of the by-law a special tax of $200 is imposed on every hotel-keeper, and on the keeper of every place wherein spirituous liquors are sold.\nAre the hotel-keepers and other holders of licenses under the Quebec License Act, carrying on, exercising or having an occupation in the city, liable to both of the aforesaid taxes? is the naked question submitted to us.\nThe Superior Court (Lynch J.) held that they were not, and the Court of Appeals held that they were. The Superior Court was right, in my opinion.\nBy its charter, 55 & 56 Vic. c. 51 s. 556, the corporation is empowered to impose a business tax on all trades occupations and business. Sec. 1 of the aforesaid by law purports to have been passed under this enactment. By subsec. g of this same sec. 55 of its charter the corporation is empowered to impose a special tax on keepers of houses of public entertainment, taverns and saloons, subject, however, to the provisions of the Quebec license law.\nSec. 3 of the aforesaid by-law purports to have been passed under this enactment.\nUpon the words s subject, however, to the provisions of the Quebec License Law,\" the hotel and tavern keepers holders of licenses under that law claim that the council cannot impose on their occupation a tax exceeding $200 a year, and that they cannot he taxed under both of the said sections of this by-law. The section of the Quebec License Law upon which they rely for their contention (927 b, enacted by 54 Vic. c. 13 sec. 30 amended by 55 & 56 Vic. c. 11 sec. 26) enacts that : (I read it as applied to this case) \"The holder of any license under the Quebec License Act cannot be taxed by the corporation of Sherbrooke to an amount exceeding $200 a year for the occupation for which he holds such license e or in other words : \" The occupation for which a license is held under the Quebec License Act, shall not be taxed by the corporation of Sherbrooke to an amount exceeding $200 a year.\"\nNow is such holder of a license taxed by the corporation of Sherbrooke to an amount exceeding $200 a year by the by-law in question, on the occupation for which he holds such license, if this by-law purports to impose on them both of these taxes?\nTo this question there is, in my opinion room for only one answer. By the two said sections 1 and 3 of the said by-law, the occupation of a licensed hotel or tavern keeper is clearly made liable to a tax of over $200 a year. And this puts an end to the case. The corporation has clearly no such right. The words, in subsec. g of sec. 55 of their charter subjecting their right under that section to the provisions of the Quebec License Law, must mean something, and if they do not mean that the aforesaid sec 927 b of that law must be read as if it had been specially re-enacted in the charter I am at a loss to understand what other meaning can be put upon them.\nIn other words I read that subsec. g of sec. 55 as if at the end thereof the words \" the whole however subject to the provisions of the Quebec License Law,\" were replaced by a proviso in these terms \" provided, however that no licensed hotel tavern or saloon keeper shall be liable to a tax on his occupation exceeding $200 per annum.\"\nAnd that both of these sections 1 and 3 of this by law impose a tax on the occupation of the hotel keepers and other license holders therein mentioned does not seem to me to require demonstration.\nA tax such as the tax of $200 imposed by sec. 3 of this by-law, on retailers of spirituous liquors is a tax on the occupation of retailing liquors ([4]). And the tax imposed by sec. 1 of that by-law is, in its own express terms, a tax on the occupation, amongst others, of licensed hotel-keepers and liquor retailers.\nNow, when the corporation impose first a yearly tax of five per cent on the value of the premises wherein he carries on his business or any one carrying on or exercising the occupation of a hotel-keeper, bearer of a license under the Quebec License Act and at the same time impose upon him another yearly tax of $200, I cannot see how it can be contended that they do not impose upon the holder of a license a tax exceeding $200 a year for the occupation for which he holds such license in direct contravention of sec. 927 b, of the Revised Statutes as now in force.\nIf they had, in sec. 3 of the by-law, imposed a tax of over $200 it is conceded that they would have exceeded their powers. Now, it cannot be that they have the power to evade the law, and do indirectly what they cannot do directly, simply by calling taxes by different names, or imposing them by different by-laws, or different sections of the same by-law. The law imposes on the corporation a restriction as to license holders, upon the unlimited power they would otherwise have under this subsec. g of sec. 55 of their charter. And this restriction was imposed, not for the benefit of the licensed retailers not to favour them as a class but to enable the government to tax them more heavily than they had ever been for provincial purposes.\nThat clearly appears from the 54 Vic. c. 13, wherein that restriction originated.\nThe provincial revenue on these licenses might also suffer a material decrease if the municipalities were allowed to exact any sum whatever, never mind how exorbitant, from the hotel-keepers, before they could get their provincial license. Great stress has been put, on the part of the corporation, on the argument that though the license holders, it must be conceded, are in the result made liable to a tax exceeding $200 a year, by the combined operation of secs. 1 and 2 of their by-law, yet the by-law is legal, and the license holders fall within these two sections, because, as it was argued, the tax of $200, under sec. 3, is a special tax on the occupation of hotel-keepers and liquor retailers as a special class, whilst the tax imposed by sec. 1 is a general tax on every occupation, and one for which the license holders are liable in common with all the other occupations or business besides the special tax of $200. I was at first struck with the argument, but, after consideration, it seems to me to rest on a fallacy. It is petitio principii, it assumes the very question to be determined.\nEvery business or occupation in Sherbrooke is liable, under sec. 55g to be, as a general rule, taxed to any amount per annum.\nThere is a restriction, however, as to the occupations for which licenses are held under the license law; these cannot be made liable to more than $200 a year. The very object of that restriction is to make a difference for the benefit of the province, as I have said, between occupations upon which the province raises a large part of its revenues, by means of licenses, and those from which the province desires no such revenue; between licensed occupations and unlicensed occupations. On the latter the corporation has unrestricted powers; on the former, the province, depending on them itself in a large measure for provincial revenue has decreed that the corporation shall not have a right to impose a tax exceeding $200 a year.\nIt is conceded by the appellants that this restriction applies only to a tax on the occupation, and that the license holders are liable to the other classes of taxes such as the tenant's tax, for instance, which are imposed by the corporation. A tax on the occupation of hotel keepers and others, for which a provincial license is held, is the only one in question in the case.\nFor these reasons I am of opinion that the appeal should be allowed with costs.\nThe judgment of the Superior Court, however, should, be reformed. It declares see. 3 of this by-law ultra vires. Now, why sec. 3 more than sec. 1? Sec. 3, by itself, is perfectly legal and within the powers of the corporation. It is the two, together, if applied to these license holders that constitute an illegality, but an illegality as to them only. If they are not made liable to the tax under sec. 1, they have no ground of complaint against sec. 3. The last paragraph of the judgment of the Superior Court should read: \u201cDoth declare that all persons holding licenses in the said city under the Quebec License Act, which are liable to the tax of $200 imposed by sec. 3 of the said by-law are not liable to the tax imposed by sec. 1 of the said by-law.\"\nThe decree so framed, though not granting all the relief prayed for by the appellants, will be within the conclusions of the declaration that this by-law be declared illegal.\nGWYNNE J. concurred with TASCHEREAU J.\nSEDGEWICK J. was of opinion that the appeal should be dismissed for the reasons given by Mr. Justice King.\nKING J.\u2014I am of opinion that the reasons given by Mr. Brown are sufficient to support the judgment appealed from.\nThe action is for the annulment of municipal by law no. 145, secs. 1 and 3, passed on 11th November, 1892, imposing an annual tax upon keepers of hotels, restaurants, etc.\nThe objection is that the necessary effect of these sections taken together is to impose a greater tax upon certain classes of persons than that permitted by the Quebec License Law (article 927 b R. S. Q. as amended by 54 Vic. c. 13 sec. 30 and 55 & 56 Vic. c. 11 s. 26.). That enactment is as follows :\nIt shall not be lawful for any Municipal Council of a city, town village or other local municipality to levy by by-law, resolution or otherwise, any license, tax, impost, or duty, exceeding in any one year two hundred dollars in cities and towns and fifty dollars in all other municipalities, upon holders of licenses under this law, either for the confirmation of a certificate to obtain a license or otherwise for the occupations for which they hold such licenses.\nThe by-law in question was made under the act 55 & 56 Vic. ch. 51 intituled \" An Act to revise and consolidate the charter of the city of Sherbrooke and the several acts amending the same,\" assented to on 24th June 1892 and it is therefore necessary to determine the extent to which the powers of taxation granted by the special Act are limited by the prior general Act.\nBy sec. 55 of the special Act it is enacted that the council may by by-law, impose and levy several different kinds of taxes. Thus, (by subsec. a), a tax on immoveable property not to exceed one and a half per cent of its value*; by (subsec. b), a tax to be called \" a business tax\" on all trades occupations &c., not to exceed seven and a half per cent on the annual value of the premises where they are so carried on, a tax which, by a subsequent section is to be payable for every establishment of such trade, etc., when carried on by the same person in separate buildings or places of business in the city; by (subsec. c.), a special tax on certain traders; by (subsec. d.), a special tax on tenants; by (subsec. e.), a special tax on dogs; by (subsec. g), a especial tax in the discretion of the council on the proprietors or keepers of houses of public entertainment taverns, saloons, restaurants, &c.; on brewers, distillers wholesale and retail liquor dealers; on peddlers, &c, on theatres, &c.; on auctioneers, grocers, traders' manufacturers and other enumerated classes, \"and generally on any commerce, manufacture, business or trade which has been or may be introduced into the said city and exercised or carried on or followed therein whether the same be or be not mentioned in this act and whether they be or be not of the same description or kind as those herein enumerated the whole however, subject to the provisions of the Quebec License law.\"\nThen follow, by subsecs. h, i and j, other kinds of taxes authorized to be imposed, viz., taxes on vehicles and horses, upon professional men, and upon the incomes of persons receiving wages or salaries. If the words at the close of subsec. g, viz., \" the whole, however, subject to the provisions of the Quebec License Law, \" were at the close of the enumeration of authorized taxes, I should think that the contention of the appellant would have to prevail; but, looking at these words in their context and at their \"position in the middle of the enumeration of the classes of taxes it seems manifest that they have relation, not to the en tire scheme of taxation but to the special tax authorized by subsec. g. Of that tax the incidence of which is ex pressed with some redundancy and repetition, it is declared that the whole is subject to the provisions of the Quebec License Law. The power to levy the several taxes is independent and cumulative. The amount of the \" business tax, \" of subsec. b, is limited only by the maximum of seven and a half per cent fixed by the statute, a maximum that might yield a considerable amount in the case of several establishments carried on by the same person or company. On the other hand, the entirely independent power to levy the special tax subsec. g, is in the discretion of the council as to amount, subject only to this, that a greater sum than $200 shall not he so levied upon holders of licenses, under the Quebec License Law for the occupations for which they hold such licenses.\nThese several limitations are not exceeded in the by law in question, sec. lof which imposes the \"business tax\" under subsec. b and sec. 3 the s special tax \" under subsec. g. I therefore think that the appeal should be dismissed.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellants : Panneton, Mulvena & Leblanc.\nSolicitor for respondents : J. T. L.

A creditor of F. for a debt due prior to the partnership induced C. to purchase a half interest in the patent for $700 and join with F. in a promissory note for $1,000 in favour of said creditor who also, as an inducement to F. to sell the half interest, gave the latter $200 for his personal use. In an action against C. on this note:\nHeld, reversing the decision of the Court of Appeal, Taschereau J. dissenting, that the note was given by C. in purchase of the interest in the patent and not having the words \u201cgiven for a patent right\u201d printed across its face it was void under the Bills of Exchange Act, 53 Vic. c. 33 s. 30 ss. 4 (D.).\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] reversing the judgment of the Divisional Court[2] in favour of the defendant.\nThe action in this case was on promissory notes of the defendant and his partner Fairgrieve and the defence that there was no consideration to the defendant for said notes unless it was the sale to him of a half interest in a patent owned by Fairgrieve as to which the notes were void as not complying with the provisions of the Bills of Exchange Act, 53 Vic. ch. 33 s. 30 ss. 4 (D). The way in which the notes came to be given is stated as follows in the judgment of the Divisional Court.\n\u201cThe defendant Fairgrieve had been in business on his own account prior to Craig becoming his partner on the 1st November, 1890, when he (Craig) put $1,600 into the business which was thereafter carried on under the firm name of \u201cFairgrieve & Craig.\u201d\n\u201cAt the time of the formation of the partnership Fairgrieve was indebted to the plaintiffs on his personal account to the amount of at least $1,000, for which the plaintiffs desired to obtain the notes of the firm of Faigrieve & Craig, and in order that Fairgrieve might be authorized to give the firm\u2019s notes it was suggested by Mr. Benjamin, one of the plaintiffs, that Craig should purchase a half interest in a patent of which Fairgrieve was the owner. The terms are set out in an agreement under seal between Fairgrieve and Craig dated the 18th of March, 1891, as follows: Whereas on or about the 3rd day of March, 1891, (the day on which the notes were given) the said Fairgrieve agreed to sell and the said Craig agreed to buy a half interest in the said Canadian patent no. 34093 in consideration of $700, payable as follows, $200 to be paid to Fairgrieve out of Craig\u2019s share of income from the business, and $500 by the firm becoming responsible to the extent of $1,000 for the personal indebtedness of Fairgrieve to Messrs. Samuel, Benjamin & Co., for which amount the promissory notes of the said firm were in pursuance of the said agreement given to the said Samuel, Benjamin & Co.\u201d\nBy the \u201cBills of Exchange Act,\u201d sec. 30, subsec. 4:\n\u201cEvery bill or note the consideration of which consists in whole or in part of the purchase money of a patent right or of a partial interest limited geographically, or otherwise, in a patent right, shall have written or printed prominently and legibly across the face thereof, before the same is issued, the words: \u2018given for a patent right\u2019, and without such words thereon such instrument shall be void except in the hands of a holder in due course, without notice of such consideration.\u201d\nThe words required by the section were not printed or written across the notes sued upon.\nThe trial judge held that the transaction was not within the provision of the \u201cBills of Exchange Act,\u201d and that there was good consideration for the notes independently of the patent. His decision was reversed by the Divisional Court but restored by the Court of Appeal, from whose judgment the defendant appealed to this court.\nMoss Q.C. and Thompson, for the appellant.\nWatson Q.C. and Parkes, for the respondents.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014I concur in the judgment of Mr. Justice Gwynne.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014I would dismiss this appeal. Mr. Justice Osler\u2019s reasoning in the Court of Appeal seems to me unanswerable.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014It is a fallacy, I think, to say that the loan of $200 to Fairgrieve for which he gave his note formed any part of the consideration of the notes signed by Craig and now sued upon. The loan of the $200 by Benjamin to Fairgrieve may have been and no doubt was made to induce Fairgrieve to accept Craig\u2019s terms for the patent right which he, at Benjamin\u2019s suggestion and to forward his private purpose, had induced Craig to consent to buy and to make an offer for to Fairgrieve; but the consideration for Craig being a party to and signing the notes sued on was the transfer of an interest in the patent by Fairgrieve to him and that only, and it was by Benjamin\u2019s contrivance and to forward his own purpose of trying to make the firm of Fairgrieve and Craig become answerable for the old discharged debt of Fairgrieve alone, that the notes were made payable to the respondents.\nNow however different may have been the condition of things to meet which the legislature passed the section of the \u201cBills of Exchange Act\u201d under consideration, it is impossible to say that the present case does not come within its letter, and I must say that I think it comes within the mischief intended to be guarded against, for otherwise the act might be readily evaded by the person who sells patent rights making all notes given therefor payable to one cognizant of the consideration for which they are given. The plaintiffs gave no consideration whatever to Fairgrieve and Craig or to Craig, or to Fairgrieve, which can support their claim to recover against Craig upon the notes sued upon, and that is the sole question on this appeal. The appeal must therefore be allowed with costs.\nSEDGEWICK and KING JJ. concurred.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Wickham & Thompson.\nSolicitors for the respondents: James Parkes & Co.\n[1] 21 Ont.

The requisition was filed by one George Comrie, and among the lands to be affected by the proposed drain were lots for which the plaintiff James York the elder, was assessed. Some time before the filing of the requisition portions of the last mentioned lots had been conveyed by said plaintiff to James York the younger and Isaac York who are also plaintiffs in the action, and the question for decision is whether or not the said two Yorks were owners under the act and whether or not Comrie was an owner he being in possession of a part of the land to be affected but the legal title thereto being in his father. It was admitted that if Comrie was counted in and the two Yorks out there was a sufficient majority under section 6 (a) of the act for the requisition to be filed.\nThe Divisional Court held that an owner under the act was one in whom the property was for the time being beneficially vested and who had the occupation or usufruct of it and that George Comrie was such an owner. The court also held that the assessment roll was also a test of ownership, and James York the elder being assessed for the property conveyed to his sons the latter were not owners under the act. The Court of Appeal reversed these holdings and gave judgment for the plaintiffs. The defendants appealed to this court.\nHenderson and MacCracken for the appellants referred as to the meaning of owner in the statute to Washburn on Real Property[3], and contended that Comrie was a beneficial owner according to the facts in evidence, citing Dillwyn v. Llewelyn[4].\nO\u2019Gara Q.C. and MacTavish Q.C. for the respondents referred to In re Flatt and the Counties of Prescott and Russell[5]. The judgment of the court was delivered by:\nGWYNNE J.\u2014This appeal must be dismissed. The question is as to the validity of an award purporting to be made by the engineer of the municipality of the township of Osgoode, under the provisions of ch. 220 of the revised statutes of Ontario, entitled \u201can Act respecting Ditches and Watercourses\u201d The question arises under section 6, subsec. a, of that act, whereby it is enacted that where parties interested in a ditch required by an owner of land for the drainage of his land shall not be able to agree upon the proportion to be borne by such owner of land to be benefited by the proposed ditch:\nAny owner may file with the clerk of the municipality in which the lands requiring such ditch or drain are situate, a requisition in a form supplied by the act, shortly describing the ditch or drain to be made, &c., &c., and naming the lands which will be affected thereby and the owners respectively and requesting that the engineer appointed by the municipality for the purpose be asked to appoint a day on which he will attend at the time and place named in the requisition, &c., &c.\nProvided nevertheless that when it shall be necessary to obtain an outlet that the drain or ditch shall pass through or partly through the lands of more than five owners (the owner first mentioned in this section being one) the requisition shall not be filed unless\n(a) Such owner shall first obtain the assent in writing thereto of (including himself) a majority of the owners affected or interested.\nUpon the 25th of August, 1891, one George Comrie, claiming to be the owner of the south-west quarter of lot no. 27, of the 7th concession of the township of Osgoode, and as such entitled to avail himself of the above section, filed a requisition with the clerk of the municipality whereby, representing himself to be owner of the said south-west quarter of said lot no. 27, he required a ditch to be made through such lot and therein alleging that it would be necessary to continue the ditch through certain other lots mentioned therein, among others, the north-west quarter of the same lot no. 27 of which his father William Comrie was named as owner, and the west half of lot no. 28, in the 7th concession, and the north half of lot no. 27, in the 6th concession, whereof the appellant James York was named as owner, and alleging further that as the said owners had failed to agree upon the respective portions of the proposed work, they required that the engineer appointed by the municipality for the purpose should name a day when he would attend at the locality of the said proposed drain and examine the premises, hear the parties and make his award under the provisions of the statute. This requisition was signed by George Comrie and his father and four others of the persons named as owners of the respective lots named, such owners including the municipality as owners of the roads to be crossed or benefited by the proposed ditch being in all ten in number.\nThe award made by the engineer upon its face professed to have been made in pursuance of the above requisition, so that several matters referred to in the argument as having taken place prior to the presentation of the said requisition can have no bearing upon the present question which must be determined upon the sufficiency of the above requisition to set the act in motion, the contention of the appellants being that as it was not signed by a majority of the owners of the lands affected by or interested in the proposed drain, the award affects the south half of lot 28 in the 6th concession, not named in the requisition at all, or professes so to do, of which the appellant Isaac York claims to have then been and to be the owner. The appellant James York the younger claims to have then been and to be the owner of the north half of lot no. 27, in the 6th concession, set down in the requisition as having then been owned by the appellant James York, and who although being as stated in the requisition the owner of the west half of lot no. 27, in the 7th concession, did not sign the requisition Now it is admitted that if James York the younger and Isaac York were respectively at the time of the presentation of the said requisition owners of the said respective lots claimed by them, and if George Comrie who was the person who as owner of the lot of which he was named to be owner was asserting the right to set the act in motion was not such owner, then the requisition was not signed by a majority of the owners of lands affected or interested as required by the act, and in such case the award which is impeached must be set aside as unauthorized by the act. Indeed it seems to me that if George Comrie who was the person who as the one requiring the drain to be made was the originator of the requisition was himself not an owner, that alone would be sufficient to invalidate proceedings originated by him, and taken upon his requisition, but it is not necessary to proceed upon this ground alone concurring as we do entirely in the judgment delivered by Mr. Justice Osler, that James York the younger and Isaac York were respectively owners of the lots whereof they claim to have been owners and must be counted as such in estimating the sufficiency of the said requisition, and that George Comrie was not such owner of the lot whereof he claimed to be the owner. It is difficult to see how the municipality are to assent in writing to the requisition to be presented to their clerk before it can be presented, but however that may be we entirely agree with the judgment of the Court of Appeal that they cannot be as such assenting parties to the requisition presented by George Comrie upon which the award which is impeached was made. The appeal must be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellants: Belcourt, MacCracken & Henderson.\nSolicitors for respondents: O\u2019Gara, MacTavish & Gemmell.\n[1] 21 Ont.

An order was made for a reference to ascertain J.\u2019s interest in the lands and to take an account of the dealings between J. and K. In the master\u2019s office K. claimed that in the course of the partnership business he signed notes which J. indorsed and caused to be discounted but had charged against him, K., a much larger rate of interest thereon than he had paid and he claimed a large sum to be due him from J. for such overcharge. The master held that as these transactions had taken place nearly twenty years before K. was precluded by the Statute of Limitations and by laches and acquiescence from setting up such claim. His report was overruled by the Divisional Court and Court of Appeal on the ground that the matter being one between partners and the partnership affairs never having been formally wound up the statute did not apply.\nHeld, reversing the decision of the Court of Appeal and restoring the master\u2019s report, that K\u2019s claim could not be entertained; that there was, if not absolute evidence at least a presumption of acquiescence from the long delay; and that such presumption should not be rebutted by the evidence of the two partners considering their relationship and the apparent concert between them.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario affirming the judgment of the Divisional Court by which the master\u2019s report in favour of the plaintiff was set aside. The facts of the case sufficiently appear from the above head-note and the judgment of the court.\nGibbons Q C. for appellant.\nFraser for respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by:\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014I am of opinion that the master\u2019s report should have been confirmed.\nThe plaintiff is a judgment creditor of Johnston. Johnston and Kittredge were in partnership some twenty years ago. The partnership business was never formally wound up, but it was so substantially, and this was done as far back as 1883. All debts were paid in equal proportions by the partners, and there are no assets except three judgments against one Crawford, and some lands in the village of Wiarton and township of St. Vincent. To enforce payment out of Johnston\u2019s interest in these lands the appellant has taken the present proceedings. In these lands Johnston and Kittredge are interested in equal moieties. The property is still subject to an old mortgage on which $2,000 remains due, which is to be paid by Kittredge, Johnston having paid his share.\nJohnston and Kittredge are brothers-in-law. They were in partnership in a land, oil and general speculation business in Strathroy. They had no capital. Funds were raised by means of discounts through Johnston, who was himself carrying on a banking business in Strathroy; he indorsed Kittredge\u2019s notes and procured them to be discounted in some of the banks at Strathroy. Johnston kept the books. Now Kittredge brings forward a claim against Johnston\u2019s interest in these lands, first raised after the lapse of some twenty years, that he was defrauded by Johnston who charged him in the partnership accounts more for discount than he really paid to the banks; that whilst in fact Johnston only paid 7 per cent discount he charged 10 or 12 per cent, contrary to agreement and in fraud of his partner. Kittredge had access to the books (see the evidence of Cuddy) and it must be assumed he inspected them before they finally settled the business by paying the debts in equal shares and agreeing to a division of what assets remained.\nI do not think this claim ought now to be entertained. There is evidence of acquiescence, at all events a presumption of acquiescence, from the long delay. Should we consider that presumption sufficiently rebutted, especially considering the relationship and apparent concert between the parties, by the evidence of the defendant Johnston himself, who thus seeks to defeat the claim of his brother-in-law\u2019s creditors, and by that of Kittredge who is giving evidence for himself? I think not. I refer again to Cuddy\u2019s evidence as disclosing circumstances which strengthen the presumption from lapse of time.\nThe witnesses were examined before the master but he never adjudicated as to the credit due to them, the report being founded on acquiescence and the statute of limitations. The evidence, in the absence of any finding by the master, is in my judgment wholly insufficient to establish such a claim as that which Kittredge has propounded and which therefore for that reason alone fails.\nI entertain a strong opinion that the master was right as to the acquiescence, and also as to the statute of limitations[1], and that his report should be restored.\nThere is no necessity for taking the partnership accounts; the evidence shows these were long since settled by the mutual arrangement of the parties. I am of opinion that we should allow the appeal, discharge the order of the Court of Appeal, and restore and confirm the master\u2019s report with costs to the appellant in this court and in both the courts below.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellant: Gibbons, McNab & Mulkern.\nSolicitors for respondent: Fraser & Fraser.\n[1] Noyes v.

Workmen engaged in making such repairs were present at the time with one of whom W. collided at the opening but a bar usually placed across the opening was down at the time. In an action against his employers in consequence of such accident:\nHeld, affirming the decision of the Court of Appeal, Strong C.J. hesitante, Taschereau J. dissenting, that there was no evidence of negligence of the defendants to which the accident could be attributed and W. was properly non-suited at the trial.\nHeld, per Strong C.J., that though the case might properly have been left to the jury, as the judgment of non-suit was affirmed by two courts it should not be interfered with.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] affirming the judgment of the Divisional Court[2] which sustained the non-suit at the trial.\nThe facts material to the appeal are sufficiently stated in the above head-note and in the judgments published herein.\nGibbons Q.C. for appellant. There was some evidence of negligence and the case should not have been with- drawn from the jury. Denny v. Montreal Telegraph Co.[3]\nThe want of a guard on the shaft was of itself negligence for which defendants would be liable. Hollinger v. Canadian Pacific Railway Co.[4] And see Smith v. Baker[5].\nNesbilt and Grier for the respondents referred to Callender v. Carlton Iron Co.[6]; Quebec Central Railway Co. v. Lortie[7]; Black v. Ontario Wheel Co.[8]\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014The only question open on this appeal is that as to the non-suit. In deciding this we must, of course, entirely disregard the findings of the jury which the appellant is not entitled to invoke in his support as he has done in his factum. The judge at the trial had to decide two preliminary questions. First, was there any evidence of negligence of sufficient substance to be submitted to the consideration of the jury? Secondly, if there was such evidence, did it appear from the undisputed facts that the plaintiff\u2019s own negligence had contributed to the accident?\nHad I been dealing with the case as judge of first instance, or even in the Divisional Court, I might have thought that the evidence did disclose a sufficient case for the consideration of the jury tending to show that the respondents\u2019 premises were at the time of the accident in a defective state, and that they were therefore guilty of a breach of duty towards the appellant who was rightfully passing through them when he fell through the shaft of the hoist. The space left between the shaft and the shelving on the left side of the room for the passage of workmen going to the carpenter\u2019s shop, appears to me to have been so narrow that I might have considered there was some proof of a maintenance of the premises in a defective condition and, therefore, proof of negligence on the part of the defendants in omitting to provide some barrier or at least some warning to persons rightfully using the passage.\nThis preliminary question, however, being substantially one of fact, no matter of law being involved, and it having been held in three successive courts, composed in the aggregate of seven judges, that the facts found did not constitute a sufficient case for the consideration of the jury, I do not think I ought now to act on my own somewhat doubtful view of the effect of the evidence so far as to reverse the unanimous judgments of the Court of Appeal and of the Divisional Court[9]. I therefore, though somewhat doubtfully I admit, agree that the appeal must be dismissed.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014I would allow the appeal.\nGwynne J.\u2014The evidence in this case fails, in my opinion, to show any negligence of the defendants to which the accident from which the plaintiff sustained the injury he complains of can be attributed. Being engaged as a workman in a room in a factory to which he could have proceeded without any danger or risk of danger whatever, and whither a fellow workman had without any difficulty just proceeded but a few steps ahead of him, he went out of his course and walked into an elevator the door of which was open it is true, but necessarily open because of some mechanics being then employed doing some necessary work to it, one of whom was so employed at the very opening through which the plaintiff fell and which he had approached without apparently taking any notice of where he was going. The case does not present a question of contributory negligence at all; the only conclusion which is warranted by the evidence is that the accident happened by and the injury consequent thereon is attributable wholly to the carelessness of the unfortunate sufferer himself and for which the defendants are in no way responsible. The appeal must in my opinion be dismissed.\nSEDGEWICK J.\u2014I am of opinion that this appeal should be dismissed for the reasons stated by Mr. Justice Burton in the Court of Appeal.\nThe accident which happened to the plaintiff was occasioned by his own carelessness and not through any negligence on the part of the company. The repairing of the elevator was a necessary act on their part. It is true that the guard protecting the elevator was not up at the time of the accident and that if it had been up the accident would not have occurred, but at the time the defendants\u2019 workmen were engaged in repairing the elevator, workmen were about it and around it engaged in that duty, and the accident happened in consequence of the defendant, instead of looking about him, looking up towards the roof of a room in which he was walking to a man engaged in the repairs and actually collided with a workman at the opening also engaged in the repairs. One can hardly conceive of a case stronger than the present where it can be said that the man himself was wholly to blame for what happened to him. I am of opinion that the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nKING J. concurred.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellant: Gibbons, McNeil & Mulkern.\nSolicitors for respondents: Beatty, Blackstock, Nesbitt & Chadwick.\n[1] 21 Ont.

Wrayton (Plaintiff)\nAppellant\nand\nJohn Naylor and Edward Guy Stayner (Defendants)\nRespondents\n1894 Nov. 6; 1895: Jan. 15.\nPresent:\u2014Sir Henry Strong C.J., and Taschereau, Gwynne, Sedgewick and King JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF NOVA SCOTIA.\nSale of land\u2014Sale by auction\u2014Agreement as to title\u2014Breach of\u2014Determination of contract.\nW. bought property at auction signing on purchase a memo. by which he agreed to pay 10 per cent of the price down and the balance on delivery of the deed. The auctioneer\u2019s receipt for the 10 per cent so paid stated that the sale was on the understanding that a good title in fee simple clear of all encumbrances up to the first of the ensuing month was to be given to W. otherwise his deposit to be returned. After the date so specified W., not having been tendered a deed which he would accept, caused the vendor to be notified that he considered the sale off and demanded repayment of his deposit, in reply to which the vendor wrote that all the auctioneer had been instructed to sell was an equity of redemption in the property; that W. was aware that there was a mortgage on it and had made arrangements to assume it; that a deed of the equity of redemption had been tendered to W.; and that he was required to complete his purchase. In an action against the vendor and auctioneer for recovery of the amount deposited by W.:\nHeld, reversing the decision of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, that the vendor having repudiated the agreement W., being entitled to a title in fee clear of encumbrances and not bound to accept the equity of redemption, could at once treat the contract as rescinded and sue to recover his deposit.\nAppeal from a decision of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia[1] reversing the judgment at the trial in favour of the appellant.\nThe facts of the case are sufficiently stated in the above head-note. The documents signed at the sale and correspondence between the parties are set out in full in the judgment of the Chief Justice.\nHarris Q.C. for appellant.\nBorden Q.C. for respondent.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014The appellant brought this action to recover back $530, the amount of a deposit paid by him on the purchase at auction of a house and premises situate in South Park Street, in the city of Halifax.\nThe defendant, Edward Guy Stayner, the assignee for the creditors of his father, Charles A. Stayner, was the vendor, and the defendant, Naylor, the auctioneer employed by him to sell the property. At the conclusion of the sale the appellant signed an agreement, as follows:\u2014\nHALIFAX, N.S., 13th April, 1893.\nI hereby purchase this house and lot, no. 179 South Park St., for the sum of fifty-three hundred dollars, the same having been knocked down to me at auction by John Naylor, auctioneer.\nI agree to pay 10 per cent deposit on the signing of these presents and the balance on delivery to me of the deed.\n(Sgd.) M. B. WRAYTON.\nOn the day following the sale the appellant paid to the defendant, Naylor, the deposit of 10 per cent and received from him a receipt in the words and figures following:\u2014\n14th April, 1893.\n$530.\nReceived from Captain M. B. Wrayton the sum of five hundred and thirty dollars, being ten per cent deposit on purchase money of property no. 179 South Park Street, sold by me to him by auction yesterday for the sum of five thousand three hundred dollars, said deposit to be retained by me until his solicitor is satisfied with the title of said property, and the sale is on the understanding that a good title is to be given to Captain Wrayton in fee simple, clear of all incumbrances up to the first day of May next, save and except the civic taxes for the years 1893-4. Should the title not be a good one I undertake to return the deposit in full, and, on the other hand, if the title is good and Captain Wrayton fails to carry out the sale, the said deposit is to become forfeited as stipulated and ascertained damages to the owner of said land and premises. Possession of said house to be given on or before the first day of May now next ensuing.\n(Sgd.) JOHN NAYLOR.\nThere cannot be a doubt but that, under the contract thus formed, the vendor was bound to make out a good title in fee simple.\nOn the 2nd of May, 1893, Mr. Barnhill, the solicitor of the appellant, wrote to Mr. Gray, the solicitor of the vendor, Edward Gray Stayner, a letter in the following terms:\u2014\nDear Sir,\u2014I hereby notify you as the solicitor of Mr. Stayner that unless the title to property no. 179 South Park Street, in this city, is at once fixed up and a deed thereof in fee simple prepared for delivery to us, Capt. M. B. Wrayton will consider said sale off, and proceed accordingly.\nTime is an essential condition with Capt. Wrayton.\nOn the 4th of May, 1893, Mr. Barnhill again wrote Mr. Gray, as follows:\u2014\nDear Sir,\u2014In close herewith the key which Mr. Naylor sent me to-day. I have no use for it, and you can give same to your client, Mr. Stayner. I now notify you that as no sufficient title in fee simple to the property has been furnished Capt. Wrayton, he now declines to have any further dealings and requires payment of his deposit.\nOn the 8th of May, 1893, Mr. Barnhill sent a further letter to Mr. Gray, saying:\u2014\nDear Sir,\u2014Capt. M. B. Wrayton has instructed me to notify you that unless the $530 paid by him to you as a deposit on the Stayner property is paid to me, as his solicitor, at once, he will bring an action against you to recover the same, no sufficient title to the property having been furnished him by the assignee.\nOblige me by an immediate reply, as the conditions on which the money was paid you have not been complied with, viz.: a title in fee simple, and Mr. Wrayton is going away in a day or two.\nAnd on the 9th of May, 1893, the purchaser\u2019s solicitor again wrote the vendor\u2019s solicitor as follows:\u2014 Dear Sir,\u2014As no title in fee simple has been offered or tendered to Capt. M. B. Wrayton of the property no. 179 South Park Street, Halifax, by the owner, he now instructs me to notify you that he considers the sale to him off.\nHe thinks he has given the sellers sufficient time to furnish the deed, and it not being forthcoming he cannot wait any longer, but must sue for his deposit paid Mr. Naylor.\nTo this last letter Mr. Gray, on the same day, replied by the following letter:\u2014\nHalifax, N.S., 9th May, 1893.\nJ. L. Barnhill, Esq., Barrister, etc., Halifax.\nDear Sir,\u2014Replying to your letter of this date in the above matter, Mr. Stayner\u2019s assignee has tendered you, on your client\u2019s behalf, a deed of the title which he held and sold in the property purchased by your client, who was aware of the mortgage held by Mr. Jones, and, of his own motion, made arrangements to assume it, and so informed those acting for the assignee.\nThe assignee had but the equity of redemption; could sell nothing further, and instructed no sale beyond it, even if the mortgage, as stated, had not been arranged for by your client, who is required promptly to complete his purchase with damages for the delay.\nI am, yours truly,\n(Sgd.) B. G. GRAY.\nThis was a distinct repudiation of the contract evidenced by the memorandum and receipt before stated, under which the appellant was clearly entitled to have made but a good title in fee simple, and was not bound to accept just such title as Mr. Edward Guy Stayner had under his father\u2019s conveyance to him, nor was he bound to accept a mere conveyance of the equity of redemption, having agreed to purchase the whole estate in fee and not a mere equity of redemption. The appellant was therefore entitled at once to rescind the contract and sue to recover his deposit which he did.\nWhere a vendor repudiates the contract and distinctly refuses to make out a good title after having been repeatedly requested to do so by the purchaser, as was done in the present case, the purchaser is not bound to wait but may at once treat the contract as rescinded. When, however, the vendor merely delays to show a good title, and time is not either by the terms of the contract or from the circumstances of the case of the essence of the agreement, the purchaser is required to wait a reasonable time for a title to be shown.\nThis latter rule can have no application in a case like the present where the vendor distinctly disclaims the obligation to make out such a title as the contract calls for\nSir Edward Fry, in his work on Specific Performance[2], states this very clearly at page 484, where he says:\u2014\nWhere one party to a contract absolutely refuses to perform his part of the contract when the hour for performance has arrived, the other party may accept that refusal and thereupon rescind the contract.\nI am of opinion that the judgment of Mr. Justice Townshend was right and ought to be restored.\nHad the defendant furnished an abstract or shown by the deeds that he had a good title in fee simple, as he might have done quite consistently with the existence of the mortgage to Mr. Jones provided he was in a position to compel Mr. Jones to take his money and release his mortgage, he would have done enough. It would then have been reduced to a mere question of conveyancing and the contract could have been completed by applying a sufficient proportion of the purchase money to the payment of the mortgagee and procuring him to join in the conveyance. But this the respondent, Stayner, did not offer to do; he never produced any title, and for all that appears his title may have been, in respects other than the mortgage, a defective one. What he insisted on in effect by the last letter his solicitor wrote, was that the purchaser was bound to accept just such title as he had, a conveyance of the equity of redemption, and that without establishing in any way that the title was, irrespective altogether of the mortgage, otherwise good, a wholly untenable position which relieved the appellant from submitting to further delay, and authorized him to treat the agreement as determined,\nThe appeal must be allowed with costs.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014We expressed our opinion at the close of the argument that this appeal was to be allowed. It merely stood over to allow his Lordship to put down in writing our reasons for that conclusion I fully concur in his opinion.\nGWYNNE, SEDGEWICK and KING JJ. concurred.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for appellant: J. L. Barnhill.\nSolicitor for respondent: Wallace McDonald.\n[1] 26 N. S. Rep. 472.\n[2] 3rd ed.\n"}

The action was twice tried, the first verdict for plaintiff for $500 damages having been set aside by the Divisional Court and a new trial ordered which resulted in a verdict for plaintiff for $700 which was sustained by the Divisional Court and the Court of Appeal. McCarthy Q.C. and Leitch Q.C. for the appellant Unless the corporation could be indicted for a nuisance it is not liable to plaintiff in this action. Ringland v. City of Toronto[3]; Ray v.

Griffiths[13].\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014My reasons for dismissing this appeal are so exactly identical with those stated in the judgments of the Chief Justice and the Chancellor, that anything I can say is only a repetition of what has already been well said by both these learned judges.\nI am of opinion that the learned Chief Justice of the Queen\u2019s Bench could not have withdrawn the case from the jury. There was evidence to show that the sidewalk was in a defective state; that it had been either originally improperly constructed, or had from age and long use sunk down so as to allow water to accumulate upon it, and in consequence of this the ice which caused the accident was formed. There being this evidence a non-suit would have been manifestly wrong. I do not consider the weather alone caused the formation of the ice on which the respondent slipped and fell, for without the structural defect there would, according to some of the witnesses whose testimony it was for the jury to consider and weigh, have been no ice at the spot.\nThe case on all the questions which arose was left to the jury in a charge which I have read more than once and which I consider to have been a clear, full and able exposition of the evidence and of the points on which the jury had to pass.\nThe admission in evidence of the by-law was, I think, a correct ruling, and even if it were not it would not, in my opinion, in the present state of the law, necessarily be ground for a new trial.\nApart from the insufficient condition of the sidewalk there may have been no evidence for the jury; probably there was none. I do not enter upon the question much dwelt upon in the judgment of Mr. Justice Burton as to the liability of municipalities generally for accidents caused by ice and snow on streets and highways for the reason that I do not think it arises in the present case.\nThe appeal must be dismissed with costs.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014This is a clear case for a dismissal. The case of Caswell v. St. Mary\u2019s Road Co.[14], seems to me to be good law; it was there held that if snow collect on a certain spot, and by the thawing or freezing the travel upon it becomes specifically dangerous, and if this special difficulty can be conveniently corrected by removing the snow or ice, or by other reasonable means, there is the duty on the person or body, on whom the care or reparation rests, to make the place fit and safe for travel. I agree with Chief Justice Hagarty\u2019s reasoning.\nGwynne J.\u2014I am entirely of opinion that there is no evidence in the case of any neglect upon the part of the corporation of the town of Cornwall to keep the street upon which the accident which caused injury to the plaintiff occurred free from ice, much less of the fact that such accident and injury can be attributed to any such neglect if there had been any. The accident was plainly attributable to the peculiar state of the weather at the time, namely, a severe frost suddenly ensuing upon a thaw and melting of the snow upon the sidewalk thereby causing some ice there upon which the plaintiff slipped and fell. The appeal should, in my opinion, be allowed with costs and judgment be ordered to be entered for the defendants as upon total failure of the plaintiff to prove the cause of action as alleged.\nSEDGEWICK and KING JJ. concurred in the judgment of the Chief Justice.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellant: Leitch, Pringle & Harkness.\nSolicitors for respondent: Maclennan, Liddell & Cline.\n[1] 21 Ont.

Both having died intestate the administratrix of M\u2019s estate brought an action against the representatives of W. for the value of such services rendered by M. and on the trial there was evidence of statements made by W. during the time of such service to the effect that if he (W.) died without having made a will M. would have good wages and if he made a will he would leave the business and some other property to M.\nHeld, reversing the decision of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, Gwynne J. dissenting, that there was sufficient evidence of an agreement between M. and W. that the services of the latter were not to be gratuitous but were to be remunerated by payment of wages or a gift by will to overcome the presumption to the contrary arising from the fact that W. stood in loco parentis towards M. There having been no gift by will the estate of W. was therefore liable for the value of the services as estimated by the jury. McGugan v. Smith (21 Can. S. C. R. 263) followed.\nAppeal from a decision of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia[1] setting aside a judgment at the trial for the plaintiff and ordering judgment to be entered for defendants. The material facts of this case are sufficiently set out in the above head-note. The case was twice tried, the jury giving a verdict for plaintiff on each occasion, the damages on the last trial being assessed at $1,950 at the rate of $325 a year for six years. The court en banc set aside the last verdict holding that Robert West the grandfather of the deceased Henry E. Murdoch stood in loco parentis towards him and there was nothing to rebut the presumption arising from the relationship that the services performed by West were to be gratuitous.\nRoss Q.C. for the appellant. There is nothing to distinguish this case from McGugan v. Smith[2] where the plaintiff recovered for services performed for her grandfather on evidence very like that in this record. See also Walker v. Boughner[3].\nBorden Q.C. for the respondent.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014I am of opinion that there was ample evidence for the consideration of the jury to shew that services were rendered by the plaintiff\u2019s husband to his grandfather as a clerk in the management of his business; and that such services were understood not to be gratuitous, but were to be remunerated by the payment of wages, or by a gift by will. In short that there was proof of an agreement to that effect between the parties. The case therefore in all legal aspects resembles that of McGvgan v. Smith (1), and must be governed by the same principle. There is nothing in the relationship of the parties disentitling the plaintiff to recover, if the services were agreed to be paid for, as the jury have found they were. When services are rendered to a person standing in loco parentis to the person rendering them there. is a certain presumption that such services were not to be remunerated by wages, but such presumption may be overcome by evidence of an express agreement. Here there was, as I have said, evidence of such an agreement. It was for the jury to weigh this evidence, and if they found there was an agreement and there having been no gift by will, to estimate the value of Murdoch\u2019s services. They have found for plaintiff at the rate of $325 per annum.\nThe appeal must be allowed with costs and the judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia must be discharged, and judgment entered for the plaintiff for $1,950 and interest from the date of the verdict together with the costs of the plaintiff in the court below.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014I would allow this appeal and restore the judgment in favour of the plaintiff. I cannot see how the defendant could get a dismissal of the action upon the finding of the jury.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014The evidence in my opinion wholly fails to establish that any contract of service had been entered into between the deceased Henry Murdoch and the deceased Robert West, his grandfather, who had brought up and maintained his grandson from his infancy as one of his own family and at the age of 16 took him into his own shop to assist him in the small retail business as a general country dealer which he carried on. The evidence goes no further than to show that the grandfather had the intention, with knowledge or expectation of the grandson, to provide for the latter by his will, and this doubtless he would have done if he had not deferred making a will until it was too late. He died intestate and within a week the grandson who had recently been married died also. The case is, in my opinion, distinguishable from McGugan v. Smith[4]. In that case there was an express promise proved that if the plaintiff would remain with her grandfather until either she should marry or he should die he would provide for her by his will as amply as for his daughters, which promise he did not fulfil although he did leave to her a bequest by his will. This promise was made to induce the plaintiff in that case to remain with her grandfather and she accepted the terms offered and did remain with him doing for him all sorts of menial services until she arrived at the age of 25 when she married.\nIn the present case no such contract is proved. It is said that the jury by their answers to the questions submitted to them have found that the deceased Robert West, did arrange with his grandson that he would compensate the latter for his services, but the evidence justified a finding to no greater extent than that the grandfather had an intention to make a provision for his grandson by will of which intention they might perhaps have found that the grandson was aware; but there was no evidence whatever that any contract for services to be compensated by wages or by testamentary bequest had been entered into between the grandson and grandfather. We cannot, I think, allow this appeal without giving to the judgment in McGugan v. Smith (1) an effect which the evidence in the present case does not warrant. I think the appeal must be dismissed.\nSEDGEWICK and KING JJ. concurred in the judgment of the Chief Justice.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: James A.

The Michigan Central pleaded that it was using the line under an agreement made in 1882 with the other company and the action against the Canada Southern having been dismissed, it being admitted that the loss of plaintiff\u2019s property was not due to negligence, the only question for the court was whether or not, under the laws in force in Ontario relating to railways, the Canada Southern could lawfully lease its road for a term of years to a foreign company.\nThe statutes affecting the case are set out in the judgment of Mr. Justice Sedgewick.\nSaunders for the appellant. The Canada Southern Railway Co., by its charter is authorized to make traffic arrangements with any other company and it makes no difference that in this case it was with a foreign company. Canadian Pacific Railway Co. v. Western Union Telegraph Co.[2] And the Railway Act of 1879 authorizes an agreement with a foreign company.\nThe more recent decisions of our courts are in favour of upholding agreements such as these. Bickford v. Grand Junction Railway Co.[3]; Attorney General v. Great Eastern Railway Co.[4]\nMoss Q.C. for the respondent. A corporation cannot give to others the right to exercise its special powers and franchises. Richmond Waterworks Co. v. Vestry of Richmond[5]; Hinckley v. Gildersleeve[6].\nAnd see Mann v. Edinburgh Tramways Co.[7]\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE concurred in the judgment of Mr. Justice Sedgewick.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014I was of opinion at the argument that we should allow this appeal without reserving judgment, and I have not changed my views since But for the judgment of the Court of Appeal in his favour, I would have thought the respondent\u2019s contentions utterly untenable. I need not say more than to adopt the cogent reasoning of Hagarty C.J. who dissented in the Court of Appeal.\nGWYNNE J. concurred.\nSEDGEWICK J.\u2014This is an action brought by the plaintiff against the Canada Southern Railway Company and the Michigan Central Railroad Company for damages occasioned by the burning of his buildings caused by sparks from a locomotive of the latter company while operating the road.\nThe case was tried before Mr. Justice Street who dismissed the action against both companies upon the ground, which is now admitted, that no negligence on the part of either company was shown. Upon appeal to the Divisional Court (Armour C.J. and Falconbridge J.) the judgment of the trial judge was confirmed. Upon appeal to the Court of Appeal judgment was given ordering a new trial as against the Michigan Central Company, Chief Justice Hagarty dissenting.\nThe sole question to be determined upon this appeal is as to whether the defendant company is liable for the damage occasioned to the plaintiff by the fire in question, although that damage was wholly accidental, having been caused (it is admitted) by sparks from the defendant company\u2019s engine, without negligence of any kind on the part of the defendants or their employees. In order to determine this question a careful examination must be made of the various statutes under which the Canada Southern Railway was built, and under which the Michigan Central Railroad Company professes to have authority to operate the line, for there can be no question that if the defendant company were at the time of the accident operating their locomotive at the place of the accident without statutory authority, then, upon the authority of Fletcher v. Rylands[8] they are liable for any damage occasioned by their having brought the dangerous machine into the vicinity of the plaintiff\u2019s lands. The construction of that portion of the Canada Southern Railway which runs through these lands was first authorized by an Act of the province of Ontario of 1868 (31 Vic. ch. 14) and by section 2 of that Act a large number of sections of the Act respecting railroads (chap. 66 of the Consolidated Acts of Canada, 1859), including the clauses of that Act respecting powers, became part of the Canada Southern Railway Company\u2019s charter, then known as the Erie and Niagara Extension Railway Company. By a provincial Act 33 Vic. ch. 32 (1869) the company received its present name, and by another Act of 1872 the following further powers were conferred upon the company:\nThe Company may make arrangements for the conveyance or transit of traffic with any other railway company or companies, or with the International or any other railroad bridge, or tunnel company, and may enter into an agreement with such other company or companies with respect to the terms of such traffic arrangements, or with respect to all or any of the matters following, namely: The maintenance and management of the works of the companies respectively, or of any one or more of them or of any part thereof respectively; the use and working of the railway or bridge, or of any part thereof respectively and the conveyance of the traffic thereon; the fixing, collecting and apportionment of the tolls, rates, charges, receipts and revenues levied, taken or arising in respect of traffic; and the joint or separate ownership, maintenance, management and use of a station or other work or any part thereof respectively.\nIn 1874 the Parliament of Canada in pursuance of the provisions of the British North America Act, declared the Canada Southern Railway to be a work for the general advantage of Canada, and by that Act also declared the company to be a \u201cbody corporate and politic within the jurisdiction of Canada for all and every the purposes mentioned in, and with all and every the franchises, rights, powers, privileges and authorities by virtue of the provincial Acts,\u201d and further that the company should in all matters occupy the same position, and stand in the same plight and condition in every respect, as the company incorporated under the provincial Acts.\nIn 1868 the Parliament of Canada substantially re-enacted the Railway Act in the Consolidated Statutes of old Canada, and at the time of the accident the general law in force throughout Canada respecting railways was embodied in the Consolidated Railway Act of 1879 (42 Vic. ch. 9) a portion of section 60 being as follows:\nThe directors of any railway company may at any time, and from time to time, make and enter into any agreement or arrangement with any other company, either in Canada, or elsewhere, for the regulation and interchange of traffic passing to and from their railways, and for the working of the traffic over the said railways respectively, or for either of those objects separately, and for the division and apportionment of tolls, rates and charges in respect of such traffic, and generally in relation to the management and working of the railways, or any of them, or any part thereof, and of any railway or railways in connection therewith, for any term not exceeding twenty-one years, and to provide, either by proxy or otherwise, for the appointment of a joint committee or committees for the better carrying into effect any such agreement or arrangement, with such powers and functions as may be considered necessary or expedient, subject to the consent of two-third of the stockholders, voting in person or by proxy.\nthis latter provision being a substantial re-enactment of a similar provision of the Dominion Railway Act of 1868.\nSuch was the state of legislation in force regarding the Canada Southern Railway on the 12th December, 1882, on which date an agreement was entered into between the defendant companies, namely, be- tween the Canada Southern Railway Company and the Michigan Central Railroad Company, by which the Canada Southern practically transferred to the Michigan Central for a term of twenty-one years the exclusive right to use and operate the former company\u2019s line of railway, at that time extending from Niagara River to Detroit River, the object being to enable the Michigan Central Railroad to have under their management and control a continuous line of railway from the Eastern States on the Atlantic sea board to the city of Chicago, and to the North-western States; and from that time to the present the Michigan Central have continuously operated under the agreement in question the Canada Southern line, the latter company, however, maintaining its corporate existence and receiving at stated periods the consideration specified in the agreement for the transfer therein contained.\nIt may be at once admitted that a railway company cannot delegate its franchises except by the authority of a statute, and the question here is: Could the Canada Southern Railway Company under their charter and the general railway Acts incorporated therein, delegate to any other company the right which they possessed of exclusively using and operating their own railway for a period of twenty-one years? In the determination of this question reference, I think, must principally be had to the provincial Act of 1872, section 9, to which Act it seems to me sufficient consideration has not been given in the courts below. Now what does that clause say? The company may enter into an agreement with any other railway company with respect to traffic arrangements or with respect to the use and working of the railway or of any part thereof, and the conveyance of traffic thereon and the joint or separate ownership, maintenance, manage- ment and use of a station or other work, or any part thereof. In my view this provision gives a special power to the Canada Southern Railway Company to delegate to any other railway so much of its franchise as authorizes it to use and work its railway. It confers upon the company a much larger right than the right of making a forwarding agreement or an agreement for conferring running powers or having reference to the convenient or more economical working of the joint traffic. No company but a company having the exclusive operation of a road, such as the Canadian Pacific Railway Company has over its road, or the Grand Trunk Railway Company has over its road, can be said to be engaged in \u201cthe use and working\u201d of a railway. That phrase is applicable only to the company possessing the road, not to a company having mere running or other rights over it. Besides, the clause would seem to infer that traffic arrangements in connection with the railway was one thing and the use and working of the railway was another thing, a larger and more general thing; and I take it that these words were inserted in this clause for the very purpose of enabling such an agreement to be entered into as the one in question. If then the Canada Southern Railway Company had a right to operate a line of railway at the place where the accident happened, it had a right to transfer to any other company a right to use and work the railway at that place and that company as a consequence would succeed to all the rights, privileges and immunities of the former company, one of these rights being the right to run a locomotive engine the motive power of which was steam, without negligence, over the line of railway there. There can, I think, in this case be no question as to the powers which the Michigan Central Railroad Company possesses under the authority of the legislature of the state of Michigan. The provincial statute must be read as if it had enacted that the Canada Southern Railway Company might enter into an agreement with the Michigan Central Railroad Company for the use and working of its line for a period of twenty\u2011one years. Whether as between the Michigan Central Railroad Company and its shareholders, the company would require authority from its own state legislature to take advantage of the privileges conferred upon it by the Ontario Legislature is a question which does not arise in the present case. The legislature has, in my opinion, given authority to the Michigan Central Railroad Company to operate the railroad in question, without negligence, and no British subject resident in Canada, who has in Canada been accidentally injured by such operation, can be permitted to say that such operation was illegal as not possessing statutory authority for its exercise. The judgment of the Court of Appeal proceeded mainly upon the ground that section 131 of the Dominion Railway Act, which likewise at the time of the accident was binding upon the defendant companies, was not wide enough in its terms to make legal the agreement of December, 1882, between the two companies; but it must be borne in mind that that clause was substantially the same as section 48 of the Dominion Railway Act of 1868, which Act, it must be presumed, was before the Ontario Legislature when it was passing the Act of 1872, and that inasmuch as the powers given in section 9 of the Ontario Act are apparently broader, having reference to traffic, tolls, running powers and management and working generally, it must be presumed that there was an intention on the part of the legislature to give the company larger powers than those specified in the Dominion Act. At the same time I am reluctantly compelled to disagree with the opinion of the majority of the Court of Appeal in their construction of this particular section of the Dominion Railway Act. In a country coterminous as Canada is for nearly three thousand miles with the United States, where it is necessary in the interest of both countries with a view to the interchange of commerce and the carrying on of traffic, that the lines of railway in the one country should be worked in conjunction with the lines of the other, public policy would seem to suggest that every facility should be given with a view to the cheap and rapid transit of merchandise from one part of the country to the other, and it was doubtless in that view that the Canadian Parliament expressly provided that Canadian railway companies might enter into agreement with foreign railway companies, or as the statute says, \u201cany other company either in Canada or elsewhere.\u201d The object of the legislature was to facilitate in every possible way the operation and working of railways generally throughout Canada, and to legalize the bringing in of foreign railways and the capital of foreign railway companies for that purpose. We are therefore required to give such a construction to the section in question as will best give effect to that policy provided we keep within the expressed intention of the legislature as manifested in the section itself. Now that section authorizes the directors of any railway company to make arrangements with any other company either in Canada or elsewhere in relation to the management and working of the railway for a period not exceeding twenty-one years. The words \u201cmanagement and working\u201d are not so broad or all inclusive as the words \u201cuse and working\u201d in the provincial Act. They are, however, in my judgment, sufficiently comprehensive to cover the agreement in question. If one company may by agreement hand over the management and working of its railway to another company, that, it seems to me, would enable that other company to secure the exclusive right to manage and work the railway. The agreement in question was one not broader than this in its character, and therefore within the statute, not beyond it.\nTo return, however, to the provincial statute it has been urged that under the provisions of section 92 of the British North America Act a local legislature could not authorize a provincial railway company to enter into an agreement with a United States railway company, the effect of which would be to connect the railway system of the United States or any of them with the Canadian railway system, with a view of providing for unity of management over a continuous line of railway running partly in one country and partly in the other. It is not necessary to determine this question here for whether the provincial Act of 1872 was ultra vires or not, all the powers therein purported to be conferred were conferred upon it by the Canadian Act of 1874, and thereby section 9 of the provincial Act in respect to the use and working of the railway was ratified and confirmed.\nI am further of opinion that the plaintiff in this action cannot under the circumstances set up in support of his claim that the agreement under which the appellant company operated the railway was ultra vires. Clearly the appellant company were running the train in question by the leave and license of the Canada Southern Railway Company. It is admitted that the Canada Southern Railway Company had the statutory right to give running powers to the appellant company. It had the right to say to the appellant company that at certain times and subject to certain conditions you may run your trains over our railway. The Canada Southern Railway Company did say so to the appellant company, and it was by virtue of their saying so that the appellant company was there. I do not think that a stranger accidently injured, injured without any fault on the part of the appellant company, can be permitted to say to the appellant company: it is true I was accidently injured by your locomotive; it is true that your locomotive was there with the permission and by the authority of the Canada Southern Railway Company; it is true that the Canada Southern Railway Company had authority from the legislature to permit you to be there and to operate your locomotive there, but the agreement was too wide. The Canada Southern Railway Company gave you larger rights and more extended powers than the legislature authorized it to do, and therefore you must pay me. This position, I submit, a stranger cannot set up. I have not been able to find express authority upon this point, but upon the principle that the acts of the corporations in excess of their corporate powers can be attacked only by the corporation itself or by its shareholders, or by the Attorney General in the interests of the public, or by others specially interested, laid down in such cases as Stockport Dist. Waterworks Co. v. Mayor, &c., of Manchester[9], and Pudsey Coal Gas Co. v. Corporation of Bradford[10], the plaintiff cannot appeal in the present case to the doctrine of ultra vires. It is unnecessary for me to refer at length to the cases of Jones v. Festiniog Ry. Co.[11]; Powell v. Fall[12]; Hilliard v. Thurston[13]; cited at the argument. In all of these cases the courts found that there was no statutory authority for the use of the instrument by which the injury was occasioned, but the principle laid down by Cockburn, C.J. in Vaughan v. Taff Vale Ry. Co.[14] \u201cwhen the legislature has sanctioned and authorized the use of a particular thing, and it is used for the purpose for which it was authorized, and every precaution has been observed to prevent injury, the sanction of the legislature carries with it this consequence, that if damage results from the use of such thing independently of negligence, the party using it is not responsible\u201d was clearly recognized.\nAs already pointed out there was, in my view, statutory authority for the use of the locomotive in question at the time of the accident, and there being no negligent use of it the defendants are not liable.\nI am of opinion that the appeal from the Court of Appeal should be allowed with costs here and in that court and that the judgment of the Queen\u2019s Bench Divisional Court, and the judgment of the trial judge should be restored.\nKING J. concurred.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellants: Kingsmill, Saunders & Torrance.\nSolicitors for respondent: Meredith, Cameron & Judd.\n[1] 21 Ont.

The persons so to be paid were not parties to nor named in the deed of assignment.\nHeld, reversing the decision of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, Taschereau J. dissenting, that as the creditors to be paid by the preferred creditor could not enforce payment from him or from the assignor who had parted with all his property, they would be hindered and delayed in the recovery of their debts and the deed was, therefore, void under the statute of Elizabeth.\nAppeal from a decision of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia affirming the judgment at the trial in favour of the plaintiff.\nThe material facts of the case are thus set out in the judgment of Mr. Justice Sedgewick:\n\u201cThe question involved in this case is as to whether the assignment in the pleadings referred to is void under the statute of 13 Elizabeth, chapter 135. One Neil McKinnon, a trader at Mabou in Inverness, Nova Scotia, being in insolvent circumstances, on the 11th November, 1892, made an assignment to S. W. Cummings, the plaintiff in this action. Subsequent to the date of the assignment Mr. Robert Taylor recovered a judgment against McKinnon for $919.60, and having issued execution thereon the sheriff levied upon and sold considerable quantity of the goods covered by the assignment, and the plaintiff, McKinnon\u2019s assignee, brought this action to recover damages from the sheriff by reason of this alleged conversion of the goods in question. The case was tried before the Chief Justice of Nova Scotia without a jury and he gave judgment in favour of the plaintiff. Upon appeal to the Supreme Court en banc this judgment was sustained, Meagher J. dissenting. The assignment in question, upon its face, was in no respect obnoxious under the authorities to the statute of Elizabeth although it provided for preferences and contained a clause by which the executing creditors released the assignor as a consideration for participating in its benefits.\n\u201cIt is, however, claimed that the instrument is void by reason of the following facts:\u2014William Cummings & Sons were, shortly previous to the assignment, creditors of McKinnon to the extent of $318. It was at the instance of these creditors that the assignment was made. It would appear that McKinnon was anxious to pay in full certain creditors before executing the assignment, and to provide for the payment of certain other creditors after the assignment, and thereupon an understanding was come to between the plaintiff and one Gladwin (both of whom were representing William Cummings & Sons at the time) on the one hand, and McKinnon on the other, by which Cummings & Sons paid on account of one Murray $162; a Mr. Hunt $101; and a further sum of $340 to other creditors; making McKinnon\u2019s indebtedness to Cummings & Sons amount in the whole to about $921. But it was further provided in the deed of assignment that the assignee was to pay to William Cummings & Sons not $921 but $1,201 therein alleged to be due them by McKinnon, and the defendant claimed that that firm having been preferred for an amount largely in excess of their real claim against McKinnon the effect is that the deed is void as against the creditors under the statute of Elizabeth. The plaintiff, on the other hand, claims that the amount of this difference, $280, represented amounts due by McKinnon to certain local creditors about Mabou for cattle and otherwise, and that the plaintiff and Gladwin having agreed on behalf of Cummings & Sons that they would subsequently pay these local claims in full it was perfectly justifiable to add this amount, $280, to McKinnon\u2019s actual indebtedness, and thereby make his total claim, as represented in the instrument, $1,201. And the question is whether this particular transaction, in connection with other facts, to which I will refer, has the effect of vitiating the deed.\u201d\nRoss Q.C. and McNeil for the appellant relied on Ex parte Chaplin[1].\nHarrington Q.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the majority of the court was delivered by:\nSEDGEWICK J. (His Lordship stated the facts set out above and proceeded as follows):\u2014\nThe instrument contained a clause giving authority to the assignee to employ any person he pleased, upon such wages as he might think fit, to carry out the trusts of the deed, and it seems to have been understood at the time the assignment was executed that that duty was to be performed by the assignor himself. The learned Chief Justice who tried the case came to the conclusion that the plaintiff should recover, stating that\u2014 it was strongly urged that the payment by which the debt of Cummings was apparently increased from $300 to $1,200 could not be sustained, but it was quite clear that no deception or fraud was intended or practised. The assignor declared his intention before making the assignment to make these debts preferential and the mode adopted, when explained, removes all difficulty as to the bona fides of the transaction. The transaction was not a \u201cmere cloak\u201d for retaining a benefit to the grantor. If the deed is bon\u00e2 fide, that is, if it is not a mere cloak for retaining a benefit to the grantor, it is a good deed under the statute of Elizabeth; Alton v. Harrison[2], Ex parte Games[3];\nand this view of the case was accepted by Ritchie and Townshend JJ. upon appeal. Mr. Justice Meagher, however, was not satisfied as to the proof of the alleged indebtedness to the \u201clocal creditors\u201d and thought there should be a new trial.\nThe solution of the question in controversy very largely depends upon the nature of the transaction, and upon the question whether or not the assignment might not be used as a method for securing an advantage to the assignor at the expense of the creditors or, to use the language of the Chief Justice, whether the assignment was not \u201ca cloak\u201d for his benefit. Now the actual payment by Wm. Cummings & Sons of the $600 above mentioned, either to McKinnon\u2019s creditors or to McKinnon himself, whether on his own account or for the purpose of paying creditors, had, of course, the effect of increasing McKinnon\u2019s indebtedness to the firm by the amount of such payments. But the effect of that firm\u2019s verbal promise to pay at a future time certain other creditors of McKinnon is of a totally different character. Cummings & Sons entered into no contractual obligation with these creditors. Even supposing, as between them and McKinnon, an enforceable bargain had been made, yet the creditors for whose benefit it was made could not in any way take advantage of it or enforce their claims, either against S. W. Cummings & Sons or their agent and nominee, the assignee. In the event of Cummings & Sons failing to pay them they could look to McKinnon alone, but inasmuch as he had divested himself of his property by virtue of the assignment it is manifest that they would fail in their efforts to secure payment unless their debtor subsequently acquired means for that purpose. Assuming, however, the arrangement above referred to to have been made as between Cummings & Sons and McKinnon, and that that firm failed to carry it out, McKinnon doubtless would have his action against Cummings & Sons, and would be entitled to recover the amount which, under his agreement, he was bound to pay the local creditors. These local creditors, in any action which they might bring against McKinnon for the recovery of their debts, might possibly have the right, after judgment, to compel McKinnon to assign to them his rights against Cummings & Sons; but it is apparent that their rights and remedies against him must necessarily be very seriously prejudiced by reason of the assignment. It is obvious, in other words, that they, by the assignment, are hindered and delayed in their remedies for the recovery of their claims. When the seek for payment the debtor has no money to give them, no goods which they can take under execution, nothing but an imperfect obligation, possibly available and possibly not, against individuals whom they never knew and who may or may not be able to pay them.\nThe facts may be looked at from another point of view so far as this body of creditors is concerned. The preferences in the deed amounted to about $2,800, the assets to about $3,810, while the whole liabilities were about $7,500. The assignment provided that the preferences were to be first paid, that the executing creditors were next to be paid, and that the residue was to be divided among the non-executing creditors. The promise on the part of Cummings & Sons to pay the local creditors was not even communicated to them. It did not appear in the assignment that there was any intention on the part of the assignor to pay them in full; there was no method provided by which they could enforce any claim against Cummings & Sons; so that their position in relation to the assignment was a most peculiar one. If they executed the assignment they thereby became entitled to participate in a very small and insignificant residue after the preferred claims were paid and were at the same time releasing their debtor from all liability. If they refused to execute it it is apparent that, apart from the promise to McKinnon, there was even less probability of their getting anything. They were thus placed in a dilemma; all the property of their debtor had passed from him into the hands of the assignee and their only chance of payment was a possibly moral, but certainly unenforceable, obligation, so far as they were concerned, on the part of Cummings & Sons. This, I take it, was unquestionably a hindering and delaying of creditors within the meaning of the statute.\nAll these difficulties would have been avoided (assuming the arrangement to be a fair and honest one) had these local creditors been named in the assignment as preferential creditors. In that case they would have been secure in their rights and no difficulty such as the present would have arisen. The question is not whether the parties intended to be honest, or to act towards these creditors as they now allege they intended to act towards them; but it is: What does the instrument enable the debtor to accomplish? Is it possible that under its provisions he may secure a benefit for himself at their expense? If so the law presumes that he intends all that the instrument provides or permits. The assignee was bound, under the instrument to pay William Cummings & Sons $1,201; they might or might not, as they chose, pay the local creditors; if they did, good and well, if not McKinnon was entitled to recover from them. That was a personal benefit for himself, a secret advantage for himself, the effect being to make the instrument void. It is elementary law that where there are in an assignment for the benefit of creditors provisions under which the assignor may be personally benefited at the expense of his creditors the instrument is void under the statute of Elizabeth. Notwithstanding the able criticism of Mr. Justice Townshend in the court below of the case of Ex parte Chaplin[4], I am of opinion that the views expressed by Fry L. J. in dealing with that case apply equally to the present. The learned Lord Justice points out the distinction between hindering and delaying creditors and defrauding creditors, and he shows that the form of the instrument in that case representing an indebtedness, as in the present case, which did not exist, together with other facts similar to the concomitant facts in the present case, led to the conclusion that the intention was to do that which in fact the deed did, namely, to hide from the creditors the real facts of the case, thereby not to defraud them but to hinder and delay them in enforcing their legal rights.\nIn my view, to uphold an assignment such as the one in question in the present case would be giving the sanction of the court to a method of procedure on the part of insolvent debtors in reference to their property fraught with great danger and detriment to the mercantile community. It is of course settled law that; under the statute of Elizabeth an insolvent debtor may prefer one creditor to another, may in fact transfer his whole estate to a few individual favorites, leaving the great body of his creditors to fruitless or illusory remedies. We must, however, insist that where preferences are given they should be open, honest and fully disclosed; they must be so declared and that under no circumstances can the debtor as a matter of right, secure an advantage for himself by reason of them.\nOn the whole I am of opinion that this appeal should be allowed with costs, and the action dismissed with costs, including all costs in the court below.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014I would dismiss this appeal. The case turns upon questions of fact and I fail to see upon what ground we could interfere. The two courts below have come to the same conclusion.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for appellant: Alexander McNeil\nSolicitor for respondent: H. O. Lovett.\n[1] 26 Ch. D. 319.\n[2] 4 Ch.

The town of Saint Stephen is situate within the boundaries of the parish of Saint Stephen, one of the parishes in the county of Charlotte, and was incorporated by Act of Assembly, thirty-fourth Victoria, chapter 26, which Act and the several Acts in amendment thereof were further amended and consolidated and the incorporation of the town continued by Act of Assembly, forty-eighth Victoria, chapter 47.\n2. Section four and subsequent sections of the said incorporating Act vest the administration of all fiscal, prudential and municipal affairs of the town, and the whole legislative power and government thereof, in the mayor and council, and the town council has under the Act the sole authority to make by-laws for the good rule and government of the town, and for the several purposes in the said Act declared.\n3. The jail of the county of Charlotte is by section 54 of the said Act made the jail of the town of Saint Stephen, and all the assessments which may be required to be levied in the town for county purposes are to be made under section 61 by the town assessors.\n4. Section 9 of chapter 99 of the Conaolidated Statutes of Municipalities makes provision for the election of five county councillors from the parish of Saint Stephen one of which, styled an ex officio councillor, is authorized to be elected by the town council of Saint Stephen; and section 57 of forty-eight Victoria, chapter 47, together with section 109 of chapter 99, Consolidated Statutes, treat of the levying and appropriating upon the town by the county council the amount to be paid by the town towards county contingencies, and sections 32, 33 and 34 of chapter 100 of the Consolidated Statutes make further provision in respect to the levying of that portion of the charge for county contingencies payable by the town.\n5. The town council of the town has each year since the passing of the said chapter 99 elected an ex officio county councillor, who has attended the meetings of the county council and acted as such ex officio councillor.\n6. The town of Saint Stephen has annually paid an amount into the county funds for county contingencies and its proportion into the county school fund.\n7. The Canada Temperance Act, 18*78, came in force in the county of Charlotte on the second day of August, A.D. 1879, and has remained and is still in force in the said county.\n8. That by order in council dated 29th day of September, 1886, under the provisions of 49 Victoria, chapter 48, section 2 D, the Governor General in council ordered that\n\u201cAll fines, penalties or forfeitures recovered or enforced under the Canada Temperance Act, 1878, and amendments thereto, within any city or county which has adopted the said Act, which would otherwise belong to the Crown, for the public uses of Canada, be paid to the treasurer of the city or county, as the case may be,, for the purposes of the Act.\u201d\nAnd by order in council dated 15th November, 1886, after reciting the said second section of 49 Victoria, chapter 48, it was ordered that the order in council of 29th September, 1886, relating to the application of fines and penalties unpaid under said Act, be and the same was thereby cancelled, an d that\n\u201cAll fines, penalties or forfeitures recovered or enforced under the Canada Temperance Act, 1878, and amendments thereto, within any city or county or any incorporated town separated for municipal purposes from the county, which would otherwise belong to the Crown for the public uses of Canada, were directed to be paid to the treasurer of the city incorporated town, or county, as the case may be, for the purposes of the said Act.\u201d 9. A large number of persons have been prosecuted by the town authorities since the passing of the last mentioned order in council for violations of the said Act, and while a considerable sum has been received into the town treasury for fines under the Act, a large sum has also been paid out for the purposes of and connected with its enforcement; all sums collected under the said Act within the town have been put into the town treasury to the credit of a special fund called the Scott Act Fund, and there now remains a balance of such fund unexpended in the treasury of the said town.\n10. No portion of the funds so collected within the town have been paid into the county treasury.\n11. The county council has not expended any money for the purposes of the said Act or of enforcing the same in the said town of Saint Stephen since the coming into operation of the Act in the said county, and the expense of such enforcement in the town has been wholly borne by the said town, except it may be the expense incidental to the imprisonment of persons convicted under the said Act in the county jail, of which expense the town bears its portion in the tax imposed for county contingencies in the county.\n12. It is admitted and mutually agreed that in case of judgment for the plaintiffs, the municipality shall only receive and be entitled to such funds as have not been expended bon\u00e2 fide for the purposes of the Act and remain in the hands of the town treasurer of the town of Saint Stephen at the time of such judgment,\nThe question to be determined by the court is whether under the above statement of facts the town of Saint Stephen is liable to pay over to the municipality of the county of Charlotte the said balance of Scott Act funds, and if it shall be of opinion that the town is so liable then judgment is to be rendered for the plaintiff, otherwise judgment to be for the defendants.\nUpon this case the Supreme Court of New Brunswick held that the town of St. Stephen is not separated from the county of Charlotte for municipal purposes within the meaning of the order in council of September 1886, and therefore not entitled to the fines collected on prosecutions under the Canada Temperance Act. The town appealed.\nBlair Q.C, Attorney General of New Brunswick, for the appellants referred to Caledonian Railway Co. v. North British Railway Co.[1] on the construction of the order in council.\nPugsley Q.C. and Grimmer for the respondents relied on Leeds & Grenville v. The Town of Brockville[2] where the same order in council was under consideration.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014I concur in the judgment prepared by Mr. Justice Sedgewick.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014I expressed my opinion at the argument that this appeal should be allowed. A further consideration of the case has confirmed me in that opinion. I agree in Mr. Justice Hanington\u2019s reasoning. I cannot see that the appellant is incorporated at all but for municipal purposes so as to make it a legal entity separate and distinct for such purposes. The words \u201cseparated for municipal purposes\u201d in the order in council are meaningless. I do not know of any incorporated town that is not separated from the county for municipal purposes; and I might, perhaps, add that there are very few, if any, that are so separated absolutely and for all municipal purposes whatsoever. GWYNNE J.\u2014By the Dominion statute 49 Vic. ch. 48, it was enacted that where no other provision is made by any law of Canada for the application of any fine, penalty or forfeiture imposed for the violation of any such law the same shall belong to the Crown for the public uses of Canada; and,\n2. That the Governor in Council might, from time to time, direct that any fine, penalty or forfeiture or any portion thereof which would otherwise belong to the Crown for the public uses of Canada should be paid to any provincial, municipal or local authority which wholly or in part bears the expenses of administering the law under which such fine, penalty or forfeiture is imposed or that the same should be applied in any other manner deemed best adapted to attain the objects of such law and to secure its due administration.\nBy an order in council made in pursuance of this enactment bearing date the 13th day of November, 1886, it was ordered that:\nAll fines, penalties or forfeitures recovered or enforced under the Canada Temperance Act of 1878, and amendments thereto, within any city or county or any incorporated town separated for municipal purposes from the county which would otherwise belong to the Crown for the public uses of Canada should be paid to the treasurer of the city, incorporated town or county, as the case may be, for the purposes of the said Act.\nIn the treasury of the town of St. Stephen there is a sum of money collected within the town as and for fines inflicted upon persons prosecuted within the town for breach of the Canada Temperance Act which sums have been paid into the said treasury to the credit of a special fund called the Scott Act fund; it is admitted that the prosecutions in which these fines were inflicted were conducted wholly at the expense of the town except only such expense as may have been incidental to the imprisonment in the county jail of persons convicted under the Act; and the question now is whether the town of St. Stephen or the county of Charlotte is entitled to those moneys; the contention of the town being that it is; and of the county that it is not, the contention of the latter being that the town of St. Stephen is not an incorporated town separated, for municipal purposes from the county, within the meaning of the above order. This question must, in my opinion, be answered in favour of the appellant, the defendant in the court below, in whose favour judgment must be rendered upon the case stated.\nBy the New Brunswick Act 34 Vic. ch. 20, the inhabitants of that part of the parish of St. Stephen particularly specified in the Act were declared to be a town corporate in right and in name by the name of the town of St. Stephen. By the 3rd section of the Act it was enacted that the administration of the fiscal, prudential and municipal affairs and the whole legislative power and government of the said town should be vested in a mayor and six other persons, styled councillors, and in no other power or authority whatever. By the 69th section it was enacted that the jail of the county of Charlotte should be the jail of the said town of Saint Stephen, and that notwithstanding the same should be without the limits of the said town all warrants, commitments, &c. awarded under the Act whereby any person might be ordered to be confined in the common jail should have like powers and effect as if the common jail was within the limits of the town. This provision that the common jail of the county should be also the common jail of the incorporated town necessitated that the town should contribute to the expense of the maintenance of the common jail in some reasonable proportion to its use of the jail, but such use did not in the slightest degree detract from the completely independent, autonomous character of the corporation as established by the Act. So neither do the provisions of sections 64 and 65 detract from such autonomous character, the former of which enacts that the overseers of the poor for the parish of St. Stephen and the overseers of the town should make such arrangements for the support of the poor of the said town and parish as they or a majority of them might deem equitable, and the latter of which enacts that in any assessment for county purposes to be made in the parish of St. Stephen the sessions or county council should apportion the amount to be levied between that portion of the parish not incorporated and the town of St Stephen. So neither do the provisions of the Common School Act passed in the same session, 34 Vic. ch. 21, by which a fund called the county school fund was established composed of an amount equal to 30 cents for every inhabitant of the county according to the last preceding census, the duty of ascertaining which was imposed upon the clerks of the peace of the several counties, detract in the slightest degree from the complete independence of the incorporated town of St. Stephen as an autonomous municipal corporation separate for municipal purposes from the municipality of the county of Charlotte. Unless therefore there be some Act which qualifies the very precise terms of the Act of incorporation, and the provisions of section 61 of the St. Stephen incorporation amendment Act, 48th Vic. ch. 47, which enacts that all assessments required to be levied for town or county purposes shall be made by the assessors elected under that Act and shall be levied, assessed and collected under the provisions thereof, those Acts are conclusive upon the point that the town of St. Stephen is an incorporated town, separated for municipal purposes from the county of Charlotte on which territorially it is situate, and upon this point the 3rd section of ch. 99 of the Consolidated Statutes of New Brunswick, which is the Act relating to the general incorporation of county municipalities, has been referred to as enacting that:\nThis chapter shall not extend to nor include within the municipality of any county any city or incorporated town in the county, which by Act of Assembly is \u201cwholly withdrawn\u201d from the jurisdiction of the county.\nThe argument, as I understand it, is that no incorporated town in the province of New Brunswick, unless by Act of Assembly it be expressly or impliedly \u201cwholly withdrawn\u201d from the jurisdiction of the county council, can be said to be separated for municipal purposes from the county. The very same section, however, enacts that nothing in the chapter contained shall interfere with, limit or restrain the corporate powers or privileges of any city or incorporated town. It is plain, therefore, that the provision in the Act that the town council of the town of St. Stephen shall annually send one of its own members to the county council as an ex officio county councillor, does not, nor does any other provision in the Act, in the slightest degree qualify, limit or restrain the corporate powers and privileges of the incorporated town of St. Stephen. With great deference I do not at present see the difficulty in holding, if it were necessary, that the inhabitants of the town of St. Stephen are a corporate body incorporated by the name of the town of St. Stephen and are by the terms of their acts of incorporation \u201cwholly withdrawn\u201d from the jurisdiction of the county council, although certain funds and property, in which as being distinct, independent corporations, they are mutually interested, are not so withdrawn, but are (for the very reason that they are wholly distinct municipal corporations separated one from the other but mutually interested in such funds and property) placed under special legislation in the interest of both. But we are not, I think, concerned in inquiring what distinction, if any, there was in the opinion of the legislature of New Brunswick, between a town separated for municipal purposes from the county in which it is territorially situate and one wholly withdrawn from the jurisdiction of the county council or what was intended by the two provisions of the same section in the Act 48 Vic. ch. 47, namely, that nothing in the Act contained should interfere with, limit or restrain the corporate powers or privileges of any incorporated town, and that the Act should not extend to nor include within the municipality of any county an incorporated town in the county by Act of Assembly wholly withdrawn from the jurisdiction of the county council. The question before us is not as to the construction of that Act, but as to the true construction of an order of the Governor General in Council made upon the authority of a statute of the Dominion Parliament, the statute declaring that the Governor in Council may, from time to time, direct that any fine, &c., &c., or any portion thereof which would otherwise belong to the Crown for the public purposes of Canada should be paid to any provincial, municipal or local authority which wholly or in part bears the expense of administering the law under which such fine, &c., &c., is imposed and the order in council directing that:\nall fines, &c., &c., recovered under the Canada Temperance Act of 1878, and the amendments thereto, within any city or county, or any incorporated town separated for municipal purposes from the county, which would otherwise belong to the Crown for the public uses of Canada, shall be paid to the treasurer of the city, incorporated town or county, as the case may be, for the purposes of the said Act.\nNow that the incorporated town of St. Stephen is a provincial, municipal and local authority within the meaning of the statute cannot be questioned and that it is an incorporated town separated for municipal purposes from the county of Charlotte within the meaning of the order cannot, in my opinion, admit of any doubt notwithstanding that both corporations have a joint interest in the common jail which is situate within the limits of the county but outside of the limits of the town, and in the funds called the county contingencies fund and the county school fund, which funds are not wholly withdrawn from the jurisdiction of the county council, for both county and town corporations are interested therein, but the town corporation may notwithstanding be well said to be wholly withdrawn from the county municipality as it most undoubtedly, in my opinion, is separated for municipal purposes from the county. The appeal must therefore, in my opinion, be allowed with costs and judgment be ordered to be entered for the defendant in the court below as the party entitled to the moneys in question.\nReference was made in argument to certain sections of chapter 100 of the Consolidated Statutes of New Brunswick, which is a statute regarding the assessment and levying of taxes in the several municipalities and parishes in the province, but I have not referred to them as they do not, in my opinion, in any manner affect or prejudice the right of the town of St. Stephen to the moneys in question.\nSEDGEWICK J.\u2014The sole question upon this appeal is as to whether the town of St. Stephen is an incorporated town, separated for municipal purposes from the county of Charlotte within the meaning of an order of the Governor General in Council of the 15th November, 1886, whereby it was ordered that all fines, penalties or forfeitures recovered or enforced under the Canada Temperance Act, 1878, and amendments thereto, within any city, or county, or incorporated town, separated for municipal purposes from the county, which would otherwise belong to the Crown for the public uses of Canada, were directed to be paid to the treasurer of the city, incorporated town or county as the case may be, for the purpose of the said Act.\nThe Supreme Court of New Brunswick decided that St. Stephen was not a town separate from the county for municipal purposes within the meaning of that order in council. Palmer and Landry JJ. dissenting, and it is from that judgment that this appeal is taken.\nIn my judgment this appeal should be allowed. The evident policy and intention of the Governor General in Council in making the order in question and specifying the authority entitled to all fines recovered under the provisions of the Canada Temperance Act, was doubtless to give effect to the principle expressed in the converse of the maxim qui sentit commodum sentire debet et onus (he who sustains a burden ought to derive the advantage.) It was intended that where a city, county or town with a view to the public welfare undertook to and did incur the expense of enforcing the Canada Temperance Act, the enforcing authority should receive the moneys recovered thereby which would otherwise belong to the Crown. This manifest intent must be borne in mind in giving a meaning to the order in council, and effect must be given to that aim if it can be done consistently with the terms in which that order is expressed. The question then is: Is the town of St. Stephen separate from the county for municipal purposes? The county of Charlotte was an incorporated municipality years before the incorporation of the town of St. Stephen. The regulation of its municipal affairs was given to its county council. That council had municipal control for all the territory within its limits. Its jurisdiction was coterminous with those limits. Its power to make by-laws (now regulated by section 96 of chapter 99 of the Consolidated Statutes of New Brunswick) was clearly defined, covering in a general sense all those subjects in respect of which municipal bodies throughout Canada are usually given jurisdiction. Such was the state of affairs when by an Act of Assembly (34 Vic. ch. 26) the town of St. Stephen was incorporated, the full charter of the town being now contained in the Act (48 Vic. ch. 47). By this charter the limits of the town were defined, section 3 providing:\nThat the fiscal, prudential and municipal affairs and the whole legislative power and government of the said town shall be vested in one principal officer who shall be the mayor of the town of St. Stephen, and in six other persons, and in no other power or authority whatever, two of whom shall be annually elected for each ward and shall be styled councillor, and all of whom shall be severally elected.\nSection 47 of the charter gives authority to the town council to make by-laws. The jurisdiction thereby given to the town council in respect of the territorial area of the town is substantially the same as the jurisdiction which the county council possessed in regard to its territorial area. There can be no question but that immediately upon the incorporation of the town the jurisdiction of the county council in regard to the area comprised in the town substantially ceased, the authority of the town council supervening and taking the place of the authority previously exercised over the town limits by the county council. Did the whole matter rest here there could not, I think, be any question but that the town, by the mere fact of its incorporation, and by its having been given the powers to which I have referred, thereby became separate from the county. There was an absolute destruction of the ordinary and general powers of municipal legislation so far as the town limits were concerned which the county council had previously exercised. There was, in effect, a legislative declaration that thereafter the territorial area of the county should be separated or divided for municipal purposes, and that for the one portion the county council should alone have jurisdiction and for the other the town council should alone have jurisdiction; a legislative declaration, too, that in so far as the town council had power to enforce law and order within the town it might use municipal funds for that purpose, funds derivable from such persons and property only as were within its domain, the county council having the like power in respect to persons and property within its domain. So far and for these purposes it cannot be disputed that the town is separate from the county. The contention, however, is that before the town could take the benefit of the order in council it must not only be separate from the county territorially and for the ordinary and common powers of municipal self-government, but it must be wholly separate from the county for all purposes; the two must have nothing in common; they must have separate and different machinery for the carrying on of their respective purposes; that inasmuch as in the present case the town of St. Stephen by express statutory provision sends a councillor to the county council; that the valuators appointed by the county council have certain jurisdiction within the town; that the county council may order the town to assess for purposes common to both county and town, and the county jail, court house and record office are jointly maintained by the town and county; and that the salary of the sheriff, clerk of the peace and other officers, are made up by the joint contribution of town and county alike; it is contended that these and other similar facts sustained the contention that the town is not separate (that is wholly separate) from the county for municipal purposes and that therefore the fines in question belong to the county.\nI have not been able to appreciate the strength of this contention. The object of the legislature in setting apart St. Stephen as a town was to give it the advantage of municipal town government. It was practically impossible to absolutely separate the town from the county to the same extent as two contiguous counties are separated. The town when created did not require a county jail for its own exclusive use, nor a court house, nor a sheriff, nor a registrar of deeds, nor a special sittings of the court of assize. There were of necessity a few matters, such as the maintenance of these institutions and the payment of these officials and expenses, that were common to both corporations, and therefore special provisions were made in the statute in relation to them, the general power of municipal government within their respective areas being exclusively given to the respective councils. If the other contention is to prevail and no town can take the benefit of the order in council unless wholly separate from the county for all municipal purposes, then, so far as I know, there is not a town in Canada that would be covered by the order in council. So far as I know, there is not a city in Canada that is wholly separate for all municipal purposes from the county of which it forms a part. Halifax, St. John, Ottawa, are all connected by legislative enactments in some way or other with the county of which they each territorially form part. Every city in Canada has to a greater or less extent some connection, some joint function to perform, with the county in which it is situated and of which it forms a part, and this is to a much greater extent true of the connection for common purposes between towns generally through Canada and the counties from which they for municipal purposes have been set apart.\nIn my view it is a perfectly accurate use of language to say that towns such as St. Stephen, and there are scores of them throughout the Dominion, are separate from the counties in which they are situate, for municipal purposes, notwithstanding the fact that there may be many common objects in which the two councils have a common interest and must therefore act together.\nIn coming to this view I have not overlooked the meaning which by express definition the Municipal Act of Ontario gives to the phrase used in the order in council, but the phrase in that Act must be interpreted as therein defined. Other rules must govern, ordinary principles of interpretation must be observed, when the true meaning of this document is to be ascertained. The order has all the force of and is in effect a statute of Canada and must be interpreted by rules applicable to the whole of Canada, and not by a provision in a provincial statute made especially applicable to that province and that statute alone.\nI am of opinion that the appeal should be allowed and that judgment should be entered for the defendants with the costs of this appeal and of all costs in the court below.\nKING J.\u2014I regret to have to differ. The question is whether the town of St. Stephen is an incorporated town separated from the county of Charlotte within the meaning of the order in council of 15th November, 1886. It is convenient first to inquire into the meaning of the words of the order in council \u201cany incorporated town, separated for municipal purposes from the county.\u201d All towns that are incorporated are ex vi termini to some extent separated for municipal purposes from the county. The object of civic incorporation is municipal self-government, greater or less according to the circumstances. But this is not enough to fill the terms of the order in council. Not all incorporated towns are meant. The incorporated town must be therefore in a fuller sense separated. It must be separated wholly for municipal purposes from the county, or what amounts to the same thing separated from the county for all municipal purposes. An incorporated town is not separated for municipal purposes from the county if there is any organic union between it and the county for any municipal purpose whatever. This, I think, is the natural meaning of the words, and is supported and illustrated also by a state of facts existing in this province at the time of the passing of the order in council. Under the Ontario municipal system, as I understand it, there were and are two classes of incorporated towns. Both classes have large powers of self-government, but they differ in this, that the one has, and the other has not, an organic union with the county for some municipal purposes. Incorporated towns may, upon certain conditions, pass from one of these states to the other. The term used in the order in council, \u201cincorporated towns separated from the county for municipal purposes,\u201d is an expression found in section 460 of the Municipal Act as indicating that class of incorporated town that has no organic union with the county for any municipal purpose.\nNow let us look at the state of things in New Brunswick where this appeal comes from. There, by chapter 99, Consolidated Statutes, every county in the province is erected into a municipality, and the municipality includes every city and incorporated town \u201cnot wholly withdrawn from the jurisdiction of the county council.\u201d Within the meaning of that Act there is only one city or incorporated town in the province to which that expression applies, viz., the city of Fredericton, in the county of York. Every other city and every incorporated town in the province is (under the municipal system of New Brunswick) an integral part of the municipality and is represented in the county council. Such is the case with the town of St. Stephen; such also the case of the city of St. John. The town of St. Stephen, like the city of St. John, has very wide powers of self-government; these extend to cover almost every subject of a municipal nature. Within their range of subjects the power of city and town is supreme and exclusive, but there are some subjects of municipal concern affecting them with which the county council has to do, and which are regulated and dealt with by the county council as representing them and the other parts of the municipality. For instance the city and town are organically united with the rest of the county in the management and control of public buildings used for general municipal purposes; in the appointment and payment of certain officers for general county purposes; in the levying of rates for county contingencies, and in the determination of the amount which the town or city and each parish throughout the county shall contribute to county rates. For instance, one considerable rate imposed upon the county is the county school rate for the support in part of the schools within the county. The proportion that each part of the county, including the cities and incorporated towns (other than the city of Fredericton), shall contribute to this is determined, like other county rates, by a valuation of the property of the entire county made at stated intervals by valuators appointed by the county council, and these valuators are paid out of the rates levied upon the entire county. Here is a very considerable and important municipal purpose that is under the jurisdiction of a body of which the incorporated town is organically a part, viz., the municipal council of the county. When the county municipality imposes rates and orders their collection upon the town of St. Stephen for a municipal purpose without the consent of the town, except so far as such consent is implied by its being part of the governing body of the county, it is impossible to say that it is, within the ordinary and natural meaning of the term, separated from the county for municipal purposes. It is entirely immaterial that the rate when ordered is levied and collected through the machinery of the town. I conclude, (therefore, that although the town of St. Stephen has a wider range of self-government than the incorporated towns of Ontario that are not separated from the counties for municipal purposes, it has less power of self-government than the incorporated towns in Ontario that come specifically within the meaning of the language of the order in council and of the Municipal Act of Ontario as \u201cincorporated towns separated from the county for municipal purposes.\u201d An incorporated town is not so separated when there is an organic connection between it and the county for any municipal purpose, and when it has or may have a certain share in the government of the county by reason of its being represented in the municipal council and entitled to take part in the municipal affairs of the county.\nThis is a sensible view too considering the nature of the order in council. Its object is to regulate the application of fines, etc., under the Canada Temperance Act. The legislative unit under that Act is the city and the county. The Act is adopted in city or in county as the case may be. It is reasonable therefore that the fines should go to city or to county, as the case may be, and that in the case of a county they should be diverted from it to an incorporated town within its territorial limits only where there is an entire want of identification or organic union for any municipal purpose between the two.\nFor these reasons I think that the appeal should be dismissed.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for appellant: James Mitchell.\nSolicitor for respondent: W.

Figes (2 Sim. 319) followed.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick affirming the ruling of the Judge in Equity who held that he had no jurisdiction to grant a new trial in the case.\nThe sole question for decision on this appeal was whether or not the present Judge in Equity, Mr. Justice Barker, could hear an application for a new trial, the former trial having been had before his predecessor Mr. Justice Palmer. The decision of this question depended on the construction to be placed on 53 Vic. ch. 4, sec. 85, which provides that in an equity suit \u201ceither party may apply for a new trial to the judge before whom the trial was had.\u201d Mr. Justice Barker refused to hear the application holding that the statute authorized it to be made before no judge but Mr. Justice Palmer. His decision was affirmed by the full court. The plaintiff then appealed to this court.\nC. A. Stockton for the appellant referred to Footner v. Figes[1]; Pemberton v. Pemberton[2].\nPalmer Q.C. for the respondent. The court will not interfere on a mere matter of procedure. Gladwin v. Cummings[3].\nAs to the merits see Armstrong v. Armstrong[4]; Hodge v. Reid[5].\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014This suit was brought in the Supreme Court in Equity of the province of New Brunswick, and on the cause coming on for hearing before Mr. Justice Palmer, then the Judge in Equity, certain issues were directed by that learned judge to be tried by a jury. The jury by a majority verdict found the issues in favour of the respondent. The appellant moved for a new trial before Mr. Justice Palmer. Afterwards and before the hearing of the motion, Mr. Justice Palmer resigned his office as a judge of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick. By Act of the legislature of New Brunswick, 57 Vic., chap. 7, it was enacted:\nThat from and after the going into effect of this Act the Supreme Court shall be composed of a Chief Justice and five puisne judges.\nAnd it was further enacted:\nThat it shall be the duty of the judges of the Supreme Court, by order to be made from time to time, to assign one of their number to attend specially to business upon the equity side of the court.\nUnder the authority of this Act the judges of the Supreme Court, by order duly made, assigned one of their number, Mr. Justice Barker, to attend specially to business on the equity side of the court. After the passing of this Act and after the making of the order assigning Mr. Justice Barker to act as equity judge, a motion was made to him for a new trial in this case. This motion was opposed by the counsel for the respondent on the ground that, under the 85th section, cap. 4, Acts 1890, relating to practice and proceedings in the Supreme Court in Equity, which enacts that\neither party may apply for a new trial to the judge before whom the trial was held,\na motion for a new trial could only be made to the judge before whom the trial was had and that Mr. Justice Barker could not hear the application for that reason.\nThe learned judge gave effect to the objection, determined that he had no jurisdiction, and refused to entertain the application for a new trial. From this order the appellant appealed to the Supreme Court of New Brunswick, which court (Mr. Justice Hanington dissenting) dismissed the appeal. From this judgment the present appeal is brought.\nIt is argued for the respondent that the decision of the Supreme Court was right inasmuch as the statute means that the application for a new trial should be made to the judge who tried the cause personally, and that it is not sufficient that it should be made to his successor in the event of the former having vacated the office. I am unable to agree in this conclusion; on the contrary I entirely concur with Mr. Justice Hanington both in the conclusions at which he arrived and the reasons he has given therefor.\nWithout authority I should have thought that such a very inconvenient construction as that adopted by the learned judges of the Supreme Court could hardly have been sustained. The result of the decision of the Supreme Court would of course be that in every case where a trial of issues in an equity suit had taken place, and the judge who tried them had either died or resigned before a new trial was moved for, there could be no new trial. An intention to enact a law leading to such a failure of justice ought not to be attributed to the legislature except on the strongest expressions and only in the absence of a possibility of giving any other meaning to the language used. I see no difficulty in giving to the words used a sensible meaning which would prevent any such inconvenient and unjust consequence as would follow in the present case if the order now appealed against should stand. In my opinion the judge referred to in the statute before whom the new trial is to be moved for does not mean the same natural person as the judge before whom the trial took place, but the person filling the same office and exercising the same jurisdiction. No reason can be suggested why the motion should be necessarily made to the person who presided at the trial, whilst there was a good reason why the jurisdiction should be assigned to the judge in equity whoever he might be, namely, that the motion should be made to that judge and not to the Supreme Court in banc. I think this was the intention of the legislature and I should have come to that conclusion even in the absence of authority. The case of Footner v. Figes[6], cited by Mr. Justice Hanington is however a conclusive authority in support of his view. A motion was made before Vice Chancellor Sir Lancelot Shadwell for a new trial of an issue which had been directed by Sir John Leach, when Vice Chancellor. Sir John Leach had been afterwards and before the motion was made, promoted to the office of Master of the Rolls. There was a general order of the court which directed that every application for a new trial should be made to the judge who directed the issue, and the question was raised whether the motion ought not to be made before the Master of the Rolls. But the Vice Chancellor said that \u201cthe meaning of the order was that the motion should be made before the same jurisdiction though the judge might have been removed. This case seems to me directly in point, for I cannot adopt the suggestion that any distinction between it and the present case is to be made because we are here construing a section of a statute whilst in Footner v. Figes the question depended on the interpretation of a general order. Such orders are always construed on the same principle as statutes.\nThe appeal must be allowed with costs and the cause remitted with a declaration that the present learned judge in equity has jurisdiction to hear the motion for a new trial.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014I am of opinion that this appeal should be dismissed. This statute may be absurd but fortunately we have not to remedy all the absurdities to be found in the statute-book. I am against judicial legislation. Then this is a question of practice and procedure, and, as we held lately again in Arpin v. Merchants Bank[7], one we should not interfere with.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014I concur in the construction put upon the statute by Mr. Justice Hanington in the court below, and so am of opinion that the learned judge in equity had jurisdiction in the matter. The appeal must therefore be allowed with costs and the case remitted to him to exercise such jurisdiction.\nSEDGEWICK and KING JJ. concurred.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: C.

Another clause of the will was as follows: \u201cIt is my intention that upon the decease of either of my children without issue, if any other child be then dead the issue of such latter child (if any) shall at once take the fee simple of the devise mentioned in the second and third clauses of this my will.\u201d\nHeld, affirming the decision of the Court of Appeal, that if the limitation in the third clause, instead of being to the issue to hold in fee simple had been to the heirs general of the issue, the son, J., under the rule in Shelley\u2019s case, would have taken an estate tail; that the word \u201cissue\u201d though prim\u00e2 facie a word of limitation equivalent to \u201cheirs of the body\u201d is a more flexible expression than the latter and more easily diverted by a context or superadded limitations from its prim\u00e2 facie meaning; that it will be interpreted to mean \u201cchildren\u201d when such limitations or context requires it; that \u201cto hold in fee simple\u201d is an expression of known legal import admitting of no secondary or alternative meaning and must prevail over the word \u201cissue\u201d which is one of fluctuating meaning; and that effect must be given to the manifest intention of the testator that the issue should take a fee.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1], reversing the judgment of the Divisional Court[2], in favour of the defendants. The question for decision in this appeal turns upon the construction of the will of one Andrew Hamilton the clauses of which bearing upon the matters in issue, are as follows:\nThirdly, I give and devise lot * * * * to my son James for the full term of his natural life, and from and after his decease to the lawful issue of my said son James, to hold in fee simple, but in default of such issue him surviving then to my daughter said Sarah Jane for the term of her natural life, and upon the death of my daughter Sarah Jane then to the lawful issue of my said daughter Sarah Jane to hold in fee simple, but in default of such issue of my said daughter Sarah Jane then to my brothers and sisters and their heirs in equal shares.\nClause two devised other lands in the same way to the testator\u2019s daughter Sarah Jane with reversion on default of issue to the son.\nThe sixth clause is as follows:\nIt is my intention that upon the decease of either of my children without issue if my other child be then dead, the issue of such latter child (if any) shall at once take the fee simple of the devise mentioned in the second and third clauses of this my will.\nThe defendants claimed, and Mr. Justice Ferguson held, that under the provisions of clause three the son James took an estate tail by application of the rule in Shelley\u2019s case. The Court of Appeal reversed the decision of Mr. Justice Ferguson and held that James took only a life estate with remainder to his issue in fee. The defendants appealed.\nArmour Q.C. and McBrayne for the appellants. The interpretation put upon the will by the Court of Appeal is that it created an estate for life with an executory devise to grand children. But a devise will never be construed as executory if it can be held to be a remainder. Carwardine v. Carwardine[3]; Goodtitle v. Billington[4]; Fearne on Contingent Remainders[5]. A devise to A. for life and after his decease to the male issue of his body and their heirs and in default of issue to other devisees creates an estate tail in A. Frank v. Stovin[6]; and to the same effect are Denn v. Puckey[7]; Williams v. Williams[8]; Hellem v. Severs[9].\nThe words \u201cto hold in fee simple\u201d cannot control the meaning of \u201cissue\u201d and make it a word of purchase. Parker v. Clarke[10]; Roddy v. Fitzgerald[11].\nNesbitt Q.C. and Bicknell for the respondent. The rule in Shelley\u2019s case is a rule of law not of construction. Evans v. Evans[12].\nThe expression \u201cto hold in fee simple\u201d is one of known legal import and must have its legal effect unless from the context it is very clear that the testator meant otherwise. Doe d. Gallini v. Gallini[13]; Montgomery v. Montgomery[14].\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014The Court of Appeal in this case reversed the judgment of Mr. Justice Ferguson whereby judgment was directed to be entered for the present appellant.\nThe sole question for determination is the construction of the will of Andrew Hamilton. The date of this will was the first of April, 1869. It was therefore made before the passing of the Ontario Wills Act[15] and is unaffected by that statute. By the third clause of his will the testator devised the lands in question in this cause as follows:\u2014\nTo my son James for the full term of his natural life and from and after his decease to the lawful issue of my said son James to hold in fee simple, but in default of such issue him surviving then to my daughter said Sarah Jane for the term of her natural life, and upon the death of my daughter Sarah Jane, then to the lawful issue of my said daughter Sarah Jane to hold in fee simple, but in default of such issue of my said daughter Sarah Jane then to my brothers and sisters and their heirs in equal shares.\nBy the second paragraph the testator devised other lands to his daughter Sarah Jane in the same terms as those upon which by the third clause he devised the lands now in question to his son James, with similar devises over in favour of James and his issue, with a like ultimate gift over in favour of the testator\u2019s brothers and sisters.\nThe sixth paragraph was as follows:\nIt is my intention that upon the decease of either of my children without issue, if any other child be then dead, the issue of such latter child (if any) shall at once take the fee simple of the devise mentioned in the second and third clauses of this my will.\nMr. Justice Ferguson was of opinion that by the operation of the rule in Shelley\u2019s case the testator\u2019s son James took an estate tail which had been effectually barred by a disentailing assurance executed by the devisee. The Court of Appeal on the other hand have held that James took an estate for life with remainder to his children in fee.\nThe rule in Shelley\u2019s case, as is well known, is a rule not of construction but of law. Before applying it, however, it is requisite to ascertain, by the application of settled rules of construction, what was the testator\u2019s meaning by the language in which he has expressed himself.\nThe word \u201cissue\u201d is no doubt well settled to be prim\u00e2 facie a word not of purchase but of limitation equivalent to heirs of the body; it will, however, be interpreted as meaning \u201cchildren\u201d when that interpretation is required either by the context or from superadded limitations. The same may indeed be said of the more technical expression \u201cheirs of the body,\u201d which may be read as children, if the testator has sufficiently expressed his intention that that shall be done. The word \u201cissue\u201d is, however, said to be a more flexible expression than \u201cheirs of the body\u201d and will more readily be diverted by force of a context or superadded limitations from its prim\u00e2 facie meaning than the term \u201cheirs of the body.\u201d\nLord Brougham in Fetherston v. Fetherston[16], where the question was whether a gift to W.F. and his heirs male could by force of the subsequent words be cut down to an estate for life in W.F., thus states the rule:\nSo again if a limitation is made afterwards, and is clearly the main object of the will\u2014which never can take effect unless an estate for life be given instead of an estate tail\u2014here again the first words become qualified and bend to the general intent of the testator, and are no longer regarded as words of limitation, which, if standing by themselves, they would have been.\nIn the case before us the controversy has turned on the effect of the words \u201cto hold in fee simple\u201d following the gift to the issue of James. Mr. Justice Ferguson held that the words should have the same effect as if there had been a limitation to the issue and their heirs in which case the learned judge was of opinion that James would have taken an estate tail.\nThat a limitation to the heirs general of the issue would have that effect is, I think, clear upon the authorities. In Montgomery v. Montgomery[17], Sir Edward Sugden, L.C. of Ireland, says in his judgment:\nThus far it appears to be clearly settled that a devise to A. for life with remainder to his issue with superadded words of limitation in a manner inconsistent with a descent from A., will give to the word \u201cissue\u201d the operation of a word of purchase. This is established by a series of cases from Doe d. Cooper v. Collis[18] to Greenwood v. Rothwell[19] with which it may be found difficult to reconcile the decision in Tate v. Clark[20]. But I say this with hesitation and with great respect for the learned judge who pronounced the latter decision.\nUpon this passage there has been much criticism. Some text writers have insisted that the Lord Chancellor did not mean to apply his remarks to a case where the additional limitation was to the heirs general of the issue; others have thought differently, and have considered that the proposition was an erroneous statement of the principle to be deduced from the authorities. In the notes to Shelley\u2019s case in Tudor\u2019s leading cases on the law of Real Property[21] it is said:\nNor will a limitation to heirs general superadded to the word issue convert it into a word of purchase; and the rule in Shelley\u2019s case (as we have formerly seen is the case where a similar limitation comes after the limitation to the heirs of the body) will still take effect.\nIn Jarman on Wills[22], the law is laid down as follows:\nIt is also established that the addition of words of limitation to the heirs general of the issue will not prevent the word \u201cissue\u201d from operating to give an estate tail as a word of limitation.\nAnd in a subsequent page[23], the editor of the last edition of that work referring to Montgomery v. Montgomery and the passage already extracted from that judgment says:\nLord St. Leonards is sometimes cited as if he had laid down a contrary rule; but what he says is \u201ca devise to A. for life with remainder to his issue with superadded words of limitation in a manner inconsistent with a descent from A. will give the word \u2018issue\u2019 the operation of a word of purchase.\u201d\nthus pointing out that what Sir Edward Sugden referred to was a subsequent limitation changing the course of descent which is sufficient to convert even \u201cheirs of the body\u201d into words of purchase[24]. Mr. Hawkins in his treatise[25] says:\nBut under a devise to A. for life with remainder to his issue and their heirs without a gift over on failure of issue of A. it has been laid down by Lord St. Leonards in Montgomery v. Montgomery that the words of limitation exclude the rule and that the issue take by purchase.\nHe afterwards adds:\nIt may perhaps be doubted whether Montgomery v. Montgomery is on this point an authority at the present day.\nTheobald on Wills lays it down very distinctly that the addition of a limitation to the heirs of the issue does not prevent the operation of the rule; the learned author says[26]:\nWords of limitation in fee or in tail superadded to the word \u201cissue\u201d where there is a limitation in default of issue in cases before the Wills Act will not make it a word of purchase, provided they do not change the course of descent.\nIt is clear that in the case of an estate limited to the heirs of the issue there is no change of descent, as there would be if there was a limitation to the \u201cheirs male\u201d of the body, or \u201cheirs female\u201d of the body, of the issue,[27] inasmuch as heirs is restrained so as to mean the same class of heirs as the word issue itself imports, thus leaving the latter to operate as a word of limitation.\nIn Parker v. Clarke[28], Lord Cranworth said:\nI quite agree with the general rule which has been advanced in the argument that when the gift is to one for life and after his death to the issue of his body and the heirs of such issue for ever, there, by the addition of the words of limitation the testator is merely using words which are idle and which shall not prevail to convert the word \u201cissue\u201d into a word of purchase.\nIn that case as Alderson B. had already said in Lees v. Mosley[29]: The word \u201cheirs\u201d would be first restrained to \u201cheirs of the body\u201d and then altogether rejected as unnecessary.\nThe case of Parker v. Clarke, supported as it is by a great number of decided cases[30], is therefore conclusive of the question which had thus far been the subject of consideration. It is however a very different thing from holding that the general word \u201cheirs\u201d may be restricted to \u201cheirs of the body\u201d in order to conciliate it with the previous limitation to say that the words \u201cto hold in fee simple\u201d should, without any context, be translated as meaning \u201cto hold in fee tail,\u201d or be altogether rejected.\nIn the older cases a rule was applied which was generally stated as one which required that the particular intent should give way to the general intent, and although probably some traces of it still linger in the rule just referred to, that a limitation to heirs following a gift to issue shall be confined to heirs of the body, this rule is universally treated by modern authorities as exploded. In Doe d. Gallini v. Gallini[31], Lord Denman referring to this old rule says:\nThe doctrine that the general intent must overrule the particular intent has been much, and we conceive justly, objected to of late as being, as a general proposition, incorrect and vague and likely to lead in its application to erroneous results. In its origin it was merely descriptive of the rule in Shelley\u2019s case, and it has since been laid down in others where technical words of limitation have been used and other words showing the intention of the testator that the objects of his bounty should take in a different way from that which the law allows have been rejected; but in the latter cases the more correct mode of stating the rule of construction is, that technical words, or words of known legal import, must have their legal effect, even though the testator uses inconsistent words, unless those inconsistent words are of such a nature as to make it perfectly clear that the testator did not mean to use the technical words in their proper sense, and so it is said by Lord Redesdale in Jesson v. Wright[32]. This doctrine of general and par- ticular intent ought to be carried no further than this, and thus explained it should be applied to this and all other wills.\nWere we to give effect to the appellants\u2019 contention in the present case we should not only be reviving the old and exploded rule of the general intent overriding the particular intent, but applying it in a manner much stronger than any of the cases, decided in times when it was generally approved of, afford a single instance of. We have here not a word like \u201cheirs,\u201d but in the words \u201cto hold in fee simple\u201d an expression of \u201cknown legal import\u201d which can admit of no secondary or alternative meaning. Then we have the inconsistent word \u201cissue,\u201d and as we cannot reconcile the two, except by reading \u201cissue\u201d in its secondary meaning as equivalent to children, that must be done.\nAs to the word \u201cissue\u201d we find it laid down in the authorities over and over again that it is a flexible word which will yield its primary meaning more readily than \u201cheirs of the body.\u201d As Alderson B. puts it in Lees v. Mosley[33]:\nBut the authorities clearly show that whatever be the prim\u00e2 facie meaning of the word \u201cissue\u201d it will yield to the intention of the testator to be collected from the will, and that it requires a less demonstrative context to show such intention than the technical expression \u201cheirs of the body\u201d would do.\nWe have already seen that even the words \u201cheirs of the body\u201d themselves will have to give way if there is a change in the course of descent.\nThen can it be doubted that when we have this word of fluctuating meaning \u201cissue\u201d coupled with the unyielding words \u201cto be held in fee simple\u201d that the latter are to prevail over the former, and that we must refuse either to strike out the words \u201cto hold in fee simple\u201d or, in defiance of the testator\u2019s expressed intention, to alter his will by reading them as meaning something entirely different, namely, \u201cto hold in fee tail.\u201d I think there can be no doubt but that we must give effect to the manifest intention of the testator. The question is whether he meant the issue of his son to take in fee simple, and in so many words he said that he did. Would it be anything short of setting aside the will were we on technical grounds to hold that \u201cfee simple\u201d did not mean \u201cfee simple,\u201d or to reject it as altogether meaningless?\nThree modern cases of the highest authority, Abbott v. Middleton[34], Grey v. Pearson[35], and Roddy v. Fitzgerald[36], have now settled the general rule of construction to be that every word which the testator has used is to be given effect to and nothing is to be rejected if it is in any way possible to reconcile and give a consistent meaning to the terms in which the testator has expressed himself.\nI have not adverted particularly to the sixth clause, but I may say generally that so far from detracting from the construction before indicated that part of the will greatly strengthens it.\nThe judgment of the Court of Appeal was entirely right and must be affirmed and the appeal dismissed with costs.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014I am of the same opinion.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014I cannot entertain a doubt upon reading the second, third and sixth clauses of the testator Andrew Hamilton\u2019s will, that the testator, by the terms \u201cto hold in fee simple,\u201d as used in the second and third clauses, and the expression \u201cshall at once take the fee simple of the devise mentioned in the second and third clauses,\u201d as used in the sixth clause, meant to devise exactly what the words express, namely, an estate in fee simple and not a fee tail, and there is no rule of law which can override a testator\u2019s intention plainly expressed. The estate devised to the testator\u2019s son James, to which alone the question submitted in the case relates, is an estate for life only and the appeal must be dismissed with costs.\nSEDGEWICK and KING JJ. concurred.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Teetzel, Harrison & McBrayne.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Nesbitt & Gould.\n[1] 21 Ont.

G. c. 135, s. 29 Contract of sale\u2014Contre lettre\u2014Principal and agent\u2014Construction of contract\nThe plaintiff who had acted as agent for the late J. B. S., brought an action for $1,471.07 for a balance of account as negotiorum gestor of J.B.S., against the defendants, executors of J.B.S. The defendants in addition to a general denial, pleaded compensation for $3,416 and interest. The plaintiff replied that this sum was paid by a dation en paiement of certain immovables. The defendants answered that the transaction was not a giving in payment but a giving of a security. The Court of Queen's Bench reversing the judgment of the Superior Court held that the defendants had been paid by the dation en paiement of the immovables, and that the defendants owed a balance of $1,154 to the plaintiff.\nHeld that the pecuniary interest of the defendants affected by the judgment appealed from was more than $2000 over and above the plaintiff's claim and therefore the case was appealable under R. S. C. c. 135, s. 29.\nThe sale of property in this case was controlled by a writing in the nature of a contre lettre, by which it was agreed as follows: \"the vander in consideration of the sum of $2,940 makes and executes this day a clear and valid deed in favour of the purchaser of certain property (therein described), and the purchaser for the term of three years is to let the vendor have control of the said deeded property, to manage as well, safely and properly as he would if the said property was his own, and bargain and sell the said property for the best price that can be had for the same, and pay the rent, interest and purchase money when sold, and all the avails of the said property to the purchaser to the amount of $2,940, and interest at the rate of eight per cent per annum from the date of three presents, and then the said purchaser shall re-deed to the vendor any part of the said property that may remain unsold after receiving the aforesaid amount and interest.\"\nThe vendor was at the time indebted to the purchaser in the sum of $2,941. The two documents were registered. The vendor had other properties and gave the purchaser a power of attorney to convey all his real estate in the same locality. The term of three years mentioned in the contre lettre was continued by mutual consent. The vendor subsequently paid amounts on account of his general indebtedness to the purchaser. It was only after the purchaser's death that the vendor claimed from the heirs of the purchaser the balance above mentioned, of $1400 as owing to him for the management of his properties.\nHeld, reversing the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench, and restoring the judgment of the Superior Court, that the proper construction of the contract was to be gathered from both documents and dealings of the parties, and that the property having been deeded merely as security it was not an absolute sale and that plaintiff was not M. S.'s agent in respect of this property.\nHeld also, that the only action plaintiff had was the action mandata contraria with a tender of his reddition de compte.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada (appeal side) reversing the judgment of the Superior Court for the district of St. Francis.\nThe action was brought by the respondent against the appellants executors of and residuary legatee under the last will of J.B Shurtleff to pay him the sum of $1,471.77 balance of amount due him as agent or mandatory of the said J B Shurtleff A statement of the facts and pleadings appears in the judgment of Mr. Justice Taschereau hereinafter given.\nOn the 27th February 1894, a motion was made by Butler Q.C. to quash the appeal for want of jurisdiction on the ground that the amount in controversy was under $2,000 and Mr. Buchan was heard for the appellants.\nOn the 1st May the following judgment was delivered on the motion:\nTASCHEREAU J. This case comes up on a motion by the respondent to quash the appeal. The plaintiff's action was for $1470 for a balance of account as mandatary or negotiorum gestor of the defendant. The plea amounts to, besides the general issue, a plea of compensation for $3,416, with interest at 8 per cent from October, 1888, on $2,941, to which the plaintiff Taplin, replied that the $3,416 were paid by a dation en paiement called a sale of certain immovables The defendant Hunt, answered that these immovables were not given to him by the plaintiff en paiement, but merely as a pledge. The Court of Queen's Bench dismissed this contention of the defendant and his \"olea of compensation, holding that he had been paid by the dation en paiement of the immovables in question and that he owed plaintiff a balance of $1,154 accrued since as his agent. The defendant now appeals. I think it clear that we have jurisdiction. The amount in controversy is clearly over $2,000. The defendant claims more than $2,000 over and above the plaintiffs claim, assuming that he owes plaintiff all that is claimed by the action. Reus excipiendo fit actor; he became plaintiff by his plea for an amount exceeding $2,000. It is true that he did not become plaintiff incident for the balance of his account over the plaintiff's but the amount in controversy, nevertheless is for the whole of his claim. The whole of it stands dismissed by the judgment appealed from. As long as that judgment stands he has no action against the plaintiff for the balance of his claim. His pecuniary interest in this appeal amounts, therefore to a sum exceeding $2,000. The motion to quash is dismissed with costs. I refer to Macfarlane v Leclaire ([1]); Buntin v. Hibbird ([2]); Gould v Sweet ([3]);. Gauffre v. Philipee ([4]).\nOn the merits Geoffrion Q.C and Buchan for the appellants, contended:\nThat the deed of sale from respondent to J. B. Shurtleff of the four properties in question, and the contre-lettre, which were passed at the same time, must be interpreted as one contract the effect of which was that the properties in question were merely transferred by Taplin to said Shurtleff as security for the debt of $2,941 due by him, and that the only interest which the said Shurtleff had in the said properties was the said sum of $2,941.\nThat the right of redemption stipulated by the contre-lettre of 23rd December 1880, accepted by Taplin, had been extended by Shurtleff beyond the three years, and had been acted upon by both parties thereafter up to the time of Shurtleff's death and treated as a continued obligation, the last payment on account of Taplin's original indebtedness, and in the exercise of the right of redemption, having been made by Taplin and accepted by Shurtleff, and credited on that account only a few weeks before the latter's death. That the r\u00e9sum\u00e9 of the evidence as to the credits in Shurtleff's book clearly establishes this \"point and in corroboration if any is required are the other facts and circumstances disclosed by the record. Bearing on the question of the extension of the time for redemption by Shurtleff, the acceptance of it by Taplin, and the consequent valid and binding contract the following authorities were cited:\u2014\nParsons on Contracts ([5]); Dignard v. Robitaille ([6]); Deniers v. Lynch ([7]); Dorion v. St. Germain ([8]) Laurent ([9]).\nH. B. Brown Q.C., for the respondent.\nWas the real agreement between the parties, as contended for by the appellant, a sale with right of redemption, or a contract or pledge?\nIf Mr. Shurtleff was taking, or thought he was taking, the property in pledge he would not have surrendered the titles of his claim. The surrender of the original titles of obligation is a legal presumption of release or discharge of indebtedness. (C. C. 1181) the presumption may be rebutted but no attempt has been made to rebut it. It is not even pretended that these notes were surrendered through any error, nor is the legal presumption of payment explained away.\nNo renewals of the notes were ever given no new acknowledgment of indebtedness was ever made and the appellants do not produce any evidence of the pre-tended claim of $3,416.77, which they offer in compensation.\nThe original promissory notes, had they remained in the possession of Mr. Shurtleff would have been discharged by limitation of time years before his death, and yet plaintiff never was called upon to give any renewals or any new acknowledgment.\nIt is quite manifest that these notes were discharged and paid by the sale and were intended to be so discharged by both parties.\nWhere, then, is the evidence of any indebtedness for which the real estate could be held in pledge; and if there is no principal debt or obligation there can be no collateral security.\nAgain, if the two deeds really embody a contract of pledge the ownership must have remained in plaintiff.\nBut the one deed is an absolute deed of sale and there is nothing in the other deed to show that the parties intended it in any other sense.\nIt is claimed that this contract is in reality, not what the parties to it have called it and what on its face it appears to be, but that it is rather a giving in payment (C. C. 1592), as the vendor (plaintiff) was owing Shurtleff at the time the sum of $2,941, the amount of promissory notes held by Shurtleff against him.\nThe only distinction the code makes between a giving in payment and a sale is that the dation en paiement is perfected only by actual delivery. Delivery, however, is not necessary to pass the property to the creditor (C. C. 1025 1472) but the debt is not extinguished until the actual delivery of the thing given in payment.\nDrouin v Provencher ([10]) Dignard v. Robitaille ([11]).\nThe question whether this contract is to be regarded as a sale or a giving in payment, is immaterial, as it was followed by delivery, that is to say, by such delivery as can be made of real estate (C. C. 1492, 1493). See also the remarks of the commissioners who prepared the code on article 1493 (article 16 of the projet of the code). Cod. Reports ([12]).\nIt is true that plaintiff continued to manage these properties, as he did other properties of Shurtleff, under power of attorney, collected the rents, paid the taxes and negotiated the sale, as an ordinary mandatary would do but possession was in the mandator. (C. C. 2192).\nAs to the effect of the contre-lettre the learned counsel cited and commented on Laurent ([13]).\nIn support of his action the learned counsel also cited Civil Code ([14]); Joseph v. Phillips\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nTASCHEREAU J.__I would allow this appeal and re store the judgment of the Superior Court. The plain tiff, now respondent, claims from the defendants, as legal representatives of one Shurtleff, deceased, a sum of $1,471, which he alleges was due to him by the said Shurtleff for services rendered as his agent and man datary in connection with certain properties in the town of Coaticook, and disbursements by him made in the administration of the said properties. The plea denies that the plaintiff ever acted as Shurtleff's agent and sets forth that on the 23rd December, 1880, he, the plaintiff being indebted to Shurtleff in the sum of $2, 941 transferred to him under colour of a sale certain real estate in the town of Coaticook; that the said real estate was transferred to Shurtleff in accordance with well established usage, merely as security for the aforesaid amount of $2,941 due by plaintiff to him, and that it was understood and agreed that the property should be managed and administered by plaintiff as his own that on the same date as the execution of the said deed a contre-lettre was executed between the same parties by which it was agreed that the plaintiff should have this right at any time within three years to redeem the real estate on repayment to Shurtleff of the said sum of $2,941 with interest at eight per cent and that this contre-lettre had been registered by the plaintiff who had retained the original in his possession; that the said plaintiff from the date thereof accepted the said right of redemption, and availed himself thereof, and the same became between the said parties equivalent to and in fact was a contract in the nature of a promise of sale from Shurtleff accepted by the plaintiff, by which Shurtleff agreed to sell the property to the plaintiff, and the plaintiff agreed to buy the same for the said price of twenty-nine hundred and forty-one dollars with interest thereon at the rate of eight per centum per annum; that this promise and agreement had been accepted by plaintiff, who had thus promised and agreed to repay to Shurtleff the said sum of twenty-nine hundred and forty-one dollars with interest at the rate of eight per cent per annum; and from the day of the date of the executions of said deed and said contre-lettre the plaintiff had always been and remained in possession of the said parcels of real estate, and had controlled and possessed the same under said promise of sale as the owner and proprietor thereof, and had kept the same in repair, paid the taxes thereon and kept the same insured for his own benefit, and had always managed, administered and disposed of the same as his own property, for his own benefit, with the obligation on his part to apply the rents and revenues and proceeds thereof on account of the amount due by him as aforesaid to Shurtleff; that the term for redemption mentioned in the contre lettre was stipulated for the benefit of Shurtleff who had on his part the right to waive and extend the same as he might see fit, and that he did waive and extend the same and the said contract was existing between the parties at the date of Shurtleff's death; that all the moneys paid laid out and expended by plaintiff in connection with said property and which he sought by his action to recover from the estate of Shurtleff were paid and expended for his own benefit and that during the lifetime of Shurtleff plaintiff never pretended to any claim whatsoever against Shurtleff, but on the contrary at all times recognized his relation to Shurtleff as that of a debtor that during the lifetime of the said Shurtleff the said plaintiff never made any claim for any pretended services and was in fraud and bad faith in seeking so to do by his action; that all the real estate described in said deed is on the valuation roll in the name of the plaintiff, and the plaintiff continued to pay the taxes thereon and to act as owner, and never in any way repudiated his ownership until after the death of Shurtleff; that on the 3rd September, 1884, after the expiry of the term of three years allowed for the redemption on the property, the plaintiff redeemed lot number 778, paying the sum of $400.00; that plaintiff at the death of Shurtleff on October 31st 1888, was indebted to him in the sum of $3416.07, being a balance of the original debt of $2,941.00 and interest at eight per cent; and the defendants declared their willingness tore transfer the remaining properties to plaintiff on payment of the said balance.\nThe replication is equivalent to a general one.\nAfter a long and rather complicated enqu\u00eate, consisting of numerous documents a great part of which might well have been dispensed with, and a comparatively large amount of verbal evidence, the Superior Court dismissed the plaintiff's action on the ground that he never acted as agent of Shurtleff in the management of those properties, and that the said properties had in fact been administered by him as procurator in rem suam, vested with a power coupled with an interest. That judgment was reversed by the Court of Queen's Bench and judgment given for the plaintiff for a part of his claim, $1,154. The following are the facts as found by the Superior Court: .\nOn the 23rd. December, 1880, the plaintiff being indebted unto the said Shurtleff in a sum of $2,941, amount of plaintiff's different promissory notes, conveyed to him under the colour of a sale, certain properties the consideration in the deed being expressed to be $2941 \"paid at and before the execution of these presents, the receipt whereof is hereby acknowledged by the said John Taplin.\" The promissory notes were thereupon surrendered by Shurtleff to plaintiff. At the same time a writing, in the nature of a contre lettre, though not strictly speaking one, was executed between the same parties, as follows: \u2014\nThis agreement made and entered into by and between Johnson Taplin, of the first part, and Jonathan B. Shurtleff, of the second part, under the penalty of damages by the said party of the first part, and also by the said party of the second part, said agreement is as follows : that is to say, the said Johnson Taplin for and in consideration of the sum of twenty-nine hundred and forty-one dollars, makes and executes this day a clear and valid deed in favour of the said Jonathan B. Shurtleff of property situate, lying and being in the said village of Coaticook, being described in the same deed from the said Johnson Taplin to the said Jonathan B. Shurtleff. And also the said Jonathan B. Shurtleff, for the term of three years, is to let the said Johnson Taplin have control of the said deeded property, to manage as well, safely and properly, as he would if the said property was his own, and bargain and sell the said property for the best price that can be had for the same, and pay the rents, interest and purchase money when sold, and all the avails of said property to the said Jonathan B. Shurtleff to the amount of twenty-nine hundred and forty-one dollars, and interest at the rate of eight per cent per annum from the date of these presents then the said Jonathan B. Shurtleff shall re-deed to the said Johnson Taplin any part of the said property that may remain unsold after receiving the aforesaid. amount and. interest.\nThese two documents were registered by plaintiff on the day following their execution.\nA power of attorney to convey all his real estate in Coaticook was afterwards given, in 1881, by Shurtleff to the plaintiff, to further facilitate, I take it as evident, the execution of the powers given to the plaintiff in the contre lettre. The Superior Court also found the following pacts : The plaintiff had charge for Shurtleff of certain other properties in Coaticook, the Mead houses and Vaughan houses, and he looked after certain investments, collected interest for Shurtleff, receiving and paying out moneys till Shurtleff s death, October 31st, 1888. He rendered no account to Mr. Shurtleff during his life. Two of these properties, 778, the Putney house, and 906, the Hackett house, remained on the valuation roll in plaintiff's name, as did 1587, Avling house, till sold, but 766, the Baldwin property, sold to the Pioneer Beet Root Sugar Co., was sold at sheriff's sale on said company, and Shurtleff was obliged to buy in at the sheriff's sale, which he did, and the deed was given to him by the sheriff. Plaintiff had the management of all these properties under his contre lettre. presumably collected rents, but with the exception of one charge, $27, April 6th, 1882 \"rents collected accounted for none till after 1881,\" i.e., he kept in his own hands any rents which he may have collected, but during that period he paid taxes and insurance on all the properties, as well as on the properties the Mead and Vaughan houses in which he had no interest personally, but in the management of which he acted for Shurtleff.\nIn 1884, Sept. 3rd, he obtained a deed of the Putney house, 778, from Shurtleff for $400 and in 1886, Jan. 15th, of 35 ft. of the Baldwin property for $35. Both these deeds are sous seing priv\u00e9, and contain the ordinary conditions of sale,\nIt is to be observed that in 1881 he obtained a power of attorney from Shurtleff to give a deed to the Pioneer Beet Root Sugar Co. In 1886, Sept. 8th, he wrote to Shurtleff, \" I send you by Mr. Gustin for Wm. Brigham $472 which you will endorse on their notes and give me credit for $38 ($37 instead of $38). I meant to send more but have got disappointed, but shall have it soon, it is hard to get money here. I meant to send you $100.\"\nOn Oct. 18, 1887, \" I have got about $100 (one hundred dollars) to send you on our deal I sold a house and have a long pay day $5 per month. Property is looking up a little better here \"\nMarch 12, 1888, \" I am going to pay you some money. I have got $100 for you now on my own account \" and on March 24 1888 \" I expect Levi Gustin over here every day, when he comes I will send you some money on my own account.\"\nAll these letters were written at a time when he now claims the late Shurtleff was largely indebted to him for the causes for which he has brought the present action.\nIs it conceivable that the plaintiff would then have written those letters if Shurtleff had been his debtor as he now would claim him to have been? And how can he now contend that the $100 he sent to Shurtleff in 1887, were moneys collected as his agent when, in his letter sending it he says, it is $100 on our deal ([15]).\nThe two deeds of December 1880, having been passed at the same time, between the same parties in relation to the same property in consideration of the same specific sum, must be construed together. \"The contract (it is said in Parsons on Contracts, 2nd Vol. p 503) may be contained in several instruments, which, if made at the same time between the same parties and in relation to the same subject will be held to constitute but one contract.\" Now, that rule of the English law is also a rule of the French law. As laid down by the Privy Council, in McConnel v. Murphy ([16]) the rule on the subject is the same, under both systems. It is impossible not to consider the contre-lettre here as part of the contract between the parties. To give effect to the deed of sale without reference to the contre-lettre, would be setting at naught the intention of the parties. They must have intended that the sale should be controlled by the contre-lettre.\nThe very fact that the plaintiff himself registered the contre-lettre is an additional proof, were any necessary, that he did not intend to convey the property to Shurtleff absolutely and without reserve.\nIf a boom had struck Coaticook during these three years, and had largely increased the value of this property, the plaintiff would have had the right to force Shurtleff, upon payment of the $2,941; to a retrocession thereof; or if he had been enabled to sell the property, say for $10,000, he would have satisfied all of Shurtleff's rights by paying him $2,941, the difference going; into his pocket. At the end of the three years both consented not to exercise their rights, Shurtleff, the right to force the plaintiff to deliver him up the possession of the property, and the plaintiff the right to get then a retrocession thereof. And the relation between the parties continued up to Shurtleff's death to be on the same footing. There was, by mutual consent, no interversion, no change whatever in their relative positions as to the property. Shurtleff continued to have the title thereto; the plaintiff continued. to have the possession thereof, and manage it as his own with power to sell it, but the price to go to Shurtleff up to the amount sufficient to satisfy his claim, Shurtleff being obliged to re-deed to plaintiff any of the property remaining unsold, upon he, Shurtleff, being repaid in full the $2,941, and interest accrued I fail to see how, under such a state of things, the plaintiff can seriously contend that, in his management of this property, he acted as mandatary of Shurtleff. His own interest in the property was, at least, co-extensive with the interest of Shurtleff if not larger.\nHis contention is entirely inconsistent with his payments on account, his repeated promises to pay more, and his excuses for delaying his payments.\nHe and Shurtleff continued by mutual tacit agreement to stand after the 23rd December, 1883, in exactly the same position as if the worlds for the term of three years \" were struck out of the contre-lettre. If he was not a mandatary during the three years after the deeds, and I cannot conceive how he could contend that he was, he never became a mandatory afterwards.\nShurtleff always considered the plaintiff as a debtor to whom he extended delay and facilitated payments and the plaintiff never did or said anything to give to Shurtleff the least suspicion that such were not their relations as to this property. Had he, Shurtleff, at any time been aware that the plaintiff claimed to be his agent, and one as costly as he now claims to have been I rather think that his agency would have pretty soon been put an end to.\nAs to third parties the title was no doubt in Shurtleff but between him and the plaintiff the sale was only colourable. And even as to third parties no purchaser could have been found during the first three years who would have accepted a title from Shurtleff alone in view of the fact that the contre lettre was registered.\nI cannot but view with suspicion the plaintiff's claim. As longs as Shurtleff lived he never demanded anything from him but, on the contrary, acknowledged him constantly as his creditor. But within a few days after Shurtleff's death he suddenly discovers that instead of being his debtor he was his creditor and makes this claim against his estate. And he does not claim to be paid, for his services solely since 1883 but even during the three years originally fixed by the contre lettre. The \"mystery\" he confided to George Robinson is now explained to my entire satisfaction. His action was, in my opinion, rightly dismissed by the judgment of the Superior Court.\nHis Lordship the Chief Justice refers me two cases exactly in point. The first is Hurlimann v. Comptoir d'escompte de Mascara ([17]) and the second Bonnival v. Barnoud ([18]).\nThe reservation made in that judgment appears to me to amply protect whatever rights if any, the plaintiff might have against Shurtleff's legal representatives, and I would simply restore the said judgment in its entirety.\nBy the notes of the learned judge who gave that judgment I gather that he was of opinion that even assuming that the plaintiff has acted as mandatory for Shurtleff his action of assumpsit, as brought, did not lie. On this ground alone, perhaps, which is clearly open to him on the general issue the plaintiff's action fails. Guillouard, du Mandat ([19]). His only remedy, assuming his allegations of fact to be true, was the action man-data contraria, with a tender of his reddition de comple.\nAnyone who has acted as agent for another has an action to force his principal to receive a reddition de compte. \u00c0 comptable has the same right to exact from his unwilling principal a settlement of their accounts that a principal has from an unwilling comptable. Bioche proc. vo. Compte ([20]). Ferland v. Fr\u00e9chette ([21]); Rolland le Villargues vo. Compte ([22]); Dalloz Rep. vo. Mandat ([23]). The case of Joseph v. Philipps ([24]) invoked by the plaintiff on this point, does not help him. I refer to what we said of that case in Dorion v Dorion ([25])\nAs held by the Cour de Cassation in re Cardon:\nEn cas de contestation entre un d\u00e9biteur et un cr\u00e9ancier sur le produit de la gestion donn\u00e9e \u00e0 l'antichr\u00e8se, il y a obligation pour les tribunaux d'examiner les comptes pr\u00e9sentant les recettes et d\u00e9penses effectives, de calculer la recette et la d\u00e9pens\u00e9e, et de fixer le reliquat d'\u00e2pres cet examen et les d\u00e9bats de compte. Farad vo. Nantissement ([26]).\nNow this ruling, though not on a precisely similar state of things, is entirely applicable to the present case.\nHowever, I rest my conclusions on the fact that in my opinion, the plaintiff never was Shurtleff's agent in respect of this property.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellants : Taylor & Buchan.\nSolicitors for respondent : Brown & Mac Donald.\n[1] 15 Moo.

The Queen\u2019s Bench Divisional Court construed it in favour of the defendant, and the Court of Appeal in favour of the plaintiff. The conveyance and all material facts are set out in the judgments published herewith.\nArmour Q.C. for the appellant. The ambiguity in the description being patent no evidence was admissible to explain it. Baird v. Fortune[2]; Meres v. Ancell[3]; Colpoys v.

Perratt[11].\nAs to the rule of construction see Elphinstone on Interpretation of Deeds[12]; Wigram on Extrinsic Evidence[13].\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014It is not necessary to state at length the evidence or the several deeds constituting the titles of the parties respectively; they all sufficiently appear in the judgments delivered in the Queen\u2019s Bench and the Court of Appeal.\nThe title of the respondent, who was the plaintiff in the action, depends altogether on the construction to be placed on the deed of the 13th of January, 1883, whereby Laurent Bondy purported to convey to Charles W. Gauthier, the respondent\u2019s predecessor in title, a piece of land described as follows:\u2014\nAll and singular that certain parcel or tract of land and premises situate, lying and being in the Township of Sandwich West, in the County of Essex, in the Province of Ontario, being composed of a part of lot forty-three (43) in the first concession of the said Township of Sandwich West, described as follows:\u2014\nCommencing in the southerly limit of said lot forty-three, at a distance of twenty feet from the water\u2019s edge of the Detroit River, thence northerly parallel to the water\u2019s edge two hundred and eight feet, thence westerly parallel to the said southerly limit six hundred feet more or less to the channel bank of the Detroit River, thence southerly following the channel bank two hundred and eight feet, thence easterly six hundred feet more or less to the place of beginning, together with the fishery privileges appurtenant to the premises hereby conveyed.\nThe patent from the Crown granting lot 43, Petite Cote, to Joseph Puget in fee, dated the 26th of October, 1798, was put in evidence and by it lot 43 is described as a piece of land containing about 118 acres the side lines of which run back from the Detroit River in a course south 73 degrees east.\nThe respondent\u2019s contention was that the point of commencement was twenty feet east (or landwards) from the water\u2019s edge; that this was necessarily so, inasmuch as the water\u2019s edge was itself, according to the description in the patent, the western boundary of lot 43; that consequently by the deed of the 13th of January, 1883, a piece of land twenty feet in width from east to west and two hundred and eight feet from, south to north passed. On the other hand the appellant insists that the point of commencement cannot be ascertained; that it is uncertain whether it is at twenty feet to the east or at twenty feet to the west of the water\u2019s edge; and that therefore there is no sufficient description and nothing passed under this conveyance of the 13th of January, 1883.\nThe Queen\u2019s Bench Division adopted the latter view. The Court of Appeal in a unanimous judgment reached the contrary conclusion.\nThere can be no doubt that situate as this lot 43 is, on a large navigable river, an international waterway, the water\u2019s edge forms the western boundary. A grant of land bounded by the banks or edges of such streams does not extend to the middle thread as is the case where lands described as so limited lying on the banks of non-navigable rivers are granted[14]. Therefore lot 43 is in truth and legally a piece of land bounded on the south and north by the side lines mentioned in the patent, on the west by the bank of the river, and on the east by the second concession. From this the Court of Appeal concluded that a point in the southerly limit of lot 43 at twenty feet from the water\u2019s edge must necessarily be to the east of the river.\nI quite accede to the principle so strongly stated in Doe d. Winter v. Perrat[15], cited in the respondent\u2019s factum, \u201cthat every shift will be resorted to sooner than hold the gift void for uncertainty.\u201d This however does not authorize a mode of construction which would be directly opposite to the intention of the parties as apparent from intrinsic evidence contained in the instrument itself. Further it matters nothing in a case of this kind whether the grantor had or had not title to all he assumed to convey; we are to construe the description according to the language of the instrument abstracted from all considerations as to title. I am not disposed to accede to all the propositions of the learned counsel for the appellant as to the admission of extrinsic evidence on a question of construction. I think some of these propositions as to the admissibility of evidence of surrounding circumstances were too broad. I do agree, however, that it is quite competent for the appellant to show if he can from the terms of the deed itself that it did not comprise the land the respondent claims. The maxim res magis valeat quam pereat is only a rule authorizing a certain presumption to be made in arriving at what must govern in all cases of construction, namely, the intention of the parties, and if that intention is clear it is not to be arbitrarily overborne by any presumption. Taking therefore this description in the deed of 1883, the description in the patent and the evidence as to the local situation and surroundings of the property in dispute, I ask myself: Can I on this say that the point of commencement is established? If we are to consider the reference to lot 43 in this deed as meaning absolutely the piece of land so described in the patent to the exclusion of any other meaning then the reasoning of the learned judges of the Court of Appeal is unanswerable. But must we necessarily attribute to the parties such an intention? Is it not open to them to show that by the description of lot 43 they meant a lot of land, including land covered with water, of much greater extent than the lot 43 of the patent? Provided they can do this by sufficient evidence, and if such a meaning and intention appears from intrinsic evidence, that is from the deed itself without going out of its four corners, must not the meaning, which it thus appears the parties have themselves attached to the language in which they have expressed themselves, prevail? An interpretation clause is no doubt very unusual in the practice of conveyancing, though in some very modern deeds of great intricacy such provisions are sometimes to be found, but for the sake of illustration let us suppose that there had been in this deed of the 13th of January, 1883, a clause expressly declaring that by lot 43 was meant not merely a parcel of land limited according to the description of the patent, but a lot the area of which was comprised in the northern and southern boundaries of the patented lot produced to a westerly boundary formed by the middle thread or by the channel bank of the river. Surely this might have been done, and if so, could it be said in that case where the point of commencement in this description was to be found? And if it would have been competent to the parties to have done this expressly in the formal way I have mentioned, can they not do the same thing in less formal terms, provided they do it clearly and without ambiguity? Then, does it not appear from the description before us that this has been done? I think that it does clearly so appear. Let us follow the description: It commences on the southerly limit of lot 43 at a distance of twenty feet from the water\u2019s edge, thence it runs parallel to the water\u2019s edge two hundred and eight feet. So far there is nothing to show that the land referred to as lot 43 was not that described in the patent, but then the next course and distance is \u201cwesterly parallel to the said southerly limit six hundred feet more or less to the channel bank of the Detroit River.\u201d\nWhat is this but saying, almost in so many words, that the southerly and as a consequence the northerly limit of the parcel of land which the parties to the deed were dealing with and describing as lot 43, extended six hundred feet more or less to the bank of the deep water channel of the river? The words \u201csoutherly limit\u201d refer of course to the southerly limit previously mentioned in the beginning of the description as \u201cthe southerly limit of said lot 43.\u201d Therefore this is equivalent to a declaration on the face of the deed that lot 43 extended westerly at least to the channel bank. The intention of the parties was that it should be so considered for the purposes of the deed, the description in which must consequently be governed by the intention thus expressed. In the face of this to force upon the parties a description of lot 43 according to a strict legal definition of its boundaries is, it seems to me, and I say it with all possible respect, to vary the terms of the instrument which they have deliberately entered into. I cannot see that there is anything in this way of putting the case obnoxious to the rule res magis valeat quam pereat, which is only a rule to aid in arriving at the intention and does not in any case authorize the court to overrule the intention which is paramount and must govern whatever may be the consequence.\nIt is probable that the parties were under a mistaken impression as to the law and supposed that the same rule which applied to grants of land in non-navigable waters were applicable to this land, That, however, is a matter of no moment. I have not referred to the parol evidence of extrinsic facts, as a good deal of it, however conclusive in an action for rectification, seems to me to be strictly inadmissible in aid of the construction of the deed. If there had been an ascertained point of commencement by designating it as at twenty feet to the west of the water\u2019s edge, I think there can be no doubt that the whole land as described would have passed although lot 43 did not in fact extend westerly beyond the water\u2019s edge. If the description had thus commenced west of the water\u2019s edge the words \u201cin the southerly limit of lot 43\u201d would have been construed to mean the southerly limit of lot 43 produced westward. In that case the general description as part of lot 43 would have had to give way to the particular description by boundaries. This is shown by the opinion of Willes J. in the case of Rorke v. Errington[16]. The only difference between that case and the case I have just hypothetically put would be that in the latter the description would be on the face of the deed, whilst in the case quoted it was described by reference to a plan. The words to be rejected as falsa demonstratio would then be \u201cpart of lot 43.\u201d It follows from this that we cannot allow the general and uncertain words of description \u201cpart of lot 43\u201d to control the rest of the description in the deed actually before us, and reject the specific description by boundaries as immaterial.\nIn what part, therefore, of this southern boundary described by the parties in their deed as extending westerly of the water\u2019s edge, at least to the navigable channel of the river, a distance of some 600 feet, are we to place the point of commencement? It is impossible to tell.\nThis, therefore, is the case of a patent ambiguity, that is, an ambiguity apparent on the face of the deed itself, and therefore one which is incapable of being explained by extrinsic evidence even if any such evidence had been given or tendered. Then there being an ambiguity patent on the face of the deed I do not see that we can apply the maxim verba fortius accipiuntur contra proferentem in favour of the respondent. In the first place if it could be applied here it might be applied in every case and there would be no such thing as a patent ambiguity, but we know this is not so. However that rule of interpretation may be applied to determine the meaning of particular words or expressions I can find no instance of its being used to determine the meaning of the parties where the words in which they have expressed themselves have left that meaning in equilibrio as to the subject matter of a conveyance. In short the deed must be construed according to the intention of the parties, and judging from the language they have used they have left the point in dispute undetermined, and the court cannot on any arbitrary principle determine it one way rather than another[17].\nIn Taylor v. The Corporation of St. Helens[18], Jessel M.R. says of this rule:\u2014\nI do not see how, according to the established rules of construction as settled by the House of Lords in the well known case of Grey v. Pearson[19], followed by Roddy v. Fitzgerald[20], and Abbott v. Middleton[21], that maxim can be considered as having any force at the present day. The rule is to find out the meaning of the instrument according to the ordinary and proper rules of construction. If we can thus find out its meaning we do not want the maxim. If, on the other hand, we cannot find out its meaning, then the instrument is void for uncertainty, and in that case it may be said that the instrument is construed in favour of the grantor, for the grant is annulled.\nThen can it be said that this is the case of an uncertainty of description to be determined by the election of the grantee?\nThis principle is applied to determine the ambiguity where a description applies equally to different subjects, as where there is a grant of 10 acres of land part of lot A, or a grant of one of the grantor\u2019s four horses. In such a case the grantor is presumed to leave the selection to the choice of the grantee. But this is not the case here; the question is, whether a larger or a smaller piece of land was intended to be conveyed. The grantor meant either the one or the other, which, he has, it is true, left uncertain, and it would be to do violence to his intention if we were to hold that the grantee should have a right of election. The doctrine has no application to a case like that now before us, where it is manifest that the grantor intended, not that there should be one or the other of two alternative points of commencement either of which the grantee might adopt, but one point only, though that has not been properly ascertained. Further, if such a right to elect did exist it must be considered as having been determined by Gauthier, under whom the respondent claims, when he allowed Barthel to build a house on the twenty feet strip now in question and otherwise to treat it as his own property.\nThe appeal must be allowed with costs and the judgment of the Queen\u2019s Bench Division restored.\nTASCHEREAU and SEDGEWICK JJ. concurred in the judgment of the Chief Justice.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014This action was brought to recover possession of a piece of land which is the front part of three acres of land of which the defendant has been in actual undisputed possession from May, 1884, to January, 1893, under parol leases from year to year made to him by one Laurent Bondy at a yearly rent and from the 3rd January, 1893, under a deed of bargain and sale whereby the said Laurent Bondy, in consideration of the sum of $2,600 paid to him by the defendant, conveyed the said three acres to the defendant, his heirs and assigns, and thereby covenanted for good title as against his own acts. A piece of this land the plaintiff now claims, under the description, in his statement of claim, of a certain parcel or tract of land being composed of a part of lot numbered forty-three in the first concession of the township of Sandwich West\u2014\ncommencing on the southerly limit of said lot forty-three at the distance of twenty feet easterly from the water\u2019s edge of the Detroit River; thence running northerly parallel to the water\u2019s edge up stream and twenty feet distant easterly therefrom two hundred and eight feet; thence westerly parallel to said southerly limit of lot forty-three twenty feet to the water\u2019s edge aforesaid; thence southerly following the water\u2019s edge of the said river down stream to the said southerly limit of lot forty-three two hundred and eight feet; thence easterly along the said southerly limit of lot forty-three to the place of beginning.\nIt is admitted that the piece of land so claimed by the plaintiff is within the limits of the three acres as described in the deed executed by Laurent Bondy in favour of the defendant in January, 1893, but the plaintiff claims title under a prior deed of bargain and sale bearing date the thirteenth day of January, 1883, executed by the same Laurent Bondy, whereby he, in consideration of the sum of three hundred dollars, conveyed to one Charles W. Gauthier, his heirs and assigns, the land therein described, the description of which, as the plaintiff contends, includes the piece of land for which this action is brought. That the plaintiff is seized of whatever title Gauthier acquired in the land covered by the description contained in that deed is not disputed, and as the plaintiff and defendant both claim title under the same grantor, the sole question in issue between the parties to this action is, whether or not the description in the prior deed from Bondy to Gauthier does include within its limits that portion of the three acres of which the defendant still is and has been so as aforesaid in possession by title under Bondy, for which this action is brought.\nThe whole onus of this issue is cast upon the plaintiff, and the solution of it depends solely upon the construction of the words used in the deed, read of course in the light of the surrounding circumstances, and if the words used leave the matter in doubt the plaintiff must fail. Now the description in the deed from Bondy to Gauthier of the land thereby intended to be conveyed is as follows:\u2014 That certain parcel or tract of land being composed of a part of lot forty-three in the first concession of the township of Sandwich West described as follows:\u2014Commencing in the southerly limit of the said lot forty-three from the water\u2019s edge of the Detroit River, thence northerly parallel to the water\u2019s edge two hundred and eight feet, thence westerly parallel to the said southerly limit six hundred feet more or less to the channel bank of the Detroit River, thence southerly following the channel bank two hundred and eight feet, thence easterly six hundred feet more or less to the place of beginning, together with the fishery privileges appurtenant to the premises hereby conveyed.\nIt is here to be observed, that this description varies, in that which is the crucial point of this case from the description of the piece of land for which this action is brought as described in the plaintiff\u2019s statement of claim, in this, namely, that the point of commencement in the latter is stated to be in the southerly limit of lot forty-three at the distance of twenty feet \u201ceasterly\u201d from the water\u2019s edge, whereas in the deed to Gauthier the word \u201ceasterly\u201d does not appear; and the sole question in the case is reduced to this: Does it sufficiently appear upon the face of the deed itself, construed in the light of the surrounding circumstances, that the deed to Gauthier (the word \u201ceasterly\u201d not being used therein) must be construed precisely as if it had been? And this having been the sole issue in the case, I must say that I think a vast deal of matter was inquired into at the trial which was not at all relevant to that issue, or admissible as evidence in the case.\nNow at the time of the purchase by Gauthier of the land described in the deed from Bondy to him he was engaged in the pursuit of his calling as a fisherman upon a very extensive tract of land covered with the waters of the Detroit River, which, as I think sufficiently appears, was commonly understood in the neighbourhood to be composed of part of lot 42, the northerly part of lot 43, lots 44 and 45 in the first concession of the township of Sandwich West. These lands covered with the waters of the river upon which Gauthier was pursuing his calling as a fisherman extended out to what was called the channel bank of the River Detroit, the side of which nearest to the Canada shore was deemed to be at the distance of 600 feet or thereabouts from the water\u2019s edge of the river on the Canada shore. The parcels were separated from each other by the strip of 208 feet in width of the land covered with the waters of the river which is described in the deed from Bondy to Gauthier. The piece of the lot 42, or commonly known as such, Gauthier held under title from one Joly, and by an indenture dated the 18th February, 1889, he conveyed it, together with the piece of land as described in the deed from Bondy to him, for the consideration of three hundred dollars, to one Reeves (who was a man who pursued, like himself, the calling of a fisherman) by the following description:\nAll and singular that certain parcel or tract of land and premises situate in the township of Sandwich West, composed of all that portion of lot number forty-two in the first concession of the said township which lies between the beach and the channel bank of the Detroit River, with the privilege of using the beach for the purpose of fishing and also of erecting thereon a fishing shanty reel and windlass sufficient for the purpose of catching fish, and also the right to land at all times upon the said beach for the purposes aforesaid.\nThese were the rights and privileges enjoyed by Gauthier upon the said described piece of land covered with water on the said lot 42 at the time of his purchasing the piece described in the deed from Bondy to him. Upon the land covered with water as above described he had at the same time a portion enclosed and used by him as a fish-pond for keeping therein fish caught by him in the river. The boundary line of this pond extended in places over the northern limit of the said piece called part of lot 42, which constituted the southern boundary line of the adjoining lot commonly known as 43. He had also upon the beach of the said lot 42 a windlass for drawing his fishing seines, and upon the beach of the lots 44 and 45 he had windlasses used for the like purpose. Now these are surrounding circumstances proper to be taken into consideration for the purpose of construing the description of the piece of land intended to be conveyed by deed from Bondy to Gauthier, and they appear to indicate very plainly that Gauthier\u2019s object in purchasing that piece and the fishing privileges thereby purported to be granted was to acquire as fishing ground the land covered with the waters of the river of which Bondy claimed to be and was believed to be seized, which lay between those portions of the land covered with the waters of the river upon which Gauthier was pursuing his calling as a fisherman which lay to the north, and that which lay to the south of the piece described in the deed from Bondy. That such was Gauthier\u2019s object, and that he required no part of the beach adjoining the piece of land covered with the waters of the river purchased from Bondy for his fishing purposes or for any purpose, and that his sole object was to acquire land covered with the waters of the river, is confirmed by the fact that while he pursued his calling as a fisherman upon the said piece covered with water until 1889, when he sold to Reeves as aforesaid, he never used or asserted any right whatever to use the piece which the plaintiff now claims to have in fact been the only piece which at all passed by the deed. In fact neither Gauthier or Reeves or any one ever made any claim to this piece until the plaintiff, who is not a fisherman as Gauthier was, but who describes himself as being a real estate owner and manufacturer residing in the city of Detroit, purchased from Reeves, not by the description used in the deed from Bondy to Gauthier, but with the word \u201ceasterly\u201d added as above shown, his object not being to use the land for the purpose for which Gauthier bought it, but to insist that no land covered with water passed by the deed and that what did pass was the piece for which this action was brought, and which the plaintiff desires to use for a drive to unite lands which he owns above and below the piece in dispute. The plaintiff\u2019s title, however, must depend upon the construction of the description in the deed from Bondy to Gauthier, read in the light of the circumstances surrounding Gauthier\u2019s purchase, and these circumstances, as already pointed out, show, I think, very clearly, that Gauthier\u2019s object and intent was simply to purchase land covered with the waters of the river and the fishing privileges thereto, or supposed to be thereto attached, and that he had no occasion for, and did not contemplate purchasing, the piece of land for which this action is brought. By the line which is spoken of in the deed as the southern limit of lot 43 is plainly, I think, meant a line in the river extending from the shore to the channel bank of the river, which both parties believed to be the northern limit of the land covered with the waters of the river in which Gauthier\u2019s fish-pond was situate, and which was deemed part of lot 42, and the southern limit of the land covered with the waters of the river which Gauthier was purchasing from Bondy and which both parties understood to be part of lot 43. Now the surrounding circumstances important to be considered as regards Bondy are, that while the piece of land which is the subject of this action was never used or claimed by Gauthier or by Reeves under him it was always, ever since the execution of the deed to Gauthier, claimed and used by Bondy and the defendant, or his tenant, until the sale in fee simple by Bondy to the defendant in January, 1893, and indeed that piece was invaluable to Bondy as constituting his water frontage by which he had access to the river; without it, to say the least, his remaining land there would have been very much depreciated in value. Then again the reservation from his grant to Gauthier of ten feet out into the river from the water\u2019s edge, upon which Gauthier should have no right so as to prejudice Bondy\u2019s approach to the land by water, was a matter no doubt of such great value to Bondy as to make it difficult, if not impossible, to conceive that he could have intended to include the piece of land for which this action is brought in the description of the land sold to Gauthier for $300. Bondy\u2019s dealing with the piece as his own in presence of Gauthier ever since the execution of the deed to Gauthier, coupled with the fact that Gauthier never used or claimed any right to use that piece as part of his purchase, indicates I think very clearly, that neither did Bondy intend to sell or Gauthier to purchase the piece for which this action is brought; and there is nothing in the deed so clearly expressed as to override their intentions,\u2014indeed nothing so expressed as to be inconsistent with these intentions. In view then of the surrounding circumstances the true construction to be put upon the deed, I think, is that the point of commencement mentioned in the deed is in the waters of the river and not to the east of the water\u2019s edge; not being to the east of the water\u2019s edge the only alternative is that it must either be to the west, or so undetermined that the plaintiff must fail.\nFor these reasons I am of opinion that the very able argument addressed to us by the learned counsel for the appellant must prevail and that the appeal must be allowed with costs and the judgment of the learned trial judge and the Divisional Court of Queen\u2019s Bench restored.\nKING J.\u2014I agree with the learned judges of the Court of Appeal and with their reasons. The point of commencement is a point in the southerly limit of lot 43 in the first concession of the township of Sandwich upon the Detroit River, and extending back from it in an easterly direction. There is no other evidence of any other lot that would fill the terms of this designation. A point in its southerly limits at a distance of twenty feet from the water\u2019s edge of the Detroit River is an ascertainable point. From this as a starting point the different courses mentioned in the deed may be followed, first by going northerly parallel to the water\u2019s edge two hundred and eight feet; then by going westerly parallel to the said southerly limit six hundred feet more or less to the channel bank of the Detroit River; then by going southerly following the channel bank two hundred and eight feet; and thence easterly six hundred feet more or less to the place of beginning. It is true that the second course, viz., the western course, is described as being parallel to the southerly limit of lot 43 in which the point of beginning is found, and it is true that the southerly limit so referred to does not extend as far west as does the second course so described, but lines may be parallel to each other although they may not be opposite to each other on a right angle. Here, for probably twenty feet at least, they might be directly opposite to each other, but whether so or not the two lines may very well be parallel. This, then, gives us a consistent piece of ground which can readily be plotted from the deed. The only thing appearing to make against it is, that in the first part of the description the parcel conveyed is described as being \u201ccomposed of a part of lot 43 in the first concession\u201d etc., whereas in the respondent\u2019s view, the lot conveyed is composed in part of a part of lot 43. This variance is not a very serious one, but, if material, I think that these words of reference may be rejected. First, as being general and opposed to the particular description, and in the next place because, if not rejected as misdescription, the whole deed fails by reason of uncertainty; for if these words are to be retained and are to be allowed to impose a non-natural meaning upon the words that follow, we have a patent ambiguity by reason of the manifest uncertainty as to whether the twenty feet from the water\u2019s edge of the Detroit River are to be measured landward or otherwise. This consequence ought, if possible, to be avoided. Res magis valeat quam pereat. The maxim, of course, may not be used to force a conclusion contrary to the clear meaning of language, but that is not this case. It further seems to me that the only known or ascertainable southerly limit of a lot 43 is the southerly limit of the lot 43 which we know as duly patented.\nFor these reasons I think the appeal should be dismissed.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Clarke, Bartlet & Bartlet.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Fleming, Wigle & Rodd.\n[1] 21 Ont.

J., and Taschereau, Gwynne, Sedgewick and King JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF NOVA SCOTIA.\nLease for lives\u2014Renewal\u2014Insertion of new life\u2014Evidence of insertion\u2014Counterpart of lease\u2014Custody of\u2014Duration of life\u2014Presumption.\nBy indenture made in 1805 F. demised certain premises to C. to hold for the lives of the lessee, his brother and his wife \u201cand renewable forever.\u201d The lessee covenanted that on the fall of any of said lives he would, within twelve months, insert a new life and pay a renewal fine, otherwise the right of renewal of the life fallen should be forfeited, and if any question should arise it would be incumbent on the one interested in the premises to prove the person on whose death the term was made terminable to be alive, or in default such person would be presumed to be dead. In 1884 a purchaser from the assignees of the reversion entered into possession, and in 1890 an action was brought by persons claiming through the lessee to recover possession and for an account of mesne profits. On the trial a counterpart of the lease, found among the papers of the devisee of the lessor, was received in evidence, upon which was an endorsement dated in 1852, and signed by such devisee, by which a new life was inserted in place of one of the original lives and receipt of the renewal fine was acknowledged.\nHeld, affirming the decision of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, that the words \u201crenewable forever\u201d in the habendum, taken in conjunction with the lessee\u2019s covenant to pay a fine for inserting a new life in place of any that should fall, conferred a right to renewal in perpetuity notwithstanding there was no covenant by the lessor so to renew; that the endorsement was an operative instrument, though found in possession of the owner of the reversion, or at all events it was an admission by their predecessor in title binding on defendants and entitled plaintiffs to a renewal for a new life so inserted, but the right to further renewal was gone, exact compliance with the requirements of the lease in the payment of the fines being essential and the evidence having shown that the original lessee was dead, and the proper assumption being that his brother, the third life, who was a married man in 1805, was also dead in 1884, even if the lease itself had not provided that death would be presumed in default of proof to the contrary.\nHeld, per Gwynne J. dissenting, that the term granted was for the joint lives of the three persons named and ceased upon the falling of any one life without renewal as provided; and the fines not having been paid on the death of the lossee and his brother there was a forfeiture which entitled defendants to enter.\nThe person in possession pleaded that he was a purchaser for value without notice and entitled to the benefit of the Registry Act R. S. N. S. 5th Ser. ch. 84.\nHeld, that the memorandum endorsed on the lease was not a deed within sec. 18 of the Act, nor a lease within sec. 25; that if a speculative purchaser, having just such an estate as his conveyance gave him, the person in possession would not be within the protection of the Act; and that there was sufficient evidence of notice.\nSemble, that section 25 of the Nova Scotia Act R. S. N. S. 5th Ser. c. 84 applies only to leases for years.\nAppeal from a decision of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia[1], varying the judgment in favour of the plaintiffs at the trial.\nThe facts are fully set out in the judgment of the Chief Justice.\nRoss Q.C. for the appellants.\nBorden Q.C. for the respondents.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia sitting in banc which varied the judgment of Mr. Justice Ritchie, who tried the action without a jury. The judgment which prevailed in appeal was that of Mr. Justice Henry and was concurred in by Mr. Justice Weather be, who, however, was of opinion that the judgment of the learned judge at the trial was right, but assented to the judgment of Mr. Justice Henry, as otherwise there would have been no judgment, the learned Chief Justice being of opinion that the action wholly failed and should be dismissed.\nOn the 16th of June, 1805, John Fraser, by indenture bearing that date, made between himself of the one part and one Preserved Coffil of the other part, granted and demised to Preserved Coffil the premises in question in this cause to have and to hold the same unto\u2014\nthe said Preserved Coffil, his executors, administrators and assigns, from the day of the date hereof for and during the natural lives of him, the said Preserved Coffil, Patrick Coffil, brother of the said Preserved Coffil, and Elizabeth Com], wife of the said Preserved Coffil, and renewable forever.\nThis lease was expressed to be made in consideration of the yearly rents and covenants thereinafter reserved and contained. These covenants were to pay annually, on the first day of May, the sum of four pounds ten shillings, Nova Scotia currency. The lease also contained a clause entitling the lessor to re-enter and avoid the lease in case the rent should be in arrear for thirty days and no sufficient distress should be found on the premises, or \u201cin case of failure on the part of the said Preserved Coffil, his executors, administrators or assigns in performing the covenants and agreements herein contained.\u201d Then followed covenants on the part of the lessee to pay the rent, to make certain improvements and repairs and to pay taxes. Next there was the clause upon which the decision of the case principally depends, which is as follows:\u2014\nAnd also shall and will at the fall of every life mentioned in this indenture, pay to him the said John Fraser, his heirs, executors, administrators or assigns, the sum of four pounds for inserting a new life in the place of the one so fallen, and if such new life be not inserted and the sum of four pounds so paid within twelve months after the fall of each life, the said Preserved Coffil, his executors, administrators or assigns shall forfeit and lose their rights of renewal of such life so fallen, anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, provided always that when and as often as any question shall arise whether the person on whose death the term hereby granted is made determinable, it shall be incumbent on the person interested in the premises, by and under the demise, to prove such person to\u2019 be living, or in default the person about whom such question shall arise shall be taken to be dead.\nThe lease also contained a covenant by the lessor for quiet enjoyment, and a penalty of one hundred pounds for the performance of the covenants was mutually stipulated for. The testatum clause was in these words:\u2014\nIn witness whereof the said parties have hereunto interchangeably set their hands and seals.\nThis lease and the estate created by it was assigned by the lessee to one David Dill, and through certain mesne assignments it became, on or about the first of March, 1850, vested in Edward McLatchy, the father of the respondents other than Margaret Pernette. Edward McLatchy, by his will, devised the premises in question to his widow Eleanor Maria McLatchy, for life, with remainder to the respondents, other than Margaret Pernette. The widow died before this action was brought. The reversion became, upon the death of the lessor, vested in Elizabeth Fraser, his widow, and upon her death in the appellants, other than William B. Shaw. The appellant William B. Shaw claims as a purchaser from the other appellants.\nThe yearly rent was paid up to the first of May, 1884. In June, 1884, William B. Shaw, claiming as before mentioned took possession of the premises. From the date of the lease until the time Shaw took possession the possession was. continuously in the parties from time to time claiming under the lease. In October, 1890, the present action was brought to recover possession and for an account of mesne profits, and the respondents also claimed a declaration that James Shand, junior, now James Shand, was inserted in the said lease as a new life in. place of the life of Elizabeth Goffil, which had fallen, and that the said lease was renewed for the life of James Shand, junior, now James Shand, or in the alternative that the appellants be ordered, decreed and adjudged to insert the said James Shand as a new life in said lease in the place of the life of Elizabeth Coffil, which had fallen, or to execute to the respondents a lease of the land and premises upon the terms and conditions contained in the lease for life of James Shand, renewable forever by the insertion of new lives as in the lease provided. The appellants by their defence deny the principal allegations of the respondent\u2019s statement of claim and in substance insist that there never had been any renewal of the lease; that all the original lives had dropped, and that the estate of the lessee had ceased and come to an end before the possession was taken as before mentioned. The defendant William B. Shaw pleaded the Nova Scotia Registry Act and also that he was a purchaser for valuable consideration without notice. In their reply the respondents, besides joining issue upon the defence, insist upon a waiver of any forfeitures by receipt of rent, and allege that the defendant William B. Shaw had notice.\nThe action came on for trial before Mr. Justice Ritchie without a jury. At the trial evidence was given that Patrick Coffil was dead, and it was proved that Preserved Coffil had left the province many years before and gone to live in the State of Maine, and that the witness (Edward McLatchy) had heard he was dead: A document purporting to be the original lease or a counterpart thereof was produced which had been found amongst the papers of Elizabeth Fraser the widow of the lessor. Upon this document was the following endorsement:\u2014\nElizabeth Coffil, the wife of Preserved Coffil within named, having died and Edward McLatchy, of Windsor, assignee of the within estate, having paid to me the sum of four pounds, I do hereby, at his request and in consideration of the said payment and in order fully to carry out and effectuate the conditions and covenants to the within indenture of lease set forth, agree to insert and do by these insert and put James Shand, junior, son of James Shand, of Windsor, blacksmith, in the stead and place as a life or heir in the said lease according to the conditions thereof.\nDated at Halifax this sixth day of April, 1852.\n(Sgd.) ELIZABETH FRASER,\nDevisee of John Fraser within named.\nAt the date borne by this endorsed memorandum the reversion was vested in Elizabeth Fraser, and Edward McLatchy was then the assignee of the lease. James Shand therein named was still living and was called and examined as a witness at the trial. No counterpart of the lease was found among the papers of Edward McLatchy, although due search was proved to have been made therefor. The learned judge considered that the lease was renewable for ever; that there had been a good renewal for the life of James Shand; that any forfeiture of the right to renew had been waived by the receipt of rent; and that the respondents were entitled to have a renewal lease executed for two new lives to be named by them in addition to the subsisting life of James Shand. By the judgment entered it was declared that the respondents, other than Mrs. Pernette, were entitled to the possession and that the possession of the appellant Shaw was wrongful. An account of mesne profits was directed and it was ordered that the defendants. Upon payment of $182.95, should execute a new lease to the plaintiff Edward McLatchy (upon proof by him that his co-plaintiffs, other than Mrs. Pernette, had assigned their interest to him) for the life of James Shand and two other persons to be named, renewable forever. Upon an appeal to the Supreme Court in banc, this judgment was varied by striking out the third paragraph directing the execution of a new lease. Of the two judges who formed the court in banc Mr. Justice Weatherbe agreed with the trial judge. The Chief Justice wholly dissented and was of opinion that the action should be dismissed, whilst Mr. Justice Henry, whose judgment prevailed inasmuch as Mr. Justice Weatherbe formally concurred in it, was of opinion that the respondents were entitled to the possession and enjoyment of the estate during the life of James Shand, but were not entitled to name new lives nor to have a renewal lease containing a clause for perpetual renewal executed.\nFrom this judgment the present appeal has been brought, and the respondents have also instituted a cross appeal.\nThe first consideration which presents itself relates to the proper construction of the lease. Does it confer a right to a renewal in perpetuity? This must depend on the words \u201crenewable for ever\u201d in the habendum, taken in conjunction with the covenant on the part of the lessee to pay a fine on the dropping of a life which has been already set forth, for the lease contains no formal covenant or agreement by the lessor to renew. The learned Chief Justice was of opinion that the expression in the habendum, read together with the lessee\u2019s covenant, was not sufficient to make out a covenant on the part of the lessor to renew, and he relied upon the case of Sheppard v. Doolan[2]. In that case the Irish Master of the Rolls certainly did hold that words like those in the habendum of this case without any other covenant by the lessor, did not amount to a covenant to renew. But on appeal to the Lord Chancellor (Sir Edward Sugden)[3], that decision was not approved of, but on the contrary a previous decision of Lord Manners, in the case of Taylor v. Pollard[4], where a covenant had been implied under still stronger circumstances, was considered to have been well decided. The Lord Chancellor did not, it is true, decide the point but offered to send a case to a court of law according to the practice of those days; this, however, was declined by the party who contended there was no covenant and who subsequently abandoned the objection.\nIn Chambers v. Gaussen[5], a case which much resembles this, the same point again arose before Sir Edward Sugden. There it was also expressed in the habendum that there should be a perpetual renewal, but reference was made in the habendum to \u201ccovenants for that purpose hereinafter expressed.\u201d As in the present case no covenants to renew by the lessor were contained in the lease but there was such a covenant on the part of the lessee. The Lord Chancellor there said:\u2014\nThe demise is for certain lives named in the lease and for \u201cthe life and lives of such other person or persons as shall be nominated by the said James Boyle upon the death of any of the persons for whose lives the premises are hereby granted and upon the death of any such person or persons as shall at any time hereafter be nominated and appointed for ever according to the covenants and agreements for that purpose hereinafter expressed.\u201d Now supposing these words \u201caccording to the covenants and agreements for that purpose hereinafter expressed\u201d had not been here, this would have been in this court a lease for lives renewable for ever. There is no magic in words to express a covenant. This would amount both to a legal demise for three lives and an equitable demise for such lives as thereafter the lessee should nominate. But then it is \u201caccording to the covenants and agreements for that purpose hereinafter expressed.\u201d For what purpose? For the purpose of the renewal of the lives. There is no covenant by the lessor to renew but there is one by the lessee. The lessee, if he names the lives, is to hold during those lives according to the covenant thereinafter expressed, and the lessee afterwards covenants that \u201che will within six calendar months after the decease of each of the persons whose lives are hereinbefore mentioned and of each person who shall hereafter be nominated and appointed\u201d pay in the nature of a fine for each person so dying one peppercorn if demanded. This case I think is a sufficient authority for holding, as the court below have done, that the lease before us was renewable in perpetuity according to the terms of the lessee\u2019s covenant to pay the fines. It is true that there was not here, as in Chambers v. Gaussen, to be found in the habendum any reference to the nomination of new lives and therefore if we had nothing but the words \u201crenewable for ever\u201d it might have been difficult to say how a renewal was to be carried out; and again there is not here any express reference as there was in the case cited to subsequent covenants. We are however to construe the instrument as a whole and this entitles us, notwithstanding the omission of any express reference to the lessee\u2019s covenant in the habendum, to read that covenant in connection with the habendum, and when that is done the mode of renewal by the appointment of a new life on the death of each of the original nominees becomes apparent. I hold, therefore, that the lease originally conferred an estate for the lives of the three persons named with a covenant by the lessor to renew from time to time upon the dropping of any of those lives and so on for ever.\nI also refer to the case of Swinburne v. Milburn[6], as to the effect of the words \u201crenewable for ever.\u201d Lord Fitzgerald in his opinion in that case says:\nIn the numerous cases which arose in Ireland on the construction of covenants alleged to be for perpetual renewal, I have not been able to call to mind a single one in which the covenant was interpreted to be of that character, unless it contained sufficient evidence of intention by the use of words importing perpetuity such as \u201cfor ever,\u201d or \u201cfrom time to time forever hereafter\u201d or some other expression of a like or equivalent character.\nThe lessee had then a legal estate for the term of the original lives, at least I assume he had, though for a technical reason he may have had only an equitable estate; this technical point, however, makes no difference and need not be dwelt upon or further adverted to. He had also a good equitable right to insist on a renewal in perpetuity provided he complied with the conditions as to terms and payment of the fines specified in his covenant. The proper mode of carrying this out would have been by executing a renewal lease in identical terms with the original lease on the occasion of the dropping of each life inserting the name of the new nominee in the place of the dead person, with the habendum and lessee\u2019s covenant in the very words of the first lease.\nThen what was the effect of the indorsement on the lease or counterpart found amongst the papers of Mrs. Fraser?\nI have no doubt whatever that this lease was, as Mr. Justice Henry holds it to have been, a counterpart. The testatum clause shows that there was such a counterpart executed by the use of the word \u201cinterchangeably\u201d found therein. That it was found in the possession of the owner of the reversion makes no difference. It has been held in many cases that conveyances, even deeds of gift, so found, are to be taken as operative instruments sufficient to pass an estate[7]. I do not think therefore that we can conclude, from the mere fact that this indorsement was upon the part of the original lease retained by the lessor, that it was a mere undelivered agreement withheld because the fine had not been paid. It is at least an admission by their predecessor in title binding on the appellants. The non-production of the part of the lease which the lessee had is accounted for by the evidence of Robie McLatchy who proves a sufficient search for it among his father\u2019s papers. I think we must assume that the life of Elizabeth Coffil was the first life which dropped, and that at the date of the indorsement in April, 1852, the other two lives, those of Preserved Coffil and Patrick Coffil, were existing. We ought not as against the lessor to presume that it was intended by the receipt of the fine and by the indorsement of the memorandum to waive a forfeiture or to alter the terms of the original lease which would have been the case if the lives, other than that of Elizabeth Coffil, had then fallen in.\nI am also of opinion that we must presume that at the date of the purchase by the defendant Shaw both Preserved Coffil and Patrick Coffil were dead. As to Patrick Coffil there is evidence of his death, and as to Preserved Coffil, the great age he would have attained if alive in 1884 (assuming him to have been of age in 1805, and he was then a married man) alone warrants this conclusion. The lease, moreover, contains an express clause requiring us to make this presumption since it is provided that whenever any question shall arise as to the life or death of any of the nominees such person shall in the absence of proof to the contrary by the lessee or those claiming under him \u201cbe taken to be dead.\u201d This is, it seems to me, conclusive. The clause of the lease already referred to making provision for the presumption of death also applies in favour of the appellants to establish, in the absence of proof by the respondents of the exact date of the death of Preserved Coffil and Patrick Coffil, that they both died more than twelve months before the respondents were evicted. In that case the right to any further renewal in substitution for those lives was forfeited according to the express terms of the lease. This clause of forfeiture it will be observed is in express terms confined to a forfeiture of the right to a renewal and does not extend to any subsisting estate for a life then in existence. The actual estate for the life of James Shand would therefore be unaffected by it, but the right of renewal on the death of James Shand would be gone. The forfeiture of that right of renewal would be worked by the general clause of forfeiture contained in the lease though that general clause would not extend to the subsisting equitable estate for Shand\u2019s life depending on the renewal effected by the indorsement, for the reason that the receipt of rent down to the 1st of May, 1884, kept it alive.\nIt was, however, held by Mr. Justice Ritchie, proceeding upon the Irish cases, that the plaintiffs are entitled to relief against the consequences of their failure to renew. I cannot assent to this. In the absence of any special equitable ground for interference to reinstate the respondents in their rights of renewal, I am of opinion that we must apply the law as settled by the cases determined in England. Exact compliance with the requirements of the lease in the payment of the fines was therefore essential. That this is the law is I think clearly established by cases cited in the judgments of the Chief Justice and Mr. Justice Henry. I particularly rely on Murray v. Bateman[8]; Baynham v. Guy\u2019s Hospital[9]; Harries v. Bryant[10]; and Maxwell v. Ward[11]. The right to any further renewal even on the dropping of the life of James Shand, the present cestui que vie, is I think absolutely extinguished. As I have already said the receipt of rent applies so far as the present equitable interest for Shand\u2019s life is concerned to keep it alive but no further.\nSome provision should be made in the judgment for the payment by the respondents of the rent accrued since 1st of May, 1884, and it should be credited to the appellants in taking that account. There remains to be considered the special defences of Shaw which are: First, that he is entitled to the benefit of the registry laws. Secondly, that he is a purchaser for value without notice, and as such entitled to the protection afforded by the general doctrines of the courts of equity to such purchasers. As regards the registry laws, the sections of the Nova Scotia Registry Act (Revised Statutes Nova Scotia cap. 84) which are relied on are the 18th and 25th. The lease itself was duly registered many years ago. The 18th section provides that deeds of land not registered shall be void against subsequent purchasers who shall first register. The memorandum indorsed on the lease was not a deed and does not come within this provision[12]. The 25th section provides that leases of lands for a term exceeding three years shall be void against any subsequent purchaser for valuable consideration, unless such lease shall have been previously registered. This section also appears to me to be inapplicable. First it seems only to apply to leases for years. But without insisting on this I am of opinion that the memorandum of the 6th of April, 1852, indorsed on the lease was not itself a lease coming within this clause. Further, I agree with both Mr. Justice Ritchie and Mr. Justice Henry that there is sufficient evidence of actual (not merely constructive) notice to be found in the admission of Shaw and the evidence of Robie McLatchy to disentitle him to the benefit of the registry laws. He admits he knew of the dispute when he took his deed, and Robie McLatchy, one of the respondents, swears that he gave him notice. Further, he appears to me to have been a speculative purchaser who bargained for and bought, not the fee simple estate in possession or any precise interest, but just such an estate as the conveyances he took\u2014a mere quit claim deed in one instance\u2014would confer on him. If so (and I do not decide this fact positively) he cannot take advantage of the Registry Act. Such purchasers, it has been decided both in Ireland[13] and Ontario[14], are not within the statutory protection conferred by such acts. Lastly, the defence of purchase for value without notice also fails for the reason already stated under the other head, that Shaw had notice.\nThe result is that I agree in all respects with Mr. Justice Henry in both his reasons and conclusion. Subject to the slight variation as to setting off the accrued rents payable under the lease against mesne profits, both the appeal and cross appeal must be dismissed with costs.\nTASCHEREAU, SEDGEWICK and KING JJ. concurred.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014The action in this case was brought by the respondents as plaintiffs claiming under an indenture of lease for lives executed by one John Fraser since deceased, under whom the defendants claim, to one Preserved Coffil, under whom the plaintiffs claim, to be entitled to possession of the land in the lease mentioned, from which they had been evicted by the entry of the defendants thereon in the month of June 1884. The plaintiffs in their statement of claim, after setting out the original indenture of lease and tracing title to the possession of the land therein mentioned by mesne assignments of the indenture of lease from the lessee and an indorsement alleged to have been made thereon in 1852 by Elizabeth Fraser devisee of the lessor John Fraser, and the entry and eviction by the defendants in 1884, claimed among other things as follows:\u2014 1. A declaration that they are entitled to the possession of and the receipt of the rents and profits of the said tract or parcel of land.\n2. A declaration that James Shand junior, now James Shand, was inserted in the said lease as a new life in the place of the life of Elizabeth Coffil which had fallen, and that the said lease was renewed for the life of James Shand junior, now James Shand, or in the alternative that the defendants be ordered, decreed and adjudged to insert the said James Shand as a new life in the said lease in the place of the life of Elizabeth Coffil which has fallen; or to execute to the plaintiffs a lease of the said tract or parcel of land upon the terms and conditions contained in the said lease for the life of the said James Shand renewable for ever by the insertion of new lives as in said lease provided.\n3. An account of the rents and profits of said tract or parcel of land received by the defendants or any or either of them since June, 1884, or which without the wilful default of the defendants might have been received, and payment of that amount to the plaintiffs.\nThe learned judge who tried the case, Mr. Justice Ritchie, made a decree in favour of the plaintiffs, whereby it was adjudged that the entry by the defendants in 1884 was wrongful, and that the plaintiffs are entitled to the possession of the said piece of land.\n2. An account in favour of the plaintiffs was directed and decreed to be taken of the rents and profits received, or which but for the wilful default of the defendants might have been received by them, from the date of such their entry in June, 1884, up to the time of the bringing of the action.\n3. It was thereby further decreed that the defendants do execute to the plaintiff Edward McLatchy, upon proof by him of conveyance to him by the other plaintiffs other than the plaintiff Margaret E. G. Pernette of all their right, title and interest in said tract or parcel of land and upon payment of the sum of $182.95 a lease for the life of James Shand of Halifax in the county of Halifax auctioneer and two other persons to be named by said Edward McLatchy, renewable for ever, of said tract or parcel of land in the terms of the decree set out in plaintiffs\u2019 statement of claim, in so far as the same are now applicable, the form of such lease to be settled by a judge.\nUpon appeal by the defendants to the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia the judgment of Mr. Justice Ritchie was varied by striking out of the decree the said third paragraph above extracted providing for the execution of a lease to the plaintiff Edward McLatchy and affirming in other respects the said judgment and decree.\nThe Chief Justice of the Supreme Court dissented from this judgment for the reason that in his opinion there had been a complete forfeiture of the lease for which the plaintiffs had shown no equity to be relieved, and that judgment in the action should have been rendered for the defendants.\nFrom the judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia both parties appeal, the defendants contending that judgment should have been rendered for them, and the plaintiffs, on the contrary, insisting that the paragraph expunged from the decree made by Mr. Justice Ritchie should be restored.\nThere is, in my opinion, no foundation whatever for the contention urged before us, that the indorsement made in 1852 upon the lease by Mrs. Fraser, the devisee of the lessor, can be construed to operate, either as a new lease for the life of James Shand alone therein mentioned, renewable for ever by the substitution of another life in his place upon his death, and so on for ever by the substitution of a new life from time to time as each substituted life falls, or as an agreement for such a lease of which specific performance can be decreed by this court.\nThe true construction of the lease of the 16th June, 1805, in my opinion, is that it was a lease of the premises therein mentioned to the lessee, his executors, administrators and assigns, for and during the term of the joint lives of the lessee and of his wife and his brother named in the lease, subject to payment of the rent reserved and to renewal by the substitution of another life in the place of each of such lives, as each should fall, and the payment of a renewal fine of four pounds within twelve months after the falling in of each life. The words of the habendum are:\nTo have and to hold, &c., &c., for and during the natural lives of him the said Preserved Coffil, Patrick Coffil, brother of the said Preserved Coffil, and Elizabeth Coffil, wife of the said Preserved Coffil, and renewable for ever.\nThe term thus granted is a term, renewable it is true as specified in the lease, but still the term granted is only for the duration of the joint lives of the three persons named. Then the words of the reddendum are \u201cyielding and paying therefor during the term hereby granted, &c., &c.,\u201d and it was expressly provided by the lease that in case of failure on the part of the said Preserved Coffil, his executors, administrators or assigns, in performing the covenants and agreements therein contained, then and from thenceforth it should and might be lawful for the said John Fraser, his heirs, executors, administrators and assigns, into the said premises to re-enter, and the said lessee, his executors, administrators and assigns, to evict, put out, and remove, notwithstanding anything contained in the indenture of lease to the contrary. The lessee then, among other covenants contained in the indenture, covenanted with the lessor his heirs, &c., &c., that he the lessee, his executors, administrators and assigns should and would, \u201cat the fall of every life mentioned in this indenture\u201d pay to the said lessor his heirs, &c., &c., the sum of four pounds for inserting a new life in place of the one so fallen, and that, if such new life should not be inserted and the sum of four pounds so paid within twelve months after the fall of each life, the said lessee, his executors, &c., &c., should forfeit and lose their rights of renewal of such fallen life. The term thus granted, being for the joint lives of the three named, ceased upon the falling of any one life, and the effect of this latter clause was to give to the lessee, his executors &c. &c. twelve months within which they could procure a renewal by payment of the fine of four pounds for each life fallen and the substitution of a new life in the place of each life so fallen, and during such year the lessee, his executors &c., could not be disturbed in their possession. The lease then provided that, whenever any question should arise as to the continuance in life of any of the persons for whose lives the term was granted, the onus should lie upon the lessee, his executors &c., to prove such person to be living, or in default that the person about whom such question should arise should be taken to be dead. Now the utmost operation which upon the proper construction of this lease can be given to the indorsement upon it made by Mrs. Fraser in 1852 is\u2014that such indorsement operated as an acknowledgment then made by her that Mrs. Coffil one of the lives named in the lease had fallen, the other two lives being then still in existence, and as an acceptance of James Shand in the place and stead of Mrs. Coffil, and as an acknowledgment that, the fine for a renewal having been paid, McLatchy the plaintiffs\u2019 assignee was entitled to have a renewal lease for the term of the joint lives of Preserved Coffil, Patrick Coffil and James Shand, under and subject to the conditions contained in the lease for further renewal; and upon the principle that equity-deems that to be done which ought to be done, it may perhaps be construed to have amounted in equity to a renewal of the lease for such further term. To give the indorsement on the lease such operation there can be no objection, but no greater or other operation can be given to it. The defendants, as heirs at law of the devisee of the lessor, entered into possession of the demised premises in June, 1884, claiming that the term granted by the lease had expired and that the lessees\u2019 representatives had forfeited all right of renewal. The question now has arisen in this action whether that entry was rightful or wrongful. Under the terms of the lease the onus was cast upon the plaintiffs to prove it to have been wrongful. In order to do so it was necessary for them, treating the indorsement on the lease in 1852 to be a renewal lease under the terms of the indenture of 1805, to have proved either that Preserved Coffil, Patrick Coffil and James Shand were all living in June, 1884, or, if any of them was dead, that when the defendants entered the year after the death within which the plaintiff had a right to obtain a renewal by payment of the fine of four pounds for each fallen life had not expired. They showed James Shand to be still living, but they failed to show that in June, 1884, when the defendants entered, Preserved Coffil and his brother Patrick Coffil were living. They must therefore in the terms of the lease be taken to have been then dead. The lease therefore, giving to the plaintiffs the full benefit of their contention that the indorsement on the lease in 1852 operated as a renewal of the lease, such renewal being of a renewal for a new term, namely, for the term of the joint lives of Preserved Coffil, his brother Patrick and James Shand, had expired and not having been renewed within the provision in that behalf in the lease, the entry by the defendants in June, 1884, was rightful.\nThe plaintiffs\u2019 case therefore is resolved into a claim for relief in equity against a plain forfeiture of their right to renewal, for which relief no case whatever that can be entertained has been made.\nThe appeal therefore of the defendants must, in my opinion, be allowed with costs and that of the plaintiffs dismissed, and judgment be ordered to be entered for the defendants in the action, with costs in all the courts below.\nAppeal and Cross-appeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellants: W. & J.

S. C. c. 122 s. 20.\nL. borrowed a sum of money from a savings bank which he agreed to repay with interest, transferring in pledge as collateral security letters of credit on the Government of Quebec. L. having become insolvent the bank filed its claim for the amount of the loan with interest, which the curator of the estate and, on appeal, the appellants, as creditors of L., contested on the ground that the said securities were not of the class mentioned in the act relating to savings banks, (R. S. C. c. 122 s. 20), and the bank's act in making said loan was ultra vires and illegal.\nHeld, that L having received good and valid consideration for his promise to repay the loan, could not, nor could the appellants, his creditors who had no other rights than the debtor himself had impugn the contract of loan or be admitted to assail the pledge of the securities.\nAssuming that the act of the bank in lending the money, on the pledge of such securities, was ultra vires, although this might affect the pledge as regards third parties interested in the securities, it was not, of itself and ipso facto, a radical nullity of public order of such a character as to disentitle the bank under arts. 989 and 990 C.C. from claiming back the money with interest. Bank of Tor onto v. Perkins (8 Can. S. C. R. 903) distinguished.\nAPPEAL and Cross-AppeAl from a decision of the court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada (appeal side) ([1]), varying the judgment of the Superior Court ([2]), in favour of the respondent bank. The material facts giving rise to the litigation in this case are as follows :\nOn the 11th February 1891 one J. A. Langlais then Ea stationer, in a large way of business in Quebec, borrowed from the Caisse d'Economie, respondents, the sum of twenty-two thousand five hundred dollars, which he agreed to return within one year from that date with interest at 7 per cent. To secure the payment of this sum and the interest the borrower transferred to the bank as collateral security, a document described as a letter of credit signed by the Provincial Secretary, and dated 10th February, 1891.\nSubsequently, on the 23rd February, 1891, Langlais borrowed two further sums of thirty thousand dollars each from the Caisse, and again as collateral security transferred to the bank two other documents called letters of credit signed by the then Prime Minister, Hon. H. Mercier.\nSubsequently, before returning these loans, Langlais become insolvent made an abandonment of his property (763a C. P. C.) for the benefit of his creditors, and to this abandonment one Docith\u00e9 Arcand was ap pointed curator and the bank filed a claim with the curator for the amount of Langlais' indebtedness.\nLanglais' estate having been disposed of by the curator the latter prepared a dividend sheet for the purpose of distributing the moneys realized among the creditors as their rights appeared and the bank was collocated on the dividend sheet for the amount of its claim, namely, for the sum of eighty-seven thousand five hundred and four dollars and seventy-six cents. This claim was contested by the curator and this contestation was tried before Mr. Justice Andrews in the Superior Court at Quebec and dismissed. From this judgment an appeal was taken to the Court of Appeal, not by the curator, but by a creditor, Mr. Rolland, the appellant herein, and the Court of Queen's Bench, sitting at Quebec, allowed the appeal in part, holding that the bank was entitled to rank as a creditor Upon Langlais's estate for the amount loaned to Langlais, but that it was not entitled to interest on the claim. From this latter judgment both sides have appealed.\nThe Caisse d'Economie is a savings bank, incorporated by 34 Vic, chap. 7, and the law applicable to savings banks at the time this contract was entered into will be found in chap. 122 of the Revised Statutes of Canada section 20 of which is as follows :\nThe bank may also loan such moneys, upon the personal securities of individuals, or to any corporate bodies, if collateral securities of the nature mentioned in the next preceding section, or British or foreign public securities, or stock of some chartered bank in Canada, or stock in any incorporated building society, or bonds or debentures, or stock of any incorporated institution or company, are taken in addition to such personal or corporate security, with authority to sell such securities if the loan is not paid.\nThe creditors of Langlais contended that the letters of credit pledged to the bank were not securities of the kind mentioned in this section and that the loan was, therefore ultra vires of the bank and the estate was not liable to pay it.\nDrouin Q.C. for the appellants Rolland and others. The Caisse d'Economie is governed by statute law and has no powers other than those conferred by statute. Brice on Ultra Vires ([3]); Ashbury Railway Co. v. Riche ([4]).\nThe pretended loan is a radical nullity affecting public order. Brice on Ultra Vires ([5]); Arts. 989 and 990 C. C. And see Bank of Toronto v Perkins ([6]); Bunk of Montreal v. Geddes ([7]).\nThe contract being contrary to public order the bank cannot enforce payment any more than it could claim performance if it were executory. 31 Demolombe ([8]); Troplong ([9]); Pothier ([10]); Aubry & Rau ([11]). Langelier Q.C. and Fitzpatrick Q.C. for La Caisse d'Economie. Whether or not the loan was ultra vires is immaterial. There was an advance by the bank to Langlais which created a valid debt, and the courts will not aid the debtor to repudiate it. Bank of Australasia v. Cherry ([12]); Ayers v. South [13]ustralian Banking Co, ([14]); Grant v. La Banque Nationale ([15]).\nThe creditors are in no different position than Langlais would have been if sued personally. Tour ville v. Valentine ([16]).\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by :\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014The principal appeal must fail. I would have dismissed it at the hearing, without calling on the respondent. Such an attempt to plunder this bank in the name of public order and public policy, such a self-constituted championship of public interests in order to defeat a legitimate claim, cannot receive the countenance of a court of justice. The appellants' contention that Langlais received no legal consideration for his undertaking to pay the bank the sum of $82,500, with interest, is to me an astonishing one.\nWas not the good, legal coin to that amount (less discount) advanced to him by the bank, a consideration? And a most valid and substantial one? On a contract of loan (mutuum) the thing lent is the consideration for the borrower's promise to pay, the curpromisit as Demolombe calls it (5). And in the case of a loan of money, the use and enjoyment of the amount lent for the time agreed upon is the consideration for the payment of the interest in addition to the amount lent. The word c consideration,\" I may here notice, in arts. 989 and 990 of the Quebec Code is clearer than the word \" cause \" in the corresponding articles of the French Code.\nAssuming that the bank had not the power to lend him that money, did not Langlais, nevertheless, receive, as a matter of fact, a good and valid consideration for his promise to pay both capital and interest?\nCan he say that he gave his note without consideration, or for an illegal consideration?\nIs it not the converse, and he, or the appellants for him, who want to pocket over $82,000 of the bank's funds, without ever having given any consideration for it to the bank?\nHe gave his note for value received. Did he not receive this value? Is there anything illegal in his promise to pay it back? The illegality, it is plain, would be the other way; he would if the appellants' contentions prevailed, have got richer by $82,500 to the clear detriment of the bank.\nThen there is no direct prohibition in the statutory provision affecting this case, as there was in Bank of Toronto v. Perkins ([17]); and nullities of the nature of those in question in that case must be restricted to the narrowest limits. Solon, Nullites ([18]); Duncomb v. N. Y. Housalonic and N. Rd. Co. ([19]); Sistare v. Best ([20]). But, say the appellants, the statute does not empower the bank to effect loans on the pledge of such securities as those taken from Langlais, and consequently it acted Ultra vires in the matter.\nBut assuming this to be so, that might perhaps affect the pledge as regards third parties interested in the securities pledged but it does not bear in the least upon Langlais' contract to pay; and the appellants cannot avail themselves of it to repudiate Langl\u00e0is' liability towards the bank. The contract of loan and the contract of pledge, are so far reciprocally independent that one may stand and the other fall. They are separable contracts. See per Miller J., National Bank v. Matthews ([21]).\nA borrower cannot be allowed to cheat his lender, under the pretext that the lender had not the power to loan. Such a plea does not lie in his mouth; he is estopped from relying upon it : il na pas de qualit\u00e9 pour s'eu pr\u00e9valoir. \" Pas de nullit\u00e9 sans griefs, \" says Solon, Nullit\u00e9s ([22]). Still less, would I say, \" de nullit\u00e9,\" to cover a glaring fraud.\nThe proposition laid down in Randolph ([23]), that \" One who borrows money from a corporation cannot in his own defence question its power to lend,\" is based on principles which must necessarily prevail through all the civilized world.\nAnd, as put by Sedgwick on Stat. Constr. ([24]) :\nWhere it is a simple question of capacity or authority to contract arising either on a question of regularity of organization, or of power conferred by the charter, a party who has had the benefit of the agree ment cannot be permitted, in an action founded on it, to question its validity. It would be in the highest degree inequitable and unjust to permit the defendant to repudiate a contract, the fruits of which he retains.\nThe appellants' case rests on a fallacy. They assume as law the untenable proposition that the ultra vires act of the bank, always assuming that ultra vires there was in lending this money to Langlais, is, by itself and ipso facto, a radical nullity of public order of such a character as to disentitle the bank under arts 989 and 990 C. C. to claim it back, and free Langlais for ever from his contract to repay it.\nPothier ([25]), speaking of a case where a lender had no right to lend, says : N\u00e9anmoins si de fait l'emprunteur a de bonne foi consomm\u00e9 l'argent ou les autres choses qu'il a re\u00e7ues, cette consomption suppl\u00e9e \u00e0 ce qui manquait \u00e0 la validit\u00e9 du contrat, et oblige l'emprunteur envers le pr\u00eateur \u00e0 la restitution d'une pareille somme ou quantit\u00e9 que celle qu'il a recue, de la m\u00eame mani\u00e8re que si le contrat eut en toute sa perfection. La consomption qu'en fait l'emprunteur r\u00e9pare le vice qui na\u00eet de l'incapacit\u00e9 que le pr\u00eateur avait de contracter ou d'ali\u00e9ner.\nAnd in the case of the loan of a thing not belonging to the lender where the borrower has had the delivery of the thing lent the contract is perfectly good between the lender and the borrower. The owner is the only party entitled to complain ([26]).\nOn the same, or kindred principles, a depositary is estopped from controverting the depositor's title ([27]), an agent is precluded from questioning his principal's title to the subject matter of the agency, a bailee of any kind from disputing his bailor's rights, and a lessee from disputing the title of his landlord to the premises demised. If Langlais had leased a house from the bank he could not refuse to pay the rent on the ground that the bank is not, by its charter, empowered to own real estate, supposing that tobe so. And, even where by its charter a corporation is not empowered to contract but under seal, yet, where a contract, within the purposes for which it has been created, has been executed and the corporation has received the benefit of it, it is not permitted to claim exemption from liability upon the ground that the contract was not under the corporate seal ([28]).\nSome modern writers seem to controvert Pothier's views as expressed in the passage I have quoted; (it seems to be thought a mark of distinction nowadays, among a certain class of writers in France to controvert Pothier). But we adopt his opinion as a correct exposition of the law. Then, no book goes to the length of saying that the borrower is at liberty to avail himself of his lenders legal incapacities, of whatever nature, in order to repudiate the repayment of the loan, when the lender's part of the contract has been executed by the delivery of the thing lent to the borrower, and its consumption by him. Of all the possible pleas to an action ex mutuo ([29]), the appellants have the merit of having found a novel one. That is the only merit of their case.\nIt is an incontrovertible proposition that no private individual has the right to institute legal proceedings against a corporation, on account of ultra vires acts of the said corporation, however great the detriment caused by these acts to the public or to others than himself unless he has himself been personally damnified.\nNow, as a general rule, what cannot be used as a weapon cannot be resorted to as a shield, and any one who has incurred liabilities under an executed contract with a corporation of which he has got the benefit cannot get rid of his liabilities on the sole ground that the corporation acted in the matter beyond its powers, though within the purposes for which it was created, unless he has a legitimate interest to do so or has suffered, or is exposed to suffer from the alleged infringement of the corporation's charter.\nAnd here, not only has Langlais not suffered any prejudice or been damnified in any way by the act of the bank but it is to damnify the bank and burden it with the loss of over $80,000 that, in the name of public order and public interests, he, or the appellants for him impugn his dealing with the bank as ultra vires in order to repudiate his promise to pay, after having had the full benefit of the contract A more flagrant misapplication of the doctrine of ultra vires, it is hardly possible to conceive. If the bank had lent this money to Langlais without any security whatever, the appellants would contend forsooth, that Langlais was not bound to repay it because the bank is not authorized to lend without security; they would contend that a party can go to a bank, get his note discounted, and at maturity refuse to pay it on the ground that the bank had no authority to advance him that money, and had acted beyond its statutory powers in doing so.\nThey were not able, as might be expected, to find any authorities to support their contentions, though their case was presented to us with great ability and learning. Those they cited have no application. Collins v. Blantern ([30]), and that class of cases under the English law, are clearly distinguishable, and the authorities under the French law do not give them more assistance.\nAnd it is not merely the contract of loan that Langlais, and the appellants for him, are precluded from impugning. The pledge itself of these securities, likewise, they cannot be admitted to assail. For, Langlais is, in law, the warrantor of the bank (upon this contract of pledge; a pledge implies a warranty from the pledger, and even if these securities had not belonged to Langlais, yet this pledge would have been perfectly valid as between him and the bank ([31]). Now though here the alleged incapacity to contract is in the pledgee, the rule still applies, it seems to me, that as pledger, Langlais cannot impeach the contract of pledge on the ground of that incapacity. He is pre sumed in law to have known of that incapacity when he effected this loan. And had he, on any ground whatever even for nullity of public order, if any such nullity there be at any time claimed the restitution of the securities pledged he never could have obtained it in the terms of art. 1975 C.C., until full payment in principal, interest, and costs ci his note to the bank. And, on the other hand, upon such payment, the bank would have been bound to return the pledge to him, and would never have had the right to refuse to do so on the ground that their contract of pledge with him was null for reasons of public policy, as ultra vires on their part.\nTheir attempt to prove that Langlais had not benefited from this loan was rightly checked by the Superior Court. The bank was not bound to see what disposition Langlais made of this money. He had the jus ulendi et abutendi over it; it is for the lender, a matter of total indifference whether the borrower doubles the amount lent, or keeps it idle, or throws it in the river. As to the appellants' contention, that as creditors they have the right to invoke the nullity 01 their debtor's contract in the matter, though their debtor himself might not have had the right to do so, it has been correctly rejected by the two courts below. There is no foundation for it in this case. Unquestionably, in cases of fraud, and of contracts made in fraud of creditors, the curator's or assignee's and creditors' interests are adverse to those of the insolvent, and they do not represent him when acting to set aside his fraudulent dealings; but here, there is nothing of the kind; and the appellants have no other rights than those their debtor himself had; and the rule that \"aequum est neminem cum alterius detrimento fieri locupletiorem \" applies to them as it did to their debtor. His insolvency has substituted them to all his rights, but they must, with his rights, bear the burden of his liabilities. They are seized with his estate, but cum onere.

Two years later he sold his mining rights in the land and by various conveyances they were finally transferred to B., each assignment purporting to convey \"all mines, minerals and mining rights already found or which may hereafter be found\" on said land A year after the transfer to B. the original vendor, M., granted the exclusive right to work mines and veins of mica on said land \"to W. &Co. who proceeded to develop the mica. B. then claimed an option to purchase the mica mines under the original agreement and demanded an arbitration to fix the price which was refused, and she brought an action to compel M. to appoint an arbitrator and for damages.\nHeld, affirming the decision of the Court of Queen's Bench, that the option to purchase other minerals could only be exercised in respect to such as were found when actually working the phosphate, which was not the case with the mica as to which B claimed the option.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada (appeal side) affirming the judgment of the Superior Court in favour of the defendant.\nThe material facts of the case are sufficiently set forth in the above head-note. The Superior Court dismissed the plaintiffs' action and its judgment was affirmed by the Court of Queen's Bench from whose decision the plaintiffs appealed to this court.\nThe judgment of the majority of the judges in the Court of Queen's Bench was delivered by Chief Justice Lacoste and was as follows :\nAppel d'un jugement de la, Cour Sup\u00e9rieure, District d'Ottawa, qui d\u00e9boute l'appelante de son action.\nL'appelante comme \u00e9tant aux droits d'un nomm\u00e9 \"Wilkinson r\u00e9clame de l'intim\u00e9 McLelland un droit de pr\u00e9emption sur les minerais de la demie sud du lot n 10 B du quatorzi\u00e8me rang du Township de Hull, que ce dernier a vendu aux autres intim\u00e9s, et de plus $20,000 de dommages, consistant principalement dans des profits qu'elle aurait faits sur le mica extrait par les intim\u00e9s acqu\u00e9reurs\nEn 1877 McLelland a c\u00e9d\u00e9 a Wilkins le droit d'extraire du phosphate de la mine en question. Dans le contrat de cession, se trouve la clause suivante:\n\"In case the said purchaser in working the said mines should find some other minerals of any kind whatever he shall have the privilege of buying the same from the said vendor or representatives by paying the price set upon the same by two arbitrators appointed by the parties.\"\nWilkins a travaill\u00e9 la mine pendant cinq ans, puis a discontinue. Durant tout ce temps il n'a pas fait option d'acheter les autres minerais qu'il a pu trouver\nQuelle est l'\u00e9tendue de la promesse de vente contenue dans la clause pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e? Elle est limit\u00e9e an minerai que Wilkins trouverait en extrayant le phosphate, et \u00e0 celui-l\u00e0 seulement, et non \u00e0 tons les autres minerais qui se trouveraient dans la mine et qui n'auraient pas \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9couverts dans l'exploitation du phosphate. Le droit de pr\u00e9emption est subordonn\u00e9 \u00e0 l'exploitation de la mine de phosphate. Comme le dit le juge de premi\u00e8re instance, l'esprit de la clause, est de permettre \u00e0 l'acqu\u00e9reur de tirer parti de tout autre minerai qu'il tirerait de la mine exploit\u00e9e en extrayant le phosphate. C'est le minerai trouv\u00e9 pendant l'exploitation que l'acqu\u00e9reur s'est r\u00e9serv\u00e9 le droit d'acheter.\nDans le cas d'ambiguit\u00e9 d'une clause, elle doit s'interpr\u00e9ter contre celui qui a stipul\u00e9 et en faveur de celui qui a contract\u00e9 l'obligation (:C. C. 1019.) or c'est Wilkins qui a stipul\u00e9 et c'est McLelland qui a contracte l'obligation.\nEn outre la clause constitue une promesse de vente unilat\u00e9rale. .Or cette promesse n'emporte alienation de la chose, que du jour o\u00f9 celui \u00e0 gui elle est faite a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 vouloir en profiter, jusque l\u00e0 elle ne conf\u00e8re aucun droit reel opposable aux tiers. McLelland restait donc propri\u00e9taire de l'objet de la promesse, jusqu'a ce que Wilkins eut signifi\u00e9 son intention d'acheter. D\u00e8s lors, McLelland pouvait louer, vendre et faire avec les tiers tons les actes de propri\u00e9taire. Ilpouvait donc c\u00e9der le droit d'extraire tout autre minerai que le phosphate aux tiers et le recours de Wilkins se r\u00e9sumait dans une action en dommages pour in\u00e9x\u00e9cution de la promesse de vente- McLelland n'est donc pas en mesure d'ex\u00e9cuter aujourd'hui sa promesse de vente, et pour cc motif la conclusion principale de l'action, c'est-\u00e0-dire, celle par laquelle l'appelante demande l'ex\u00e9cution d'une vente, devrait \u00eatre renvoy\u00e9e, Et l'appelante ne reste sans aucun recours contre les intim\u00e9s, tiers-acqu\u00e9reuss de la mine de mica.\nMaintenant quant aux dommages r\u00e9clam\u00e9s. Ils consisteraient principalement dans le droit r\u00e9galien que les acqu\u00e9reurs auraient pay\u00e9 \u00e0. McLelland, mais ce droit r\u00e9galien repr\u00e9sentait le droit de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de McLelland dans le mica. Ce dernier n'\u00e9tait pas tenu d'attendre que Wilkins eut fait son option pour disposer de sa propri\u00e9t\u00e9 dans le mica. Je suppose que Wilkins eut exploit\u00e9 le phosphate, McLelland aurait pu disposer du mica extrait en m\u00eame temps, jusqu'\u00e0 ce qu'il eat \u00e9t\u00e9 arr\u00eat\u00e9 par une demande r\u00e9guli\u00e8re d'achat de la part de Wilkins. Ce dernier avait l'option, mais tant qu'il n'optait pas, McLelland pouvait se servir de sa propri\u00e9t\u00e9. D'o\u00f9 je conclus que McLelland avait le droit de percevoir la royaut\u00e9, quelle lui appartenait et qu'lle ne pent pas-\u00eatre r\u00e9clam\u00e9e par l'appelante \u00e0 titre de dommages.\nLa seconde clause des dommages r\u00e9clam\u00e9s, consisterait dans le fait que les mis en cause auraient jet\u00e9 de la Pierre dans les trous, faits autrefois par Wilkins en extrayant le phosphate. Rien n'indique que l'appelante ait l'intention de continuer l'exploitation de la mine de phosphate. Ces dommages sont probl\u00e9matiques et ind\u00e9termin\u00e9s. Peut-\u00eatre l'appelante trouvera-t-elle dans ces pierres du phosphate em quantit\u00e9 suffisante pour l'indemniser. McIntosh, le seul t\u00e9moin qui parle de ces dommages, le-fait d'une mani\u00e8re vague.\nSi l'appelante a un recours, ce n'est pas dans la pr\u00e9sente cause o\u00f9 elle demande l'ex\u00e9cution d'une promesse de vente, et les dommages resultant de l'inex\u00e9cution de cette promesse. Or les dommages ne-r\u00e9sultent pas de l'inex\u00e9cution de promesse mais d'une cause qui lui est \u00e9trang\u00e9re.\nMcDougall Q.C. for the appellants. The option to purchase was not a mere personal right, but one capable of being assigned. Pothier, Obligations ([1]); 4 Aubry & Rau ([2]).\nIt was not a requisite that minerals must be found during the actual working to allow the purchaser to exercise his option. If it was, the evidence shows that mica was discovered by Welkins while operating the phosphate, but mica was not then valuable. The right of option was merely held in abeyance, but was not lost by lapse of time and cannot be considered as abandoned. 24 Laurent ([3]).\nAylen for the respondents referred to Webster v. Watters ([4]); Levy v. Connolly ([5]); 24 Laurent ([6]); Troplong ([7]).\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.

I would dismiss this appeal for the reasons given by Mr, Justice Tascherau.\nTASCHEREAU J. This appeal must be dismissed for the reasons given by Chief Justice Lacoste in the Court of Queen's Bench. The appellants have no right of action. The clause in McLelland's sale to Wilkins, the appellants' auteur, upon which she bases her claim against the respondents is not free from ambiguity, but, as remarked by the learned Chief Justice, this ambiguity must be interpreted against the appellants.\nSEDGEWICK and KING JJ. concurred.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellants : J.

Arts. 676 to 691.\nD. a retired employee of the government of Quebec in receipt of a pension under arts. 676 and 677 R.S.Q., surrendered said pension for a lump sum to the government, and subsequently he and his wife brought an action to have it revived and the surrender cancelled. By art. 690 of R. S. P. Q. the pension or half pension is neither transferable nor subject to seizure, and by art. 683, the wife of D. on his death would have been entitled to an allowance equal to one-half of his pension.\nHeld, reversing the decision of the Court of Review, Strong C.J. and Sedgwick J. dissenting, that D. after his retirement was not a permanent official of the government of Quebec and the transaction was not, therefore, a resignation by him of office and a return by the government, under art. 688, of the amount contributed by him to the pension fund; that the policy of the legislation m arts. 685 and 690 is to make the right of a retired official to his pension inalienable even to the government; that D.'s wife had a vested interest jointly with him during his life in the pension and could maintain proceedings to conserve it; and therefore that the surrender of the pension should be canceled.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Superior Court for Lower Canada, sitting in review at Quebec ([1]), dismissing the petition of the appellants for cancellation of a surrender of pension to the government. The facts are sufficiently set out in the above head-note and. in the judgments of the court.\nBurroughs for the appellants.\nCannon Q.C. Assistant Attorney General of Quebec for the respondent.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014 This is an action by Charles John Burroughs and Edm\u00e9e Dionne, his wife, asking that a pension of $242 a year, payable monthly, awarded to the husband as a retired employee of the Provincial Government of Quebec, pursuant to the provisions of the Revised Statutes of Quebec regulating the civil service of that province, and which pension he commuted some four months after it was granted, for $382, may be revived and the surrender cancelled\nIn the Superior Court Mr. Justice Andrews dismissed the action, and his judgment was affirmed by the Court of Review.\nThe wife sues claiming to be interested, as, in the event of her husband dying in her lifetime entitled to the. pension, she would be entitled to an allowance equal to one-half of that granted to the husband.\nThe validity of the commutation is impugned for three reasons: \u20141. It is said that the commutation or surrender of the pension was illegal and void under section 690 of the Revised Statutes. 2. Because the surrender was void under the general law, as being against public policy, 3. Because it prejudicially affected the rights of the wife (conferred by section 683 of the Revised Statutes) to receive a half pension on the death of her husband.\nSection 690 enacts that:\nThe pension or'half pension is neither transferable nor subject to seizure.\nIt is clear that the surrender of the pension was not a transfer or cession. The plain object of this provision was, that pensions should not be sold or assigned to speculators or others, and to assure that the pension, which was intended as an alimentary allowance to persons who whilst they remained under sixty years of age might be recalled to the public service, should be applied to its legitimate uses. There was nothing inconsistent with this that the government itself should be able to take a surrender from a superannuated officer, who, for his own reasons, might wish to be rid of the conditions imposed by section 686, which make it imperative upon him to reside within the limits of the province.\nI am equally clear that the general law, on principles of public policy, does not forbid such a surrender. It would be a great hardship upon a retired civil servant, who might for many reasons, health, business, employment or convenience, have to live out of the province if he should be unable to commute his pension and consequently be compelled to forfeit it. The commutation was therefore unimpeachable on this ground.\nMrs. Burroughs has no locus standi to maintain the action. She has no vested interest, but merely a contingent right to a pension in the event of surviving her husband, provided he dies in active service, or whilst in the enjoyment of a pension. It would indeed be a strange result if a superannuated civil servant under sixty years of age should be unable to reside beyond the limits of the province without his wife's assent, or without giving her a right of action against the government, if they commuted the pension at his request, in order that he might not forfeit it by taking up his residence outside the province of Quebec, yet that would be the consequence of a judgment in favor of the appellants.\nThe appeal must be dismissed with costs. FOURNIER J.\u2014I would allow this appeal for the reasons given by Mr. Justice Gwynne.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014This is a proceeding by petition of right instituted in the province of Quebec against the government of that province by Charles John Bur-roughs and his wife, s\u00e9par\u00e9e de biens, wherein they allege that on or about the 28th day of December, 1878, the said Charles John Burroughs was appointed a permanent clerk in the civil service of the province rand continued in such employment until the 31st day of January 1891 when he was compelled by ill-health to resign the office which as such civil servant he had held and for that reason to retire from the public service and that by an order in council bearing date the said 31st day of January, 1891, he was permitted to retire from the civil service under the provisions of the law in that behalf as a person no longer capable by reason of ill-health to discharge the duties of his office, and by the same order another person was appointed to fill the office which he had filled in the employment of the government, that he thereby became entitled in virtue of the law of the province of Quebec to a pension which as provided by law was paid to him (to wit, $21.33 per month for the months of February and March, 1891. The law of the province of Quebec by which he became entitled and in virtue of which he received such pension, was first enacted by statute of the legislature of the province 40 Vic. ch. 10, intituled \"An Act to establish a pension and aid fund in favour of certain public servants and their families.\" This fund was created by the payment by each public servant of certain monthly sums of a stated percentage upon the amount of his salary. This Act was amended by 44 & 45 Vic. ch. 14, by which among other amendments, it was enacted that these monthly payments should be made into the consolidated revenue fund of the province, which, fund was charged with the payment of the pensions granted by the provisions of the Acts in that behalf. These provisions are now contained in the Revised or Consolidated Statutes of the province of Quebec in articles 676 to 691 inclusive. By article 676 a pension is granted to, (among others) every permanent member of the civil service who is incapable of discharging his ordinary duties, by reason of physical or mental infirmity, if such infirmity is not the result of bad conduct. By article 677 the amount of the pension to which such person is entitled is determined upon a scale varying according to the number of years during which the person so retiring and thereby becoming entitled to the pension has been in the public service.\nIt was under the provisions contained in these articles that upon the order in council of the 31st day of January, 1891, being passed, by which Burroughs was permitted to retire from the public service and another person was appointed in his place, that he became entitled to his pension and which was paid to him in the months of February and March, 1891. This pension was guaranteed to him for his natural life by art 685 of the statutes which enacts that the pension of every public officer or employee en retraite, that is, in retirement or who has retired from the public service or been superannuated \"is paid by the treasurer by monthly payments but not in advance.\"\nBy art. 683 it is enacted that :\nFrom and after the first day of the month which follows the date of the death of a public officer or employee, half the pension which the deceased received or which he would have been entitled to receive if he had been superannuated is paid to his widow for life during her widowhood.\nThat is to say one-half of the pension which by the law a superannuated or retired pubic servant was entitled to receive and received during his life or which, if at the time of his death a public servant was still in the service of the government, he would by law be entitled to receive if he had been superannuated is paid to his widow during her widowhood, and upon her death or marriage again, the article proceeds to enact that such half pension be paid by monthly instalments to those of the children of such person as had not attained the age of eighteen years, until they should attain such age.\nThe suppliants then proceed to allege in their petition of right, that about the end of the month of March, 1891, the said Charles John Burroughs without the knowledge of his said wife, and in \u00e0 moment of despondency consented, \" \u00e0 vendre ceder et abandonner \u00e0 toujours au gouvernement\" all his rights to the said pension for an insignificant sum, that is to say, $382.82; \" que la dite vente, cession et abandon \" of the said pension was accepted and ratified by an order in council dated the 24th day of April, 1891. The petition of right then submits that such \"vente, cession et abandon \" so made of the said Charles John Burroughs of said pension so accepted by the government was illegal and void for the following reasons: 1. Because by the law said pension and half pension \"sont incessibles et insaisissables.\" 2. By force of the said order in council dated the 31st of January 1891 the right to the said pension had become a right acquired by (or vested in) not only the said Charles John Burroughs but his wife and children also and that he could not alone dispose of it or renounce it to their prejudice. 3. Because the said sale would have the effect of depriving the female suppliant, his wife of the half pension (to which she hath right by force of the law) after the decease of her husband. 4. Because the suppliants have children who would be deprived of the interest Which the law gives to them in the said. pension in the event of their surviving their father. 5. Because the said transaction is prohibited by the law. The suppliants then pray that the renunciation, sale, surrender and relinquishment of his said pension by the said Charles John Burroughs to the government, as well as the order in council of the 24th April 1891 accepting such surrender, are illegal and void, and that the government may be condemned to pay to the said Charles John Burroughs the balance due for monthly instalments of his said pension upon and from the 1st April, 1891, after deducting as payments on account thereof the said $382.82, and that it may be declared that the said Charles John Burroughs is entitled to his said pension in the future.\nThe Attorney General for the province of Quebec for defence of the Provincial Government to the said petition of right pleads: 1st. The general issue. 2nd. That the said Charles John Burroughs was of full age and stricken with no legal incapacity at the date of the order in council of the 24th April 1891 by which the government accepted the sale and surrender of the said suppliant's pension, previously made by him about the end of the month of March, 1891, for the price and sum of $382.82. 3rd. That the said Charles John Burroughs had a right to surrender that pension as he did do in manner aforesaid. 4th. That the said order in council of the 24th April, 1891, is regular and legal and ought to be maintained. 5th. That all and each of the allegations in the said petition of right are unfounded in law.\nThe case came down for hearing in the Superior Court for the district of Quebec, upon the matters alleged in the said petition of right, the answer of the Attorney General thereto by way of defence, an admission of facts signed by the attorney of the suppliants upon their behalf and by the Attorney General of the province for the defence, and the production of copies of the orders in council of the 31st January and 24th April, 1891.\nThe learned judge of the Superior Court before whom the case was heard by his judgment has adjudged that art. 690 R.S.Q. which enacts that \" la pension et demi pension sont incessibles et insaisissables \" has no application whatever to the arrangement entered into under the order in council of the 24th April, 1891; That such arrangement was in effect a mere consent on the part of the government to an election made by Charles John Burroughs to retire from the public service and take the benefit of art. 688 rather than avail himself of the advantages offered to him by art. 676 coupled with the conditions and restrictions contained in articles 690 and 691.\nWhile of opinion that the transaction could not be assimilated to a commutation of his pension he adjudged that, even if it could, it would not therefore be illegal, and in support of this view he referred in his reasons for his judgment to a case of Wells v. Fcster ([2]), and to the Imperial statutes 47 Geo. 3 2nd. Sess ch. 25 sec. 4 and 34 & 35 Vic. ch. 36.\nHe adjudged further that the wife of Burroughs had no present legal interest in the matter and finally that the arrangement complained of, that is to say, that contained in the order of council of 24th April 1091, violates no law and is not contrary to public policy, and he therefore dismissed the petition of right with costs.\nWith reference to this judgment I may here observe that the learned judge in the reasons given for his judgment seems to have arrived at the conclusion in \"the second consid\u00e9rant of his judgment upon the assumption that Burroughs' motive for the arrangement which is embodied. in the order in council of the 24th .April was simply this\u2014\nThat Mr. Burroughs who, as the record shows, was comparatively a young man preferred not to be fettered by these two articles (686 and 691) by which he found himself restrained as to his residence and compelled to give up at any time any employment he might obtain, chose rather to completely sever his connection with the civil ser-vice and take the benefit of the art. 688 only available to those who do so.\nI must say that I can see nothing in the case in support of this assumption, although no doubt the suggestion may be true, but assuming it to be true it does not appear to me that his having been, if he was, influenced by such motive can have any bearing upon the questions raised by the petition of right, namely,. whether in April, 1891, Burroughs was a person then filling any office in the permanent employment of the government as a civil servant, who was retiring from such office, service or employment in such a manner as to demand and have repaid to him under the provisions of art 688 his contributions to the pension fund; whether in point of fact he did then retire from any office or employment held by him in the civil service under the provisions of art. 688.\nIf he was then in a position to avail himself of, and. did in point of fact retire from, the office which he had. held in the civil service under the provisions of that article and if the order in council of the 24th April-was simply a submission by the government to the provisions of that article, then undoubtedly, neither Charles J. Burroughs or his wife has now, nor can his wife or his children upon his death maintain any claim whatever against the government; this is the main point in the case, but there seems to me to be many points of difficulty which are entitled at least to very grave consideration before that conclusion can be reached, as likewise, if such conclusion can not be reached, do there appear to be many points entitled to equally grave consideration in determining upon what ground the order in council of the 24th April if maintained can be rested. The Court of Review have simply maintained the judgment of the Superior Court as free from error, but we have very fully presented to us their reasons for arriving at that conclusion which are as follows :\n1. They are of opinion that by force of art. 691 every civil servant who has been superannuated or permitted to retire from the public service upon a pension, under 60 years of age, by reason of physical or mental infirmity, is still in the public service as a public officer or employee, who is entitled to retire voluntarily from such service, and thereupon to demand as of right and to receive repayment of all the sums contributed by him to the pension fund. That under that article the will of the person employed is the law, and that the sole obligation cast upon the government is to repay to the person who has so voluntarily resigned his office Or employment the sums which he had paid to the pension fund. They hold that the order itself shows that this was precisely what was done in Burroughs' case, and that the transaction did not constitute a sale or cession or commutation of his Pension not withstanding the admissions to the contrary in the answer of the Attorney General to the petition of right, and in the admissions of facts put in as evidence namely, that the transaction was in fact a sale and surrender, but as is contended a legal sale and surrender, by Burroughs of his pension to the government for a pecuniary consideration paid in one sum in advance, and finally, they are of opinion that the transaction being of the nature which they hold it to have been it was perfectly legal and that the wife of Burroughs has not now and never can acquire any right to set aside or call in question its legality; and that even if it were illegal she would have no such right until after her husband's decease if she should then be living.\nIf these reasons be well founded undoubtedly the appeal must be dismissed but the whole argument of the learned counsel for the appellants was that they are not well founded. The case rests wholly upon the construction of the articles of the Revised Statutes of Quebec relating to the civil service and its officers and their retirement therefrom, and the right of each party so retiring either to a pension or to repayment out of the pension fund of his subscriptions to the fund, as the case may be in view of the circumstances attending his retirement By article 685 which is a transcript of sec. 1 of the provincial statute 40 Vic. ch. 9, it is enacted that\nThe members of the civil service are the deputy heads clerks and messengers permanently employed iii the departments at the seat of government and the special officers similarly (that is permanently) employed if with respect to the latter the lieutenant governor in council so orders\nIt is alleged in the petition of right and admitted in the admission of facts that Burroughs was a permanent clerk in the civil service of the province of Quebec from the 28th day of December, 1878, until the 31st day of January, 1891. By art. 616, which is a transcript of sec. 1 of the provincial statute 40 Vic. ch 10 intituled an Act to establish a pension and aid fund e en faveur\" (i.e. for the benefit or on behalf) of certain public employees and their families, there is granted a pension\u2014\nto every permanent member of the civil service who has served as such during ten years or more and has attained the full age of sixty years or who has become incapable of discharging his ordinary duties by reason of physical or mental infirmity, provided such infirmity be not caused by bad conduct. Upon the said 31st of January, 1891, Burroughs being then, as he alleged, incapable of discharging his ordinary duties by reason of physical infirmity within the meaning of that article, claimed and demanded the right to retire from the office which he held in the civil services and to be pensioned under the provisions of the said art. 676 and of art. 677.\nBy an order in council made on the said 31st day of January, 1891, such his claim and demand were recognized by the government and his resignation of his said office for the cause alleged was accepted and another person was appointed to fill the permanent office which he had filled * and thereupon Burroughs was put upon the pension list as a person entitled to the pension guaranteed to him under the provisions of the said articles 676 and 677 having regard to the duration of his service as such permanent clerk from the 28th day of December, 1878, to the 31st of January, 1891. Upon such acceptance by the government Of the only permanent office Burroughs had held in the civil service he ceased under the provision of said art. 685 to be any longer a member of the civil services.\nBy art. 685, which is a transcript of sec. 8 of the above statute 40 Vic. oh. 10 it is enacted that the pension of every public officer or employee \"en retraite\" that is who has retired upon a pension from the permanent public office which he had filled in the civil service, i is paid to him during his life by the provincial treasurer by monthly payments, but not in advance,\" and by art. 683, which is a transcript of sec. 10 of said Provencal statute 40 Vic. ch. 10, it is enacted that where a person in receipt of a pension dies, one-half of the pension of which he is in receipt, or in the event of an employee dying in the civil services one-half of the pension which such employee would have received if he had been superannuated, \" is paid to his widow for life during her widowhood to be paid to her monthly until her death or second marriage, in either of which events occurring, such half is made payable in like monthly instalments to the children under 18 until they attain that age It is admitted that during the months of February and March, 1891, Burroughs received from the provincial treasurer the monthly instalments of his pension which in these months became due to him under the provisions of the articles 676 and 677.\nNow from the above articles of the statute it is apparent that no one is a member of the civil services within the meaning of the articles but a person holding some permanent office in some department of the civil services. Burroughs held such office only as a clerk in the audit office of the treasurer's department which office he resigned upon the 31st January, 1891 for the cause already stated. That resignation was accepted and another person was appointed to fill the office resigned by him by the order in council of the 31st January 1891. The acceptance of Burroughs' resignation and the appointment of another person to the office he had held was the sole effect and purpose of that order. Not a word is said in it as to the pension to which by such resignation Burroughs became entitled that was determined by the statutory articles, and the amount to which he became entitled under art. 677 having regard to the number of years of his services and the salary of which he had been in receipt, was granted and guaranteed to him by art. 685 which imposed upon the treasurer the duty to pay him the pension to which he had such statutory right by monthly instalments and not otherwise. Burroughs never subsequently to the 31st January, 1891, has held any permanent office or employment in the civil services, and as it is only a person in possession of a permanent office in the civil service who becomes entitled by voluntary resignation of such, office to be repaid under art. 688 the sums contributed by him out of his salary to the pension fund, it is obvious, I think, beyond, all con troversy, that in April, 18.91, Burroughs was not in a position to be capable of availing himself of art. 688. But it is argued that art. 691 shows that he Was then in such a position and it is further contended that the order of that date was made by the lieutenant clover- nor in council in simple discharge of an obligation imposed upon the government by that article to refund to Burroughs as a person then retiring from the civil service under the art 688 his contributions to the pension fund. With great deference art, 691, instead of supporting that view, has in my judgment the contrary effect and the case of Wells y. Foster ([3]), referred to in support of the contention is very distinguishable from the present case. The art. 691 re cognizes in very plain language the complete resignation of an office in the civil service formerly held by the person with whom the article deals, and his right to a pension acquired by such resignation, and provision is made which is obligatory on the person so in receipt of pension to accept another appointment in the civil service at a future time if it should be offered to him in conformity with the conditions stated or in 'default that he should lose his pension. From this case Wells v. Foster (1), is quite distinguishable. There the question was whether an annual allowance made to a person who had held a place in the audit office and who upon the reduction of the department was paid this allowance for maintenance until he should be called upon to serve again with an express under standing that he was bound whenever he should be called upon to re-enter the audit office or to take any other office under the Crown of equal value and the question was whether such an allowance was assignable, and it was held that it was not upon grounds of public policy and upon the grounds that the allowance was made to him by way of retainer in the public service and in consideration of his holding himself ready, so long as it should be paid to him for future employment, and that he was by the arrangement still in the service of the government at a salary upon such a contract which, however, could be determined by the government by dismissal or otherwise as pointed out in the report of the case. It was held however, that it was against public policy that such a salary should be assignable, and in so far it is an authority in support of the present appeal l but we are not at present concerned with any such question as whether Burroughs' pension was assignable. By and by we shall have to deal with that question but at present we are only dealing with the question, whether in April, 1891, he held any permanent public office or employment in the civil service which he could then resign under art. 688, that is to say, which he could retain or resign at his own sole pleasure. He certainly held none from which he could then have been dismissed as it was held that the person whose allowance by way of salary was under consideration in Wells v. Foster ([4]) could have been; nor had he any of which he was in possession and could have retained. In my opinion it is very clear that in April, 1891, Burroughs held no office in the civil service which he could then resign under art. 68a or otherwise, and the order of the 23rd April cannot be sustained as one authorized by and made under said article. If made under that article where is to he found the authority for revoking the order in council of 31st January, 1891, which appointed Mr. Tessier as a permanent clerk in the civil service in the office which Burroughs is by the order stated to have resigned? Such authority cannot be found in the art. 688 nor, so far as appears, in any of the articles regulating the civil service. But in truth the order in council of the 24th April properly construed does not upon its face purport to have been made under the art. 688 that is to say, as an order made in a matter in respect of which the government had no discretion to exercise, but had imposed upon them the simple obligation of refunding to Burroughs, as a person then retiring voluntarily from a permanent office in the civil service then held by him, the contributions made by him out of salary monthly to the civil service pension fund, without interest. The order recites that Mr. Burroughs \" qui est \u00e0 sa retraite depuis le 1er f\u00e9vrier dernier \" had written to the treasurer of the province a letter informing him that he is ready to relinquish\u2014 what? A permanent office in the civil service then held by him? No such thing\u2014but all right to the pension of which he is in receipt, provided that the government grant to him the benefit of art. 688 of the Revised Statutes of the province. Now what is the true construction of the offer as here recited? It plainly is not an offer. to resign any permanent office then held by Burroughs, as it must needs have been if made under art. 688, for he then held no such office. It is an offer to surrender or relinquish to the government the pension of which he was then in receipt provided government would grant him the benefit of art. 688 it was simply an offer by Burroughs to give up to the government all right to his pension, if they would \"pay him the amount he would have been entitled under art. 688 to have received if he had resigned under that article which he had not. Then again it is plain that the government did not regard the offer as one which imposed upon them the simple obligation of refunding without interest the sums contributed by Burroughs to the pension fund, as they would have been if Burroughs was in point of fact then resigning under the provisions of art. 688 for the order recites that the amount which would be payable to Burroughs if his offer should be accepted was under $400, and that an arrangement closed with Burroughs for such sum in view of his age and the amount of his pension would be plainly to the advantage of the government which they should accede to. It was not then a transaction in which the government were not given any discretion to exercise as to acceptance or refusal of the offer but must simply have paid the money asked in obedience to an obligation imposed upon them by the art. 688. In fact the order thus shows upon its face that the transaction was precisely what it is alleged in the petition of right, and admitted in the answer of the Attorney General and in the admission of facts to have been, namely, a sale, surrender or relinquishment of his pension by Burroughs to the government in consideration of the paltry sum of $382.82, paid by the government therefor, and this the Attorney General in the answer to the petition of right claims to have been perfectly legal; whether it was or not is the sole issue raised by the pleadings. The learned judges in the courts below are as we have seen, of opinion that the transaction was neither a sale transfer or commutation of his pension. If it was neither and ifit cannot he as I think it cannot be supported as a transaction within the authority of art. 688, then it cannot be supported at all and of necessity the order of the 24th April 1891 being in that case null, Burroughs' right to his pension must still remain, and the relief prayed by the petition of right seems reasonable and proper. I do not think however that we can so deal with the question raised by the pleadings, which is as to the legality of the transaction wholly independently of art.: 688 as One of bargain and sale, surrender, relinquishment and cession of his pension by Burroughs to the government for the sum of $382.82.\nBy art. 690 it is enacted \"La pension et la demi-pension sont incessibles et insaissables\"\nThis language seems to have-been used by the legislature by way of amendment of sec. 14 of the above provincial statute 40 Vic. ch. 10 from which the article purports to be taken, for the language used in the said section 14 is\u2014\" La pension on demi-pension payable 'e\u00f1 vertu de cet acte ne sera ni transferable ni saisissable. This alteration in th\u00e9 language would seem to impart that the legislature considered the expression s sont incessibles \" as imposing a more extensive restriction upon, and greater security against, the pension being capable of being parted with in any manner than was obtained by the 14th see. of 40 Vic. ch. 10. In Fleming & Tibbins' Dictionnaire Fran\u00e7ais the term \"incessible \" is explained to be \"qui ne peut \u00eatre c\u00e9d\u00e9\" and the term \"c\u00e9der\" is by the same authority explained to be \" laisser,\" abandonner une chose \u00e0 quelqu'un \" and the term c cession\" which is involved in c c\u00e9der \" and i incessible\" is explained by the same authority to be, \"action de ceder\"\u2014\"de transporter \u00e0 in autre ce dont on est propri\u00e9taire\"\u2014\"il se dit principalement du transport des droits\" The English equivalents of the above expressions are, that which cannot be sold, given away pledged, surrendered, transferred,parted with, relinquished or abandoned to any one. I cannot entertain a doubt that the provisions of the above articles 690 and 685 were intended to \"prevent and are sufficient to prevent a person in the enjoyment of \u00e2 civil, service pension from parting .with it in any way whatever either to the government or to any person whomsoever th\u00e9 policy of the law; being that the pensioner and his wife and family shall receive the pension by monthly instalments and not otherwise and direct from the treasury. Indeed there is no provision in law by which the government could, under our system, apply any public money by way of commutation or purchase of a pensioner's right to such a pension unless under the express provision of some Act of Parliament. So in deed it may be said that civil service pensioners and other pensioners upon funds provided by Parliament have this additional restraint upon their being able to part with their pensions by surrender to the government for a present pecuniary consideration or by com mutation in any way and this additional security in the enjoyment of their pensions in the precise way in which the payment of them is directed by the Act of the legislature which grants them, as in the present case by payments in monthly instalments and not otherwise.\nIn England commutations when authorized are so by special Acts of Parliament for that purpose, as\u2014 32 & 33 Vic. ch. 32, 33 & 34 Vic. ch. 101, 34 & 35 Vic. ch. 36 39 & 40 Vic. ch. 73 45 & 46 Vie. ch. 44.\nThe policy of the articles in the Revised Statutes of the province of Quebec relating to the civil service and civil service pensions, is, in my opinion, that no such pensioner shall be able to divest himself by any act of his own of his right to receive the pension granted to him by the legislature, and made to him by monthly instalments only, nor shall be deprived of such right by any process of law, and that the pension shall be applied for the purpose for which it is granted, namely the maintenance not only of the pensioner but of his wife and children also for which purpose it is made payable by monthly instalments only, and this is \"what the true construction of the articles above quoted does effect. The suppliants, therefore, are entitled, to the relief prayed for in their petition of right.\nAs to the joinder of Burroughs' wife, I am of opinion that the policy of the law and its true construction is that immediately upon a married civil servant retiring and acquiring a pension under the statute, his wife acquires a vested interest, not only in the half pension made payable to her after her husband's death, but jointly with him during his life in the monthly instalments which are made payable in that manner for supplying maintenance and support not only to the husband for himself alone, but for his wife and children also; and that, therefore, she has during his life a right to maintain conservatory proceedings in law for the purpose of preventing his improvident squandering of the fund granted by the legislature for their joint support and of preventing herself and her husband being in any way deprived of the statutory right to receive, by monthly instalments, the provision made by the legislature for their maintenance.\nThe appeal must be allowed with costs and a decree made to the effect prayed in the petition of right.\nSEDGEWICK J \u2014 I concur in the opinion of the Chief Justice that we should dismiss this appeal.\nKING J.-\u2014Burroughs having been a permanent officer in the civil service of Quebec and having applied for superannuation on the ground of ill-health, his request was complied with; and by order in council of 31st January 1891 he was superannuated as from the 1st day of February, 1891. By the same order in council the vacancy so caused was filled by the appointment of another. This entitled him to receive an annual \"pension during his life by monthly payments, and entitled his wife and children to half pension after his death for certain times and on certain conditions\nOne consequence following upon this was that in case he should become able to render services, he might (up to the age of 60 years) be called upon to fill certain public offices. During such service he would of course receive the ordinary salary therefor, but payment of his pension would, in the meanwhile, be suspended. If he should decline to discharge the duties of the office so offered he, ipso tacto (as well as his widow and children) lost all further right to the pension or half pension. (Art. 691).\nThere is another provision of the law (art. 688) that if any public officer or employee retires voluntarily from the service, or his office be abolished, the sums previously deducted from his salary and paid into the consolidated revenue fund are forthwith returned to him without interest.\nAfter Burroughs had been for about two and a half months superannuated and had received two months' payments of pension, he applied to the government stating that he was ready to abandon all his rights to the pension provided that the government would accord to him the benefit of art 688\nThe government being of the opinion that such an arrangement would be advantageous to the treasury acceded to it, and by order in council of 24th April 189.1, it was declared that the order in council of 31st January be revoked in order to permit of Burroughs taking advantage of the privilege which article 688 gives to public officers.\nBurroughs was not in fact reinstated in office; nor could he well be for the office had been filled by another. Could he then in any sense be said to he still in office for art 688 deals with the case of a public officer retiring (voluntarily) from the service?\nIt is said by the learned judge of the Superior Court, before whom the case first came, that because of his liability under art. 691, to be called upon to fill certain public offices he must still be considered as in the public service. And he cited Wells v. Foster ([5]) as an authority,for this. In that case, however, the person was liable to be dismissed at any moment either for positive misconduct, or on any ground which would render him an unfit person to remain in the service of the Crown. On this account he was deemed to be still in the public service, and the so-called pension .was really retainer or compensation in. the way of salary. ' If, in the case before us, the contingent liability to b\u00e9 called to the public service, constituted a pensioner a public officer under sec. 688 it would follow that under that art.\" he, might retire and so become entitled, not only to his pension but to the retiring allowance under art. 688 as well. Clearly art. 688 has no reference to the; contingent responsibility or service of a pensioner.\nBut may not an order be made under art. 688 nunc pro tunc, treating it as though the original application for superannuation had- not been made, and as though the original application had been for the voluntary retirement referred to in the article?\nSuppose the case reversed. Could one who had retired under art 688 come in after a couple of months and claim and be allowed, superannuation under art. 6761 Would it be competent for the government to pass an order in council revoking what had been done under 688 in order that the person might come in under 676? It s\u00e9\u00ebms to me that it would lead to bad administration and confusion to allow one who had exercised his election in one way to withdraw it and exercise another option.\nIn my view, the Act does not contemplate anything of the sort. An election is given; when exercised in one way or the other certain statutory consequences follow, leaving no room for acts of grace or favour on the one hand, or for turning to advantage the necessities of pensioners upon the other.\nI agree also that by force of the term \"incessible \" as used in the statute the right while forfeitable for non-compliance with conditions, is an inalienable right.\nOrdinarily this would operate to restrain alienation to individuals, to the inalienable quality of the right is expressed in terms covering every attempted giving up of rights. It seems inconsistent with the very particular provisions controlling the action of the Crown in the dispensing of the statutory aid for the benefit of the pensioner, and of persons having a natural claim upon him for support, that the Crown, who in such matter exercises what are as it were the duties of a statutory trustee, should come into the field in competition with any of these objects of bounty and make terms advantageous to the treasury with those for whom Parliament had made certain provision\nI am to some extent influenced by the mischievous consequences that might follow and, while believing that what was done here was done wholly in the supposed interests of the pensioner I think it should be held null and void, as being entirely wanting in power.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellants : L.

At the end of s. 120 is the following: \u201cThe clerk shall deliver the roll, certified under his hand, to the collector on or before the first day of October.\u201d * * *\nHeld, affirming the decision of the Court of Appeal, that the provision as to delivery of the roll to the collector was imperative and its non-delivery was a sufficient answer to a suit against the collector for failure to collect the taxes.\nHeld also, that such delivery was necessary in the case of the roll for municipal taxes provided for in the previous section as well as to that for provincial taxes.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1], reversing the judgment at the trial in favour of the plaintiff.\nThe action in this case was brought by the corporation of the town of Trenton against the defendant Dyer, collector of taxes for the town, and his sureties, the other defendants, to recover the amount alleged to be due the town for taxes which Dyer should have collected but failed to do so. The defence was that no collector\u2019s roll had been delivered to Dyer as required by section 120 of the Assessment Act, 55 Vic. ch. 48. This section and the construction claimed for it by the respective parties appear in the judgments given on this appeal.\nThe case was tried before Armour C.J. who gave judgment in favour of the corporation, which judgment was reversed by the Court of Appeal. The corporation then appealed to this court.\nMarsh Q.C. and Delaney for the appellant. The provision as to delivery of the roll is grammatically a part of sec. 120, which deals with provincial taxes only and by no rule of construction can it be held to apply to the taxes mentioned in the previous section.\nThe provision is directory, not imperative. Caldow v. Pixell[2]; Lewis v. Brady[3]; Parish v. Golden[4].\nChute Q.C. and O\u2019Rourke for the respondents sureties of the collector, and Abbott for the respondent Dyer referred to Welland v. Brown[5]; Whitby v. Flint[6], and Vienna v. Mair[7], in support of their contention that the provision as to delivery of the roll was imperative. They were not required to argue the other point as the court was satisfied that the provision applied to local as well as provincial taxes.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014The only question for decision in this appeal relates to the proper construction of the concluding paragraph of the 120th section of the Ontario Assessment Act (now 55 Vic. cap. 48, formerly R.S.O. 1887, cap. 193). The respondent Dyer was in 1891 the collector for the town of Trenton and his co-respondents were his sureties. This action was brought to make him liable for the taxes which it was alleged he ought to have collected but had failed to collect.\nThe defence, so far as it is now material on this appeal, was that he had not been furnished by the town clerk with a properly certified roll. This action was tried before Chief Justice Armour without a jury, when judgment was entered for the appellants. On appeal this judgment was reversed by the Court of Appeal. Mr. Justice Burton dissented from the majority of the court.\nThe 120th section is as follows:\nAll moneys assessed, levied and collected under any Act by which the same are made payable to the treasurer of this province, or other public officer for the public uses of the province, or for any special purpose or use mentioned in the Act, shall be assessed, levied and collected in the same manner as local rates, and shall be similarly calculated upon the assessments as finally revised, and shall be entered in the collector\u2019s rolls in separate columns in the heading whereof shall be designated the purpose of the rate; and the clerk shall deliver the roll, certified under his hand, to the collector on or before the 1st day of October, or such other day as may be prescribed by a by-law of the local municipality.\nIt was argued before us that this section had no reference to the roll for purposes of local taxation, and that the requirement that the roll should be certified by the clerk was only for the purpose of collecting provincial taxes. This contention we disposed of at the conclusion of the argument of the learned counsel for the appellant, the court holding that such was not the true legal construction of the clause in question, but that the requirement that the roll should be certified under the hand of the clerk applied as well to municipal as to provincial taxes. The sole question which remains is, therefore, whether the words \u201cshall deliver the roll certified under his hand to the collector\u201d are imperative or directory only. The prim\u00e2 facie presump- tion, as well under the Interpretation Act as without it, is that they are imperative. It is for the appellant to demonstrate that they are directory merely. This has not in my opinion been done. I see a great distinction between the provision as to the time of the delivery of the roll and that as to the certificate of the clerk. The first may well be directory. A failure to comply with it is in the power of the municipality to remedy and the omission does not affect the ratepayers. Such is not the case, in my opinion, as regards the want of authentication. If the object of requiring a certificate only concerned the municipality itself and its officer, and could be regarded as a mere direction to the clerk as to the course he was to pursue in performing his duty to the municipality, I should have no difficulty in holding it to be not obligatory. But is this so? Clearly not, for it concerns the taxpayers that the person to whom they pay their taxes, and who may distrain on their goods in case of non-payment, should be in possession of, and able to produce to them, proper authority for those purposes. An unauthenticated list of taxes, however formally made out in other respects, would not be such an authority, and if on such a list taxes could be collected the ratepayers might be called upon by a fraudulent collector to pay money as and for taxes never legally imposed. The roll in effect operates as a warrant, and usage and convenience alike require that such a document should bear upon its face some authentication or certificate to show that it was regular, and that it emanated from the official who had authority to issue it. I think therefore we must consider the provision as one introduced for the protection of the ratepayers and therefore obligatory. The cases of Whitby v. Harrison[8] and Whitby v. Flint[9], referred to in the judgment of the learned Chief Justice of Ontario, are both authorities in support of this view, though in neither of them was the point now raised actually decided. It was, however, decided by these cases that the authority of the collector to collect the taxes did not depend on his appointment but on the receipt of such a roll as the statute requires, and the language of both the Chief Justices who gave the judgments in those cases certainly implies that they considered that the roll to be valid should be certified. Then a roll not authenticated by the signature of the clerk is not such a roll as the statute requires. The case of Vienna v. Marr[10] was in my opinion well decided, and shows that the collector was not bound to act under an uncertificated roll. The case of Welland v. Brown[11], on which it was determined that the signature of the clerk without any formal certificate was sufficient, is not in any way inconsistent with this view, but on the contrary that case also implies that the court considered such a signature to be necessary. I am compelled with much respect to dissent from the view of Mr. Justice Burton that the omission of the statute to make some provision for the case of the incapacity or death of the clerk, which latter event was in the present case the reason why the omission could not be remedied, is a reason why we should not hold signing to be imperative. I think we must rather regard that as casus omissus, and that it is an insufficient reason for holding that the payment of taxes may be enforced under a roll which upon the prima facie meaning of the words of the statute is a nullity.\nThe appeal must be dismissed with costs.\nFOURNIER J. concurred.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014I am of opinion that this appeal should be dismissed. The reasoning of Hagarty C.J. and Maclennan J. in the Court of Appeal is unanswerable. Dyer never was vested with the right to collect the taxes, for the reason that the clerk never delivered to him the roll certified under his\nhand as required by the statute. He was in the position of a police officer, bearer of a warrant which is not signed by the magistrate, or not evidenced by seal where that is required. Archibald v. Hubley[12]; Cotter v. Sutherland[13]; Morgan v. Quesnel[14]; Reg. v. Chapman[15]. I do not attach much importance to the word \u201cshall\u201d in sec. 120, c. 193 R.S.O. The definition of the words \u201cshall\u201d and \u201cmay\u201d in the Interpretation Act is taken from the school books.\nIt is hard case law that though the statute decrees that a certain thing \u201cshall\u201d be done, it \u201cmay\u201d not be done, or need not be done, and I, for one, will always restrict the application of that law within the narrowest possible limits.\nI do not exactly see, however, that there is here room for the controversy raised by the parties as to the construction to be given to that word \u201cshall\u201d in this part of the statute. The words \u201cand the clerk shall deliver the roll certified under his hand\u201d are clearly imperative. As to the delivery of the roll that is not questioned, The only question that remains, then, is: What roll is it that he has to deliver? And to this question the enactment, to my mind, leaves room but for one answer, that is \u201cthe roll certified under his hand,\u201d under the hand of the clerk. Or, in other words, I read the clauses 120 and 122 simply as if they said: \u201cThe collector, upon receiving the collector\u2019s roll certified by the clerk, shall proceed to collect the taxes.\u201d So long as he has not received the roll so certified he is without authority to act. This roll, whilst in the clerk\u2019s hands, before being so certified and delivered, is not yet a \u201croll\u201d as to the collector, a completed roll. It is only by the certificate and delivery, that it becomes efficacious for the purpose of collecting the rates, that it gets vitality. Before that it is an inchoate document which confers no power whatever on the collector. And the genuineness of a document of this nature must be self apparent. It must bear some mark of attestation. Upon general principles a public officer who, in the name of the law, claims the right to intrude upon the private rights of his fellow citizens, and the power to force them to obey his commands, must be prepared, when required, to satisfy them of his authority. And, to my mind, an unattested document like the one delivered to Dyer in this case is not intrinsically a voucher of authenticity sufficient for that purpose in the collector\u2019s hands. It lacks what is called, in the civil law, the solemnia probantia, necessary to make it what it should be, probationem probatam.\nGreat stress was put by Mr. Marsh at the argument on the point, not raised in the court below I understand, that upon the true construction of section 120 this enactment as to the roll being certified applies only to cases in which taxes are being collected for provincial purposes, and not to cases, as the present one, provided for in the preceding section, where taxes are to be collected for municipal purposes only, and the appellant\u2019s factum, in a full historical review of the legislation on this particular part of the Municipal Act, has apparently established his proposition, that from the introduction of municipal institutions into the province, down to 1853, the roll was a sufficient authority for the collector, though not signed or certified by the clerk. He has failed, however, to convince me that in the statute, as it stands in the Revised Statutes of 1887, which rules this case, the provision of section 120, that the roll must be certified under the hand of the collector, does not apply to the roll mentioned in section 119, that is to say, to the roll for municipal taxes. There is only one roll provided for, not two rolls, one for municipal taxes and another for provincial taxes, as the appellant\u2019s contention would import.\nIt has also been urged for the appellant, though, it seemed to me, not much relied upon, that as the provision in that same sentence of the statute as to the time within which the clerk was to deliver the roll to the collector had been held to be directory[16], therefore the provision as to the signature of the clerk should also be treated merely as a directory one. But I do not see anything in this argument. There is no objection whatever that I can see in the enacting of two provisions in the same sentence of a statute, one imperative, and the other directory, though it may lead to controversy. Here the date is immaterial. What difference does it make to the rate-payer that the roll be handed over to the collector on the second of October, instead of on the first?\nAnd the delivery is not a preparatory matter. It is something that happens after it is completed and signed. Whilst the attestation is, to my mind, an essential requisite of that document to confer any power on the collector[17]; it is a condition precedent to an effectual delivery.\nThe holdings in the cases of Whitby v. Harrison[18], and Whitby v. Flint[19], assuming them to be law, do not support the appellant\u2019s case. I would be inclined to think that, if they bear at all on the case, it is more in the respondent\u2019s favour than in the appellant\u2019s.\nSEDGEWICK and KING JJ. concurred.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for appellant: H.W.

The defence was a denial of negligence, and that the injury was caused by a fellow servant of the deceased. The Exchequer Court held that the injury was due to the negligence of the superintendent of the canal and foreman of the work, and that the doctrine of common employment had no place in the law of the province of Quebec where the injury complained of occurred. The Crown appealed.\nHogg Q.C. for the appellant.\nMonk Q.C. and Coderre for the respondent. THE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014I have not prepared a judgment in this case, as I entirely agree with the reasons given by the learned judge of the Exchequer Court for the conclusion that the Crown was liable. The question of jurisdiction is precluded by the decision of this court in The Queen v. City of Quebec[2]. On the merits two points were argued, first, whether or not negligence was established, and, secondly, if it was, were the suppliant and the servants of the Crown guilty of negligence in a common employment? The evidence as to negligence is clear, and I agree with the learned judge of the Exchequer Court that the doctrine of common employment has no place in the law of the province of Quebec. I therefore reject both grounds of appeal.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014I dissent. I would allow the appeal, and dismiss the petition of right on the ground that it is still the law of the land, as held in The Queen v. McLeod[3], that the rule respondent superior does not apply to the Crown.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014It is unnecessary, in my opinion, to discuss the questions whether a petition of right could have been maintained in a case like the present prior to the passing of the Dominion statute 50 & 51 Vic. ch. 16, or how far the judgment of their Lordships of the Privy Council in the case of the Windsor & Annapolis Railway Co. v. The Queen[4], has shaken the ancient doctrine that the subject had no remedy against the Crown for torts committed by its servants, for I am of opinion that the language of the above Dominion statute is sufficient to give to persons suffering injury in person or property on any public work resulting from the negligence of any officer or servant of the Grown while acting within the scope of his duties or employment, a right to redress, even though they may have had none before, such redress being sought for in the Court of Exchequer.\nThe only question raised by the argument in appeal which is necessary to be determined in the present case, in my opinion is, whether the persons whose negligence (as the learned judge of the Exchequer has, as a matter of fact found) caused the death of the young man for whose death the proceeding by petition of right has been instituted by his father, came within the description of the persons named in subsection c of sec. 16 of the above Act, that is to say, \u201cofficers or servants of the Crown acting within the scope of their duties or employment,\u201d and I am of opinion that they do.\nI cannot see anything in the evidence which would justify me in pronouncing the judgment of the learned judge of the Exchequer Court to be erroneous upon the matter of fact found by him that the death was caused by their negligence or the negligence of one of them.\nNo objection was taken to the effect that to qualify the father to maintain the petition of right he should have been shown to have taken out letters of administration and have been a suppliant in the character of personal representative of the deceased, and as no objection was taken upon that point, I do not deal with it; dealing with the case as argued I am of opinion that the appeal must be dismissed.\nSEDGEWICK J.\u2014This appeal was asserted before the decision of this court in The City of Quebec v. The Queen[5]. An important question involved in that case was as to the construction that was to be given to the Dominion statute 50 & 51 Vic. ch. 16, section 16, paragraph c, which enacts that:\nThe Exchequer Court shall have jurisdiction for any claim against the Crown arising out of any death or injury to the person or to property on any public work, resulting from the negligence of any officer or servant of the Crown while acting within the scope of his duties or employment.\nIt had been contended by the Crown that that section did not create a liability but only gave jurisdiction in claims against the Crown existing aliunde that statute. In The City of Quebec v. The Queen[6], as well as in several other cases, the Court of Exchequer had decided against the Crown\u2019s contention, and my learned brother Gwynne in delivering the judgment of the court (since this case was argued), says:\nThe object, intent and effect of the above enactment was, as it appears to me, to confer upon the Exchequer Court in all cases of claim against the Government, either for the death of any person or for injury to the person or property of any person committed to their charge, upon any railway or other public work of the Dominion under the management and control of the Government, arising from the negligence of the servants of the Government acting within the scope of their duties or employment, upon such public work, the like jurisdiction as in like cases is exercised by the ordinary courts over public. companies and individuals.\nI consider myself bound by that judgment, and if so the principal ground of this appeal has disappeared.\nI entirely concur in the view which was taken by the learned judge below upon the facts. In my view there was negligence on the part of the officers of the Crown in not testing the strength and capacity of the derrick which caused the injury before it was put into operation, and it is further clear, as pointed out by the learned judge in the court below, that the doctrine of collaborateur, until recently the law of England and of Ontario, does not obtain in the province of Quebec.\nI am therefore of opinion that the appeal must be dismissed with costs.\nKING J.\u2014Concurred.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: O\u2019Connor & Hogg.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Primeau & Coderre.\n[1] 4 Ex.

After 52 Y. c. 43 was passed, the company shifted one of its toll gates to a point beyond the limits of the village, which limits'were subsequently extended so as to bring said gate within them. The corporation took proceedings against the company contending that the repeal of sec. 2 of 52 V. c. 43, made that Act retroactive and that the shifting of the toll gate Without the consent of the corporation was a violation of said Act\nHeld, affirming the decision of the Court of Queen's Bench, that as a statute is never retroactive unless made so in express terms sec. 2 had no effect and its repeal could not make it retroactive * that the shifting of the toll gate was not a violation of the Act which only applied to the erection of new gates and that the extension of the limits of the village could not affect the pre-existing rights of the company.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada (appeal side), reversing the judgment of the Superior Court in favour of the plaintiff.\nThe plaintiff municipality seeks by its action to have the defendant enjoined from continuing the toll gates erected by it within the municipality and to have the same demolished as being erected without the consent of the corporation under 52 Vic. ch. 43, which provides that\u2014\nArticle 5089 of the Revised. Statutes of the province of Quebec is replaced by the following:\n5089. As soon as one mile of the road is made the company may put up toll gates and collect the tolls established by the board of \u2022directors, subject to the provisions of this section.\nThe company cannot, however, place any toll or other gate within the limits of any town or Tillage incorporated by special charter or under the municipal code, unless the said corporation consents thereto.\n2nd. This Act shall have no retroactive effect.\nAn Act passed in the following year, 54 Vic. ch, 36, was as follows :\nSection 2 of the Act 52 Vic. ch. 43 amending the law respecting companies for stoning roads is hereby repealed.\nThe plaintiff claimed that the effect of such repeal was to make the former Act retroactive and so prevent the company defendant from continuing its maintenance of the toll gates and collecting tolls without the consent of the corporation. It was also contended that the Act was violated by the company shifting certain toll gates after the Act was passed to a point within the limits of the village as extended shortly before the passing of 54 Vic. ch. 36. The facts material to the decision are more fully stated in the judgment of the court.\nThe Superior Court held the plaintiff entitled to relief but its judgment was reversed by the Court of Queen's Bench. The plaintiff appealed.\nGeoffrion Q.C. and Charbonneau for the appellant. '\nSaint-Pierre Q.C. for the respondent. The judgment of the court was delivered by\u2014\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014This is a very simple case. The respondent's turnpike road company for a number of years had erected and maintained toll gates under its charter within the present limits of the municipality appellant. In 1889, the legislature decreed that no-toll gates should be placed within the limits of any town or village municipality without the consent of the corporation.\nDid that enactment affect toll gates existing previously or only those to be erected thereafter, is the only question raised on this appeal. The judgment appealed from determines that this legislation has no retroactive effect and consequently does not interfere with the respondents toll gates, which had been in existence a long time before within the limits of the municipality appellant. And this in my opinion, is clearly right. The appellant's case rests mainly on the following curious piece of legislation. To the enactment of the Act of 1889 to which I have referred was added \"this Act shall have no retroactive effect.\" But in the following year, an Act was passed repealing these words. I Now, what is the effect of this repeal? It is simply to leave the statute of 1889 as if the said words \"this Act shall have no retroactive effect\" had never been in it. And no Act has a retroactive effect if nothing to the contrary appears therein. So that the words \"this Act shall have no retroactive effect\" in the statute of 1889 were unnecessary, and their being struck out leaves the construction to be given to the statute the same as if they had never been in it and has no other consequence.\nAs found by the Court of Appeal as a matter of fact this turnpike road company has erected no new toll gates since 1889 within the limits of the municipality appellant. The shifting of its gates. and removal from one place to the other, did not constitute new gates. The municipality has extended its limits, but that cannot affect the respondent's pre-existing rights.\nAn objection to our jurisdiction to entertain this appeal was taken in limine by the respondent. But as we are of opinion that we should dismiss the appeal we assume jurisdiction, without determining the question raised thereupon, as we have often done in such cases, and as the Privy Council has done in many instances, amongst others, in Braid v. The Great Western Railway Co. ([1]).\nThe result is that the judgment of the Court of Appeal, which dismissed the appellant's action is affirmed, and the appeal dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs\nSolicitor for the appellant : Nap.

(of the Ontario bar) and Martin for the appellant.\nBeique Q.C. and Geoffrion Q.C. for the respondent.\nFOURNIER J.\u2014I am of opinion that this appeal should be dismissed for the reasons given by Mr. Justice Taschereau.\nTASCHEREAU J. The facts which gave rise to this litigation are as follows :\u2014The parties, appellant and respondent, were, previous to the month of May, 1889, engaged in the manufacture and sale of glass and glassware, having their principal places of business in Montreal.\nThe Hamilton Glass Company was engaged in the said business at Hamilton in Ontario.\nOn the seventh of May, 1889, an agreement was entered into between these parties by which it was stipulated that as the appellant and the Hamilton Glass Company, in view of increasing their works and production thereof, were interested in prevailing upon respondent to discontinue the manufacture of glassware, the respondent covenanted to discontinue such manufacture of glass and glassware for a period of five years from the 15th of May 1889, in consideration whereof the appellant agreed to pay him quarterly the sum of one thousand two hundred and fifty dollars during said period, and the Hamilton Glass Company agreed to pay him, quarterly, the sum of seven hundred and fifty dollars. Provision was also made in the said contract for the purchase by the appellant and the Hamilton Glass Company of the raw materials of the respondent also for cancelling the same in case any furnace or furnaces should be started for the manufacture of glassware during the said period of five years.\nThis contract was carried out until the fall of 1891. In November, 1891, the appellant, earning that other firms were manufacturing glassware at or near New Glasgow N.S. assumed to elect to cancel the contract\nHad it the right to do so is the point in controversy.\nThe case turns upon the construction and interpretation of that clause of the contract by which the parties could bring the agreement to an end. It reads as follows:\nIt is, however, agreed that in case at any time during said period of five years any furnace or furnaces shall be started for the manufacture of glassware, (except black beer bottles and window glass ) by any party or parties other than the said parties of the second and third parts, directly or indirectly, then the said parties of the second and third parts or either of them, if they deem it expedient may, by giving notice in writing to the party of the first part, bring this agreement to an end as on the first day on which glass has been made in said furnace or furnaces, after which notice no further payments shall be made to the party of the first part except that it can be shown by the party of the first part to the said parties of the second and third parts that said furnace or furnaces at the time said notice was given could not have a production of more than one hundred dollars per day, calculated on present selling prices, in which case the quarterly payments shall be continued to said party of the first part.\nWhat is the true meaning and construction to be given this clause of the contract?\nThe respondent contends that it means an actual production and output of manufactured goods exceeding one hundred dollars per day on an average during the whole year. Appellant contends that what respondent was required to show is that the furnace or furnaces, which had been started, could not have a production, or in other words a capacity to produce one hundred dollars per day, that is to say :\u2014What was the capacity of production of the furnaces in question at the time the notice was given on the 15th of November 1891?\nThe Superior Court held that the parties to the contract had in view a regular uniform and maintained production of one hundred dollars per day, during the ordinary period of running such furnaces, per year, to wit : during ten months of the year; and that judgment was confirmed in review. Hence the present appeal by the North American Glass Company.\nI am of opinion, though not without some hesitation that the appeal should be dismissed The case is not free from doubt, but we cannot reverse upon a doubt. Reading the agreement between the parties in the light of the surrounding circumstances, we cannot say that the courts below were wrong in holding that what the parties intended was not to provide for the case of a possible capacity of producing more than $100 worth per diem, but for an actual production to that amount.\nThe mere capacity of producing more than $100 per diem could not have been intended because that alone would not have affected the appellants.\nIt is the actual production that would have been hurtful to their interests, and the only one which it is reasonable to assume they provided for.\nAs to the facts of production by the Nova Scotia Company we cannot interfere with the findings of the courts which are entirely borne out by the evidence. The plea of illegality of the contract was declared before us to have been abandoned as had been done in the courts below The plea that this contract was in restraint of trade and null on grounds of public policy was abandoned below and has not to be determined by us In fact the defendant also abandoned it expressly at the hearing here.\nI would dismiss with costs.\nGWYNNE J. The only question in this case is as to the construction of a clause for defeasance of an agreement bearing date the 7th day of May, 1889, by which agreement, in consideration of the plaintiff, at the request of the defendants, discontinuing his business of manufacture of glass and glassware for the period of five years from the 15th of the said month of May, the defendant promised to pay him quarterly during the said period of five years the sum of $1,250, the first payment to be made on the 15th day of August then next The clause of defeasance contained in the agreement is to the following effect,:\n\" It is however, agreed that in case at any time during said period of five years any furnace or furnaces shall be started for the manufacture of glassware, except black beer bottles and window glass, by any party or parties other than the said parties of the second and third parts, directly or indirectly, then the said parties of the second or third part, or either of them if they deem it expedient may, by giving notice in writing to the party of the first part, bring this agreement to an end as on the first day on which glass has been made in said furnace or furnaces, after which notice no further payments shall be made to the party of the first part except that it can be shown by the party of the first part to the said parties of the second and third parts that said furnace or \" furnaces at the time said notice was given could not have a production of more than one hundred dollars per day, calculated at present selling prices in which case the quarterly payments shall be continued to the said party of the first part.\nThe plaintiff is the party of the first part to the agreement, the defendants are the party of the second part and a glass manufacturing company called the Hamilton Glass Company the parties of the third part above mentioned. The object which the parties of the second and third part had in view in procuring the plaintiff to give up his business for the period of five years was to endeavour thereby to reserve to themselves as much as possible the benefit to be derived from such his retirement and the clause of defeasance was inserted to enable them to obviate the effect of their business being interfered with by a new production of glass exceeding in value $100 per day at the then prices. The clause may not be very felicitously expressed, but it is, I think, sufficiently clear that the intention of the parties was that the parties of the second and third parts should assume the risk of all injury which should befall their business from new factories being started whose daily production should not exceed in value $100.\nWe cannot, I think, hold that the plaintiff was consenting that the defendants should have it in their power to evade the payments they had agreed to make to him for the consideration he had oliven if for example a stranger or strangers should erect a building supplied with a furnace or furnaces having capacity to manufacture glass of greater value than $100 per day, but in which no glass at all should in fact be produced * that very plainly was not the intention of the parties for the clause provides that upon notice of the determination of the contract being given the agreement shall be determined as on the first day on which glass has been made in the furnace. So neither could it have been the intention that the defendants could arbitrarily terminate the agreement if a new factory started having a furnace of capacity sufficient for the manufacture of glass to an amount exceeding in value $200 per day should be shown to have never exceeded in actual production $50 worth per day during the whole glass making season. Such a construction would be so utterly illusory and one-sided plainly to evince that it could not have been the intention of the parties. Injury from a production exceeding in value $100 per day is what the defendants were providing against, not the capacity to. produce a non-produced excess of that quantity.\nThen the expression c could not have a production of more than $100 per day\" plainly shows that what was intended to be guarded against was not the production of more than $100 worth upon one day\u2014or occasionally\u2014or upon a few days, but the interference with defendants' business by a continuous production of glass of greater value than $100 per day, that is daily for some, though undefined, continuous period, and of this opinion the defendants themselves appear to have been, for to this action which is brought to recover the quarterly payments which accrued due from the defendants upon the 15th November, 1891, and the 15th February, 1892, the defendants justify their terminating the agreement under the provisions of the above clause in the agreement by the following plea upon which is raised the only issue between the parties to this action. They say\u2014\nthat during the summer of eighteen hundred and ninety-one, two other factories were carrying on the manufacture of glass (not black beer bottles or window glass), in the county of Pictou in Nova Scotia, namely one D. B. Humphrey & Company and another firm of Lamont Brothers, which said factories combined did have a daily production of more than two hundred dollars, and said factories continued in operation during the summer and fall of said year eighteen hundred and ninety-one, and are in operation up to the present time and are still producing more glassware of a value greater than one hundred dollars per day * that when the defendants became aware of the said facts they notified the plaintiff that they cancelled the said contract and would no longer continue the payment of the sums of money therein stipulated.\nIn thus the clause of defeasance as the defendants have here done, as pointing to a daily production of glassware exceeding in value one hundred dollars, they have, I think, correctly construed it; and the evidence, in my opinion, justified the finding of the learned trial judge and of the learned judges in the court of review that the factories in question did not have a daily production of glassware exceeding one hundred dollars in value, and that the contingency upon which the defendants have vested their asserted right of determining the contract had not arisen when they gave the notice on the 17th November, upon which they rely. The appeal must therefore be dismissed with costs, and the judgment below affirmed\nSEDGEWICK and KING JJ. Concurred.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant : Girouard, Foster, Martin & Girouard .\nSolicitors for the respondent : Beique, Lafontaine,Turgeon & Robertson.\n"}

By 112, Ontario and Quebec are jointly liable to Canada for any excess of the debt of the province of Canada at the time of the union over $62,500,000 and chargeable with 5 per cent interest thereon. Secs. 114 and 115 make a like provision for the debts of Nova Scotia and New Brunswick exceeding eight and seven millions respectively, and by 116, if the debts of those provinces should be less than said amounts they are entitled to receive, by half-yearly payments in advance, interest at the rate of 5 per cent on the difference. Sec. 118, after providing for annual payments of fixed sums to the several provinces for support of their governments, and an additional sum per head of the population, enacts that \"such grants shall be in settlement of all future demands on Canada and shall be paid half-yearly in advance to each province, but the government of Canada shall deduct from such grants, as against any province, all sums chargeable as interest on the public debt of that province in excess of the several amounts stipulated in this Act.\" The debt of the province of Canada at the union exceeded the sum mentioned in sec. 112, and on appeal from the award of arbitrators appointed to adjust the accounts between the Dominion and the provinces of Ontario and Quebec.\nHeld, affirming said award, that the subsidy of the provinces under sec. 118 was payable from the 1st of July, 1867, but interest on the excess of debt should not be deducted until 1st January, 1868; that unless expressly provided interest is never to be paid before it accrues due; and that there is no express provision in the British North America Act that interest shall be deducted in advance on the excess of debt under sec. 118.\nBy 36 V. c. 30 (D), passed in 1873, it was declared that the debt of the province of Canada at the union was then ascertained to be $73,006,088.84, and that the subsidies should thereafter be paid according to such amount. By 47 V. c. 4, in 1884, it was provided that the accounts between the Dominion and the provinces should be calculated as if the last mentioned Acts had directed that such increase should be allowed from the coming into force of the British North America Act, and it also provided that the total amount of the half-yearly payments which would have been made on account of such increase from July 1st, 1867, to January 1st, 1873, with interest at 5 per cent from the day on which it would have been so paid to July 1st, 1884, should be deemed capital owing to the respective provinces bearing interest at 5 per cent and payable after July 1st, 1884, as part of the yearly subsidies.\nHeld, affirming the said award, Gwynne J. dissenting, that the last mentioned Acts did not authorize the Dominion to deduct interest in advance from the subsidies payable to the provinces half-yearly but leaves such deduction as it was under the British North America Act.\nAppeal from an award of arbitrators appointed to adjust the accounts between the Dominion of Canada and the provinces of Ontario and Quebec respectively.\nThe circumstances under which this appeal arose were the following:\u2014\nThe appeal herein is taken by the Dominion of Canada, from the award made and published on the 2nd day of November, 1893, by the Honourable John Alexander Boyd, Chancellor of the province of Ontario; the Honourable George Wheelock Burbidge, Judge of the Exchequer Court of Canada; and the Honourable Sir Louis Napoleon Casault, Judge of the Superior Court of the province of Quebec, the arbitrators duly appointed under the provisions of the Act of the Parliament of Canada, 54 & 55 Vic. ch. 6; the Act of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario, 54 Vic. ch. 2; and the Act of the Legislature of Quebec, 54 Vic. ch. 4.\nSections 6 and 7 of the Dominion Act and of the respective Acts of Ontario and Quebec provide identically as follows:\n6. The arbitrators shall not be bound to decide according to the strict rules of law or evidence, but may decide upon equitable principles, and when they do proceed on their view of a disputed question of law, the awards shall set forth the same at the instance of either or any party. Any award made under this Act shall be, in so far as it relates to disputed questions of law, subject to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada and thence to the Judicial Committee of Her Majesty's Privy Council, in case their Lordships are pleased to allow such appeal.\n7. In case of an appeal on a question of law being successful the matter shall go back to the arbitrators, for the purpose of making such changes in the award as may be necessary, or an appellate court shall make any other direction as to the necessary changes.\nIn pursuance of the said statutory enactments the three governments by orders in council duly approved on 15th April, 1893, referred certain matters as specified and contained in \"the first agreement of submission to the arbitrators.\"\nThe following are such of the matters contained in the \"agreement of submission\" as were submitted in respect whereof the arbitrators made their award and on which this appeal is made.\n1. (a.) All questions relating or incident to the accounts between the Dominion and the provinces of Ontario and Quebec.\n2. The accounts are understood to include the following particulars:\u2014\n(a.) The accounts as rendered by the Dominion up to January, 1889.\n(b.) In the unsettled accounts between the Dominion and the two provinces the rate of interest and the mode of computation of interest to be determined;\nOn the 2nd November, 1893, the arbitrators published their award, partial in respect of the matters referred.\nBy the last paragraph of the said award the arbitrators in pursuance of section 6 of the Acts of Reference set forth that in respect of paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 of the award, they proceeded upon their view of a disputed question of law.\nParagraphs 1 and 2 of the award, which are the subject of contention and exception in this appeal, are as follows:\n1. That from the 1st July, 1867, to the passing of the Act of Parliament of Canada, 36 Vic. ch. 30, the provinces of Ontario and Quebec shall be credited with subsidy half-yearly in advance, deducting therefrom at the end of each half year their respective shares of interest as determined by the award of September 3rd, 1870, at the rate of five per centum per annum on the excess of debt of the province of Canada over $62,500,000 as actually ascertained in amount at each period, the first of such deductions to be made on the 1st day of January, 1868, and the others on the 1st day of July and January thereafter down to and including the 1st day of January, 1873.\n2. That in the province of Canada account there shall be credited on the 23rd May, 1873, the sum of $10,506,088.84 remitted by the said Act, and thereafter the subsidy shall be credited in the separate accounts of Ontario and Quebec without any such deduction.\nThe Dominion objects to this award that it should have determined that the interest on the excess of debt should be deducted from the first half-yearly payment of subsidy on July 1st, 1867, making twelve deductions up to January 1st, 1873, instead of eleven, which would be the number under the award. The decision of such questions depends on the construction of the following sections of the British North America Act.\nSection 111 of the British North America Act, 1867, is as follows:\nCanada shall be liable for the debts and liabilities of each province existing at the union.\nSection 112:\nOntario and Quebec conjointly shall be liable to Canada for the amount (if any) by which the debt of the province of Canada exceeds at the union sixty-two million five hundred thousand dollars, and shall be charged with interest at the rate of five per centum per annum thereon. Section 114:\nNova Scotia shall be liable to Canada for the amount (if any) by which its public debt exceeds at the union eight million dollars, and shall be charged with interest at the rate of five per centum per annum thereon.\nSection 115:\nNew Brunswick shall be liable to Canada for the amount (if any) by which its public debt exceeds at the union seven million dollars, and shall be charged with interest at the rate of five per centum per annum thereon.\nSection 116:\nIn case the public debts of Nova Scotia and New Brunswick do not at the union amount to eight million and seven million dollars respectively, they shall respectively receive, by half-yearly payments in advance from the government of Canada, interest at five per centum per annum on the difference between the actual amounts of their respective debts and such stipulated amounts.\nSection 118 is as follows:\nThe following sums shall be paid yearly by Canada to the several provinces for the support of their governments and legislatures:\nOntario\n$80,000\nQuebec\n70,000\nNova Scotia\n60,000\nNew Brunswick\n50,000\n$260,000\nand an annual grant in aid of each province shall be made, equal to eighty cents per head of the population as ascertained by the census of one thousand eight hundred and sixty-one, and in the case of Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, by each subsequent decennial census until the population of each of those two provinces amounts to four hundred thousand souls, at which rate such grant shall thereafter remain. Such grants shall be in full settlement of all future demands on Canada, and shall be paid half-yearly in advance to each province; but the government of Canada shall deduct from such grants, as against any province, all sums chargeable as interest on the public debt of that province in excess of the several amounts stipulated in this Act.\nIt was further contended that if this contention should not prevail under the British North America Act, that 36 Vic. ch. 30 (D) and 47 Vic. ch. 4 (D) authorized such deductions of interest in advance. The preamble and secs. 1 and 2 of 36 Vic. ch. 30 provided that:\nWhereas by the provisions of \"The British North America Act, 1867,\" and by the terms and conditions under which the provinces of British Columbia and Manitoba were admitted into the Dominion, Canada became liable for the debts and liabilities of each province existing at the time of its becoming part of the Dominion, subject to the provision that each province should, in account with Canada, be charged with interest at the rate of five per cent per annum on the account by which its said debts and liabilities exceeded (or should receive interest at the same rate by half-yearly payments in advance on the amount by which its said debt and liabilities fell short of) certain fixed amounts.\nAnd whereas the amount fixed as aforesaid in the case of the provinces of Ontario and Quebec, conjointly (as having heretofore formed the province of Canada), was sixty-two millions five hundred thousand dollars ($62,500,000), and the debt of the said late province, as now ascertained, exceeded the said sum by ten million five hundred and six thousand and eighty-eight dollars and eighty-four cents, ($10,506,088.84), for the interest as aforesaid on which the said two provinces were chargeable in account with Canada.\nAnd whereas it is expedient to relieve the said provinces of Ontario and Quebec from the charge, and for that purpose hereafter to consider the fixed amount in their case as increased by the said sum of ten millions five hundred and six thousand and eighty-eight dollars and eighty-four cents, and to compensate the other provinces for this addition to the general debt of Canada: Therefore Her Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate and House of Commons of Canada, enacts as follows:\n1. In the accounts between the several provinces of Canada and the Dominion, the amounts payable to and chargeable against the said provinces respectively, in so far as they depend on the amount of debt with which each province entered the union, shall be calculated and allowed as if the sum fixed by the one hundred and twelfth section of \"The British North America Act, 1867,\" were increased from sixty-two millions five hundred thousand dollars to the sum of seventy-three millions six thousand and eighty-eight dollars and eighty-four cents, and as if the amounts fixed as aforesaid, as respects the provinces of Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, by \"The British North America Act, 1867\" and as respects the provinces of British Columbia and Manitoba by the terms and conditions on which they were admitted into the Dominion, were increased in the same proportion. 2. The subsidies to the several provinces in July, one thousand eight hundred and seventy-three shall be paid in accordance with the foregoing provisions of this Act.\nAnd the preamble and sec. 1 of 47 Vic. ch. 4, are as follows:\nWhereas the subsidies payable under \"The British North America Act, 1867,\" to the several provinces thereby united into one Dominion respectively, were readjusted and increased by the operation of the Act of the Parliament of Canada, 36 Vic. ch. 30, but the said increase was allowed only on and from the 1st day of July, 1873, and it is expedient that it should be allowed as from the day of the coming into force of the said \"British North America Act, 1867,\" and that a proportionate increase should be made in the subsidies now payable by Canada to the provinces of British Columbia, Manitoba and Prince Edward Island respectively: Therefore Her Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate and House of Commons of Canada, enacts as follows:\n1. In the accounts between the several provinces and the Dominion, the amounts by which the yearly subsidy to each was increased by the Act 36 Vic. ch. 30, as explained by the Act, 37 Vic. ch. 3, as to Nova, Scotia, shall be calculated and allowed to Ontario and Quebec, jointly, as having formed the late province of Canada, and to Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, as if the said Acts had directed that such increase should be allowed from the day of the coming into force of the \"British North America Act, 1867,\" and the total amount of the half-yearly payments which would have in that case been made on account of such increase from the 1st day of July, 1867, up to and including the 1st day of January, 1873, with interest on each at five per cent per annum, from the day on which it would have been so paid, to the 1st day of July, 1884, shall be deemed capital, owing to the said provinces respectively, bearing interest at five per cent per annum, which interest shall be payable to them as part of their yearly subsidies from the Dominion, on and after the 1st day of July, 1884.\nRitchie Q.C. and Hogg Q.C. for the appellant.\nIrving Q.C. and Moss Q.C. for the respondent, province of Ontario.\nGirouard Q.C. and Hall Q.C. for the respondent, province of Quebec.\nRitchie Q.C.\u2014One of the contentions arising here is shortly this:\u2014Under the sections of the British North America Act was the Dominion entitled to deduct from the first and each subsequent half-yearly payment of subsidy interest at the rate of five per cent on the excess of debt which was declared by this Act to be a charge against them? Ontario and Quebec, under the British North America Act, were declared to be conjointly liable to the Dominion of Canada for this excess of debt, and it was declared that they should be charged with interest at the rate of five per cent upon the excess of debt, and I emphasize the word \"charged\" because possibly something may turn upon it. There is an express statement that they shall be charged. There is no provision whatever in any of these sections for a liability on the part of Ontario and Quebec to the Dominion for this excess of debt outside of this charge. In other words, there is no statement made in the Act at all that they shall pay to them interest at the rate of five per cent per annum, but it is a charge.\nThere is no provision similar to 116, with respect to Ontario and Quebec, for this reason, that it was well known that the debt of the old province of Canada considerably exceeded that sum, but, as to Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, it was to some extent doubtful. It was possible it might exceed, therefore it is put in both ways. If it does exceed the stipulated amount then it was to be charged at five per cent; if, on the other hand, it falls short, the provinces should be paid and receive interest at the rate of five per cent half-yearly in advance on the sum by which the real debt fell short of the amount, as between all the parties, it was agreed the Dominion Government should assume. In other words, all these things are carved out of the subsidy.\nThat being so, one should ask, in the case of one whose debt exceeded the stipulated amount, what reason or what justice would there be as to that particular province, in saying that that province shall only pay the interest at the expiration of six months, instead of taking it out of the first payment of subsidy, when the Act expressly provided that, as to Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, if their debts fell short of the stipulated amount, they should be paid and receive in advance the interest on the difference. Clearly the intention of the Act was to place all these constituents of the new confederation in the same position. They agreed upon the relative proportion of debt to be assumed, they agreed that they should participate equally, per capita, in the subsidy to be granted.\nThen in 1873, the different provinces were agitating for better terms, and apparently Ontario and Quebec, at all events, were urging that this deduction made half-yearly should be discontinued, and in 1873 an Act was passed. I call your Lordships' attention to the title of that Act. It is an Act to readjust the amount payable to and chargeable against the several provinces of Canada by the Dominion, so far as they depend on the debt with which they respectively entered the union. It is an Act to read just the amounts payable to and chargeable against the provinces.\nThen in 1874 was passed 47 Vic. ch. 4. I may in passing, refer to that Act as confirming the construction which I asked your Lordships to place upon the clause of the British North America Act, because apparently, in dealing with it, they regarded these deductions as being something carved out of the subsidies, as something going to increase the yearly subsidies, or the amount of subsidy payable to the provinces; the Act is declared to be an Act to readjust the yearly subsidies to be allowed by Canada to the several provinces now united in the Dominion. The recital is:\nWhereas the subsidies payable under the British North America Act to the several provinces thereby united into one Dominion were readjusted and increased by the operation of the Act of 1873. So that the Parliament of Canada in 1884 treats that Act of 1873 as an Act increasing the subsidies. Increasing the subsidies how? By declaring that those subsidies shall not be diminished by deductions in respect of excess of debt. In other words, treating the deductions in respect of excess of debt as something carved entirely out of the subsidy itself, and throughout all the legislation, as I contend, it will be seen that the deductions and the subsidies were treated practically as being part and parcel of the same thing. The subsidies were to be increased or diminished dependent altogether upon whether the debt exceeded or fell short of the amount stipulated in the British North America Act.\nNow, following on the statute for a moment, your Lordships will see that the provision is: \"it is expedient to allow the increase,\" because we are dealing with the increase from the day of the coming into force of the Act, which is the 1st of July, 1867.\nNow, if the Dominion Parliament had not construed the British North America Act as giving to the Dominion the right to deduct the first half-yearly charge in respect of the excess of debt from the first payment, to deduct it in advance, then it would be absurd to talk about allowing the increase from the 1st of July, 1867, because that would have been paid without being diminished in any way, and the proper reference would be to the payment increased from the 1st January, 1868. So that whatever may have been done by any officer of the government, clearly Parliament in construing the British North America Act acted upon the assumption that the right was vested in the Dominion to deduct from the first half-yearly payment of subsidy the first half-year's interest on the excess of debt. In other words, to deduct in advance. That is manifest also by the first clause: In the account between the several provinces and the Dominion the amount by which the half-yearly subsidy to each was increased by the Act.\nTreating always this interest question as either increasing or diminishing the subsidy, something carved out of it, as I said before.\nThe Act of 1884 can only be looked upon in one of two ways. Either it is a gift out and out to the provinces upon certain terms and conditions, or else it must be treated as a settlement or agreement of disputed claims, and no matter which aspect it may be viewed in, the result must be the same, that the provinces must be estopped from contending that the Dominion are not entitled to now charge in their books the sums which they have added together in order to form the capital sum mentioned in the Act of 1884, the provisions of which Act the provinces have availed themselves of.\nHogg Q.C. follows: I do not know that I can add very much to the construction endeavoured to be placed upon the British North America Act by my learned friend, but upon the 118th section it has occurred to me there is one observation which may have some weight in its proper construction.\nThe observation I desire to make is this, that if the construction placed upon that section of the statute by the arbitrators is correct, then the word \"deduct\" is practically a meaningless word in that section, because if the amount of interest upon the excess of debt is only to be called for or charged at the end of six months then there is no deduction. A deduction is something that is to be taken from an amount now paid. If the amount is to be paid to-day, subject to a deduction, it must be the amount less the deduction, and the construction which Mr. Langton, Deputy Minister of Finance, in 1868, put upon this section, is the correct one, and the arbitrators have not put the construction which the words themselves actually bear out.\nThen, with reference to the Act of 1884, while the British North America Act dealt with the equality of all the provinces, the Act of 1884 dealt with the recoupment of the provinces of Ontario and Quebec, with the amount which it was considered might be deducted from them under the British North America Act. That is the whole object of the Act of 1884. The purport and intention of that Act was to recoup the provinces of Ontario and Quebec. Now, what were they to recoup? Putting the case in this position:\u2014Supposing they had kept no account, because the amounts were unsettled, because it was uncertain what the excess of debt was, and supposing that that was simply kept in suspense, and no entries made in their books at all, then, upon the construction of the Act of 1884, what would be the amount which would be recouped or repaid, or allowed to the provinces of Ontario and Quebec under the construction of the Act of 1884, and Acts prior to it? Even if there were no entries, I submit to your Lordships that the only amount that would be recouped to them would be the twelve payments, which, under the British North America Act the Dominion was entitled to deduct.\nWhat we submit to your Lordships is, that there has been an error in making up these accounts. Assuming now that we are dealing with the accounts themselves, there has been an error in making up these accounts, and the error is one of a large amount; it is the amount of $262,000, plus interest, which I understand will make it up to upwards of $400,000, And I submit that the arbitrators should have considered that position of the matter, and that they should have directed that as the accounts are now open for settlement and adjustment by the Act of 1891, that the accounts should be rectified by the addition of the amount of $262,000 which should have been charged.\nUpon that position, treating this as an error in the accounts, the cases of Williamson v. Barbour[1], and Gething v. Keighley[2], show this:\u2014That where accounts have been of long standing and have been settled, and it is shown that there has been an error in certain items, they may be opened, and the account rectified.\nThen, upon the question of estoppel, which my learned friend has referred to, there is just one case which I desire to direct your Lordships' attention to, In re Hercules Insurance Co.[3].\nThe questions upon the statute have been so fully argued, I do not know that I can add anything that would be of great value.\nIrving Q.C. for the province of Ontario.\u2014I wish to say at the outset that in the accounts rendered to the province of Ontario only eleven half-yearly deductions of interest between 1867 and 1873 were ever claimed, and never was the idea of the twelfth payment put forward until before the arbitrators; my learned friend, for the first time, started the question. The case which they submitted to the arbitrators, which is in the blue-book, which is practically a record of the court below and which can be brought up here, does not say one word about the twelfth payment. Our position is the converse of my learned friend's statement as to that.\nThen, taking up the British North America Act, I am almost inclined to think, that we now come merely to discuss what its dry reading is. I do not know that it is necessary for me to offer any observation. My learned friend, Mr. Hogg applied some criticism to section 118, in which he said that the word \"deduct\" became meaningless, but it appears to me that the answer to that is, that the word \"deduct\" can be only applied when there is something to deduct, when there is something that has been settled and is chargeable. The word \"deduct\" does not necessarily assume that there must be actually something to deduct; it was to be deducted whenever it should be chargeable.\nWe will see, that after the passing of the Act of 1873, and up to the time of the Act of 1884, the position was that the subsidies were paid in full, and the two provinces remained liable to pay the interest upon the excess of debt between January, 1868, and the 1st of January, 1873. Now, the introduction of the Act of 1884 in no way disturbs that. There, I think, is the fallacy of the position that my learned friends, the appellants, have set up. The Act of 1884 in no way disturbs that. It in no way relieved the provinces from paying the excess of debt between those periods, but it took, as a well-settled arithmetical quantity, the figure or figures which composed the increase of debt between what had been originally allowed by the British North America Act and the increase under the Act of 1873. It took that as a well-settled figure, whatever it might have been.\nThe Act of 1884 in no way deals with the amount of the debt. It says simply, the increase of subsidies which have taken effect from 1873 are now to take effect from 1867, beginning at the 1st of July, 1867, ending on the 1st of January, 1873, which makes the twelve deductions, and it could not be otherwise, because at that period twelve subsidies had not been paid on their respective dates, and the increases had to relate to such dates. It would seem to me that there would be no other explanation of the Act of 1884, on its reading after having read the two first Acts. All that the Act of 1884 has to refer to the other Acts for is to ascertain the amount of figures which compose the increase under the Act of 1873, and that increase, no matter what it was from, became eo nomine a subsidy, and the Act of 1884 says that the increase which is a subsidy under the Act of 1874, is now to be multiplied by twelve.\n(The learned counsel then dealt with the contention that the provinces having accepted the benefits under the Act of 1884 should be bound by its burdens, and read certain documents and correspondence to show that the province had no knowledge of the details of the adjustment under that Act long after it was passed).\nThe Act of 1884 was an absolute gift, increasing the subsidy up to January, 1873, inclusive.\nI think that is the answer to the whole position, that the Act of 1884 took up the increase to all the provinces wholly, with reference to the amount of increases that had taken place in 1873. It did not deal with the question of interest.\nMoss Q.C. follows.\u2014Section 112 makes Ontario and Quebec jointly liable to Canada for the amount, if any, by which the debt of the province of Canada exceeds at the union the sum of $62,500,000. Now, these two provinces are jointly liable to Canada for any excess. In other words, they are to make good and pay to Canada, to recoup to Canada, in some way or another, any sum over that sixty-two millions, five hundred thousand dollars, and then there follows upon that what very naturally and very frequently certainly follows upon a liability, and that is, an obligation to pay interest upon it; \"shall be charged with interest at the rate of five percent per annum thereon.\" That is to say, Ontario and Quebec are to be liable for the excess and are to be charged with interest at five per cent upon that excess. Now, when does the charge of interest begin?\nDoes any debt or obligation create interest until the lapse of some period of time? The interest begins to run from a certain date, and it runs from that time out, but what is the day at which interest is to begin to run on this? Could it possibly be a day before the coming into force of the Act of Confederation? The interest will begin to run from the day when this compact of confederation took effect, and not before. If this Act never took effect that obligation never took effect, and interest would never begin to run. The moment the Act comes into force, the moment the Dominion is established, that is to say, on the 1st of July, 1867, this obligation commences, interest begins to run from that day, on whatever that excess may be. Interest is chargeable, therefore, from that time, beginning at that date, and following up.\nWhen you look at the way in which section 118 deals with it, it is perfectly clear that the provinces are to receive the amounts which are fixed by that section 118; they are to be paid these half-yearly in advance, but the government of Canada shall deduct from such grants, as against any province, all sums chargeable as interest. That is, a sum chargeable when it accrues due.\nThe law with regard to the right to the payment of interest is very well settled, and perhaps no observation could be clearer than that by Lord Westbury:\u2014That interest can only be demanded by virtue of a contract, express or implied, or by virtue of a principal sum being wrongfully withheld on the day it ought to have been paid.\nThen the Dominion for many years kept the accounts according to our contention and in construing statutes long usage has frequently been referred to. Magistrates of Dunbar v. The Duchess of Roxburghe[4]; Attorney General v. Rochester[5]; The Queen v. Archbishop of Canterbury[6].\nThen as to the Act of 1884, that Act, your Lordships will see, does not attempt to deal in terms, at all events, with any question of the allowance upon the excess of interest, or otherwise, but what it does say, is this: It says that the subsidies payable under the British North America Act were readjusted and increased by the operation of the Act of 1873. That is to say, the operation of the Act of 1873 was to readjust and to increase, in a certain way, the subsidies, and it was desirable that that operation of the Act should be so extended as that there should be no doubt as to its being intended to apply, not only from the date of the coming into force of the Act of 1873, but from the coming into force of the Act of 1867, the Confederation Act. Now, how does it proceed to do that? Here, as it seems to me, my Lords, is where my learned friends have not taken the right view of this Act. What Parliament has done is, not to decide or determine anything absolutely upon figures, but it says, the amount by which the yearly subsidy to each was increased shall be calculated and allowed to Ontario and Quebec conjointly, as if the said Acts had directed that such increase should be allowed, and so on; not that the Acts did do so, or that they did not do so; they do not determine anything with reference to the effect of that Act, but, at all events, they say now, in the accounts, that amount shall be computed or calculated and allowed as if these Acts had directed that such increase should be allowed from the day of the coming into force of the British North America Act. Whether it does or does not do so, at all events, the amounts are to be computed and calculated and allowed as if that were so.\nGirouard Q.C. for the province of Quebec.\u2014As representing Quebec, I have very little to add to the exhaustive arguments presented by the learned counsel representing Ontario. Our interests are almost identical with those of Ontario, and whatever has been said in favour of Ontario should be accepted by the court as being an argument in favour of Quebec. I will content myself with summing up the case as I understand it.\nIn my humble opinion, the statute of 1884 which has been cited in support of the views contended for by the Dominion has no application whatever. The statute of 1884 provides for the case, and no court, as I understand it, should go behind the statute, to find out whether there was a mistake or not, whether there were twelve payments, or ten, or nine. The statute of 1884 has provided for a case which is complete on its face, and we have to-day to decide whether under the British North America Act the Dominion is entitled to get interest in advance. That is the sole question, as I understand it.\nNow, let us look at that statute. Section 112 says that Ontario and Quebec shall jointly be liable to Canada for the amount at which the debt, &c.; nothing said about interest payable in advance or to be charged in advance.\nBy section 118 it says, the government of Canada shall deduct from said grants of subsidy as against any province all sums chargeable as interest on the public debt of that province, and so on; nothing is said there that the interest is to be charged in advance.\nAnd then we come to the common law principle that interest shall only be charged as accrued or earned. Now, let us look at another clause of the British North America Act, which concerns Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, but which, I believe, throws light upon the intention of the legislature:\nIn case the public debts of Nova Scotia and New Brunswick do not at the union amount to eight million and seven million dollars respectively, they shall respectively receive by half-yearly payments in advance from the government of Canada, interest at five per centum per annum on the difference between the actual amounts of their respective debts and such stipulated amounts.\nThe subsidies are to be paid in advance. The interest which should go to Nova Scotia or New Brunswick on their debt shall be payable in advance. Nothing is said as far as the interest on the excess of debt is concerned, whether that should be payable in advance or not, and we conclude, the statute being silent, that we must supply the common law rules. That is to say, the interest shall be charged as earned or accrued. That is commencing on the 1st of January, 1868, as the parties have done in the public accounts; and I wish to call the attention of the court to the agreement of the parties as far as the papers show, which are now before the court in this appeal; the court is not limited to the case as printed; the case is the same as before the arbitrators; each party has leave to refer to any of the documents and papers before the arbitrators. Looking at the public accounts for 1869, what do you find? You find that the parties charged interest to the provinces, on the excess of debt, from the 1st of January, 1868, in conformity with the opinion of the Minister of Justice at that time. Under the circumstances I do not wish to weary the court with a lengthened argument. I think the case is fully before the court. It has been argued in an able manner. Under these circumstances, I leave the case confidently before the court, that the interpretation which will be given to the Act of 1884 will not allow interest to be charged. I ask for the dismissal of this appeal, as we have asked in our factum; and if they lose their appeal, they should pay the costs.\nHall Q.C. follows:\u2014I would like to emphasize the position we take, that it is for this court to lay down the view of what was the liability of the provinces of Quebec and Ontario under the British North America Act, and I would ask your Lordships to consider the question irrespective of the statutes of 1873 and 1884. Because, I presume, if there is no liability on the provinces of Ontario and Quebec under the British North America Act to be charged with that interest in advance, there is no obligation at all.\nWe want your Lordships to determine the question whether under the British North America Act, the Imperial Act, there is any obligation on the provinces of Ontario and Quebec to pay interest in advance on the excess of debt. I say at the threshold, that is the question which was evidently determined by the arbitrators below, and is now the question for your Lordships to determine here. Under that Imperial Act, is there a legal obligation against Ontario and Quebec to pay interest on the excess of debt in advance?\nIf your Lordships come to the conclusion that there was no legal obligation on the part of Ontario or Quebec to pay interest on the excess of debt in advance, let us come to the statute of 1873. Now, the statute of 1873, according to our contention, relieved the provinces from any obligation. If there was an obligation to pay interest on the excess of debt, whenever that might be, that excess of debt was removed, that was the effect of the Act of 1873: and your Lordships will see, that in that Act of 1873 the other provinces of Nova Scotia and New Brunswick were compensated for that assumption by Canada of the increased debt of Ontario and Quebec; so that the other provinces, up to that time any way, never had any cause to complain, because they were all brought up on the same sort of levelling process. Therefore, whatever obligation there was to pay interest on the excess of debt, that obligation was removed in 1873 by the Dominion assuming the excess of debt. Well, when you come to the statute of 1884, as my learned friends from Ontario argued so elaborately, there is nothing to show how that principal sum is arrived at. There is nothing to show that Ontario and Quebec were ever aware of the terms of that Act. It was after the Act was passed, at the conference that took place in 1884, that the treasurers of Ontario and Quebec first inquired how the principal sum was arrived at. Now, my learned friend Mr. Girouard said, and it was the point taken below, that whether that Act was good or bad, it must stand in its entirety, and on its face. It gives an increased subsidy by the operation of the Act of 1873, but it gives that not only to Ontario and Quebec, but to Prince Edward Island, British Columbia, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick. No question of inequality or in justice can come in there, because whatever was done as regards one province, or the old province of Canada, was done with reference to the other provinces in the levelling up process.\nRitchie Q.C. in reply.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014This is an appeal by the Dominion from Certain parts of the award of the Honourable John Alexander Boyd, Chancellor of Ontario, the Honourable George Wheelock Burbidge, Judge of the Exchequer Court of Canada and the Honourable Sir Louis Napoleon Casault, Chief Justice of the Superior Court of Quebec, arbitrators appointed under the Act of the Parliament of Canada 54 & 55 Vic. cap. 6, the Act of the Legislature of Ontario 54 Vic., cap. 2. and the Act of the Legislature of Quebec 54 Vic. cap. 6. The object of the arbitration was the settlement of certain disputed accounts between the Dominion and the provinces. By the 6th section of the Dominion Act it was enacted:\nThe \"arbitrators shall not be bound to decide according to the strict rules of law or evidence, but may decide upon equitable principles and when they do proceed on their view of a disputed question of law, the awards shall set forth the same at the instance of either or any party. Any award made under this Act shall be, in so far as it relates to disputed questions of law, subject to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada and thence to the Judicial Committee of Her Majesty's Privy Council, in case their Lordships are pleased to allow such appeal.\nA similar provision was contained in each of the provincial Acts. An agreement of submission was come to between the Dominion and the provinces on the 10th of April, 1893, by which certain questions were submitted to the arbitrators. This agreement was subsequently confirmed by orders in council, and under it the arbitrators on the 2nd of November, 1893, made the award, the first, second and third paragraphs of which are the subjects of the present appeal.\nIt is declared in the award that in respect of the findings contained in the paragraphs mentioned the arbitrators proceeded upon their view of a disputed question of law. These paragraphs are as follows:\n1. That from the first of July, 1867, to the passing of the Act of the Parliament of Canada, 36th Victoria, chapter 30, the provinces of Ontario and Quebec shall be credited with subsidy half-yearly in advance, deducting therefrom at the end of each half-year their respective shares of interest as determined by the award of September 3rd, 1870, at the rate of five per centum per annum on the excess of debt of the province of Canada over $62,500,000, as actually ascertained in amount at each period, the first of such deductions to be made on the first day of January, 1868, and the others on the first day of July and January, thereafter, down to and including the first day of January, 1873.\n2. That in the province of Canada account, there shall be credited on the 23rd clay of May, 1873, the sum of $10,506,088.84 remitted by the said Act, and thereafter the subsidy shall be credited in the separate accounts of Ontario and Quebec without any such deduction. 3. That on and from the first of July, 1884, the provinces of Ontario and Quebec shall be credited with the additional subsidy granted by the Act 47 Victoria, chapter 4, in the proportion determined for the excess of debt by the award hereinbefore mentioned.\nThe first question raised relates to interest on the excess of debt of the late province of Canada over the sum of $62,500,000, being the amount specified in the 112th section of the British North America Act. Is such interest according to the proper legal construction of this 112th section, and of the 118th section to be deducted from the half-yearly subsidies at the end of each half-year from the date of the union until the 1st of January, 1873, inclusive, or at the times when such half-yearly subsidies are directed to be paid to the provinces? In other words, is interest to be charged in advance or not until it had accrued? The learned arbitrators have determined that the interest was not to be deducted until it had actually accrued, and that consequently so far as the decision of this point depends upon the 112th and 118th sections of the British North America Act only eleven half-yearly deductions on interest on the excess are properly chargeable to Quebec and Ontario as representing the former province of Canada, and not twelve as contended for by the Dominion. In other words, the first of such deductions was chargeable at the expiration of the first half-year of the confederation, viz., on the 1st January, 1868, and the last on the 1st of January, 1873.\nBy section 111 of the British North America Act it was enacted that:\nCanada shall be liable for the debt and liabilities of each province existing at the union.\nThe 112th section is in these words:\nOntario and Quebec conjointly shall be liable to Canada for the amount (if any) by which the debt of the province of Canada exceeds at the union $62,500,000, and shall be charged with interest at the rate of five per centum per annum thereon. By section 118 it was enacted:\nThe following sums shall be paid yearly by Canada to the several provinces for the support of their governments and legislatures:\nOntario\n$80,000\nQuebec\n70,000\nNova Scotia\n60,000\nNew Brunswick\n50,000\n$260,000\nAnd an annual grant in aid of each province shall be made equal to eighty cents per head of the population as ascertained by the census of one thousand eight hundred and sixty-one, and in the case of Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, by each subsequent decennial census until the population of each of those two provinces amounts to four hundred thousand souls, at which rate such grant shall thereafter remain. Such grants shall be in settlement of all future demands on Canada, and shall be paid half-yearly in advance to each province; but the government of Canada shall deduct from such grants, as against any province, all sums chargeable as interest on the public debt of that province in excess of the several amounts stipulated in this Act.\nSections 114, 115 and 116 are respectively as follows:\n114. Nova Scotia shall be liable to Canada for the amount (if any) by which its public debt exceeds at the union eight million dollars, and shall be charged with interest at the rate of five per centum per annum thereon.\n115. New Brunswick shall be liable to Canada for the amount (if any) by which its public debt exceeds at the union seven million dollars, and shall be charged with interest at the rate of five per centum per annum thereon.\n116. In case the public debts of Nova Scotia and New Brunswick do not at the union amount to eight million and seven million dollars respectively, they shall respectively receive, by half-yearly payments in advance from the government of Canada, interest at five per centum per annum on the difference between the actual amounts of their respective debts and such stipulated amounts.\nThis question first arose in 1869, when the then treasurer of the province of Ontario objected to the mode in which the Auditor General had charged the interest, that officer having deducted it in advance from each half-yearly payment of subsidy beginning on the 1st of July, 1867. Upon a reference to the Minister, of\n[Page 522\nJustice, the late Sir John Macdonald, this was held to be wrong and the account was rectified by making the first deduction on the first of January, 1868, instead of on the first of July, 1867, and continuing in this way to deduct the interest on the excess of debt ascertained at the date of each half-yearly payment of the subsidy down to the first of January, 1873, inclusive, and this mode of making up the account has since for a period of twenty-six years been adopted and acquiesced in by all parties. So far as this question depends upon the terms of the 118th section I am of opinion that there can be no possible doubt of the correctness of the principle adopted by the arbitrators, and that for the reasons which have been set forth in the opinions which two of them, Chief Justice Sir Louis Casault and Mr. Justice Burbidge have appended to the award. Sections 114 and 115 which apply to Nova Scotia and New Brunswick respectively are as regards interest in the same terms as section 118. Section 116 which provides for the payment by the Dominion of interest to the two provinces of Nova Scotia and New Brunswick in the event of the amount at which their debts were assumed being; found to be in excess of the true amount, makes express provision for such payment being made in advance.\nThey shall respectively receive by half-yearly payments in advance from the government of Canada interest at five per centum per annum on the difference between the actual amounts of their respective debts and such stipulated amounts\u2014\nare the words of the Act. From this it appears plain that in the case of these two provinces it was not the intention of Parliament that interest on any excess of the debt which might be found over the stipulated amounts, should be deducted in advance, for when it was intended that interest should be so paid it was said so in express words. Then the same result must follow as regards the construction to be placed on section 118. No good reason can be assigned why any difference should be made as regards deducting interest on an excess of debt between the two Maritime provinces and the two provinces composing the province of Canada. The words of the 118th section are identical with those of the 114th and 115th, and if these latter did not require a deduction in advance clearly the former did not.\nFurther, the payment of interest before it has actually accrued due is so inconsistent with the normal mode of keeping accounts that in the absence of an express provision to that effect it is not to be inferred. There is no such thing as interest on a debt not yet due. As Chief Justice Casault well observes:\nInterest is the price of the use of money or commodity\"; it cannot be due before its use has been enjoyed and for the duration of the enjoyment, though stipulated at a certain rate per annum, it is never paid in advance without an express stipulation which is to be found nowhere in the British North America Act, 1867.\nThen to deduct interest on the excess from the 1st of July, 1867, would be to take interest not actually accrued, for there was of course no debt due to the Dominion before the first of July, 1867, and interest could only be computed from that date. The mere provision of the 118th section that the interest was to be deducted from the grants or subsidies is not at all conclusive to show that it was to be deducted from the first payment of a subsidy and so by anticipation. These subsidies were necessarily payable in advance since the Act had transferred to the Dominion all the available means which the provinces had for carrying on the provincial governments, and they would have been absolutely without means for that purpose if the half-yearly payments of the subsidy in advance had not put them in funds. It does not follow from the provision that the interest is to be deducted from these half-yearly payments, that the interest is to be deducted before it accrues due. It is not said that from \"each and every\" half-yearly subsidy interest is to be deducted, and to give effect to the claim of the Dominion would be to interpolate those words. It is quite consistent with the terms of the 118th section and with the whole tenor of the statute that the interest should for the first time be deducted when it had accrued, and that the first deduction should be made from the half-yearly subsidy payable on the 1st of January, 1868, and so on half-yearly thereafter.\nSection 112 says that the provinces of Ontario and Quebec shall be charged with interest at five per cent on the excess of debt, but to charge interest at that rate in advance as contended for by the Dominion would be to make the provinces pay more than five per cent and thus to give the Dominion a premium which would be entirely unwarranted by the terms of this section. It therefore appears to me to be very clear that under the British North America Act by itself, without regard to subsequent Dominion legislation, the decision of the learned arbitrators is entirely right, in holding that the mode of keeping the accounts and deducting the interest which has been adopted by the Dominion and acquiesced in by all parties since January, 1867, was correct, and that the accounts ought not in that respect to be now disturbed so far as the British North America Act is alone applicable.\nIt is said, however, that the effect of certain legislation of the Parliament of the Dominion has been to alter the liabilities of the provinces in this respect, and to impose upon them the obligation of submitting to the deduction of twelve instead of eleven payments of interest. In 1873 the statute of Canada 36 Vic. ch. 30, was passed, and received the royal assent on the 23rd of May in that year. The object of this statute was to increase the yearly grants to the provinces, to give what were called \"better terms.\" By the preamble, after reciting the provision of the British North America Act as to the assumption of the provincial debts, and as to the payment of interest on any excess or less amount of debt over or under the fixed amounts mentioned in that Act, it was further recited as follows:\nAnd whereas the amount fixed as aforesaid in the case of the provinces of Ontario and Quebec, conjointly, as having theretofore formed the province of Canada, was $62,500,000, and the debt of the said late province as now ascertained exceeded the said sum by $10,506,088.84 for the interest on which the said two provinces were chargeable in account with Canada. And whereas it is expedient to relieve the said provinces of Ontario and Quebec from the charge, and for that purpose hereafter to consider the fixed amount in their case as increased by the said sum of $10,506,088.84, and to compensate the other provinces for the addition to the general debt of Canada.\nBy the first section it was enacted that:\nIn the accounts between the several provinces of Canada and the Dominion, the amounts payable to and chargeable against the said provinces respectively in so far as they depend on the amount of debt with which each province entered the union, shall be calculated and allowed as if the sum fixed by the 112th section of the British North America Act, 1867, were increased from $62,500,000, to the sum of $73,006,088.84, and as if the amount fixed as aforesaid, as respects the provinces of Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, by the British North America Act, 1867, and as respects the provinces of British Columbia and Manitoba by the terms and conditions on which they were admitted into the Dominion, were increased in the same proportion.\nBy the second section it was provided that:\nThe subsidies to the several provinces, in July, 1873, shall be paid in accordance with the foregoing provisions of this Act.\nIt was at first contended by the provinces of Quebec and Ontario that this Act was retrospective and authorized the payment of the increased subsidies from the date of union in 1867. This, however, was resisted by the Dominion, and rightly, for it is expressly said in the preamble, that \"thereafter\" the amount of debt fixed by the British North America Act should be considered as increased in the manner indicated by the Act.\nBy the Act 47 Vic. ch. 4, the preamble of which, after referring to the Act of 1873 and stating that the increase thereby allowed was only from the first of July, 1873, recited that it was expedient it should be allowed from the coming into force of the British North America Act, and that a proportionate increase should be made to the three provinces subsequently admitted to the Dominion, it was enacted by section one as follows:\nIn the accounts between the several provinces and the Dominion, the amounts by which the yearly subsidy to each was increased by the Act thirty-six Victoria, chapter thirty, as explained by the Act thirty-seven Victoria, chapter 3, as to Nova Scotia, shall be calculated and allowed to Ontario and Quebec, jointly, as having formed the late province of Canada, and to Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, as if the said Acts had directed that such increase should be allowed from the day of the coming into force of the \"British North America Act, 1867,\" and the total amount of the half-yearly payments which would in that case have been made on account of such increase from the first day of July, one thousand eight hundred and sixty-seven, up to and including the first day of January, one thousand eight hundred and seventy-three, with interest on each at five per cent per annum, from the day on which it would have been so paid, to the first day of July, one thousand eight hundred and eighty-four, shall be deemed capital, owing to the said provinces respectively, bearing interest at five per cent per annum, which interest shall be payable to them as part of their yearly subsidies from the Dominion, on and after the first day of July, one thousand eight hundred and eighty-four.\nSection 2 provided in the same terms for proportional allowances to Manitoba, British Columbia and Prince Edward Island.\nSection 3 is as follows:\nAnd for the avoidance of doubt under the foregoing provisions, it is declared and enacted, that the amount of the increase of the yearly subsidy and the capital on which the same is payable, to the several provinces respectively, under this Act, shall be as follows: Yearly increase ...................\nCapital.\nTo Ontario and Quebec jointly\n$269,875 16\n$5,397,503 13\nNova Scotia\n39,668 44\n793,368 71\nNew Brunswick\n30,225 97\n604,519 35\nManitoba\n5,541 25\n110,825 07\nBritish Columbia\n4,155 39\n83,107 88\nPrince Edward Island\n9,148 68\n182,973 78\nOf both these Acts of 1873 and 1884 it is to be said that they are not of their own force binding on the provinces. There never has been any legislation on the part of the provinces agreeing to an alteration of their rights as they existed under the British North America Act. If, however, the provinces accepted the benefits conferred upon them by Parliament in the terms of these statutes, they are, I take it, upon the principle qui sentit commodum debet sentire et onus, bound by any burdens and conditions to which the additional grants are made subject.\nIt was at one time contended by Ontario and Quebec that the effect of the Act of 1884 was not only to give the additional subsidy or yearly increase therein specified but also to authorize the crediting in the accounts of those provinces with the Dominion of all deductions made between 1867 and 1873 on account of half-yearly balances of debt in excess of $62,500,000 but under $73,006,088.84. This, however, would have been virtually to give the same benefit to the provinces twice over and being clearly not warranted by the statutes or either of them it was not insisted upon. In determining how the account between 1867 and 1873 is to be constructed the question now arises whether eleven or twelve gales of interest are to be deducted. The question of what are the proper balances on which the interest should be deducted will be considered later on. The question now under consideration is confined to the number of those half-yearly deductions of interest on the excess of debt. As already demonstrated, the 118th section of the British North America Act would have authorized the deduction between the 1st of July, 1867, and the 23rd of May, 1873, of only eleven gales of interest.\nThe Act of 1873 is, as has been shown, entirely prospective and does not touch this point except in so far as the amount of increase therein specified is referred to in the later Act. If then any change in this respect is to be made, warrant for it must be found in the Act of 1884.\nIn the first place it would be well to consider the general scope and object of this Act. This clearly was to give to the provinces of Ontario and Quebec jointly from the 1st of July, 1884, an increased subsidy of $269,875.16. It is true that it is said that this was based on an assumed capital of $5,397,503.13, but this does not affect the provinces. All they are concerned with is the grant itself. This grant cannot now be disturbed without prejudicially affecting those provinces relatively to the other provinces. It will be observed too that the language of the Act in the third section indicates that it was intended that this should be conclusive: \"for the avoidance of doubt under the foregoing provisions,\" the words are. Surely nothing can be more absolute than this to show that whether the calculation was right or wrong the figures are to be taken as conclusive.\nThen in the face of the Act itself nothing appears showing how the amount of the subsidy was arrived at. The first section of the Act does not fix the number of the deductions of interest in excess of debt, nor require any departure from the proper mode of making these deductions as prescribed by the 118th section of the British North America Act. If then we are to say that it was intended to be attached as a condition to the acceptance of the subsidy, that the provinces in taking these accounts between 1867 and 1873 should submit to be charged with twelve instead of eleven gales of interest, it can only be because the amount of capital upon which the increased subsidy is based coincides with twelve gales of interest on an assumed excess of debt for each half-year during that time of $10,506,088.84 (contrary as regards the amount of the excess to the well ascertained fact) with five per cent from the supposed time of payment added. Are we to assume that it was the intention of the legislature to attach a submission to this mode of calculation as a condition of the subsidy when we find that it was not warranted by the law, and must have proceeded on an error either of fact or law, and when we find Parliament saying in almost so many words, as it does in the third clause, that without regard to any mistake the subsidy specified shall be paid? I agree with Sir Louis Casault that so to do would be to alter, not to expound, the law, and to compel the provinces to submit to terms they never assented to. If there has been a mistake it is apparent that it is one which is not susceptible of any judicial remedy. It would be out of the question to declare the Act either wholly or partially void. The amount of the subsidy could not be reduced without disturbing the fairness of the proportion between Ontario and Quebec and the other provinces; and to require them to surrender their legal right under the British North America Act to restrict the Dominion to eleven deductions of interest would be to compel them to submit to terms which they were never required to assent to, and in short to make a new arrangement for them. If Parliament was in error, either as to the proper calculation or as to the legal effect of the British North America Act, that can only be corrected by statute. This is not the case of a legislature proceeding upon an assumed construction of one of its own statutes. Parliament had no power in any way to alter the rights of the provinces under the British North America Act, nor to bind the provinces by its legislation except in so far as it made the subsidy conditional on an acceptance of the terms that twelve gales of interest should be deducted, and I fail to see that they have imposed any such condition.\nSir Louis Casault expresses the opinion that Parliament made no mistake either as to the number or amount of the half-yearly deductions of interest. The learned Chief Justice points out that though the deductions of interest were not to be made in advance the subsidies were so payable, and therefore, although twelve deductions of interest are not authorized in taking the accounts between 1867 and 1873, it is not inconsistent with this that the legislature intended that the capital specified should be based on twelve half-yearly payments of interest on the increase of debt given by the Act of 1873; and that the amount of the subsidy is by the first section of the Act of 1884 fixed with reference, not to the number and amount of the half-yearly deductions of interest, but by the amount of the subsidy granted by the Act of 1873, treated as the subsidies were declared to be by the British North America Act as payable in advance from the date of union. This receives strong support from the recitals of the statute of 1884, showing that the object of that Act was to put the provinces in the same position as if the statute of 1873 had been retrospective. I entirely agree in this view and I adopt what the learned Chief Justice says in regard to it in his judgment. If this is correct it is of course conclusive and there can be no pretense of any error in the statute, nor can it be said that there is anything in it which in any way controls the rights of the provinces to have the deductions of interest made according to the principle required by the 118th section of the Confederation Act.\nOn the whole I am of opinion that the learned arbitrators were right in making only eleven half-yearly deductions of interest in the interval between 1867 and 1873, a conclusion which agrees entirely with the mode in which from 1869 the Dominion officers had kept the account.\nThe third point relates to a sum of $23,614.22 which the Dominion claims is by the award allowed to the provinces in excess of what they are entitled to. The arbitrators have determined by the first clause of the award:\nThat from the first of July, 1867, to the passing of the Act of the Parliament of Canada 36 Victoria, chapter 36, the provinces of Ontario and Quebec shall be credited with subsidy half-yearly in advance, deducting therefrom at the end of each half-year their respective shares of interest as determined by the award of September 13th, 1870, at the rate of five per cent per annum on the excess of debt of the province of Canada over $62,500,000 as actually ascertained in amount [at each period, the first of such deductions to be made on the first of January, 1868, and the others on the first day of July and January thereafter, down to and including the first day of January, 1873.\nThe objection to this on the part of the Dominion is that the deduction of interest instead of being based on the excess of debt as ascertained at each time of deduction should be based on such excess as ascertained at the time of the passing of the Act of 1873, or as actually existing at the time of the union. In other words, it is claimed on behalf of the Dominion that interest should be charged against the provinces from the 1st of July, 1867, on an excess of debt amounting to $10,506,088.84, being the excess as determined by the Act of 1873, as existing on the 1st of January, 1873, instead of on the actual excess ascertained from time to time as the amount over the sum of $62,500,000 as specified in the 112th section of the British North America Act, whilst the same excess of $10,506,088.84 should not be credited to the provinces until the 23rd May, 1873, thus not giving the provinces the benefit of the increase for the purpose of establishing the excess of debt on which interest is to be charged whilst taking advantage of such increase as establishing against them the amount of debt at each half-yearly period from 1867 to 1873 without reference to the actual facts.\nThe provinces on the other hand contend that the proper mode of calculating the interest on the debt during the interval from 1867 to 1873 is to charge the provinces with interest and to deduct from each half-yearly payment of subsidy, interest at five per cent on the balance from time to time actually ascertained on the excess of the debt over the $62,500,000 as fixed by the 112th section. This principle has been adopted by the learned arbitrators in their award. A third plan has been suggested by Chief Justice Casault, viz., that the provinces should be credited with the increase of $10,506,088.84 on the 1st of July, 1867, which would result in half-yearly balances in their favour instead of against them, down to the 1st of January, 1873, inclusive; and that the benefit of the increase being thus given to the provinces from the beginning the Dominion should be at liberty to assume that there was a uniform excess of debt equal to the increase at each half-yearly period during the whole time from 1867 to 1873, and that interest should be credited and charged accordingly. The learned Chief Justice did not, however, act on this view but concurred with the other arbitrators in adopting the mode of calculation sanctioned by the award.\nLittle or no difference in the result would have been caused by adopting this latter mode of making up the account, as is well shown in the very able judgment of Mr. Justice Burbidge. I see, however, considerable objection to it in a legal point of view. There is no statutory authority for such a mode of proceeding. I have already shewn in discussing the question as to the number of deductions for interest, that the Act of 1884 ought not to be considered as decisive of that question, and for the same reason it ought not to be considered as conclusive of the amount of the half-yearly balances on which interest should be calculated.\nThe interest account was not kept in this way by the Dominion officers, but on the plan adopted by the arbitrators.\nAs regards the agreement entered into at a conference held in 1888, between certain Ministers representing the Dominion and others representing the Executives of the provinces, I agree with Mr. Justice Burbidge that as these gentlemen acted under no legislative authority, their conclusions as to the proper mode of constructing the interest account can have no binding effect either on the Dominion or the provinces.\nThere remains to be considered the contention of the Dominion on this head. According to this the statutory increase should be treated as the uniform fixed amount of the excess of debt during the whole period from 1867 to 1873, and interest charged accordingly, whilst the provinces should not have the benefit of such increase until the 23rd of May, 1873, the deductions for interest up to that date being calculated on the half-yearly balances of the excess thus assumed over the original amount specified in section 112 of the Confederation Act ($62,500,000).\nThe proposition of the Dominion is that there could be no increase in the amount of the debt of the provinces for which the 111th section of the British North America Act made the Dominion liable after that Act came into force on the 1st of July, 1867, and as it was ascertained on the 1st of July, 1872, that the excess then amounted to $10,506,088.84, that that amount must have been due from the beginning, and interest on that amount should therefore be deducted half-yearly all along and not on the actual balances as shown in the Dominion accounts.\nThe answer of the provinces to this contention is that it was not intended by the provision for payment of interest on excess of debt to give the Dominion any premium or profit but simply an indemnity, and that it would therefore be unjust and unreasonable to charge interest in respect of claims or debts of the provinces not assumed by the Dominion as between it and the creditors! or claimants, or even known to exist, until long after the date of confederation; that all that the Dominion could properly claim under the statute was interest on such subsequently ascertained claims or debts from the dates at which they were either paid or satisfied, or from the time at which interest upon them was paid or a liability to pay interest undertaken on the part of the Dominion.\nThis was the view adopted by the arbitrators in making their award. It proceeds entirely upon the principle that interest as given by section 118 was by way of recoupment only. There is nothing in the British North America Act itself indicating this, but I am of opinion that it is a fair inference from the whole scope and intention of that statute that the Dominion were merely to be recouped to the extent of interest and were not entitled to receive interest which they did not pay or become liable to pay. Further, this is in accord with the mode of keeping the accounts adopted by the Dominion officers from the beginning, and which prevailed without question for a period of some twenty-six years. I confess I have had more doubt on this head than on any others, but I do not feel the doubt sufficiently strong to warrant me in dissenting from the award.\nOn the whole I am of opinion that there was no legal error in the award in respect of the matters; brought under review in this appeal, which must there-fore be dismissed with costs.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014Concurred.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014By the 104th sec. of the British North America Act, 1867, it was enacted that the annual interest of the public debts of the provinces of Canada, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick at the union should form the second claim on the consolidated revenue fund of Canada. By sec. 111 it was enacted that Canada should be liable for the debts and liabilities of each province existing at the union. But by sec. 112 it was enacted that Ontario and Quebec conjointly should be liable to Canada for the amount, if any by which the debt of the province of Canada exceeded at the union $62,500,000 and should be charged with interest at the rate of five per centum per annum thereon. By sec. 118 it was enacted that certain sums specified therein should be paid yearly by Canada to the several provinces of Ontario, Quebec, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick for the support of their governments and legislatures and that\u2014\nsuch grants shall be in full settlement of all future demands on Canada and shall be paid half-yearly in advance to each province, but the government of Canada shall deduct from such grants as against any province all sums chargeable as interest on the public debt of that province in excess of the several amounts stipulated in the Act.\nThe union of the provinces into the Dominion of Canada came into operation on the 1st day of July, 1867. At that time the public debt of the late province of Canada was known to exceed the said sum of $62,500,000 but to what amount was not ascertained. Interest upon such excess was coming due in July, 1867. To meet such interest which the government of Canada was made liable for by the British North America Act the government deducted from the half-yearly subsidy payable respectively to Ontario and Quebec a sum calculated as the half-yearly interest upon such excess, estimating it at an amount deemed to be within the mark; this deduction was made upon the assumed authority of the British North America Act\u2014the 118th sec. of which expressly authorized the Government of Canada to deduct from the half-yearly grants payable to each province all sums chargeable as interest on the public debt of that province in excess of the several amounts stipulated in the Act, that is to say, as regards Ontario and Quebec, all sums chargeable as interest on the public debt of the late province of Canada in excess of the said sum of $62,500,000. Like deductions were made from the half-yearly subsidies payable to Ontario and Quebec in January and July, 1868, but in 1869 it appears that upon the authority of the Minister of Justice such deductions were no longer made until the expiration of each half-year; that is to say, that so much of the interest upon the excess of the public debt of the late province of Canada over the $62,500,000 as fell due in July of Bach year, and which the government of Canada was bound to pay them, was not charged to the provinces until the following January, nor that coming due in January until the following July. This continued until the month of May, 1873, when an Act was passed by the Dominion Parliament intituled:\nAn Act to readjust the amounts payable to and chargeable against the several provinces of Canada by the Dominion Government so far is they depend upon the debt with which they respectively entered the union. By that Act, after reciting that by the terms of the union Canada became liable for the debts and liabilities of each province existing at the time of its becoming part of the Dominion subject to the provision that each province should in account with Canada be charged with interest at the rate of five per centum on the amount by which its said debts and liabilities exceeded, or should receive interest at the same rate by half-yearly payments in advance on the amount by which its said debts and liabilities fell short of, certain fixed amounts; secondly, that the amount of Ontario and Quebec conjointly as having theretofore formed the province of Canada was $62,500,000, and that the debt of the said late province as then ascertained exceeded the sum of $62,500,000 by $10,506,088.84; and thirdly, that it was expedient to relieve the said provinces of Ontario and Quebec from the said charge and for that purpose thereafter to consider the fixed amount in their case as increased by the said sum of $10,506,088.84, and to compensate the other provinces for this addition to the general debt of Canada; it was enacted as follows:\n1. In the accounts between the several provinces of Canada and the Dominion the amounts payable to and chargeable against the said provinces respectively in so far as they depend upon the amount of debt with which each province entered the union shall be calculated and allowed as if the sum fixed by the 112th section of the British North America Act of 1867 were increased from $62,500,000 to the sum of $73,600,088.84, and as if the amounts fixed as aforesaid as respects the provinces of Nova Scotia and New Brunswick by the British North America Act, 1867, and as respects the provinces of British Columbia and Manitoba by the terms and conditions upon which they were admitted into the Dominion were increased in the same proportion.\n2. The subsidies to the several provinces in July, 1873, shall be paid in accordance with the foregoing provisions of this Act.\nWhatever doubt may have existed as to the construction of this Act by the use of the word \"hereafter\" in the third of the above recitals in the preamble of the Act seems to me to be wholly removed by the enacting clause which in plain terms as it appears to me enacts that in all accounting and taking of accounts between the Dominion of Canada and the provinces of Ontario and Quebec such accounts should be taken as if the sum of $73,600,088.84 had been the sum inserted in the 112th section of the British North America Act instead of the sum of $62,500,000, in which case as the public debt of the late province of Canada did not at the time of the union exceed the said sum of $73,600,088.84 there would have been no deduction whatever authorized by the British North America Act to be made from the half-yearly subsidies payable by Canada to Ontario and Quebec, and if the account now being taken had been taken under that Act I cannot entertain a doubt that the provinces would have been entitled to claim and be allowed as against the Dominion so much of the several sums which had been deducted from their half-yearly subsidies with interest thereon from the time of such deductions respectively as had not been repaid; but doubts appear to have been entertained as to such being the construction of the Act for in 1884 the Dominion Parliament passed an Act to make the matter clear beyond any doubt\u201447 Vic. ch. 4.\nBy that Act, after reciting among other things that the subsidies payable under the British North America Act, 1867, to the several provinces thereby united into one Dominion respectively were readjusted and increased by the operation of the Act of the Parliament of Canada 36 Vic. c. 30, but the said increase was allowed only from the first day of July, 1873, and it was expedient that it should be allowed as from the day of the coming into force of the said British North America Act, 1867, it was enacted that: In the accounts between the several provinces and the Dominion the amounts by which the yearly subsidy to each was increased by the Act 36 Vic. ch. 30, shall be calculated and allowed to Ontario and Quebec (jointly as having formed the late province of Canada) as if the said Act had directed that such increase should be allowed from the coming into force of the British North America Act, 1867, and the total amount of the half-yearly payments which would in that case have been made on account of such increase from the first day of July, 1867, up to and including the first day of January, 1873, with interest on each at 5 per cent per annum, from the day on which it would have been so paid to the first day of July, 1884, shall be deemed capital owing to the said provinces respectively bearing interest at 5 per cent per annum, which interest shall be payable to them as part of their yearly subsidies from the Dominion on and after the first day of July, 1884.\nAnd the 3rd section enacts that:\nFor the avoidance of doubt under the foregoing provisions it is declared and enacted that the amount of the increase of the yearly subsidy and the capital on which the same is payable to the several provinces respectively under this Act shall be as follows:\nYearly increase.\nCapital.\nTo Ontario and Quebec jointly.\n$269,875 16\n$5,397,503 13\nNow what Parliament did by the Act of 1873 as regards Ontario and Quebec was to declare in express terms that in the accounts between the provinces and the Dominion the amount of the debt of the provinces should be calculated and allowed as if the sum of $62,500,000 mentioned in the 112th section of the British North America Act had been increased to $73,600,088.84, and that in July, 1873, the subsidies to Ontario and Quebec should be paid in accordance with this provision. This Act entitled the provinces of Ontario and Quebec in July, 1873, and thenceforth to receive half-yearly in advance the full amount of their subsidies ascertained under the provisions of the British North America Act without any deduction whatever as for excess of debt as provided for in the British North America Act. The only increase in the subsidies which they received in and subsequently to July, 1873, was the full amount of their half-yearly subsidies ascertained in the manner provided by the British North America Act without any deduction whatever as for interest upon an excess of debt of the late province of Canada over the amount of $73,600,088.84, which by the Act of 1873 was assumed absolutely by the Dominion instead of the amount fixed by the 112th section of the British North America Act. As there was not pretended to be any excess of debt of the late province of Canada over the amount by which the Act of 1873 was fixed as having been the total amount of the debt of the province of Canada at the union, assumed by the Dominion, there was no deduction to be made.\nNow the Act of 1884, for the purpose as appears to me of removing all doubt as to the operation of the Act of 1873, simply provides that the benefit in increase of subsidy received by the provinces of Ontario and Quebec by the Act of 1873 in July, 1873, and thenceforward should be allowed to them as from the first of July, 1867\u2014and to effectuate that purpose the Act provided that the whole of the amounts by which the subsidies paid from the 1st July, 1867, to 1st January, 1873, fell short of the full amounts which would have been payable if $73,600,088.84 had been the sum inserted in the 112th section of the British North America Act instead of $62,500,000 together with 5 per cent on the respective sums by which the half-yearly subsidies said fell short of such full amounts should be capitalized, that is to say that the precise amount of the deductions made with interest upon the respective amounts of such deductions at 5 per cent from the respective dates upon which the amounts deducted would have been payable as subsidy but for the deductions should be capitalized, and the Act declares the amount so capitalized to be the sum of $5,397,508.13, which sum the Dominion acknowledges by statute to owe to the provinces and undertakes to pay 5 per cent per annum thereon to the provinces as part of their yearly subsidies upon and from the 1st June, 1884. Now the amount so capitalized we find to be composed of twelve several half-yearly sums of $262,652.22 with interest at 5 per cent per annum upon each of such sums respectively from the respective days upon which the half-yearly subsidies from which such sums were now assumed to have been deducted were payable, the interest being calculated up to the 1st July, 1884, so that the amount allowed to the provinces by the Act as for deductions from their half-yearly subsidies between the 1st July, 1867, and the 1st January, 1873, inclusive exceeded the amount of the deductions actually made, as appears by the evidence in the appeal case, but the Act of 1884 is conclusive against the Dominion having any claim upon that ground and the Dominion Government makes no such claim. So in like manner are the provinces who have accepted the benefit conferred by the Act precluded from contesting that the capital sum of $5,397,503.13 does not include all the sums which it is plain by the Act that it does, namely, all the amounts which the payments made to them for half-yearly subsidies from the 1st July, 1867, to the 1st January, 1873, inclusive fell short of the full amounts which would have been payable if no deductions had been authorized and made.\nIn taking the accounts now under consideration both the Dominion and the provinces respectively must rest upon and abide by the Act of 1884, and each party does profess to rest upon and abide by such Act, but each contends that it is the contention of the other which alone departs from the provisions of the Act. I must confess that in my opinion the respondents alone are open to that imputation.\nThe Act in fact removes all necessity for any consideration now of the amounts of the several deductions or of the times when such deductions were made respectively, and an inquiry whether or not any such deductions were illegally made is not called for. In the account being taken on the arbitration no deductions were chargeable by the Dominion to the provinces, nor was any sought to be charged; and as the Act of 1884 was plainly passed for the purpose of compensating, and does compensate the provinces for all sums which the half-yearly subsidies paid to them between the 1st July, 1867, and the 1st of January, 1873, inclusive, fell short of the amounts which would have been payable to them if the sum of $73,600,088.84 had been inserted in the 112th section of the British North America Act instead of $62,500,000; and as the account between the provinces and the Dominion must be taken in conformity with the directions of said provisions of that Act; all inquiry as to the times when the several amounts deducted were so deducted, and whether any of the deductions made was made at a time not authorized by the British North America Act, is now wholly immaterial and irrelevant. The contention of the respondents is that the 118th section of the British North America Act did not authorize the deduction to have been made, which in fact was made, from the first half-yearly instalment of subsidy which was paid in July, 1867. They insist that such deduction operated as a payment of interest by the provinces to the Dominion six months in advance of its becoming due although half-yearly interest accrued due in July, 1867, upon the public debt of Canada, which the Dominion Government had to pay in that month; and further, they contend that the Act of 1884 is to be taken as compensating the provinces for eleven gales only of half-yearly interest deducted from the subsidies which, as the respondents contend, is all that could have been deducted legally between the 1st of July, 1867, and the 1st of January, 1873, inclusive, and therefore they now claim that in the account which is being taken between them and the Dominion they are entitled to charge the Dominion Government with the sum of $262,652.22 and interest thereon from the 1st of July, 1867. But as already shown the Act of 1884 in point of fact made compensation to the provinces for all that was in fact deducted, which as is not disputed, was twelve half-yearly gales of interest on excess of debt, the contention of the provinces if it should prevail would give them the return of thirteen gales of half-yearly interest with interest thereon as compensation for twelve which were in point of fact deducted. Such a construction is plainly at variance with the express intent of the Act of 1884, in accordance with the provisions of which Act, as already stated, the account must be taken. This contention could only be urged if the Act of 1884 had never been passed, but even in that case the construction of the British North America Act which is insisted upon, namely, that nothing could be deducted by section 118 of the Act from the half-yearly subsidies payable to the provinces until the expiration of six months from the 1st day of July, 1867, and then as for interest for the first time then accrued due from the provinces to the Dominion as accruing upon a debt found to be due from the provinces to the Dominion upon, and bearing interest from the 1st July, 1867, is in my opinion a narrow and erroneous construction of the Act.\nIn determining when first the deductions authorized by the 118th section of the British North America Act might be made, the whole scope and object of the contract contained in the treaty of union of which the British North America Act, 1867, is but the embodiment must be taken into consideration. By that contract the Dominion Government agreed to assume absolutely as their own debt $62,500,000 of the public debt of the late province of Canada and to pay the public creditors the interest accruing due half-yearly upon so much of that public debt as exceeded the said sum of $62,500,000. The interest so accruing due half-yearly exceeded the sum of 5 per cent per annum. The Dominion Government, however, agreed to pay the whole of such interest accruing half-yearly upon condition that they should have the right of deducting from the half-yearly grants which the Dominion agreed to pay to the provinces half-yearly in advance interest at 5 per cent per annum on so much of the public debt of the said late province of Canada as exceeded the $62,500,000 assumed absolutely by the Dominion. Now as such interest was accruing due in July, 1867, when the first half-yearly subsidy became payable it was necessary and reasonable that the deduction should be made in July, 1867, as in any other half-year. The deduction is not by the 118th section stated to be authorized as for interest upon a debt ascertained to be due from the provinces to the Dominion upon, and bearing interest from, the 1st day of July, 1867, but as interest chargeable on the public debt of (in the case of Ontario and Quebec) the late province of Canada in excess of the amount stipulated in the Act to be assumed absolutely by the Dominion, namely, $62,500,000.\nThe effect of the contention of the respondents prevailing would be to make the Dominion liable to the public creditors of the late province of Canada for the half-yearly interest upon the excess of debt falling due in July, 1867, and to give them no claim against the provinces of Ontario and Quebec in respect of such payment until the expiration of six months; and so likewise in respect of the interest accruing due every half-year upon such excess of debt, and yet not a word is said of allowing interest to the Dominion upon such half-yearly advances.\nBut it is unnecessary to discuss the point further for as already said, in taking the account, as it must be taken under the Act of 1884, the question and the point involved in it have no relevancy.\nIn my opinion the appeal must be allowed with costs and a declaration be made to the effect that in the account being taken the provinces of Ontario and Quebec have no claim or demand whatsoever against the Dominion for any deductions made from their half-yearly subsidies payable to them between the 1st July, 1867, and the 1st January, 1873, inclusive, as all such claims, if ever they had any, are compensated by the provision made in favour of the provinces by the Dominion Act 47 Vic. ch. 4.\nSEDGEWICK, and KING JJ. concurred in the judgment of the Chief Justice.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\n[1] 9 Ch.

Col., being about to purchase goods from G. in Ont. signed, on request of the freight agent of the Northern Pacific Railway Company in British Columbia, a letter to G. asking him to ship goods via Grand Trunk Railway and Chicago & N.W. care Northern Pacific Railway at St. Pauls. This letter was forwarded to the freight agent of the Northern Pacific Railway Company at Toronto, who sent it to G. and wrote to him \u201cI enclose you card of advice and if you will kindly fill it up when you make the shipment send it to me, I will trace and hurry them through and advise you of delivery to consignee.\u201d G. shipped the goods as suggested in this letter deliverable to his own order in British Columbia.\nHeld, affirming the decision of the Court of Appeal, that on arrival of the goods at St. Pauls the Northern Pacific Railway Company was bound to accept delivery of them for carriage to British Columbia and to expedite such carriage; that they were in the care of said company from St. Pauls to British Columbia; that the freight agent at Toronto had authority so to bind the company; and that the company was liable to G. for the value of the goods which were delivered to E. at British Columbia without an order from G. and not paid for.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1], affirming the judgment of the Chancery Division[2] in favour of the plaintiffs. The action was brought to recover from the defendant company the value of goods shipped by plaintiffs at Ingersoll, Ont., to Victoria, British Columbia, and improperly delivered at Victoria to one Evans, the intending purchaser, who did not pay plaintiffs the price. Evans after ordering the goods had, on request of the freight agent of the company at Victoria, written to plaintiffs as follows:\u2014\u201cPlease deliver my shipment of bacon, ordered through Mr. James Mitchell, to be shipped as per tag below,\u201d and the said tag read \u201cmark and ship this freight via Grand Trunk Railway and Chicago and North Western care Northern Pacific Railroad St. Paul. Be particular to mark in full as above.\u201d The freight agent at Victoria sent this letter and tag to one Belcher the freight agent of defendant at Toronto, who wrote to plaintiffs the following letter: \u201cI beg to enclose order from W.W. Evans of Victoria, B.C., for shipment of bacon ordered by that firm through Mr. Jas. Mitchell. I also enclose you card of advice and if you will kindly fill up when you make the shipment send it to me, I will trace and hurry it through and advise you of delivery to consignee.\u201d\nPlaintiffs shipped goods as directed delivering them to the Grand Trunk Railway Company at Ingersoll, to be delivered at Victoria to plaintiffs\u2019 own order. They were delivered to the defendant company at St. Pauls, and forwarded by it to Victoria where, without any order from the plaintiffs, they were delivered to Evans who did not pay plaintiffs for them. Plaintiffs then brought an action against the Northern Pacific Railway Co. for the value of the goods and obtained a verdict at the trial which was affirmed by the Divisional Court and the Court of Appeal.\nMcGregor for the appellants. The contract by the company was with Evans, who alone could sue for breach of it. Moore v. Wilson[3]; Davis v. James[4]. Belcher could only bind the company by a contract relating to its own line. Great Western Railway Co. v. Willis[5]; Mullarkey v. Philadelphia Railroad Co.[6]; and see McMillan v. Grand Trunk Railway Co.[7]\nWells and W. Nesbitt for the respondents referred to Hately v. Merchants\u2019 Despatch Co.[8]; Bristol & Exeter Railway Co. v. Collins[9].\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by:\nKING J.\u2014Any arrangement made at Victoria, B.C., was made with Evans, who was treated as the intended consignee, and his letter of directions to plaintiffs assumes that the latter, as vendor, is to deliver the goods at Ingersoll, Ontario. He accordingly specifies (as proposed by defendants) the route by which they are to be sent, viz., via Grand Trunk and Chicago and N.W.R.R. care Northern Pacific R.R. St. Pauls.\nThis letter of direction was transmitted through defendants\u2019 contracting freight agent at Toronto to the plaintiffs with a letter in which the defendants are made in effect to say:\n\u201cShip your goods as requested to our care, St. Pauls vi\u00e2 our connecting lines, and we will trace and hurry them through and advise you of delivery to consignee.\u201d\nThey thus recognize that while Evans may be the consignee, the shipper may have rights in respect of the goods which would give him an interest in their prompt and safe carriage and delivery.\nUnder English law (differing in this respect from American law) a company receiving goods for carriage to a point beyond its line prim\u00e2 facie contracts for the entire carriage. But it may limit its responsibility to acts or defaults occurring upon its own line, and where this is done it and each carrier in succession comes under an obligation to deliver goods so received to the next carrier. An intending shipper might well feel concerned at being put (as has been expressed) \u201cto the difficult task of ascertaining where any fault of carriage was or of resorting to his legal remedy in a distant state.\u201d This would naturally work to the disadvantage of such a route in competition with one on which through contracts are made.\nAs if recognizing this, defendants as an inducement to the shipper, say: \u201cSend your goods by our connecting lines to our care St. Pauls and we will trace the shipment, expedite the carriage and advise of delivery.\u201d This certainly seems to imply some control over the carriage and delivery, at least after the goods reach the company at St. Pauls.\nThe plaintiffs did not ship goods in pursuance of Evans\u2019s direction, but shipped them to be carried as suggested, deliverable however to their own order at Victoria.\nThe shipping papers contained certain conditions limiting the responsibility of the Grand Trunk Railway, which it is assumed had the effect of confining the responsibility of that company to its own line.\nFrom the correspondence between plaintiffs and Belcher on the day of the shipment, and upon the next day, and from Belcher\u2019s letter to the general freight agent, I think it appears that the shipment as made was treated as though Belcher\u2019s letter of 18th June was applicable to it.\nNow limiting our view to what would take place when the goods reached St. Pauls; would the defendant company be then free to refuse to receive the goods or to delay in receiving them? It seems to me that what took place at Ingersoll bound the company promptly to receive the goods, and to hurry them through and advise of delivery. More than that, I think that the facts show a contract upon shipment at Ingersoll that when the goods so shipped should reach St. Pauls, in ordinary course, they would continue in their care.\nThe route tags were put into the hands of their contracting freight agents by the company to use in the diversion of traffic to their road, and the fair representation involved in them was that their company was the only one concerned in the carriage from St. Pauls onward. This is strengthened by the undertaking to advise of delivery to consignee. I am, therefore, of opinion that in the circumstances, the defendants are responsible for misdelivery.\nAs to Belcher\u2019s authority, it seems to me that if his office of contracting freight agent for Ontario had any significance at all, he could make contracts of this sort. Shippers in Ontario would not be apt to be concerned about local freight rates from St. Pauls to Tacoma. Besides the representation as to the goods being in care of the company after reaching St. Pauls was the direct act of the company itself.\nUpon the whole therefore, I am inclined to think that the appeal should be dismissed.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellants: Bigelow & Smyth.\nSolicitor for respondents: Thomas Wells.\n[1] 21 Ont.

The township was afterwards annexed to the adjoining city and the drain was thereafter used as a common sewer, it being as constructed fit for that purpose. In an action against a householder, who had connected the sewage from his house with said drain, for a nuisance occasioned thereby at its outlet:\nHeld, affirming the decision of the Court of Appeal, Taschereau and Gwynne JJ. dissenting, that sec. 570, in authorizing the construction of a drain \u201cfor draining the property\u201d empowered the township to construct a drain for draining not only surface water, but sewage generally, and the householder was not responsible for the consequences of connecting his house with said drain by permission of the city.\nWhere a by-law provided that no connection should be made with a sewer, except by permission of the city engineer, a resolution of the city council granting an application for such connection on terms which were complied with and the connection made was a sufficient compliance with said by-law.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1], reversing the judgment of the Chancery Division in favour of the plaintiffs and dismissing their action. The action in this case was brought to abate a nuisance to plaintiffs\u2019 property by offensive matter being deposited thereon by drainage from the dwelling houses of the respective defendants. The sewage from the house of the defendant Alexander was carried through a drain constructed when that portion of the city was a separate township, and plaintiffs claimed that such drain could not be used as a common sewer. The defendant Puddicombe had obtained connection with the sewer after the township was annexed to the city, and as to him the contention was that permission to make such connection had not been given by the city engineer as required by a by-law of the city. The facts are more fully stated in the judgments published herewith.\nMcCarthy Q.C. and Fraser for the appellants.\nGibbons Q.C. and Cameron for the respondents.\nThe judgment of the majority of the court was delivered by:\nSEDGEWICK J.\u2014The parties to this action are residents of London, Ontario. In 1883, the plaintiffs owned lots in the township of Westminster, immediately outside of the corporate limits of the city. This portion of the township was all at that time laid off in town lots, with necessary streets and sidewalks, most of the lots having a frontage of eighty-four feet on the street. In the month of July of that year, in pursuance of the provisions of the Consolidated Municipal Act of 1883, a majority in number of the owners of the property affected petitioned the council of the township of Westminster, praying that a sewer be constructed for the purpose of draining the lots on both sides of Bruce Street. This petition having been considered by the council, a by-law was passed granting the prayer of the petition and authorizing its construction in accordance with the report and plans of the engineer, the cost of the work to be paid by moneys borrowed in the first place by the township, but to be recouped by the proceeds of ten annual assessments upon the property benefited pursuant to the provisions of the Act. Under this by-law the drain was constructed, and it has since been paid for by the assessment referred to.\nThe principal question in controversy in this suit is as to whether the residents on both sides of Bruce Street have a right to connect their water-closets with the drain, or whether its use is limited to mere surface water, or in other words, whether it is a common sewer within the meaning of the statute, into which all sewage from the dwelling-houses affected may lawfully be turned, or only a drain limited in its use as above mentioned. Section 482, subsec. 15, of the Act (46 Vic. ch. 18) authorizes the council of every township to pass by-laws for opening and making drains, sewers, or watercourses within the jurisdiction of the council. Section 570 authorizes the council of a township to pass by-laws to provide for the draining of any property which may be benefited thereby, and for assessing the cost thereof upon that property by special rate, and it was under either one or other of these powers, or of both of them, that the work in question was constructed. The contention of the appellants is, that the work in question was not a sewer within the meaning of section 482 (15) but only a drain within the meaning of section 570; that the authority given by the latter section was not sufficient to enable a township council to construct a common sewer, the cost of which might be met by special assessment, and that any work done thereon was limited and confined in its purpose to surface drainage only for agricultural or other similar objects; and in support of this conten- tion they point out that it was by subsequent legislation only that township councils were authorized to construct sewers to be paid for by special assessment. The Municipal Act of 1883 did not particularly define the meaning to be given to the words \u201cdrain\u201d or \u201csewer\u201d as used in that Act, and we cannot of course resort to definitions given to those words in the English statutes relating to drainage, sewerage and other matters connected with public health. The question to be considered is: What is the meaning of the words \u201cfor draining of the property\u201d? In my view these words are wide enough to include the draining of property for all purposes, whether these purposes be agricultural or sanitary. The word \u201cdrain\u201d has no technical or exact meaning; it has, however, a much wider meaning than the word \u201csewer.\u201d A sewer is in every case a drain although a drain is not in every case a sewer. A sewer is, I suppose, that kind of a drain which is constructed in thickly populated areas for the purpose of carrying off, not merely inoffensive surface water, but also foul water, and all excrementitious and other filthy matter. I see no reason why the power given to the council to provide for the draining of any particular property confines that power solely to the draining of inoffensive or surface water. One area may be drained in one way for one purpose, while another area may be drained in another way for other purposes as well. Without possessing the knowledge of a hydraulic or sanitary engineer, in my view it is a matter of common knowledge that in order to properly drain an area of farm land for agricultural purposes, a drain of a cheap and simple character may be all that is necessary, whereas, if that same area is laid off and built upon as a city, town or village, altogether irrespective of the question of incorporation, a drain of a much more expensive character is necessary. In the first case the drain need not be a sewer; in the second case, in order to effectually drain the property it must be a sewer, that is, a structure with capacity to carry off all liquid matter the necessary concomitant of human dwellings which is usually carried off by means of a sewer. I am unable to find any satisfactory reason for narrowing the wide meaning of the word \u201cdrain.\u201d The plaintiff Levi Lewis, himself, in his evidence states that the drain was constructed \u201cfor the purpose of surface water, sewers and cellars,\u201d but not for the drainage of offensive matter from water-closets. There is no authority, it seems to me, for limiting the purposes of the drain. Who is to determine the character of the matter that may be carried off, the degree of its offensiveness or inoffensiveness? The drainage of an area covered by human habitations must, in my judgment, necessarily include the drainage or carrying off from those habitations of all matter that is usually carried off by means of drains or sewers in areas of that description. Some evidence was adduced at the trial to show that it never was intended by the petitioners that their water-closets should be connected with this drain, and this evidence not only impressed the trial judge but seems to have affected the learned judges of the Court of Appeal.\nNeither the petition for the drain nor the by-law itself affords any evidence that such was the object of the drain. If it were to be so limited, either the by-law itself or the plans and specifications of the work which formed part of the by-law, should have made apparent that limited purpose, and no reliance in my view can be placed upon oral testimony, even if admissible, as to its purposes many years after the work was constructed. It appears to me, however, that the evidence is conclusive that the drain was intended to be a drain for all purposes. The petition and the bill refer to it as a sewer. It was precisely the same kind of a drain as had for years before been constructed within the limits of London, adjoining it, for sewage purposes. It was a glazed tile drain, fifteen inches in diameter, with facilities for connecting it with the buildings, lots and dwellings on each side of it. It was deep enough and perfect enough to carry off all the sewage of the locality, and I believe that it was constructed for those purposes\u2014purposes for which it was perfectly adapted.\nIt was in 1888 that the defendant Alexander connected the water-closets in his house on Bruce Street with the drain in question, and from that time until shortly before this action commenced, January, 1894, he had enjoyed it without interruption or objection on the part of any one.\nBy an Act of the legislature of Ontario (chapter 89, of the Acts of 1890) the area through which the drain was built became annexed to and thenceforward formed part of the city of London. From that time until the commencement of this action the authorities of that city in all respects treated the drain in question as one of the city\u2019s common sewers. At the time of the annexation the special assessment for the drain had not been wholly paid; the city authorities collected the balance of it as sewerage rates; the city likewise collected from residents on Bruce Street, water-closet rates, which was a tax for the privilege of draining excrementitious matter through this drain. The city authorities likewise looked after the repair and sanitary conditions of this drain. They flushed it. In addition to this they connected the water-closets in their public buildings with it as well as constructed a new sewer, the outlet of which was this drain. In every respect, so far as I can see, they dealt with it in exactly the same way as they dealt with any other common sewer in the city. All this shows, in my judgment, conclusively, that the drain in question having become the property of the city by virtue of the annexing Act, was considered by it and dealt with as a common sewer, and not as a structure of the limited character and purpose contended for by the appellants; and in my view the judgment of the court below was perfectly right in holding that as between the defendant Alexander and the city, it was a common sewer.\nThere is, however, a by-law of the city which prohibits the property owner from connecting his buildings with a common sewer without the written consent of the city engineer. This by-law can in no way affect the defendant Alexander. There was no such by-law in the township of Westminster either at the time when the drain was built or at the time when he made connection with it. If that connection was lawfully made in 1888, as I think it was, his rights in that regard could not in any way be affected by the by-law referred to. In my judgment, therefore, the defendant Alexander is entitled to succeed upon two grounds: in the first place, because he was lawfully using the drain under his original rights as a property owner; and secondly, because having regard to the action of the city authorities it was at the time of the grievances complained of de facto a common sewer of the city of London and subject to its supervision and control.\nThe case of Ferrand v. Hallas Land and Building Company[2], is an express authority, in support of the defence. Lord Justice Smith there says:\nIt appears to me that if the sewer be vested in the local authority, and the defendants have the sanction of that authority to do what they have done, then this action is not maintainable against them, for if it were, every householder whose house is drained into a sewer, which is vested in, and is under the control of the local authority, would be liable to be proceeded against for what the local authority might do with the sewage which flowed out of the mouth of the sewer, although the householder is unable to direct as to how and in what way such sewage is to be dealt with. It is immaterial who originally constructed the sewer. When once the sewer was vested in the local authority, they are the persons liable for injury caused by the effluent from the sewer, and not the persons who drain into the sewer.\nThe case of the defendant Puddicombe is stronger even than that of the defendant Alexander. The city had constructed a sewer about July, 1892, on Henry Street which emptied into the Bruce Street drain. City by-law number 759 had provided that every lot abutting on a street through which a common sewer ran should be drained into it, and that it should be the duty of the owner to keep the connecting drain between his premises and the common sewer in good repair. It, however, further provided, that no person should connect with such sewer except on previous application in writing to and permission from the city engineer; and it appeared that as a matter of fact no actual application in writing had been made to the city engineer, nor had express permission been given by him to the defendant Puddicombe to make connection with this drain, and the plaintiffs contended that Puddicombe, at all events, had therefore no right to drain his premises into that sewer. But the evidence shows that he applied to the city council for leave to make the connection, and that the city council passed a resolution granting him such permission upon certain terms therein specified. These terms were complied with, and the connection was made, and he has since, as was proved, paid sewage rates and closet rates. I think the by-law has been substantially complied with, and it is not for the plaintiffs at all events to assert the contrary.\nIt is not necessary in this case to discuss at length the question of the liability of the city for the injury of which the plaintiffs complain. If the amount of sewage which overflows upon their property has been appreciably increased by reason of the connection of the Henry Street drain with the Bruce Street drain, and, they have sustained damage beyond that which must be deemed to have been within the contemplation of the township authorities and the plaintiffs themselves at the time of the original construction of the latter drain, then doubtless they have either a cause of action or a claim for compensation against the city, but it does not appear to me necessary to do more than reserve this point.\nAs the case at present stands, in my judgment, the appeal should be dismissed as against both the defendants.\nI have referred to the contention that because, subsequent to the Act of 1882, the Ontario Legislature has by express enactment given to township councils authority to build sewers, the cost of which might be defrayed by special assessment imposed upon the property benefited, the drain in this case cannot be held to be a sewer. But this contention is nothing more than an argument depending for its force upon the circumstances in each case. If we think that the statute of 1882 covers the case, the fact that the legislature has made certain what might before, to some minds, have been doubtful, cannot effect an alteration of that opinion; nor compel us to decide that that opinion must necessarily be erroneous. The amending Act is not declaratory. It has no retroactive operation and while it may indicate some doubt in the mind of the draftsman and even of the legislature as well as to the breadth of the Act amended, it can in no way alter its meaning, and we are bound to give it what we consider its meaning is, independently of and uninfluenced by that doubt. TASCHEREAU J.\u2014I concur in the judgment of Mr. Justice Gwynne.\nGYWNNE J.\u2014The appeal of the plaintiffs, as against the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario in favour of the defendant Puddicombe, must in my opinion be dismissed with costs. At the time of the passing by the municipal council of the corporation of the city of London, in the month of July, 1892, of the by-law 659 for the construction of a tile drain upon and along that part of Henry Street which lies between James Street and Bruce Street both Henry Street and Bruce Street were within the limits of the city of London, and were under the jurisdiction and control of the municipal council of the city corporation. By that by-law the municipal council authorized the construction of a tile drain on Henry Street, between James Street and Bruce Street, at the cost of the parties benefited thereby, under the provisions of sections 612, 616 and 618 of the municipal Act, ch. 184 of the Revised Statutes of Ontario of 1887. The drain so authorized was constructed in the manner usual in the construction of common sewers in the city, and for the purpose of being used as a common sewer, and when constructed was the property of the city corporation and wholly under the control of the city council. By the municipal Act then in force, R.S.O. ch. 184, sec. 466, subsec. 49, et seq. jurisdiction was absolutely vested in the city council to regulate the construction of cellars, sinks, water-closets, privies, and private vaults, and the manner of draining the same, and to make any Regulation for sewerage or drainage that might be deemed necessary for sanitary purposes, and to charge all persons owning or occupying property which is drained into a common sewer (or which is required by any by-law to be so drained) with a reasonable rent for the use of such sewer. A Mr. Abraham Puddicombe, father of the defendant, R.W. Puddicombe, owns property on Henry Street which is benefited by the Henry Street sewer, and as a person so benefited was assessed for the construction thereof under the provisions of the said sections of the municipal Act in that behalf. The defendant, R.W. Puddicombe, occupies a house situate, not on Henry Street, but on the corner of James Street and a road called the Wortley Road, adjoining his father\u2019s property situate on Henry Street, and he applied to the city council for permission to connect a drain from his house with the sewer on Henry Street through his father\u2019s drain, the one opening from the drain on his father\u2019s property into the Henry Street sewer serving for both of them, and he deposited with the city treasurer the sum of ten dollars for such permission to connect with his father\u2019s drain, undertaking at the same time to the effect mentioned in a receipt given to him by the city treasurer for such sum which is in the terms following:\n$10. London, Ont., Sept. 15th, 1892.\nReceived from R.W. Puddicombe the sum of ten dollars (being nominal rental commuted) for the use of Henry Street sewer for the property leased by him on the Wortley Road, Mr. Puddicombe agreeing not to oppose the construction of a sewer on Wortley Road opposite the property occupied by him, if at any future time the property owners in that neighbourhood petition for one.\nSgd.

POPE,\nTreasurer.\nThis receipt would seem to have been given in pursuance of a report of a committee of the city council adopted by the city council on a day not stated in the appeal case, but the report is given, and is as follows:\nReport No. 2 Committee City Council.\u2014That Mr. R.W. Puddicombe be granted permission to connect with Henry Street drain from his property on Wortley Road on agreeing to pay a nominal rent for said privilege to be fixed by city engineer and on promising not to oppose the construction of a drain on Wortley Road fronting property, at present occupied by him. Upon the 9th of January, 1893, the city council passed another by-law No. 759, \u201crelating to sewerage and draining, and to provide for an annual sewer rental in certain cases,\u201d whereby it was enacted\u2014\n1. Every lot or parcel of land abutting on any street in the city through which a common sewer runs and which is opposite to such common sewer shall be drained into it, and it shall be the duty of the owner and occupier of every lot or parcel of land which is drained into such common sewer to cause the connecting drain between his premises and such common sewer to be in good repair. 2. No person shall connect any drain from his premises with any common sewer now made or constructed within the city, or with any private drain whereby his premises will be drained into any such common sewer, except on previous application in writing to and permission by the city engineer, and except there is first placed in the hands of the city treasurer a deposit of ten dollars in case of a macadamized street and fifty dollars in case of a paved street, as a guarantee to be used in the repair of the sewer or street, providing the work is not done without injury thereto. Such deposit to remain in the treasurer\u2019s hands for six months, and all such excavations and connections shall be made under zthe supervision of the city engineer or such other officer or person as committee No. 2 shall appoint, and if such officer or person be other than the city engineer, he shall be paid for his services by the person on whose behalf the said connection is made.\nNow, upon the assumption that for the consideration of ten dollars so paid by way of commutation of rental the defendant Puddicombe had the permission of the city council to connect a drain from his house with his father\u2019s said drain, he did make such connection, and thereby water-closet matter was conveyed into his father\u2019s drain. Whether the connection was made in such a manner as to be binding upon the corporation as between them and the defendant is a matter with which the plaintiffs had nothing to do, and with which we are not at present concerned. When the connection was made does not appear; it was made, however, before the 17th November, 1893, upon which day the injury of which the plaintiffs complain was committed in manner following. Upon that day the officers of the city corporation flushed certain drains within the city, and among those the drain in Bruce Street with which their sewer in Henry Street was as aforesaid connected and thereby washed clean the Bruce Street drain, and in so doing forced a great quantity of water-closet filth down the drain and deposited it upon property of the plaintiffs near to their dwelling\u2011house, thus causing a grievous and offensive nuisance to the plaintiff. Now the whole contention of the plaintiffs as regards the defendant Puddicombe, is that neither the corporation of the city of London, nor any individual had any right to cause water-closet filth to pass into and through the Bruce Street drain, and that as the defendant Puddicombe\u2019s drain connects a water-closet on his premises with his father\u2019s drain, which connects with the Henry Street drain which was constructed by the corporation so as to connect with the Bruce Street drain, the defendant is a person who is liable to the plaintiffs as a party contributing to the wrong done to them by the flushing of the drains by the corporation officers on the 17th November, 1893, and by the stuff falling into the Henry Street drain being still carried down through the Bruce Street drain upon the premises of the plaintiffs, so as to cause a nuisance to them. The whole damage of which the plaintiffs complain, in so far as Puddicombe is concerned, is caused by the act of the city corporation alone in connecting as they have done by by-law their Henry Street drain with the drain in Bruce Street, and for that act, if it be wrongful, the corporation alone are responsible. The defendant was no party to it and is under no responsibility in respect of it. In view of the constitutional character of these municipal institutions, and the absolute jurisdiction and control given to city municipalities over sewage and drainage within their several municipalities, the corporation of the city of London can alone be made responsible for the connection, so as aforesaid authorized by by-law, and if in the exercise of their jurisdiction they have been guilty of any actionable wrong by making the connection, they and not the defendant Puddicombe must answer for it. There is no connection between the wrongful act of the corporation, assuming it to be wrongful, and the act of the defendant Puddicombe in connecting his drain with his father\u2019s drain, which in the circumstances under which that connection was made as aforesaid was, in so far at least as the plaintiffs are concerned, perfectly lawful. There needs no authority to be cited in support of this proposition, but if any be necessary the principle laid down in Ferrand v. Hallas Land & Building: Co.[3], upon which the Court of Appeal in Toronto proceeded is sufficient. As against the defendant Puddicombe, therefore, the appeal must be dismissed with costs.\nThe case of the defendant Alexander gives rise to somewhat different considerations. He has a drain which connects a water-closet on his premises on Bruce Street directly into the Bruce Street drain; that drain was constructed in 1883, in the township of Westminster, outside of the city of London, under a by-law of the municipal council of the township, passed under secs. 570 and 571 of 48 Vic. ch. 18, upon the petition of the plaintiffs and others, owners of land to be benefited by the drain. The drain authorized by the by-law was expressed to be a sewer for draining the lots on both sides of Bruce Street, which lots, by the engineer\u2019s report incorporated in the by-law, were shown to be 59 building lots, whose frontages on Bruce Street, were of dimensions varying from 42 to 84 feet in width. The locality, although in the township of Westminster, just outside of the city of London, was then a suburb of the city, and has since by an Act passed in 1890 been made part of the city. The drain so authorized was a 15-inch glazed tile drain, with 14 gully holes in the street, itself, and was of a character and dimensions in every respect suitable and proper for a public and common sewer in a street in a city, save only that it wanted the most essential requisite, namely, a suitable and proper outlet of a sewer into and through which the offensive and nuisance creating matter from sinks and water-closets and such like filth is intended to pass. It is upon the evidence clear, I think beyond all doubt, that notwithstanding the capacity of the sewer, it never was contemplated by the persons petitioning for it, nor intended by the municipal council which authorized its construction, that it should be the receptacle of filth proceeding from water-closets. The plaintiffs, who were among the petitioners, never contemplated consenting, and in point of fact never did consent, to their premises being made a place of deposit of such filth. Moreover, when constructed, the sewer was the property of the township municipality, and the township council had not vested in them the jurisdiction which by 46 Vic. ch. 18, sec. 496, subsecs. 39 and 40, was vested in the councils of cities, towns and incorporated villages for regulating sinks, water-closets, privies, and privy vaults, and the manner of draining the same. That jurisdiction was first vested in township municipalities by ch. 184, sec. 489, subsec. 47, R.S.O., 1887, and, indeed, assuming township councils to have had such jurisdiction in 1883 over water-closets, &c., and the manner of draining them, they would not have been authorized, even by by-law, to commit the wrong to the plaintiff of depositing filth from water-closets upon his premises in such a manner as to create a nuisance to him. We need not go further back than Humphries v. Cousins[4], for the doctrine that it is prim\u00e2 facie the right of every occupier of a piece of land to enjoy that land free from all invasion of filth or other matter coming from any artificial structure on land adjoining; He may be bound by prescription or otherwise to receive such matter, but the burthen of showing that he is so bound rests upon those who seek to impose the easement upon him. Now there is nothing in the municipal institutions Acts of Ontario, or any Act, which ever authorized the committal of such a nuisance as that of which the plaintiff complains. In Attorney General v. Colney Hatch Lunatic Asylum[5], Lord Hatherley said that he entertained a very strong opinion, that when a nuisance is established all the court has to do is to say that it must cease, unless at least that be physically impossible, in which case the party must be left to his remedy by an action for damages. In Charles v. Finchley Local Board[6], the law is approved as it is laid down in the last edition of Addison on Torts, by Mr. Justice Cave, in these words:\nWhere a person who is entitled to a limited right, exercises it in excess so as produce a nuisance, and the nuisance cannot be abated without obstructing the enjoyment of the right altogether, the exercise of the right may be entirely stopped until means have been taken to reduce it within its proper limits. \u201cThus if a man,\u201d says Baron Alderson, \u201chas a right to send clear water through my drain and chooses to send dirty water, every particle of water may be stopped because it is dirty.\u201d\nAnd in that case a local board was restrained by injunction from discharging or permitting to be discharged sewage or other offensive matter into a watercourse, so as to create a nuisance to the plaintiff, although it appeared that the nuisance was in fact caused by a person not a party to the action, who had passed the sewage from his house into a watercourse opposite the plaintiff\u2019s house, by a pipe which by agreement with the defendants he was only entitled to use for surface or rain water.\nIn Lewis v. The City of Toronto[7], the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench in Ontario held, that it is not in the power of a municipal corporation to pass a by-law which would legalize the acts complained of in that case in the manner in which they were done, namely, the piling large quantities of filthy rubbish so near to a cellar of the plaintiff as to cause filthy water, earth and stuff to flow into his cellar and into his well.\nIn Van Egmond v. Seaforth[8], the municipal corporation of the town of Seaforth were restrained by injunction from letting foul water from salt-works of a third person to pass through a sewer constructed by the corporation into a stream passing through the plaintiff\u2019s land.\nNow, it cannot be doubted that a person aggrieved has his remedies against all persons contributing to causing him the injury of which he complains. It is necessary, therefore, to consider whether the defendant Alexander contributes in any, and if any what, manner to the injury of which the plaintiffs complain. In 1885 he purchased one of the lots on Bruce Street for the benefit of which the Bruce Street drain was constructed. In 1888 he apparently made some arrangement with the city of London Waterworks Company under the provisions of 45 Vic. ch. 25, sec. 28, for the supply of water to his dwelling-house, and he applied that water supply to a water-closet in his house, and carried the filth therefrom into the Bruce Street sewer, for which disposal of such filth he had no authority in law, and he thereby no doubt in some measure contributed to the nuisance caused to the plaintiffs by the flushing of the sewer by the city corporation in 1893. By an Act of the legislature of Ontario, passed on the 7th April, 1890, 53 Vic. ch. 89, that part of the township of Westminster whereon was the locality for draining, which the Bruce Street sewer had been constructed in 1883, was incorporated with and made part of the city of London, and thereby the sewer in Bruce Street became the property of the city of London in the same condition and character as it was held by the municipality of the township of Westminster, but subject for the future to the exercise by the municipal council of the city of London of their legal jurisdiction over it as conferred by statute. They have passed no by-law since having the effect of subjecting the sewer to an obligation to which it was not subject when the property of the municipality of the township of Westminster, namely, to be the receptacle of water-closet filth, nor have they done any act to remove the nuisance to the plaintiffs which the passing of such filth through it creates with its outlet as at present existing. The conduct of the defendant Alexander therefore in using the sewer for the purpose of carrying off the filth from his water\u2011closet is still as illegal as it was while the property in the sewer was vested in the municipality of the township of Westminster, and although the damage done thereby to the plaintiff may be, and no doubt is, very trifling as compared with the damage caused by the connection by the city corporation of other sewers in the city with the Bruce Street sewer, as the conduct of the defendant Alexander is not shown to be authorized by any law and contributes to the nuisance caused to the plaintiffs, the plaintiffs are entitled to the injunction against him as granted by the learned trial judge. The appeal must therefore be allowed with costs, and that judgment as against the defendant Alexander restored; while for their substan- tial redress of the wrongs of which the plaintiffs complain they must be left to their remedy against the city corporation.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Fraser & Fraser.\nSolicitors for the respondent Puddicombe: Gibbons, McNab & Mulkern.\nSolicitors for the respondent Alexander: Meredith, Cameron, Judd & Dromgole.\n[1] 21 Ont.

Gwynne J. dissenting.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1], affirming the judgment of the Divisional Court[2] in favour of the plaintiff.\nThe action in this case was for damages in consequence of plaintiff being ejected from a street railway car to which he had been transferred from another car where he had paid his fare. After being ejected he went back to the transfer agent and had to wait some time for another car in order to reach his destination, and on leaving the latter car he called at a hotel on a matter of business and then walked home, the walk occupying twenty minutes. It was a very cold night and the next day he had an attack of bronchitis and rheumatism which confined him to the house for some weeks.\nAt the trial the jury, under the direction of the judge, severed the damages, allowing $200 for the ejectment and $300 for the subsequent illness. The defendant company paid the $200 and appealed against the other assessment, contending that there was not sufficient evidence of the illness being the natural and probable result of the ejectment and that it was too remote a cause of damage. The verdict was sustained by the Divisional Court and the Court of Appeal.\nBicknell for the appellants, argued that the damages were too remote, citing Williamson v. The Grand Trunk Railway Co.[3]; Hobbs v. London & South Western Railway Co.[4]; The Notting Hill[5].\nMcWhinney for the respondent, referred to Brisbane v. Martin[6]; McMahon v. Field[7]; Town of Prescott v. Connell[8]; York v. The Canada Atlantic Steamship Co.[9]\nThe judgment of the majority of the court was delivered by:\nKING J.\u2014The question in this case is as to the remoteness of damages. The plaintiff sued to recover damages for having been wrongfully put off a street car in the city of Toronto. The defendants\u2019 line has connecting branches. Plaintiff took a car on the main division and paid his fare, which entitled him to travel over the entire route. At the point where the branch line intersects, he got off and the servant of the company stationed there for the purpose of effecting transfers directed him into the car on the branch line. After starting upon the new route and proceeding several blocks, the conductor demanded his fare, and disputed his statement that he had been duly transferred. This led to an altercation, the conductor charging plaintiff with cheating, and the plaintiff in reply using very strong language. He had other tickets in his pocket, but he stood upon his rights, and finally was required by the conductor and driver to leave the car. He alleges that by reason of what had occurred, he was before leaving the car in a state of profuse perspiration. The night was one of extreme severity, but it is not suggested that plaintiff was inadequately clothed and the inference is otherwise, as he contemplated being upon the road twenty minutes after reaching the end of the car route.\nWhen put off the car he went back to the point where he had taken the branch car, and complained of what had been done, and waited for the next car. He says that after waiting in the open air (the company providing no shelter at the point of transfer) for about twenty minutes, the branch line car came along and he was allowed to get in it as a transfer passenger and so travelled to the end of the route without further pay. There he left the car and after going to a hotel on business walked home. This occupied twenty minutes, and by the time he got home it was about 11 o\u2019clock. He then felt that he had caught a severe cold. The next day he was feverish and went to his work but was not able to remain, and on the day following was found to be affected with bronchitis and rheumatism, by which he was confined to the house for several weeks and kept from work for a period considerably longer. As to the origin of his illness, he stated that he caught cold during the affair, and the physician who attended him being examined as to the effect of what took place, said that a person excited and over- heated and going out into the cold air would be apt to suffer from some inflammatory trouble, and that such condition and exposure together would be sufficient to induce chronic bronchitis and rheumatism.\nUpon the trial the learned judge asked the jury to separate between the damages for the assault and expulsion and the damages in respect of the illness, telling them that they might give damages of the latter kind if they should think that the illness was the natural or probable result of defendants\u2019 act. The jury found for the plaintiff, awarding $200 for the assault, &c., and $300 in respect of the illness. The Divisional Court upheld the verdict as did the Court of Appeal, Hagarty C.J. dissenting, the learned Chief Justice basing his dissent upon the case of Hobbs v. London & South Western Railway Co.[10]\nThe only question in this appeal is as to the damages in respect of the illness. Two questions appear to be involved: First, whether the re\\covery is precluded by reason of any established rule of law; and secondly, whether the conclusion of fact is so entirely without substantial support from the evidence as to be wholly unreasonable. As to the first point, the appellant contends that the right that was interfered with was one of contract, and that as the illness was not reasonably contemplated by the parties at the time of entering into the contract as a probable consequence of the breach, it was not a subject of compensation.\nWhen one, whether in performance of a contract or not, takes charge of the person or property of another, there arises a duty of reasonable care. Foulkes v. Metropolitan District Railway Co.[11] And if by his own act he creates circumstances of danger and subjects the person or property to risk without exercising reasonable care to guard against injury or damage, he is re- sponsible for such injury and damage to the person or property as arises as the direct or natural and probable consequence of the wrongful act.\nIt would indeed be startling to learn that bronchitis and rheumatism follow as a natural and probable result upon the putting a man suitably clothed off a car in the streets of Toronto in any kind of weather. The natural and probable result would not be different whether he is put off or gets off of his own accord, or whether he gets off during the trip or at the end of the route. But whatever of strength there is in plaintiff\u2019s case lies in this, that, according to him, he was at the time he was put off the car, and as the result of the defendants\u2019 conduct, in a bodily state which predisposed him to receive physical injury as the result of his being suddenly exposed to the very low temperature that then prevailed.\nThe circumstances intervening between the act complained of and the illness are all in evidence, and there is the uncontradicted statement of the physician that the act of exposure operating upon a person in an excited and overheated state would be sufficient to induce such an illness. If this is so, it follows that the plaintiff was subjected to the risk of such illness by the unlawful act of the defendants. They created the circumstances of damage for him and subjected him to the risk. Then as to the connection between their act and plaintiff\u2019s illness, it was for the jury to examine the entire circumstances, in order to see if there was any intervening independent cause. Finding none, sufficient to satisfy them, they were entitled to refer the illness to the only thing referred to in the evidence as a sufficing cause.\nThere was in such case, evidence from which they might conclude either that the act of the defendants was the direct cause or that it was the efficient cause, the causa causans followed by the illness as the natural and probable result without the intervention of any independent cause.\nI share in the doubts that have been expressed by the Court of Appeal in England, respecting the conclusiveness of the reasoning in Hobbs v. London & South Western Railway Co.[12], but this case does not rest upon like facts and admits of decision independently of it.\nI therefore think that the appeal should be dismissed.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014The plaintiff\u2019s cause of action, as stated in his statement of claim, is that upon the night of the 10th January, 1893, which was an intensely cold night, he became a passenger, for a fare duly paid, upon the Toronto Street Railway to be carried along Queen Street to Spadina Avenue, and thence by Spadina Avenue to King Street, and along King Street to the corner of Simcoe Street which was his destination; that by the regulations of the company and by virtue of their agreement with the corporation of the city of Toronto, subject to which they enjoyed their franchise, he was entitled, by notifying the conductor of the car which he had entered on Queen Street of his desire, to be transferred at the corner of Queen Street and Spadina Avenue into a car going south along Spadina Avenue and King Street to Simcoe Street; that he did so notify such conductor of the car on Queen Street; that such conductor upon arriving at Spadina Avenue placed the plaintiff in charge of an agent of the defendants stationed there for the purpose of looking after the passengers requiring to be transferred there, from one line to the other; that such transfer agent did duly transfer the plaintiff to a Spadina Avenue car running south, and advised the conductor of that car that the plaintiff was a transfer passenger; that the conductor of this lat- ter car, notwithstanding, demanded a fare from the plaintiff, and upon the plaintiff informing him that he was a transfer passenger refused to recognize him as such, and upon the plaintiff persisting that he was and refusing to pay a fare assaulted the plaintiff and ejected him from the car; that thereupon he returned to the transfer agent at the corner of Queen Street and Spadina Avenue, who told the plaintiff that he had informed the conductor of the car on Spadina Avenue which the plaintiff had entered that he the plaintiff was a transfer passenger; that owing to having been so wrongfully removed from the car he was compelled to stand in the street and wait for another car for nearly half an hour, and in so doing contracted a severe cold which resulted in an attack of bronchitis and rheumatism, by which he was kept in-doors for several weeks.\nNow the evidence given by the plaintiff upon this claim is that upon paying his fare by handing to the conductor one of several railway tickets of the defendants which the plaintiff had he told him that he wanted to be transferred at Spadina Avenue to a car going south; that upon getting off at Spadina Avenue the conductor signalled to the transfer agent that the plaintiff was a transfer; that plaintiff waited ten minutes before a car going south came down, when being told by the transfer agent that this was his car he got on to it, and there met a person with whom he was well acquainted who was also a passenger, and they spoke to each other; that in conversation with his friend the plaintiff said to him that he, the plaintiff, was a transfer; that the conductor who was standing close by thereupon said to plaintiff, \u201cNo, you are not,\u201d to which plaintiff replied, \u201cI am,\u201d whereupon a discussion arose between plaintiff and the conductor who threatened plaintiff to put him off the car unless he should pay his fare, which plaintiff refused to do; that the conductor then took him by the arm, and turned him round saying that he, plaintiff, would have to get off; that they continued in discussion, but eventually as the plaintiff says, wishing to avoid a row, he thought he had better get off, and he went out of the car. The conductor of this car unfortunately had gone to England, so that we have not his testimony of what occurred. We have, however, the evidence of the plaintiff\u201ds friend whom he met upon the car, whose account of what occurred is as follows. He says that while the car was in motion crossing Queen Street on its course south, the plaintiff came in to the car seemingly in a great hurry and cold, and seeing witness said to him, \u201cHow are you;\u201d the car went on and when they got close to Adelaide Street, that is the next street west north of King Street, the conductor came collecting tickets. Witness then said to plaintiff, \u201cI am a poor unfortunate and have only five cents or I would pay your fare,\u201d to which the plaintiff replied, \u201cThat is all right, old man, I am a transfer,\u201d whereupon the conductor said to him, \u201cYou are not,\u201d to which he replied \u201cI am,\u201d and the conductor again replied, \u201cYou are not,\u201d and said that he would have to stop the car and put him off; witness said that then the plaintiff looked to him and asked him what he should do, and witness told him that he should pay his fare, take the numbers of the car and the conductor and report the matter to the company. He says thereupon there was a little talk, the car was stopped and plaintiff went off it himself\u2014this is all, he says, that occurred. Now it is to be borne in mind that at this time the plaintiff, by his own evidence, had at least three railway tickets one of which would have paid his fare.\nAs to what took place when he left the car the plaintiff\u2019s evidence is that he went back to the transfer agent and told of his being turned off the car and asked him, \u201cDid you tell that conductor there were no transfers, no passengers\u201d and that he said he did not. That plaintiff then waited 20 minutes for a car going south upon which he was put by the transfer agent and was taken to the corner of King and Simcoe Street, where he left the car and went to the Avondale Hotel, which is on Simcoe Street. As to this evidence all that is necessary to say is\u2014that it is wholly contradicted by the transfer agent, who says never to his knowledge did he see the plaintiff until he saw him in court at the trial, and that certainly he never came and conversed with him as the plaintiff said he did on the said 10th January\u2014he denied it utterly, saying that if any such a thing had occurred as stated by the plaintiff he certainly would have remembered it, and he added that there never was such a delay as 20 minutes interval between the cars running on Spadina Avenue crossing Queen Street, that at the time in question, January, 1893, they arrived there every six minutes. This is the whole of the evidence as to the alleged assault and eviction from the car and upon it the jury have rendered a verdict for $200 damages. This verdict illustrates in a significant manner what little consideration companies like the defendants receive at the hands of juries, when an individual, even upon the most trifling and conflicting evidence, brings an action upon the ground that a servant of the company even innocently commits to the prejudice of the plaintiff the slightest infraction of law, but it may be added that even in cases of this description a plaintiff is seldom so fortunate as to succeed in realizing the sum of $200 out of the saving of a few cents. However, the defendants have submitted to this verdict so far and have paid the $200, but what the defendants appeal against is that the jury have given a further sum of $300 for the illness which the plaintiff complained of as having been suffered by him. Upon this point the learned judge who tried the case charged the jury that if they should find that the plaintiff\u2019s illness was the natural and probable result of his having been turned out of the car on that night, they should give the plaintiff damages upon that ground as well. He said that whether or not he was entitled to such damages might be a question of law and he therefore directed them, in order to avoid the necessity for a new trial, to keep the two heads separate and divide the damages, if any, they should give as follows:\u20141st. For the plaintiff having been turned out of the car and the trouble and inconvenience in waiting for the second car. 2nd. For the plaintiff\u2019s illness and his having to incur expenses in order to recover from the illness. Now, the evidence upon which this charge was given as effects the $300 awarded by the jury, besides the evidence of the plaintiff of his having walked back from the place where he was put off the car near Adelaide Street to Queen Street, and of the conversation which he said he had there with the transfer agent, but which the latter denied, and of his having waited there in the street for 20 minutes for another car going south, he further said that the car on which he then got took him to the corner of King and Simcoe Streets, where he got out as he wanted to call at the Avondale Hotel on Simcoe Street for letters, that finding none there he walked home to Toronto Street, which occupied he says 20 minutes more. Then the doctor who attended him during his illness says that what he was suffering from was chronic bronchitis and rheumatism, and he added that a little inflammation or severe cold might ensue upon exposure to cold upon the night of the 10th January, 1893, as spoken of by the plaintiff, that the effect would be different on different persons, that the exposure as spoken of by the plaintiff might be sufficient to induce chronic bronchitis and rheumatism, that a person who was very much excited and thereby over-heated going out into the cold air would be apt to suffer from some inflammatory trouble. This was the whole of the evidence upon which the learned judge charged the jury that if they should be of opinion that the illness of the plaintiff was the natural and probable result of his eviction from the car in the manner above detailed in evidence, they might give damages independently of and apart from the damages they should give for the plaintiff being obliged to leave the car under the circumstances in evidence. Upon this charge the jury have given the $300 in addition to the $200, and it is against the recovery of this sum of $300 by the plaintiff that this appeal is taken, the verdict of the jury having been maintained by all the courts in Ontario.\nI entirely concur in the dissenting judgment of the learned Chief Justice of Ontario in the Court of Appeal for Ontario, to the effect that this case is governed by Hobbs v. London & South Western Railway Co.[13], which is as good law now as ever it was, and is not nor was intended to be overruled by McMahon v. Field[14], and is conclusive that damages of the nature of that for which the jury have accorded the $300 were altogether too remote to be recoverable in this action. To what is said by the learned Chief Justice of Ontario, I desire merely to add that there is nothing in the evidence which in my opinion at all warranted the submission of the case to the jury in the manner in which it was submitted, or their finding upon the matter as so submitted. The medical expert gave no evidence to the effect that, nor could any reasonable person conscientiously say that, the illness of the plaintiff was the natural and probable result of the conduct of the defendants\u2019 servant in requiring the plaintiff to leave the car if he would not pay his fare when demanded, which, apart from the technical assault committed, according to the plaintiffs\u2019 own evidence, was all that the defendants\u2019 servant did, any more than that the illness was the natural and probable result of the plaintiff\u2019s own perverse, wilful and insensate conduct in electing, contrary to the advice of his own friend, to leave the car in preference to parting with one of the street railway tickets which he had in his possession wherewith he could have paid the five cents demanded, and in exposing himself to the intense cold of the night for full fifty minutes according to his own evidence\u2014first in walking back from Adelaide Street to Queen Street, then in standing there for 20 minutes and spending further 20 minutes in walking home from Simcoe Street where he left the car which conveyed him there. This choice of the plaintiff so to expose himself to the cold of that severe night in preference to parting with a five cent railway ticket is an element in the case which cannot be, although it has been, overlooked. The appeal must, in my opinion, be allowed with costs, and the judgment left to stand for the $200 damages against which the defendants have not appealed.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Laidlaw, Kappele & Bicknell.\nSolicitors for respondent: McWhinney, Ridley & Co.\n[1] 21 Ont.

He can be in no worse position than if he had looked and seen that there was time to cross. Gwynne J. dissenting.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1], affirming the judgment of the Divisional Court in favour of the plaintiff.\nThe action in this case was brought in consequence of a street railway car having run into plaintiff\u2019s cart which he was driving across the track whereby he was thrown out and hurt, and the cart badly damaged. The company denied the negligence charged in the driving of their car, and alleged that plaintiff was himself negligent in not looking to see if a car was approaching before going on the track. There was evidence that the car which struck the plaintiff\u2019s cart was going at an excessive rate of speed, and the jury so found and they found that plaintiff could have crossed if the car had been driven moderately, and that he was not guilty of contributory negligence. The verdict was sustained by the Divisional Court and by the Court of Appeal.\nOsler Q.C. and Laidlaw Q.C. for the appellants.\nFullerton Q.C. for the respondent.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE concurred in the judgment of\nMr. Justice King.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014The appeal in this case is from the unanimous judgment of the Court of Appeal, upholding a unanimous judgment of the Common Pleas Division, which maintained the verdict and judgment obtained against this company. The appellants would contend that they are not bound by any particular rate of speed, that they can go as fast as they please, that persons entering upon, crossing, or otherwise using portions of any roadway covered by their tracks do so at their own peril, caveat viator. These astounding propositions, it is not surprising, have not found the assent of a single judge out of the eight who had to pass on the case in the courts below, and it is not complimentary to this court, that the appellants must be assumed to have believed that we might here countenance their contentions. They were wrong, however, and they will have to abandon such unreasonable claims, and act accordingly in the future.\nThere was ample evidence for the jury that the cars were going at an unreasonable rate of speed. In fact, I should say, the evidence is overwhelming on the point. Their finding that the plaintiff was not guilty of contributory negligence is also one that we cannot interfere with, more especially after the concurrent approval of those findings by the two courts below. These street railway companies must remember that they have not the exclusive right of way, and that the private traveller in the streets of the city is justified in assuming that the cars will be kept under control and driven moderately and prudently.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014The impression left upon my mind from the consideration of this case is, that if this judgment should be maintained and should this become a precedent to govern future cases it is quite illusory for the defendants to expect to be able to set up a successful defence to any action brought against them for injury to an individual sustained by collision with one of their cars in motion. With the judgment of the learned Chief Justice of Ontario I entirely concur that there was no case to go to a jury apart from the evidence of the witness who testified that in his opinion immediately before the accident and at the distance of about 80 or 90 yards from where it occurred, the railway car which came into collision with the plaintiff\u2019s wagon was going at the rate of twenty miles an hour\u2014and I must say that I find it difficult to understand how any jury should adopt the evidence of that witness, who admits that he neither saw the accident occurring, nor the plaintiff with his wagon upon the track at all, in the face of all the other testimony in the case given by persons who had the best possible opportunity of observing and who did observe the movements of the plaintiff and of the defendants\u2019 car from the moment of the plaintiff entering with his wagon upon the railway track until the accident. But while I so concur in the judgment of the learned Chief Justice of Ontario, I am of opinion that this case does not turn upon a question as to the rate of speed at which the railway car was going immediately preceding the occurrence of the accident, but rather upon the conduct of the plaintiff himself in entering upon the railway track at the time he did; and indeed the rate of speed at which the railway car was moving, assuming it to have been excessive, would seem to me to make the conduct of the plaintiff in entering upon the railway track just in front of a car going at such excessive speed only the more inexcusable. The evidence is, I think, overwhelming and uncontradicted upon the point that when the plaintiff entered upon the railway track with his wagon the car which came into collision with him was coming down the railway at the distance of 70 or 80 feet behind him. If he had looked in that direction he must have seen it and had he seen it, whatever its rate of speed, his entering upon the track just in front of it would have been inexcusable; and if it was moving at such a rate of speed as is suggested by the one witness who estimated it at thirty miles an hour, that would have supplied a stronger reason why the plaintiff should not have entered upon the railway. As, however, there was but that one witness of several who saw the car in motion who estimated its rate of speed at thirty miles an hour, it is not likely that the plaintiff would have formed such an estimate if he had looked in the direction of the car, but he did not look in that direction at all but blindly incurred the risk, and so he cannot, I think, claim to be in any better position than if he had looked and had seen the car coming down as the other witnesses who have testified did, one of whom swears that immediately upon the plaintiff entering upon the track he called out to him to look out\u2014that the motor was coming, and he adds that as the plaintiff was trying to get off the track and go round a buggy in front of Mr. Prettie\u2019s store, either the horse had not energy enough to get off or the plaintiff had not energy enough to drive him, and so the car struck the hind wheel of the plaintiff\u2019s wagon before he got off and thus the accident occurred. The evidence upon this point of several witnesses who saw the accident occurring may be said to be uncontradicted, and being so establishes, I think, beyond all question that the accident was due to the very inconsiderate, to say the least, conduct of the plaintiff in having entered upon the railway track just in front of a moving railway car\u2014and the more excessive the speed of that car is shown to be the indiscretion of the plaintiff becomes greater in having entered upon the railway track just in front of it. The plaintiff cannot excuse himself by saying that he did not look in the direction of the coming car. Between his not looking, and his entering upon the railway track having seen the car coming as he must have if he had looked, I can see no difference as regards the liability of the defendants in this action. I am of opinion therefore that the appeal should be allowed and the action dismissed as one which under the circumstances should not have been submitted to the jury.\nSEDGEWICK J.\u2014I am of opinion that this appeal should be dismissed for the reasons given in the judgment of Mr. Justice King.\nKING J.\u2014At the time that a collision appeared imminent the position of things was this: The plaintiff\u2019s vehicle, a loaded coal cart, had gone in upon the street railway track for the purpose of passing a team that had just turned into Yonge from Scollard street. The electric car was coming up behind and distant about sixty or seventy feet. According to the defendants\u2019 witnesses, the motor-man in charge of the electric car then put on the brakes and did his best to stop the car. But before the car could be stopped it struck the hind wheel of the plaintiff\u2019s cart which was just about leav- ing the track. It is manifest that in a few moments more the cart would have gone entirely clear. It is proved, by defendants\u2019 witnesses that a car going at the usual rate of speed can be stopped within a space of about thirty-two feet. How then did it happen that this car was not stopped in double that distance although the man in charge was doing his best to stop it? The rail was indeed wet, but, as against this, there was an up grade. The answer is to be found in the evidence of plaintiff\u2019s witnesses that the car was going at an excessive rate of speed and so the jury have found. There is therefore a finding of negligence upon sufficient evidence.\nThen it is contended that there is conclusive proof of contributory negligence on plaintiff\u2019s part. This is said to consist in his not having looked back before going upon the track. But he can be in no worse position than if he had looked back and had seen the car.\nIn the case from the State of New York Hegau v. Eighth Avenue Railroad Co.[2] cited by Mr. Justice Osler, it is well said:\nIt is not unreasonable for the private traveller to assume that the car will be driven moderately and prudently. He can calculate distance and the time required to effect his own change of position in order to prevent injury in such cases.\nThe excessive speed of the car would not be readily discernible by one directly in front and in plaintiff\u2019s position. If he had looked and had seen the car behind him, can we say upon the facts proved that he might not reasonably have calculated that, with the car going at a moderate speed, as he might fairly assume was the case, he would be able to quit the track in time?\nBut further, in cases of this sort, where the public use of a street is concerned, we are to be careful not to fetter the public right by rules of law as to what specifically constitutes reasonable care or the want of it. The matter is essentially one for the jury, and in this case they have negatived want of care on plaintiff\u2019s part.\nThe appeal should therefore be dismissed.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellant: Laidlaw, Kappele & Bicknell.\nSolicitors for respondent: Fullerton, Neville & Wallace.\n[1] 21 Ont.

The evidence was that the snow from the sidewalks was placed on the roadway immediately adjoining by servants of the city and snow from the railway tracks was placed by servants of the railway company upon the roadway immediately adjoining the track without any permission from the city, thus raising the roadway next to the track, where the accident occurred, to a height of about twenty inches above the rails. The jury found that the disrepair of the street was the act of the railway company, which was therefore made liable over to the city for the damages assessed. The company contended on appeal that the verdict was perverse and contrary to evidence.\nHeld, affirming the decision of the Court of Appeal, that under the evidence given of the manner in which the snow from the track had been placed on the roadway immediately adjoining, the jury might reasonably be of opinion that if it had not been so placed there the accident would not have happened, and that this was the sole cause of the accident.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario affirming the judgment of the Queen\u2019s Bench Division in favour of the City of Toronto.\nThe action in this case was brought against the City of Toronto by one Langstaff who claimed compensation for injuries alleged to have been received by him in consequence of one of the streets of the city being out of repair, and the Street Railway Company was brought as third party, the city claiming recourse over against the company for any damages assessed against it in the action. By the evidence at the trial the disrepair of the street was caused by snow having been placed on the roadway from the street railway tracks, and it was shown that snow from the sidewalks was also placed on the roadway. The jury found that the want of repair was caused by the act of the company and plaintiff having obtained a verdict against the city judgment was given for the city against the company for the amount of such judgment. The company appealed and the judgment was sustained by the Divisional Court and the Court of Appeal.\nLaidlaw Q.C. and Bicknell for the appellant.\nFullerton Q.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by:\nGWYNNE J.\u2014This was an action against the City of Toronto for injuries sustained by the plaintiff by reason of a street in the city of Toronto, upon which there is a street railway of the appellants, having been suffered to be in a dangerous condition, arising from a quantity of snow which fell during the winter of 1892-3, having from time to time been taken from the railway track and piled upon the roadway between the railway track and the sidewalk, and the railway company as parties against whom the city corporation if liable claim to have remedy over, have been made defendants as third parties under the provision of the municipal Act in that behalf. The action of the plaintiff against the City of Toronto, and the claim of the City of Toronto over against the railway company were tried together by the same jury. The plaintiff recovered judgment against the City of Toronto, who recovered judgment of indemnity over against the railway company, and it is only against this latter judgment of indemnity that this appeal is taken, and the ground upon which it is rested is, as follows: Among the questions submitted to the jury was the following, which related to the claim of the city to remedy over against the railway company, namely:\n\u201cWas the disrepair caused by the act or acts of either or both of the defendants? If by either, by which of them.\u201d\nTo which the jury answered that it was caused by the street railway company. The appellants now contend that this finding of the jury upon the issue between the City of Toronto and the appellants is ambiguous, perverse, and contrary to the evidence, upon the ground that, as the appellants contend, the evidence in the action established beyond all doubt that the accumulation of snow upon the portion of the street where the accident occurred was caused by the joint acts of the city by the snow thrown from the sidewalk, and of the railway company by the snow from the railway track, and that in such a case, although the railway company could offer no defence to an action by the plaintiff if they had been sued by him, the appellants are not responsible over to the City of Toronto.\nNow by the appellants\u2019 Act of incorporation, 55 Vic. ch. 99, sec. 25, (O.) it is enacted that the company shall not deposit snow, ice or other material upon any street, square, highway or other public place in the city of Toronto, without having first obtained the permission of the city engineer of the said city or the person acting as such. The evidence showed that the space between the railway tracks and the sidewalks was fourteen feet, and that the width of the railway tracks was sixteen feet, and that the railway company had during the winter upon the occasion of every fall of snow piled upon the roadway adjoining the railway track on either side, the snow taken from the railway tracks and thereby raised the roadway immediately adjoining the railway track to the height of about twenty inches above the railway which was kept clear of snow. It was also proved that this piling of the snow by the railway company upon the roadway adjoining the railway track was without any leave of the engineer for that purpose first obtained. It was upon this part of the roadway immediately adjoining the railway track that the accident from which the plaintiff sustained injury happened. It is now contended that as snow from the sidewalk was also put upon the roadway between the sidewalk and the railway track, the snow from the sidewalk together with the snow from the railway track must be regarded as one inseparable accumulation of snow which caused the roadway to be out of repair, and from this it is argued that the finding of the jury that the disrepair which caused the accident was caused by the street railway company was perverse aud contrary to the evidence; but in view of the evidence as to the manner in which the railway company removed the snow from their track and placed it upon the roadway immediately adjoining, the jury may, I think, not unreasonably have been of opinion that if the snow from the railway track had not been placed where it was the accident could not have happened, notwithstanding that the snow from the sidewalk had also been spread on the roadway; and as it was the height of the snow to the elevation of about twenty inches above the railway track immediately adjoining to it which caused the accident, they not unreasonably concluded that the piling of the snow upon the roadway by the railway company was the sole cause of the accident to the plaintiff; and so the appellants\u2019 sole ground of appeal against the finding of the jury upon the above question is removed. The appellants, however, further contend that even admitting the piling of the snow upon the roadway by the railway company to have been the sole cause of the accident to the plaintiff, still they are under no obligation in law to indemnify the city, because they say that the railway company by their solicitors upon the 27th February, 1893, addressed a letter to the city engineer, making proposals which were accepted by the city engineer, as to the removal of snow, ice, &c., from the streets so as to make them reasonably safe for public travel. The effect of this contention is that by the acceptance of such proposals by the city engineer, the city assumed the burthen of removing the snow, &c., so as to make the streets reasonably safe for public travel, &c. The question thus raised is a pure question of law, namely, whether the acceptance by the city engineer of such proposals as were contained in the railway company\u2019s solicitor\u2019s letter could have the effect in law of relieving the railway company from liability to the city arising out of acts then already committed by the railway company in violation of their statutory obligations; but it is unnecessary to consider this question, or to enter into the nature of the proposals so accepted by the city engineer, because it is expressly provided for in the letter itself that nothing contained in it should affect or prejudice the rights or liabilities of either party under the terms of the original agreement, which was made part of the company\u2019s Act of incorporation; it could not, therefore, relieve the railway company from their liability to indemnify the city from the consequences of acts then already due by the railway company in violation of the terms of their charter. The appeal must therefore, in my opinion, be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Laidlaw, Kappele & Bicknell.\nSolicitor for the respondents: T.W.

In 1888 L. was appointed an alternate examiner in pursuance of a suggestion to the manager by local agents that it was advisable to have a French. Canadian on the staff. By his commission L. was entitled to the privilege of such examinations as should be assigned to him by, or required during the absence, disability or unavailability of. the chief examiner. After L. had served for four years it was found that his methods in holding examinations were not acceptable to applicants and he was requested to resign, which he refused to do and another French-Canadian was appointed as an additional alternate examiner, and most of the applicants thereafter went to the latter. L. then brought an action against the company for damages by loss of the business and injury to his professional reputation by refusal to employ him, claiming that on his appointment the general manager had promised him all the examinations of French-Canadian applicants for insurance He also alleged that he had been induced to insure his own life with the company on the understanding that the examination fees would be more than sufficient to pay the premiums and he asked for repayment of amounts paid by him for such insurance.\nHeld, affirming the decision of the Court of Queen's Bench, that by the contract made with L. the company were only to send him such cases as they saw fit, and could dismiss him or appoint other examiners at their pleasure; that the manager had no authority to contract with L. for any employment other than that specified in his commission; and that he had no right of action for repayment of his premiums, it being no condition of his employment that he should insure his life and there being no connection between the contract for insurance and that for employment\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of Queen's Bench (appeal side) ([1]), reversing the judgment of the Superior Court ([2]) in favour of the plaintiff.\nA motion to quash this appeal for want of jurisdiction was refused by the court ([3])\nThe material facts of the case on the merits are sufficiently set out in the above head-note and fully stated in the report of the case in the Court of Queen's Bench and the Superior Court.\nGreenshields Q.C. for the appellant.\nMacmaster Q.C. for the respondent.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.

As regards the appellant's claim to recover the premiums he has paid on the policy he effected with the society on his own life, a claim which has been repelled by both the Superior Court and the Court of Queen's Bench, he clearly has no right of action. That was a contract wholly collateral to his appointment as medical examiner; it was no condition of his employment as such that he should insure his life and there connection between the two contracts.\nMr. Stearns had no authority to enter into any additional or other verbal contract entitling the appellant to employment other than that provided for by the commission from the society. He is therefore restricted to the terms of the contract embodied in that document, and it is out of the question to say that there has been any breach, of them. It was consistent with the commission that the society should refer to him just such cases as they thought fit and no others, and they had power to dismiss him at their will and pleasure whenever they thought fit to do so.\nThe by-laws and rules of the society are for the governance of their own officers only and do not enter into the contract between the society and the appelant, or in any way control it.\nI need not discuss the case at any greater length, as Mr. Justice Hall's judgment is very full and clear, and I entirely concur both in his reasons and conclusions.\nThe appeal must be dismissed with costs.\nFOURNIES J.

Having oiled a part the other workman went away for a time, during which O. saw that the oil was running off the horizontal shaft of the drill and called the attention of the foreman of the machine shop to it and to the fact that the shaft was full of ice. The foreman said to him, \u201cRun her up and down a few times and it will thaw her off.\u201d The shaft was seven feet from the floor and on it was what is called a buggy which could be moved along it on wheels. Depending from the buggy was a straight iron rod into the hollow end of which was inserted the drill secured by a screw, and attached to the buggy was a lever over six feet long. O. when so directed by the foreman tried to move the buggy by means of the lever but found he could not. He then went round to the back of the spindle and not being able then to move the buggy came round to the front, put his two hands upon a jacket around the spindle and put the weight of his body against it; it then moved and he stepped forward to recover his balance, when the screw securing the drill caught him about the middle of the body and he was seriously injured. In an action against his employers for damages it was shown that O. had no experience in the mode of moving the buggy and that the screw should have been guarded.\nHeld, affirming the decision of the Court of Appeal, Gwynne J. dissenting, that the jury were warranted in finding that there was negligence in not having the screw guarded; that as the foreman knew that O. had no experience as to the ordinary mode of doing what he was told he was justified in using any reasonable mode; that he acted within his instructions in using the only efficient means that he could; and that under the evidence he used ordinary care.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1]. affirming the judgment of the Divisional Court[2] in favour of the plaintiff.\nThe material facts of the case sufficiently appear from the above head-note and the judgments of the court.\nBruce Q.C. for the appellants. There was no defect either in the construction of this drill or neglect in using it which would make the employers liable for negligence. Walsh v. Whiteley[3]; Wild v. Waygood[4].\nThe fact that the screw was not guarded would not be ground for an action. Finlay v. Miscampbell[5].\nThis case is distinguishable from Grand Trunk Railway Co. v. Weegar6, in that here the employee was told to do a particular thing which could only properly be done in one way.\nStaunton for the respondent. This case is directly within the principle of Grand Trunk Railway Co. v. Weegar[6], and Barber v. Burt[7].\nAs it was reasonably practicable to have the screw guarded it was the duty of the respondents to do it. Smith v. Baker[8]; Webster v. Foley[9].\nThe judgment of the majority of the court was delivered by:\nKING J.\u2014The fair result of the evidence is that the set screw projecting from a swiftly revolving spindle was a contrivance that subjected persons brought into proximity to it to unnecessary danger. That it was dangerous any one would know; whether it was unnecessarily so would depend upon circumstances. The machine had been in the workshop but a short time and was manufactured by a firm of high standing, and this afforded a fair presumption of fitness. On the other hand a witness for plaintiff, who had been mechanical foreman in the Grand Trunk Railway shops for thirty years, stated that the projecting screw had long before been discarded in England and the screw set flush with the spindle adopted as being safer because not liable like the other to catch in the clothing. He gives as the reason for the use of the projecting screw its cheapness and the ease of getting at it. He further said that it might readily be guarded by a collar put on at the time of manufacture or afterwards. At the same time, however, he said, partly as a statement of a fact and partly as a matter of opinion, that the projecting screw was an ordinary reasonable device in this country. The defendants did not produce any witnesses at all to explain the mechanical reasons that led to the adoption of the contrivance used by them. In view of their manifest avoidance of attempted justification of the construction and use of this part of their machinery, and of the obvious danger of it, I cannot say that the several courts who have dealt with it are wrong in concluding that the jury were warranted in their conclusion that there was negligence in not having the screw guarded. They probably thought that any one reasonably acquainted with machinery would not need the occurrence of an accident to see the probability of some harm coming from the projecting screw if not properly guarded. This, considering the way the matter was left by the learned Chief Justice of the Queen\u2019s Bench, meant that the defendants had not taken reasonable care to provide proper appliances, and so to carry on their operations as to subject those employed by them to no unnecessary risk.\nBut, it is said that the plaintiff had no reason to be where he was. This depends on whether the mode he took to move the buggy was one that he might reasonably suppose to be necessary in order to carry out his orders. He was told to run the buggy up and down a few times, but was not told how he was to do this. It is said that this amounted to a direction to do it in the ordinary way, and that he was not warranted in doing it in any other way. But the foreman who gave the order knew that the plaintiff had no experience of any ordinary way, for he had only a few minutes before called him from his usual work of heating rivets in another part of the building to act as a helper in the operating of this machine. For the plaintiff, therefore, any reasonable way was an ordinary way. But further, I fail to see upon the evidence that the ordinary way of moving the buggy backwards and forwards on its track was by means of the lever. This had a distinct use, viz., by its vertical action to raise or lower the drill. Force applied at the end of a long arm and at a considerable angle to the line of motion, is poorly adapted for the pushing or the pulling of a heavy body. The evidence shows that when Gearing, the principal workman, started the buggy a foot or two along its track that morning in the presence of plaintiff, he used a crowbar. Archibald, the witness already referred to as having been for many years mechanical foreman in the Grand Trunk Railway shops, was asked by the learned judge how he would move the buggy backwards and forwards, and replied that he would take it by the centre and pull it. What the plaintiff did, after trying to move it by the lever, without success, was to take the machine by the centre and push it. And indeed there would seem to be less danger in pushing a heavy body that is apt to yield suddenly than in pulling it towards you. I would only add as further showing that the foreman\u2019s direction could not be carried out by the plaintiff merely by his using the lever, that the foreman, in denying that he gave any orders at all to run the buggy backwards and forwards says:\u2014\nI would not tell him to do that, it takes two men to do it and I would not tell a boy to do it.\nIt manifestly appears, therefore, that if the plaintiff was told to run the buggy backwards and forwards a few times (as is found by the jury) he was clearly acting within his instructions in resorting to the only efficient means he could use. There would of course still remain the obligation to take reasonable care, but although he knew that the spindle was revolving he did not know of the projecting screw. Here is his account:\u2014\nI said to Kempster (the foreman) that the shaft was all ice and the oil was running off as fast as he put it on, that is the horizontal shaft: he says to me, \u201cRun her up and down a few times and it will thaw it off,\u201d he walked away and I started to pull her up and down. The buggy was about in the middle of the shaft, I caught the lever and pulled her up about a foot or two towards the end of the shaft but could not get it any freer; I went around back and tried to shift it again, and I came around to the front and put my two hands upon the jacket around the spindle; I put my weight against it and it started; I stepped forward to catch myself, when the set screw caught me about the middle * * *......... I did not expect there was anything in it, and no one told me there was a set screw.\nThe jury have negatived want of due care on plaintiff\u2019s part, and whatever doubts I might myself have had upon the point of defendants\u2019 negligence in not taking reasonable care in providing proper appliances, a doubt, however, which does not exist respecting the failure to acquaint the plaintiff of the dangerous character of the work he was directed to do and which was out of the usual course of his employment, I have not the slightest doubt whatever, either as to the way in which the plaintiff sought to carry out his instructions, or as to his use of ordinary care in doing so.\nFor these reasons I think the appeal should be dismissed.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014The action in this case was brought under the Workman\u2019s Compensation for Injuries Act for injuries sustained by the plaintiff as alleged from the following causes: 1st. By reason of defect in certain machinery used by the defendants in their business as bridge and ship builders. 2nd. By reason of the negligence of a person in the service of the defendants to whose orders the plaintiff was bound to conform and did conform; and, 3rd. By reason of the defendants having negligently set plaintiff to work at a drill without instructing him in the management of the drill, of which to the knowledge of the defendants the plaintiff was ignorant. The plaintiff\u2019s own statement of the manner in which he received the injury, as alleged in his statement of claim and in his evidence, is that at the time when the accident occurred which occasioned the injury he was employed as a labourer by the defendants for the purpose merely of heating rivets used in their business; that upon the morning of the 22nd December, 1892, the plaintiff together with one Gearing (whose business was to work a drill in the defendants\u2019 factory for drilling rivet holes in large iron plates) was engaged in oiling the gearing, shaft, &c., of the machinery which worked the drill. The plaintiff and Gearing having oiled the arms of the shaft and a track along which a part of the machinery called a buggy moved, Gearing went to the machine shop, taking with him the oil cans with which they had been oiling the machinery. While Gearing was thus away the plaintiff observed that the oil was all running off the horizontal shaft; when oiling it he had observed that the shaft was full of ice; while Gearing was absent with the oil cans one Kempster, who was foreman in the machine shop, happened to be walking around picking up drills that were lying about and the plaintiff mentioned to him that the oil was all running off the shaft and that it was full of ice, and Kempster replied, \u201cRun her up and down a few times and it will thaw her off,\u201d that thereupon the plaintiff went and took hold of the lever used for moving the buggy backwards and forwards along the shaft. The buggy at this time was in the middle of the shaft, whether it had been drawn by the united force of the plaintiff and Gearing applied at the lever, before they had commenced to oil the machinery. When, then, the plaintiff alone went to the lever for the purpose of running the buggy backward and forward on the shaft, as Kempster had suggested, he found he could not move it more than a foot; he then upon his own suggestion, thinking that he could move it by taking hold of the spindle, went round to the back of the spindle and took hold of it, and, as he says, tried to shift it, then came round to the front, put his two hands upon the jacket around the spindle, put the weight of his body against it and it moved, he stepped forward to catch himself when the set screw caught him about the middle of his body; what caught him was the square head of a screw by which the drill was kept tight within the spindle and which projected a little on the outside of the spindle; the machine having been put in motion by Gearing when they commenced oiling it the plaintiff was caught by the machinery in motion and received, no doubt, very serious injuries before he was released.\nNow upon this evidence it is, I think, apparent that the lever which the plaintiff took hold of to move the buggy was the proper means designed to be used for that purpose and that no one directed the plaintiff to take hold of the spindle, thereby to move the buggy, as it appears that he did. The evidence, however, is that any person who understood the business could have moved the buggy by taking hold of the spindle without incurring any danger of being caught in the machinery. The plaintiff unfortunately knew nothing of the machinery, and he through ignorance and without any directions to take hold of the spindle at all took hold of it as he did upon his own suggestion and thereby occasioned the injury which he suffered. He was not employed by the defendants for any purpose save as a labourer to heat rivets. He knew nothing of the working of the machinery further than that he knew that the lever which he took hold of to move the buggy was designed and used for that purpose, for Gearing and he had together that morning so used it. His taking hold of the spindle in the manner in which he did cannot be attributed to any direction given by the defendants or by any person in their service whose orders or direction the plaintiff was bound to obey and was obeying. The plaintiff therefore cannot recover upon the ground, alleged in the statement of claim, that the injury was occasioned by reason of his obeying any such order. Neither do I think the action can be maintained upon the ground of defect in any part of the machinery used by the defendants in their business. The case of Walsh v. Whiteley[10] is, I think, conclusive that the projection of the head of the screw in the spindle, which was not intended to be taken hold of at all in the manner in which the plaintiff took hold of it, and which could, without any danger whatever of damage, have been taken hold of in a different manner by any person who understood the business for which the machine was used, cannot be held to be any defect in the machinery for which, under the Act, negligence can be imputed to the employer, at least by a person who had no business whatever to lay hold of the spindle as the plaintiff did. In fine, the evidence clearly, as I think, establishes that the injury which the plaintiff sustained was occasioned wholly by his attempting to deal with the machinery in a manner never contemplated by the defendants, and in his undertaking upon his own mere motion to exercise his discretion in a matter which he did not understand and in his attempting to handle machinery which he was never employed by the defendants to handle at all, and in a manner not directed by any person in the service of the defendants to whose orders or directions he was by reason of his employment bound to conform. Kempster\u2019s suggestion as to moving the buggy backwards and forwards in order to thaw the ice on the shaft, even if it could be regarded as such an order, cannot be extended beyond a direction to effect the purpose by the use of the lever which was used for that purpose.\nI am, for these reasons, of opinion that, however much to be lamented are the very serious injuries which the plaintiff has sustained, the defendants cannot reasonably or legally he held to be responsible therefor. The appeal therefore must, I think, be allowed and the action in the court below dismissed.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Bruce, Burton & Bruce.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Staunton & O\u2019Heir.\n[1] 21 Ont.

The trial judge agreed with this contention and dismissed the action.

I concur in the argument of the learned counsel for the appellants that nothing was by the contract made payable for the timber expressed to be lying at John\u2019s Island until delivery thereof. The true construction of the first paragraph of the contract if it had stood alone was, as I think, that the appellants undertook to pay $9.50 per thousand feet of that timber delivered free of charge, but in that contract if it had so stood no time was fixed for the delivery of the timber further than that it was agreed that it should take place \u201cwithin ten days from the time the ice is advised ( as clear out of the harbour,\u201d the second paragraph was therefore inserted in the contract which provides that, \u201csettlement to be finally made inside of 30 days in cash less 2 per cent for dimension timber which is at John\u2019s Island.\u201d\nThis is the paragraph which was relied upon as giving to the appellants 30 days of grace for payment of the price after delivery of the timber, but it does nothing of the kind; what the paragraph was introduced for was manifestly to define more precisely the time for delivery of the timber than by the expression \u201cwithin ten days from the time the ice is advised as clear of the harbour,\u201d and it expresses the mutual agreement of both parties to the contract, namely, that everything necessary to a final settlement of the contract by both parties, namely-, delivery by the one and payment by the other, shall be made inside of 30 days from the date of the contract. For delivery after that date, and consequently for payment in the event of delivery after that date, the contract makes no provision. If the non-delivery within the 30 days was by reason of the respondent\u2019s default the appellants had their action for breach of contract; but having accepted a delivery of the timber after the expiration of the 30 days named in the contract within which it was to be delivered, for which event the contract made no provision, it is preposterous to hold that the appellants had by the contract 30 days after delivery, after the expiration of the time named in the contract for delivery, for payment of the price of the timber delivery of which was so accepted. For such an event it is plain that the contract made Ho provision, so no question as to the action having been premature within the terms of the contract could arise.\nThe appeal mast be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Laidlaw, Kappele & Bicknell.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Edwards & Murray.\n"}

Vogel v. Grand Trunk Railway Co. (11 Can. S.C.R. 612), and Bate v. Canadian Pacific Railway Co. (15 Ont. App. R. 388) distinguished.\nThe Grand Trunk Railway Co. received from R. a horse to be carried over its line and the agent of the company and R. signed a contract for such carriage which contained this provision \u201cThe company shall in no case be responsible for any amount exceeding one hundred dollars for each and any horse,\u201d &c.\nHeld, affirming the decision of the Court of Appeal, that the words \u201cshall in no case be responsible\u201d were sufficiently general to cover all cases of loss however caused, and the horse having been killed by negligence of servants of the company, R. could not recover more than $100, though the value of the horse largely exceeded that amount. APPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1], affirming, by an equal division of opinion, the judgment of the Divisional Court[2] in favour of the defendant company.\nThe appellant, the plaintiff in the action, issued a writ on the 3rd day of November, 1891, against the defendants indorsed to recover damages for the loss of a valuable trotting horse known as \u201cHenry R,\u201d shipped by him at Windsor for St. Catharines on the 15th day of September, 1891, upon the Southern Division of the defendants\u2019 railway.\nIn consequence of a collision between two of the defendants\u2019 freight trains, at a point near Stoney Creek, a short distance west of St. Catharines, on defendants\u2019 said line, the plaintiff\u2019s horse was killed.\nThe defendants, in answer to said action, set up a special contract signed by the plaintiff at the time of shipment whereby they contended he was limited in his recovery, if any, even in case of negligence, to the sum of $100, and they paid that sum into court with their amended statement of defence.\nThe special contract so set up contained the following provision:\n\u201cAnd in consideration of said agreement to transport at said special rate it is hereby mutually agreed by and between the parties hereto that the said Grand Trunk Railway shall not be liable for any loss or damage which the shipper or owner of said live stock may suffer by reason of delay. * * * And the said company shall in no case be responsible for any amount exceeding one hundred dollars for each and any horse or head of cattle, (10) dollars each for sheep, hog or calf transported.\u201d\nThe plaintiff contended that even if the company could limit its liability for damage caused by negli- gence, the terms of this contract were not comprehensive enough to cover such cause of loss. But he also relied on section 246 (3) of the Railway Act, 1888, as preventing a railway company from so protecting itself from liability. Section 246 of said Act is as follows:\n\u201c246. All regular trains shall be started and run as near as practicable at regular hours, fixed by public notice, and shall furnish sufficient accommodation for the transportation of all such passengers and goods as are within a reasonable time previously thereto offered for transportation at the place of starting, and at the junctions of other railways and at usual stopping places established for receiving and discharging way passengers and goods from the trains.\u201d\n\u201c2. Such passengers and goods shall be taken, transported to and from, and discharged at such places, on the due payment of the toll, freight or fare lawfully payable therefor.\u201d\n\u201c3. Every person aggrieved by any neglect or refusal in the premises, shall have an action therefor against the company, from which action the company shall not be relieved by any notice, condition or declaration, if the damage arises from any negligence or omission of the company or of its servants.\u201d\nAt the trial of the action the defendants admitted that the collision occurred through the negligence of their employees, and the learned judge left to the jury simply the question of damages and reserved all questions of law. The jury assessed the damages at $5,000, and judgment was entered for the plaintiff for that amount, with costs.\nUpon appeal by the defendants to the Common Pleas Divisional Court the judgment of the trial judge was reversed, and the action dismissed with costs. The plaintiff then appealed to the Court of Appeal and that court affirmed the judgment of the court below by an equal division of opinion, the Chief Justice and Mr. Justice Osler agreeing with the Divisional Court, and the Chancellor and Justice Maclennan being in favour of the plaintiff.\nMoss Q.C. and Collier for the appellant. Vogel v. The Grand Trunk Railway Co.[3], decided that under precisely the same legislation as that in section 246 (3) of the Railway Act, 1888, a railway company could not contract itself out of liability for negligence. Then if it is to be held that it can limit the pecuniary amount of its liability that would be practically to effect what Vogel\u2019s case said it could not do.\nEven if the amount of liability can be so limited the contract in this case would not cover loss by negligence which must be expressly mentioned to cause an exemption. See Nicholas v. The New York Central Railroad Co.[4]\nOsler Q.C. and W. Nesbitt for the respondents referred to Dixon v. The Richelieu Navigation Co.[5]; Barnard v. Faber[6].\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014I refer to the judgment of Mr. Justice McMahon in the Divisional Court for a full statement of the facts. Two questions call for decision. First, did the special contract set out in the amended statement of defence, according to the fair meaning of the language used, cover the case of negligence?\nSecondly, if liability for negligence was, by the terms of the contract, limited as to the amount of damages to be recovered, was such a stipulation legal and was it one which it was competent to the respondents to enter into, having regard to the provisions of the statute (51 Vic. chap. 29, sec. 246, subsec. 3) and to what was decided in Vogel\u2019s Case[7]?\nI am of opinion that both these questions must be answered in the affirmative.\nThe words of the special contract material to the present question are, that the \u201csaid company shall in no case be responsible for an amount exceeding $100 for each or any horse or head of cattle, or $10 each for sheep, hog, or calf transported.\u201d\nMr. Justice Maclennan, who was of opinion that the statute did not interfere with the respondents\u2019 prima facie right to enter into a contract limiting their liability to ascertained damages, gave judgment in favour of the appellant, upon the ground that the terms of the agreement were not sufficiently comprehensive to embrace a case of loss or damage occasioned by the negligence of the respondents\u2019 servants.\nI am unable to agree in this conclusion. The valuation fixed upon in consideration of the special rate was general, and no distinction is made between the value to be assumed in a case of negligence and in a case of accident. There would be no reason for presuming such a discrimination between the value in one case and the other, and the language used \u201cshall in no case be responsible\u201d is sufficiently general to cover all cases of loss, however caused, as they undoubtedly were intended to do. In the case of Hart v. Pennsylvania Railroad Co.[8], the agreement was certainly not more specific in its terms than in that before us; the same argument was used that these general terms did not apply when there was a loss by negligence, but the court held the contrary. Secondly, it appears to me, that nothing decided in Vogel\u2019s Case7 touches the points raised in the appeal now before us. In Vogel\u2019s Case[9] the question was as to exemption from all liability, and nothing there decided established, or tended to establish, that it was not competent to the respondents to enter into an agreement for pre-ascertained damages, or for limited liability, if that term is preferred. The subsection which is invoked by the appellant is worded as follows:\nEvery person aggrieved by any neglect or refusal in the premises, shall have an action therefor against the company, from which action the company shall not be relieved by any notice, condition or declaration, if the damage arises from any negligence or omission of the company or of its servants.\nThis is an enactment which ought not to be extended beyond its literal meaning, and that is plainly confined to the prohibition of any contract relieving the company from liability for negligence. To say that it is to shut out the company from limiting its liability for damages by an agreement fixing a value on goods carried, would be to extend its language by implication to a case which does not appear from any part of the Act itself to have been within the contemplation of the legislature. So far indeed from this being so, we may reasonably infer that the legislature never intended to enact a provision which would most assuredly have the result so forcibly pointed out in the judgment of the learned Chief Justice of Ontario, viz., that, when it was sought to compel the company to carry property of great value for rates which would not cover the equivalent of a fair premium for insuring, we should find the company refusing to carry, and thus, on a calculation of profit and loss, preferring to pay damages for such refusal to incurring a risk without adequate compensation. The case relied on by Mr. Justice McMahon in his elaborate judgment is, in my opinion, in point and entirely supports the learned judge\u2019s conclusions. In that case of Hart v. Pennsylvania Railroad Co.[10], the question presented was identical with that now before us. The only difference existing between the two cases is, that, whilst in the present case the power of contracting themselves out of liability for negligence is taken away from the railway company by statute, in the case of Hart v. Pennsylvania Railroad Co.10 the same prohibition was derived from the common law prevailing in the state by the law of which the contract was governed. Blachford J., in delivering the unanimous judgment of the Supreme Court, says:\nIt is the law of this court that a common carrier may, by special contract, limit his common law liability, but that he cannot stipulate for exemption from the consequences of his own negligence or that of his servants.\nThe case therefore, although of course not binding upon us, is one which, having regard to the high authority of the great court from which it emanated and to the admirable reasoning by which its conclusions are supported, we may safely follow.\nAdopting the reasons there given, we find every difficulty which had been or possibly could be suggested in the present case completely answered.\nSome reference was made in the judgments in the Court of Appeal and also on the argument here to the case of Bate v. Canadian Pacific Railway Co.[11] I may say at once, that that case was not decided on the authority of Vogel\u2019s case, but on a totally different point there arising on the findings of the jury, viz., that the appellant had not read, and could not (in the state of her eyesight) have read, the conditions on the ticket, and that she was misled as to the effect of those conditions by the answers she received in reply to her inquiries addressed to the ticket clerk of the defendants. In short it was decided upon the authority of Henderson v. Stevenson[12], which was followed in preference to Watkins v. Rymill[13], and the choice thus made between two apparently conflicting authorities, seems now to be confirmed by the very late case of Richardson Spence & Co. v. Rowntree[14], which is a decision to the same effect as Bate v. Canadian Pacific Railway Co.[15] on facts very similar.\nThe appeal must be dismissed with costs.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014I adopt Chief Justice Hagarty\u2019s reasoning in the Court of Appeal, as reported in 21 Ont. App. R. 204. This appellant saw no objection whatever to have his horse valued at one hundred dollars when he benefited from the undervaluation, but when the horse is killed he would repudiate his submission to the undervaluation. A horse that is worth one hundred dollars when shipped cannot be worth five thousand dollars when killed next day.\nIf it is not true that it was worth only one hundred dollars when shipped it does not lie in the appellant\u2019s mouth to say so. I would dismiss the appeal.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014I am of opinion that this case is not concluded by the judgment of this court in Vogel v. Grand Trunk Railway Co.[16] Subsequently to that judgment being rendered the company, with the view I presume of protecting themselves from what appeared to them to be the severity of that judgment, procured the assent, under the provisions of the statute in that behalf, of the Governor in Council to a new tariff, with which alone we have to deal in the present case.\nThe clause of the statute upon which the judgment in Vogel v. Grand Trunk Railway Co.16 proceeded was the same in terms as the clause of the statute now in force, namely, ch. 109, sec. 104, ss. 2 and 3 R.S.C. By that section it is provided that goods shall be taken, transported and discharged by the company on due payment of the toll, freight or fare lawfully payable therefor, and that every person aggrieved by any neglect or refusal in the premises shall have an action therefor against the company, from which action the company shall not be relieved by any notice, condition, or declaration, if the damage arises from any negligence or omission of the company, or of its servants. Now that there should be any toll or freight lawfully payable for the carrying of goods by the company must depend upon the terms of the tariff of tolls or freight approved under the provision of the statute, by order of the Governor General in Council, for sec. 16 ss. 9 of ch. 109 R.S.C., enacts that no tolls shall be levied or taken until approved by the Governor in Council, &c.\nIn Vogel\u2019s case this court held that this section applied to prevent the company from relieving themselves by contract from an action for the loss of horses received by them for transportation, such loss having arisen from the negligence of the servants of the company, and that the fact that what the defendants had done was merely to let to the plaintiff a car which he loaded with horses and which the defendants undertook to draw did not prevent the application of the section. The ratio decidendi therefore, as it appears to me, was that the section, prohibiting, as it was held it did, the company from contracting against liability from loss by negligence, applied, by reason of the defendants having been by their tariff then in existence under an obligation to carry the horses delivered to them at a rate provided for in such tariff. But by the new tariff, which has been adopted since the judgment in Vogel\u2019s case, and which, approved in the manner required by the statute, has been substituted for the one which was in force when Vogel\u2019s case was before the court, and has become a lawful tariff confirmed by the provisions of the statute in that behalf, the defendants are under no obligation whatever to carry racers, although they do by that tariff, so approved and made valid in law, undertake to carry them at the same rate as they do carry horses of ordinary value, subject however, to the condition that the owner shall incur all risk of loss or damage from any cause whatever including negligence. Such a condition, besides being perfectly reasonable and fair to be made in a contract for the carriage of animals which the defendants are under no obligation to carry, is made perfectly free from all doubt as to its validity by the tariff approved as required by the statute; the section therefore of the statute which declared that the railway company could not relieve themselves from an action for loss or damage, arising from negligence, of goods which the defendants were bound to carry by their tariff, has no application in the present case, which is an action for the loss of a race horse which they were not under obligation to carry, and which by their tariff, approved as required by statute, and so given the force of law, they only undertook to carry upon condition that the owner should bear the risk of all loss or damage from whatever cause arising.\nNow as to the facts of this case, the plaintiff, well knowing the terms of this tariff, which may be said to be the statutory tariff, brought his horse to the defendants, but did not disclose to them the fact that he was a race horse, and he asked the defendants\u2019 servants for and procured from them their bill of lading for an ordinary horse and signed it and thereby in effect, as I think, under the circumstances, represented the value of his horse to be no more than $100, which sum and no more the defendants by the bill of lading so obtained by the plaintiff undertook to pay in the event of loss. The plaintiff now claims $5,000, which he alleges to be the value of his horse as a race horse, although he neither represented the animal to be such, when delivered to the defendants, nor did they undertake to carry him as such.\nTo hold this case to be governed by Vogel\u2019s case and that the plaintiff is entitled to recover herein, besides being, as I conceive it would be, a judgment unwarranted by the ratio decidendi in that case, would be to construe that case so as to enable the plaintiff to commit a fraud upon the defendants. The question in the present case, but for the payment by the defendants of $100, which they agreed to pay in the event of loss from any cause, would more properly, in my opinion, have been whether the plaintiff, he not having shipped the horse as a race horse, but upon the form used for the transportation of horses of ordinary value, had not by such deception lost all right even to the $100.\nThe appeal should in my opinion be dismissed with costs.\nSEDGEWICK J. concurred.\nKING J.\u2014I am of opinion that this appeal should be dismissed with costs for the reasons given in the judgment of the Chief Justice.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellant: Collier & Shaw.\nSolicitor for the respondents: John Bell.\n[1] 21 Ont.

Rules 848, 849\u2014Extension of time\u2014Confirmation of report by lapse of time.\nIn an action by V. against a municipality for damages from injury to property by the negligent construction of a drain, a reference was ordered to an official referee \u201cfor inquiry and report pursuant to sec. 101 of the Judicature Act and rule 552 of the High Court of Justice.\u201d The referee reported that the drain was improperly constructed, and that V. was entitled to $600 damages. The municipality appealed to the Div. Court from the report, and the court held that the appeal was too late, no notice having been given within the time required by Cons. Rule 848, and refused to extend the time for appealing. A motion for judgment on the report was also made by V. to the court on which it was claimed on behalf of the municipality that the whole case should be gone into upon the evidence, which the court refused to do.\nHeld, affirming the decision of the Court of Appeal, that the appeal not having been brought within one month from the date of the report, as required by Cons. Rule 848, it was too late; that the report had to be filed by the party appealing before the appeal could be brought, but the time could not be enlarged by his delay in filing it; and that the refusal to extend the time was an exercise of judicial discretion with which this court would not interfere.\nHeld also, Gwynne J. dissenting, that the report having been confirmed by lapse of time and not appealed against, the court on the motion for judgment was not at liberty to go into the whole case upon the evidence, but was bound to adopt the referee\u2019s findings and to give the judgment which those findings called for. Freeborn v. Vandusen (15 Ont. P.R. 264) approved of and followed. APPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, affirming the judgment of the Divisional Court in favour of the plaintiff.\nThe action was brought against the municipality for damages for injury to plaintiff\u2019s land and crops from the negligent construction of a drain by the defendants. When the action came on for trial it was referred to the official referee under sec. 101 of the Judicature Act, and rule 552 of the High Court of Justice, and the questions raised for decision on this appeal were: Was the Divisional Court right in holding that an appeal from the referee\u2019s report was too late not having been brought within one month from the date of the report as required by Consolidated Rule 848, and in refusing to extend the time for appealing? Could the court, on a motion for judgment on the referee\u2019s report, go into the whole case on the evidence, or was it bound to give judgment on the findings in the report? The Divisional Court held that it could not go into the whole case, and its decision on that ground, as well as on the ground that the appeal was too late, was affirmed by the Court of Appeal.\nWilson Q.C. for the appellants. We can appeal against the report notwithstanding it is conclusive as to matters of fact. Raymond v. Little[1].\nOn the merits the learned counsel referred to Corporation of Raleigh v. Williams[2]; Cowper Acton v. Essex[3]; Cripps on Compensation[4].\nDouglas Q.C. and Langton Q.C. for the respondent referred to Geddis v. Bann Reservoir[5]; Suskey and Township of Rowney, in re[6]. THE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014I am of opinion that there was no error in the judgment of the Court of Appeal and that it ought not in any way to be interfered with.\nFirst, the appeal to the Divisional Court from the referee\u2019s report was properly held by Mr. Justice Falconbridge to be too late, it being indisputable that notice of appeal was not given within the time prescribed by Consolidated Rule 848. By Consolidated Rule 849 an appeal against a report must be brought on to be heard within one month from the date of the report. It is for a party appealing to file the report before he brings his appeal. It is not, however, within the power of an appellant, by delaying the filing of the report, to enlarge the time for appealing allowed him by Consolidated Rules 848 and 849. The practice thus prescribed for proceedings in the High Court was adopted from the former practice of the Court of Chancery, where it had prevailed under the authority of a general order of the court for a considerable time. (Chancery General Order 253).\nAs regards any extension of the time for appealing by way of indulgence, that was entirely for the discretion of the learned judge of the Divisional Court who did not think fit to grant it. This being so the Court of Appeal refused to interfere, and this court certainly ought not to entertain an appeal on any such grounds. We have held in several cases, that this court will not interfere with the decisions of the Court of Appeal of the province of Quebec in matters of practice, and I see no reason why the same principle should not apply to the adjudications of the Court of Appeal for Ontario.\nThen coming to the question as it was presented on the motion for judgment upon a report which we must assume to have become absolutely confirmed by the lapse of time and the appellants\u2019 failure to appeal against it, we have to consider what was the effect of the report thus confirmed. Was it open to the Divisional Court on that motion to go into the whole case upon the evidence, or was it at liberty to take the facts stated by the referee on the face of his report and to inquire if those facts justified his conclusion that the defendants had been guilty of negligence, or was the court bound, upon the report standing undisturbed by an appeal, to adopt the referee\u2019s findings and merely to give the judgment which those findings called for? I am clearly of opinion that the latter was the proper course. In the case of Freeborn v. Vandusen[7], the learned Chancellor of Ontario treats the report of a referee and the mode of appealing from it and proceeding upon it as being regulated by the same practice as that which applies to a master\u2019s report. This was evidently the intention of the judges who framed the Consolidated Orders, as appears from the heading which precedes Consolidated Order 848.\nThe case of Freeborn v. Vandusen7 has never been reversed or overruled, and it therefore stands as an authoritative decision as to the procedure of the High Court of Justice upon the point in question. Moreover, its weight as an authority is greatly enhanced by the consideration, that it is the judgment of the chief judge of that branch of the High Court which until recently exclusively dealt with these questions as to the reports of masters and referees, and a judge who had himself had great experience as a master in chancery. I should not therefore, for these reasons alone, be disposed to overrule it, even if I could do so consistently with our own rulings against interfering with mere matters of procedure before referred to. I am, however, of opinion that the Chancellor\u2019s judgment was a correct construction of Consolidated Rules 848. 849 and 850, and that this practice, which is founded on the old Chancery General Order 253, and was established by the Consolidated Rules of 1888 in lieu of the prior practice, is more reasonable and convenient than that which has been established in England under cognate orders. Freeborn v. Vandusen[8] decides that a referee\u2019s report, like a master\u2019s report, stands absolutely confirmed when the time for appealing has elapsed, just as under the old practice of the Court of Chancery a master\u2019s report did after the order absolute to confirm. In the words of the Chancellor referring to the report of a referee, \u201cthe course of the court is to treat it, if not appealed from, as a finality.\u201d Where a party does not appeal the evidence taken before the referee is not before the court on a motion for judgment, any more than the depositions taken before the master were under the former practice before the court when the cause came on to be heard on further directions. Under the English practice the report amounts to nothing final; on the motion for judgment the court go behind the referee\u2019s report and discuss the merits. The provision for an appeal from the referee, just as in the case of the master, is designed, and can only have been designed, to shut out all such discussion on the motion for judgment, when the court adopts the findings of the referee or master as final, and bases its judgment on those findings as res judicate. The English practice, on the other hand, makes no provision for such an appeal; the review of the referee\u2019s finding and the judgment of the court thereon are both included in the motion for judgment.\nBy the alteration in the practice effected by the rules of 1888, such cases as Longman v. East[9], and Cumming v. Low[10], have become inapplicable, and to ascertain how a report of a referee which has become absolutely confirmed is to be proceeded upon we must have recourse to the former practice of the Court of Chancery applicable to the reports of the master.\nThese authorities show that except in cases where the master exercised his power of stating special circumstances, leaving the court to draw its own conclusions therefrom, which was not the course pursued by the referee here, the court could only have regard to the conclusions arrived at, and would not enter into any discussion of facts or reasons which the master might have stated in the report.\nThe result is that the appellants, not having appealed from the report, and the referee having found in the plaintiff\u2019s favour that there had been actionable wrong on the part of the defendants, and that the plaintiff had suffered damages to the amount of $600, the Divisional Court had no alternative but to pronounce the judgment which the Court of Appeal have affirmed and which is now the subject of the present appeal. A contrary decision as to the right of the defendants to go into the merits on the facts stated on the face of the report would do great injustice to the respondent, who would thus be debarred from going into the evidence at large and who was not called upon to appeal from a finding in his favour. Arriving at this conclusion I am not called upon to discuss the merits, or to go into the evidence; I may say, however, that I have read the evidence twice, and I am of opinion, that not only was there some evidence of negligence, but that it establishes a strong case of negligence, both as regards the cutting of the embankment and as regards the Richmond drain. In the case of the latter, tested by the principle laid down by the Privy Council in Williams v. Raleigh[11] as to the distinction between compensation under the statute for lands injuriously affected and damages for negligence, indemnity for the former being recoverable only under the statute, whilst the proper remedy for negligence is by action, I am of opinion that there was evidence of actionable negligence. The appellants were warned by their own engineer that the mouth of the Richmond drain as planned would be insufficient to carry off the water, and yet they persisted in carrying out the work. This, surely, comes within the language of the judgment of the Judicial Committee in the passage from it quoted by the Chief Justice of Ontario.\nThe embankment was not a statutory work at all, it was no part of the original plan for the Richmond drain. There is evidence that the cuttings in this embankment caused damage to the respondent (see the extracts from the depositions in respondent\u2019s factum); for this the respondent\u2019s only remedy was by action.\nI cannot part with this case without characterizing the litigation as extravagant and wasteful in the extreme, and I must express the hope that some check may be placed by legislation on appeals to this court in such cases as the present.\nThe appeal must be dismissed with costs.\nTASCHEREAU J. concurred.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014This is an action instituted in the Queen\u2019s Bench Division of the High Court of Justice for Ontario against the Municipal Corporation of the Township of South Colchester, for damage alleged to have been caused to the plaintiff and his land by reason of the negligence of the defendants in the construction of certain drains, for the construction of which by-laws had been duly passed by the council of the municipality in conformity with the provisions of the Acts of the province of Ontario in relation to the construction of drains. In order to understand the case it will be convenient to set out, in an abbreviated but substantial form, the material part of the plaintiff\u2019s statement of claim.\nThe plaintiff, who is the owner of the north half of lot no. 7, in the 5th concession of South Colchester, containing 100 acres, alleges that in the years 1883 and 1884 the defendants undertook to construct a drain within the limits of the municipality of South Colchester, called the Richmond drain, upon plans, specifications and a by-law adopted and passed by the municipality for the construction thereof, under the provisions of the Municipal Acts of Ontario. That the drain commenced at a point in lot no. 8, near the line between the 1st and 2nd concessions, and passed northerly, intersecting in its course three or four other tap drains and other small drains connecting them, and thence north by a deep cut across the 4th concession to about the middle of lot no. 8, in the 5th concession, where it turned at right angles to the east to an outlet several miles distant at a creek called Cedar Creek. That at the point where it so turned east it is intersected by a drain called the McLean drain, the waters in which flow northwesterly across plaintiff\u2019s farm to an outlet several miles distant in a river called Canard River, and that this drain had also been constructed by the defendants under the drainage Acts. That from the point where the McLean drain and the Richmond drain so intersect, the latter drain was never large enough to carry off the volume of water brought from the south of the 4th concession and to drain the lands assessed for its construction. That because the McLean drain intersected the Richmond drain at the point aforesaid, and because the Richmond drain from thence to its outlet in the east was insufficient, water rushed down the McLean drain in greater volume than its capacity could carry off, and the plaintiff\u2019s said land and the lands even in the adjoining township of North Colchester became flooded thereby, and that in consequence thereof, the defendants made a settlement by arbitration with the municipality of North Colchester, and in pursuance thereof built an embankment along the north and west sides of the Richmond drain at the point where it was intersected by the McLean drain, thereby filling up the McLean drain at such point of intersection, and thereby preventing the flow of waters from the Richmond drain into the McLean drain. That the defendants during the years 1887 and 1888 caused that part of the McLean drain which lies north of the Richmond drain and between it and the township of North Colchester to be cleared out, but refused to enlarge it to any greater size than was sufficient to drain the lands in the township north of the Richmond drain. That at every heavy rainfall large volumes of water, brought by the Richmond drain with great force against the embankment, washed the same away, whereby plaintiff\u2019s land became flooded, and that the defendants caused and permitted ditches to be cut into the embankment in several places, whereby the water flowed on to plaintiff\u2019s land and destroyed his crops in 1889 and 1890. That extra water has been brought and kept on plaintiff\u2019s farm and crops to his damage, that would not have been so brought and kept but for the said Richmond drain. That the defendants were guilty of gross negligence in constructing the said drains and embankment and leaving them incomplete and insufficient, and in refusing to enlarge the McLean drain, and in building an embankment instead which was imperfect and useless to prevent overflow of water on plaintiff\u2019s farm.\nNow here it may be observed, that this last paragraph contains the whole gist of the plaintiff\u2019s cause of action, which is thus stated to consist merely in gross negligence in the construction of drains, constructed, as is admitted, upon plans, specifications and by-laws adopted and passed by the municipality under the provisions of the Acts of the legislature relating to the construction of drains by municipalities. And for this alleged negligence the plaintiff in conclusion claims nine hundred dollars for loss of crops, and the use of his land for crops, owing to their having been drowned and destroyed by water diverted from its natural course and brought on the plaintiff\u2019s farm by means of the Richmond drain in the years 1889 and 1890.\nTo the plaintiff\u2019s cause of action so stated, the defendants by their statement denied the charge of negligence made by the plaintiff, upon which the plaintiff joined issue, and the issue was brought down for trial at Sandwich in October, 1890, when the learned judge presiding at the trial made the order following:\nThis action coming on for trial at Sandwich on the 20th October, 1890, and the same being, on the application of the plaintiff, postponed until the 21st day of October, 1890, and the said action coming on, on the said 21st day of October, in the presence of counsel for all parties and the jury notice having been struck out and the jury dispensed with; upon opening of the matter and hearing read the pleadings and what was alleged by counsel aforesaid, and consideration the appointment of a referee having been postponed to, and disposed of, this day.\nIt is ordered that all questions arising in this action be, and the same are, hereby referred to Frank E. Marcon, Esq., Official Referee, for inquiry and report pursuant to sec. 101 of the Judicature Act and rule 552 of the High Court of Justice, and the said referee may inspect the locality and works in question; and such evidence as may be offered by the parties, or as the referee may require, may be taken in short hand by the stenographer and need not be signed by the witnesses.\n2. That the costs and proper charges of such examination, reference, report, stenographer and type writing of the evidence for the court and parties shall be costs in the cause herein. Now upon the true construction of the above sec. 101, under the authority of which this order was made, and upon the authority of the judgment of the Court of Appeal in England, in the three cases of Longman v. East; Pontifex v. Severn; and Mellin v. Monico[12], it must be held, that neither the action, nor the issue joined therein between the parties, was by the above order referred to the referee to determine.\nCommenting upon sec. 56 of the English Judicature Act of 1873, from which sec. 101 of the Ontario Judicature Act is taken almost verbatim, Bramwell L.J., at p. 149 of the above report, says:\nUnder sec. 56 any question arising in the cause may be referred by the court or a judge for inquiry and report to an official or special referee. He is not to dispose of the action, and I do not think he is even to determine any matter in issue between the parties. * * * His duty is, instead of determining issues of fact or of law, to find the materials upon which the court is to act. Clearly, under sec. 56 an action cannot be referred to him to decide facts and law.\nBrett L.J. at p. 152, says:\nI think it convenient before I proceed to the construction of the Judicature Acts to consider the kinds of references that existed previously to the passing of those statutes, and afterwards to consider the effect of the Judicature Acts on the then existing law. Before the Judicature Acts there were several modes in which disputes were remitted to the decision of third persons and which might be called references. There was the common law reference to an arbitrator constituted by the consent of the parties. There was the compulsory reference to an arbitrator under the provisions of the Common Law Procedure Act, 1854. There was the reference to the master to report in the common law courts as to matters of discipline and similar questions, and in the Court of Chancery there was the reference into chambers. It was not intended by the Judicature Acts to interfere with these references, and they at present exist with all their incidents. But it was thought that further powers ought to be given to the Divisional Courts, and I think that sec. 56 gives to the Chancery Division a new tribunal, that is to say, instead of referring certain questions for a report into chambers, that court may, if they think fit, refer questions to an official referee, an officer newly appointed with limited duties and also with defined powers. Section 56 therefore gives to that Division a new tribunal in addition to their own chambers; but it gives to the common law Divisions a new power as well a new tribunal; it gives them power to do what the Court of Chancery had done in a suit or cause. The common law courts had no power previous to the passing of sec. 56 to refer matters in a cause for report, but only to refer for report of the master matters of discipline; these matters the courts themselves were bound to decide upon the facts, but they sometimes delegated the duty to a master. This section, however, gives them power to remit questions in a cause for report in the same way as a question was referred in the Court of Chancery into chambers, and afterwards the report was brought back from chambers to the court.\nAnd again at p. 155, after commenting on the powers conferred by sec. 57, he says:\nI should say that, in the case of a report to the court or judge under sec. 56, the court or judge may differ from the official referee as to any finding which is an inference from the facts that the referee has reported, they may deal with his report generally in the same way as the courts do with a report of the master upon a matter of discipline. But with regard to the finding of a referee of issues of fact sent to him under sec. 57, either by consent of the parties or without consent, I think the appeal is of the same nature as the appeal from the finding of a judge when he tries without a jury, or as the appeal from the finding of a jury, that is to say, the court must accept the finding of the referee, unless they can set it aside, according to the ordinary rules which would be applicable to the finding of a jury, or to the finding of a judge trying a cause without a jury.\nAnd Cotton L.J. at p. 159, says:\nBefore I proceed to deal with the three appeals which are before us, I will first consider the sections of the Act of 1873. Secs. 56 and 57, on the face of them, relate to very different matters. Sec. 56 provides for cases which frequently occurred in the Court of Chancery, where on some question being raised either of a scientific or other nature requiring special knowledge, the evidence was conflicting, or the witnesses differed, (as for instance, as to what would be the result of a certain act sought to be restrained by injunction, or as to what ought to be done in order to remedy a particular state of things, or as to what timber was fit to be cut), it was not unusual to direct a reference to some expert or scientific man to report to the court upon the question as to which there was a conflict of evidence, or as to which for any other reason the court desired to have information. These cases, by sec. 56, may be referred to an official referee, who is not to find the issues between the parties, but to make a report, and that report is for the assistance of the court, as is shown by this, that it may be adopted wholly or partially by the court, and when adopted may be enforced as a judgment of the court.\nSection 57 provides for a different matter. As I understand it, it is to enable certain issues of fact arising in a cause, which the court or judge thinks cannot be conveniently tried before the court or judge either with or without a jury, to be referred to another tribunal, and that really is acting upon what formerly was constantly the practice in the Court of Chancery.\nThese observations of the Lords Justices in relation to secs. 56 and 57 of the English Judicature Act of 1873, have precise application to secs. 101 and 102 of the Ontario Judicature Act, which are taken almost verbatim from the said secs. 56 and 57.\nIn the action before us the only material question in issue is, whether the defendants were or were not guilty of negligence in the construction of the Richmond and McLean drains, in the plaintiff\u2019s statement of claim mentioned; the legality of the construction, that is to say, the authority to construct those drains, was not questioned. Now, whether the defendants were or were not guilty of negligence in their construction, thereby causing damage to the plaintiff, was a mixed question of law and of fact. First, of fact, namely, as to the matters of fact relied upon as constituting the alleged negligence, and, secondly, of law, namely, whether matters of fact, when ascertained, constituted negligence in point of law. This latter question, or part of the material question, was not at all submitted to the referee; he had no authority what ever except to take evidence and to report his findings upon the matters of fact relied upon as constituting the alleged negligence, and to report the evidence with his findings thereon to the court, whose duty and right it was, upon the authority of the judgment of the Court of Appeal in England in the cases above cited when arriving at a judgment in the action on the issues joined therein, to consider the evidence and upon consideration of it to differ, if they should think fit, from any finding of the referee which was an inference from the facts reported by him, and to render judgment according to the court\u2019s view of the law, as applicable to the matters of fact submitted to the referee to inquire into and report upon; and in case of any of the findings of the referee upon the matters of fact submitted to him to inquire into and report upon appearing to be inferences drawn by him from the evidence, then to exercise their own judgment from such evidence, and, if they should differ from the inference drawn by the referee, to act upon their own judgment.\nNow the referee by his report, which together with the evidence upon which it is founded has been filed in the Divisional Court in which the action was pending, has reported in paragraphs distinctly as follows:\n1. That the plaintiff in 1888 and 1890 was and still is owner of the lot in his statement of claim mentioned.\n2. That in 1877 the defendants passed several by-laws for drainage of lands south of the 4th concession, respectively called Aikman\u2019s drain, Ferris drain, Shepherd drain and Long-marsh, the three former emptying into Long-marsh drain, which, however, was not of sufficient capacity to carry off to its outlet the waters so brought into it.\n3. That through the 4th concession of the township of Colchester there is a ridge of land of sufficient height to separate the waters in the Long-marsh in the 2nd, 3rd and 4th concessions from the waters in Roach\u2019s or Walker\u2019s marsh in the 5th concession, which lies about 15 feet lower than the Long marsh, but in times of very high water a little water would flow northerly from the Long-marsh to Roach\u2019s or Walker\u2019s marsh. 4. That in 1868 the defendants constructed a drain called the McLean drain from a point a little southeast of plaintiff\u2019s land to the River Canard, and in 1879, cleaned out and enlarged that drain under the Municipal Act; that this drain was intended to drain the plaintiff\u2019s land and other lands in the 5th concession, and would have done so effectually but for the interference of the defendants as hereinafter mentioned.\n5. That in or about the year 1870, but without any by-law therefor, the defendants cut a small drain across the 4th concession, which carried a small quantity of water into the 5th concession and Roach\u2019s marsh, but which was found ineffective, and on the 12th January, 1884, the defendants passed a by-law for the construction of the Richmond drain to provide an additional outlet for the waters of the Long-marsh to Cedar Creek, and that by an award under an arbitration and agreement come to with the township of Colchester North, an embankment, about three feet high and about three-quarters of a mile in length from above the McLean drain around the elbow or turn easterly to Cedar Creek, was erected on the north side of the Richmond drain for the express purpose of preventing water from the Richmond drain flowing into or being carried therefrom by the McLean drain or overflowing the plaintiff\u2019s land or other lands theretofore drained sufficiently by the McLean drain.\n6. That the defendants had due notice while constructing this drain that the outlet at Cedar Creek was insufficient, partly owing to the want of sufficient fall, and that the same should be enlarged in order to prevent the water brought down to it from the south overflowing plaintiff\u2019s land and other lands in the fifth concession.\n7. That the plaintiff was assessed for a cut off by the defendants for the Richmond drain, and was therefore entitled to have his lands protected from the water coming down the Richmond drain.\n8. That subsequent to the award mentioned in the above paragraph 4, and to the making of the said embankment, the defendants caused, or permitted and allowed, a cut to be made in the said embankment at the point where the McLean drain came up to that portion of the embankment separating it from the Richmond drain, thereby causing a large body of water from the said Richmond drain to flow into and surcharge the McLean drain, which it otherwise would not have done in a state of nature, if such cut in said embankment had not been made, thereby overflowing the plaintiff\u2019s lands during the years 1889 and 1890 and destroying and injuring the crops on about 50 acres of his land; that the plaintiff\u2019s land, after the construction and after the cleaning out on two occasions of the McLean drain, was dry and fit for cultivation until the construction of the Richmond drain and the cutting of the said embankment, whereby the said McLean drain became overcharged as aforesaid.\n9. That the plaintiff\u2019s crops and lands were damaged by water during the years 1889 and 1890 by waters from the Richmond drain being allowed and permitted to enter the McLean drain, thereby causing an overflow of the latter drain, and that such flooding was not from the skies, and that the lands and crops were so injured was solely due to the waters coming from the Richmond drain as aforesaid.\n10. That the McLean drain was ample and sufficient to carry off the waters from the plaintiff\u2019s lands if the waters from the Richmond drain had not surcharged it during the years 1889 and 1890.\n11. That the defendants were guilty of negligence, 1st, in constructing the Richmond drain, and diverting and carrying water across the 4th concession which would not have come there in a state of nature, and providing no sufficient outlet therefor at Cedar Creek, as recommended by their engineer, thereby causing the overflowing of lands in the 5th concession and amongst others those of the plaintiff. 2nd. In cutting or permitting the said embankment to be cut, thereby causing the McLean drain to be connected with the Richmond drain and allowing the waters from the said Richmond drain to flow into and overcharge the said McLean drain, thereby overflowing the plaintiff\u2019s lands. 3rd. In bringing down through the Richmond drain such a large volume of water and with such velocity to the 5th concession as to overflow the McLean drain to such a height as to overflow the plaintiff\u2019s lands.\n12. That the plaintiff has sustained damages in the years 1889 and 1890 by the negligence and wrongful acts of the defendants at the sum of $600, and that he is entitled to recover that sum from the defendants.\nNow upon this report it is to be observed, that in so far as the McLean drain is concerned the referee has found, as a mere matter of fact, by the 10th paragraph of his report, that it was ample and sufficient to carry off the waters from plaintiff\u2019s lands, if the waters from the Richmond drain had not surcharged it during the years 1889 and 1890, so that as matter of fact the plaintiff\u2019s damage is wholly attributable to such surcharging of the McLean drain by the Richmond drain. Then as to the Richmond drain, it is admitted in the plaintiff\u2019s statement of claim that the drain was constructed upon plans, specifications and a by-law duly prepared, adopted and passed by the muncipal council of the township of South Colchester under the provisions of the municipal Acts of Ontario in that behalf, and that the plaintiff himself was one of the parties assessed under such provisions in respect of his said land for the construction of the drain. Then by the 11th and 12th paragraphs it is apparent, that the referee assumed and erroneously assumed a jurisdiction which the order of reference (it having been made merely for inquiry and report to assist and inform the conscience of the court) did not vest in him, in assuming to adjudicate upon and determine the action itself and the sole material issue joined between the parties therein, namely, that the defendants were guilty of the negligence wherewith they were charged in the statement of claim, qualifying however the conclusion at which he had so arrived by basing it upon the reasons stated in the 11th paragraph of his report, the sufficiency of which reasons to support a judgment in the action against the defendants it was for the court in which the action was pending alone to adjudicate upon and determine, as already shown by the judgment of the Court of Appeal in England in the report of the cases cited[13].\nAgainst this report the defendants moved by way of appeal, upon grounds of the reception of improper evidence, the finding being contrary to law and evidence, and several other grounds which I do not think it necessary to set out here, because I think that every material objection taken before us on this appeal to the plaintiff\u2019s right to recover in the action was open to the defendants upon the plaintiff\u2019s motion for judgment which came on for hearing in the Divisional Court of Queen\u2019s Bench upon the same day as the above motion of the defendants by way of appeal from the referee\u2019s report.\nUpon the 20th May, 1893, judgment was rendered in the Divisional Court upon both of the said motions as follows, so far as is material:\nUpon motion made on the 26th day of November, 1892, unto this court, on behalf of the plaintiff for judgment herein, upon and in ac- cordance with the report made by Frank E. Marcon, Esq., referee herein, dated 17th day of February, 1892, and filed the 5th day of September, 1892, and upon motion also made on the same day, on behalf of the defendants by way of appeal from the said report, and for judgment for the defendants, or that the report be varied, or that the questions referred by the order of reference made in this cause * * * be referred back to the said or some other referee to inquire and report, * * * * * and upon hearing read the pleadings, the judgment bearing date the 24th day of February, 1891, (this is the order of reference) the report of the said referee, the evidence, depositions and exhibits taken and put in at the trial and before the said referee * * * * and upon hearing counsel for both parties, and judgment having been reserved until this day, it is ordered that the said appeal be and the same is hereby dismissed with costs to be paid to the plaintiff by the defendants and that the defendants do pay to the plaintiff the sum of $600 damages with interest from the date of said report, and that the defendants do pay to the plaintiff his costs of this action including the costs of the reference forthwith after taxation thereof.\nThis judgment upon its face appears to me to show (although it is said to be made upon hearing read the pleadings in the action, the referee\u2019s report and the evidence, depositions and exhibits taken or put in at the trial and before the said referee), that the learned judge by whom the judgment was pronounced dealt with the motion for judgment as if the order of reference had vested in the referee jurisdiction to adjudicate upon and determine the action and the issues joined therein, or as if the order had been made under sec. 102 and not under sec. 101 of the Judicature Act.\nIn so far as the question arising upon the present appeal is concerned it may be admitted, that (no notice of appeal having been served within fourteen days from the filing of the referee\u2019s report) that report became absolute at the expiration of the fourteen days as to the mere matters of fact referred to the referee to inquire into and report upon for the information of the court and to enable it to adjudicate upon and determine the action and the issue joined therein, and that therefore the defendants were too late in moving against the report, whether for the improper rejection or reception of evidence, or for a reference back to the same or another referee, and so that the motion of the defendants by way of appeal from the report was properly dismissed; but neither that dismissal, nor rule 848, nor rule 40, as amended by 1288, nor any other rule, had the effect of extending the jurisdiction of a referee to whom a reference was made under sec. 101 of the Judicature Act one iota beyond what was contained in that section itself; or relieved the court in which the action was pending from the duty of primarily adjudicating upon and determining the action and the issue therein, or from perusing and considering the evidence for the purpose of determining whether any of the findings of the referee upon any matter affecting the proper determination of the action and the issue therein appeared to be inferences drawn by him from the evidence, or (in case they should so appear to be) of relieving the court from the duty of drawing the inference which should appear to the court to be the proper inference to be drawn, irrespective of the findings of the referee in relation to such matters. Those rules are adopted for carrying into effect the purposes of the Act and do not extend the jurisdiction conferred by the Act.\nFrom the above judgment the defendants appealed to the Court of Appeal for Ontario.\nThe majority of the learned judges of that court, as appears by their judgment pronounced by the Chief Justice, plainly dealt with the case as if the action and the issue therein had been referred by the order of reference to the referee to adjudicate upon and determine; they seem to have felt themselves bound by the finding of the referee, not only upon the existence of the matters of fact from which he has drawn the infer- ence that the defendants were guilty of the negligence charged in the statement of claim, but they treat as conclusive the inference drawn by him that these matters of fact existing constitute the negligence charged by the plaintiff in the action and denied by the defendants, the sole material issue in the action. They thus adopt the finding of the referee, 1st, as in the 1st subsection of the 11th paragraph of his report is found, namely, that the construction of the Richmond drain and the diverting thereby and carrying water across the 4th concession which would not come there in a state of nature, and providing no sufficient outlet at Cedar Creek, as recommended by their engineer, constituted negligence of which the defendants were guilty and for which they were liable to a judgment being rendered against them in this action, although the statement of claim admits that the said Richmond drain was constructed upon plans, specifications and a by-law made, adopted, and passed respectively under the provisions of the Municipal Acts of Ontario in that behalf. Now the finding, that the not providing a sufficient outlet as recommended by their engineer for a drain so constructed constituted negligence for which the defendants were responsible in this action, is plainly an inference drawn as an inference of law, the correctness of which can only be tested by considering the nature of the alleged recommendation of the engineer and the time of its being made. Mr. Justice Burton, who dissents from the judgment of the majority, points out that the nature of the recommendation, and the time of its being made, were such that it is impossible to hold that negligence of the defendants is a just, proper and legal inference to be drawn from the facts from which it was drawn, and indeed there can, think, be no doubt upon this point, for the matters of fact upon which the referee proceeded in drawing this in- ference of negligence were all before the court for their consideration upon the question whether the negligence of the defendants was or was not a proper and legal inference to be drawn from them, and these facts appear to have been as follows:\u2014\nUpon the 8th August, 1885, the engineer reported to the council of the defendant municipality that the contractor on the contract for the Cedar Creek outlet of the drain had performed the work in conformity with the by-law, and that he was entitled to the full amount of the contract money under the terms of his contract, except one item of extra work, a certificate for which would be given when completed.\nThen upon the 2nd November, 1885, the same engineer made a report to the council recommending them to pass another by-law for certain work, which he suggested should be performed at a cost of $2,500, whereby the drain as then almost completely constructed under the by-law passed for its construction would, in the opinion of the engineer, be much improved.\nThen upon the 2nd January, 1886, he made another report to the council, whereby he reported that the contractor for the construction of the Richmond drain (the same contractor as was named in his report of the 8th August, 1885) had performed all the work on the Richmond drain, \u201crequired by the plans and specifications for the construction of the same as adopted by the council of the township,\u201d and in this report he adds: \u201cThe drain in the whole is a success and I think will eventually fulfil all the advantages claimed for it.\u201d How, under these circumstances, the non-action of the council upon their engineer\u2019s report of the 2nd November, 1885, can be held in law to constitute negligence of the defendants in the construction of the Richmond drain, which was then already almost completed and by the 2nd November, 1886, was actually completed as required by the plans and specifications for the construction of the same as adopted by the council, is, I confess, to my mind inconceivable. The majority of the Court of Appeal appear to me to have construed this part of the referee\u2019s report as a finding, that in point of fact the defendants left the outlet of the drain in Cedar Creek insufficient, contrary to the recommendation of their engineer, as appearing in the plans and specifications adopted by the by-law for the construction of the drain, and to have considered themselves bound by that finding so construing it, but with great deference this view cannot be supported either in point of law or as being stated in the referee\u2019s report as a matter of fact so found by him to be. Then again, 2nd, the judgment of the majority of the Court of Appeal approves of the inference of negligence of the defendants as charged in the statement of claim as a fair and legitimate inference from the matter stated by the referee in the second subsection of the 11th paragraph of his report as his second reason for the finding the defendants to be guilty of negligence and liable to the plaintiff therefor in this action, namely, that the defendants \u201cin cutting or permitting the said embankment to be cut, thereby causing the McLean drain to be connected with the Richmond drain and allowing the waters from the said Richmond drain to flow into and overcharge the said McLean drain, thereby overflowing the plaintiff\u2019s land.\u201d As to this reason for holding the defendants to be liable in this action as for the negligence with which they are charged by the plaintiff in his statement of claim, it is to be observed that the embankment was not, and in point of fact was not claimed, or found, to have been, part of the plan adopted for the construction of the Richmond drain or of the McLean drain; on the contrary it is by the statement of claim stated to have been, and by the referee\u2019s report found as matter of fact to have been, erected in pursuance of an agreement entered into between the municipalities of North and South Colchester, to which agreement it is not found or suggested that the plaintiff was a party, and the object of its erection was to try and prevent thereby damage to lands in North Colchester which the Richmond drain after its completion was found to be insufficient to prevent. Whether the defendants\u2019 cutting or permitting to be cut an embankment so erected, assuming it to be established as matter of fact that they did so, constituted negligence of the defendants as charged against them in the plaintiff\u2019s statement of claim, or indeed any wrong giving to the plaintiff a right in law to recover in this action, or in any action, involves a question of law which cannot by possibility be determined without reference to the evidence in relation to the erection of the embankment and to the alleged cutting or permitting the same to be cut, all of which was before the courts, both the Divisional Court and the Court of Appeal, and thereby it appears that the embankment was erected without any authority in law for its being erected across the land of one Hiram Walker, who was one of the persons assessed for the construction of the Richmond drain, and that by its erection he was prevented from draining his land, as he had a right to do, into the said drain, and for that reason he, in successful assertion of his right in law so to do, cut through the embankment upon his own land, whereby and by the washing away of a part of the embankment as stated in the plaintiff\u2019s statement of claim, by force of the waters in the Richmond drain in heavy rains, that drain became again connected with the McLean drain, as by the original design and plan for the construction of the Richmond drain was intended and effected, as indeed sufficiently appears in the plaintiff\u2019s statement of claim. Now it is impossible to hold in point of law, that, assuming it to be established as matter of fact that the defendants did cut through such an embankment, their so doing could be pronounced to be negligence, either in the construction of the Richmond drain or of the embankment itself, for which the defendants would be liable in this action, or that their so doing would constitute any actionable wrong whatever to the plaintiff.\nThen as to the third reason given by the referee for the conclusion arrived at by him, as stated in the 11th paragraph of his report, namely, that the defendants were guilty of the negligence charged against them in the plaintiff\u2019s statement of claim, the judgment of the majority of the Court of Appeal does not deal with it in particular, but in dismissing the appeal of the defendants from the judgment of the Divisional Court, which proceeded upon the adoption of the referee\u2019s report, they seem also to have adopted that report in omnibus, both in point of law and of fact, yet it cannot, I think, admit of a doubt that the referee\u2019s third reason is no more than finding, as matter of fact by implication, that the Richmond drain, constructed according to its design and plan of construction, brought down such a volume of water and with such velocity into the 5th concession as to overflow the plaintiff\u2019s land therein, which is neither the cause of action alleged in the statement of claim, nor is it an actionable wrong done to the plaintiff by the defendants, so that it is impossible that the judgment in favour of the plaintiff in this action can be sustained for the reason stated in the third subsection of the 11th paragraph of the referee\u2019s report; and upon the whole, for the reasons I have given, I am of opinion that the judgment of the Divisional Court in favour of the plaintiff cannot be sustained, and that this appeal must be allowed with costs and judgment be ordered to be entered for the defendants in the Divisional Court in the action with costs.\nThe enormous delay which has taken place, and the frightful expense which has been incurred in the prosecution and defence of this action, is deplorable in the extreme, but I cannot help saying that I think this delay and expense have been due to an inconsiderate reference to a referee of matters which, in view of the statements made in the statement of claim, and the single matter of defence pleaded in answer thereto upon which issue was joined, now appear to have been very simple, and which, if tried before a judge, with or without a jury, could have been disposed of in a very short time and at a comparatively insignificant expense. The reference to a referee has, on the contrary, resulted in the production of a printed volume containing upwards of 450 pages of evidence, of which I think it may safely be said that nine-tenths is irrelevant and never could have been admitted, if the issue in the action had been tried before a judge with or without a jury.\nAs to the case of Freeborn v. Vandusen[14], upon the authority of which the learned judge of the Divisional Court proceeded, it is to be observed, that the matters referred there were of a very different character from those referred by the order in the present case; they were not in truth matters referable under section 101 at all, although by what appears to have been a singular mistake the first paragraph of the order refers to that section. It must be obvious, that such reference to the section could not make the reference to be within the section, if the essential matter referred was of a nature not within the section, which was the case in Freeborn v. Vandusen14. The action was to remove a defendant, who had been appointed by the court jointly with the plaintiff a trustee of an estate, from his office as such trustee, and for an account of his dealings with the estate. The court made an order the second paragraph of which contained the whole gist and substance of the order, which was in the nature of a decretal order and comprehended within itself a judgment upon every matter involved in the action, and a reference to the master as in the ordinary case of a reference after judgment, to carry it into effect. The paragraph ordered as follows:\nThat it be referred to the master to take the accounts of the defendant, and to appoint a trustee to act with the plaintiff, James S. Freeborn, in the place and stead of the defendant, who was to be removed upon the new appointment, such appointment not to take effect until confirmation of the report.\nNow plainly such a reference was not at all one coming under section 101, and, with deference, it was in my opinion quite a mistake in such an order, which involved in itself a judgment upon the whole matter involved in the action, to have inserted anything in relation to section 101, as was done in the first paragraph of the order.\nNow the learned Chancellor\u2019s judgment, that the master\u2019s report upon the matter so as above referred was to be regarded in the same light, and to have the same effect, as any other report of the master upon a reference after judgment, to give effect to the judgment, that is a truism which may readily be conceded, and it must I think be to the matters so expressly referred by the order that the judgment of the Chancellor is to be construed as applying and not to the case of a simple regular reference merely for inquiry and report under section 101.\nIf the learned Chancellor had ruled that in the case of such a simple reference like the present under section 101, if the referee should assume to report upon and to find and determine matters beyond the scope of the reference, and should assume the functions of a judge by affecting to adjudicate upon and determine the action and the issues therein, as was done in the present case, that such report is to be regarded in the same light, and of like effect as the report of a master upon a reference after judgment, or as a report upon a reference made under section 102, and should be binding upon the court, I must say that, in my opinion, such a judgment would have been quite erroneous and should be reversed as subversive of the plain intention of the legislature in enacting the clauses of the Judicature Act in relation to the different kinds of references thereby authorized; but the special character of the reference in Freeborn v. Vandusen[15] removes all necessity of construing the Chancellor\u2019s judgment therein as having any application to the case of a simple reference like that in the present case for inquiry merely and report for the information of the court under section 101, to aid the court in rendering judgment on the action.\nSEDGEWICK J.\u2014I concur in the judgment of the Chief Justice. The appeal should be dismissed.\nKING J.\u2014I am of opinion that this appeal should be dismissed with costs for the reasons stated in the judgment of the Chief Justice.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellants: A.H.

It was probably not known at the time how much land the railway company would acquire at the station in question. The deed grants a piece of land near the Enfield station of the Intercolonial Railway, in the province of Nova Scotia. As to the limits of this piece of land there is no dispute. The deed then proceeds to grant a further piece by the following description:\nAlso a strip of land twenty-five links wide, running from the eastern side of the aforesaid lot along the northern side of the railway eastward about twelve rods unto the western end of the railway station ground, the said lot and strip together containing one acre, more or less.\nThere is no dispute as to the site of the eastern side of the piece of land first granted by the deed. The question is merely whether the piece secondly described is to be limited by the precise distance of twelve rods from the eastern limit of the piece first granted, or to be continued until the western end of the railway station ground at Enfield is reached. As to what is the western end of the station ground mentioned in this description, the evidence admits of no doubt that it is a line bounding on the west a greater width of land taken at the station for station grounds, and which crosses the piece of land 25 links in width granted by the deed if, in the words of the deed, the land granted reaches the west end of the station grounds, What is granted is plainly a piece of land 25 links in width, the southerly limit of which is the northerly limit of 100 feet in width taken outside of the station grounds for the roadway, which northerly limit of the railway the piece granted goes \"along\" until it reaches the western limit of the station grounds, which must therefore be a line along the west end of the station ground and crossing the space 25 links in width and so terminating the piece intended to be granted, and which is, as I think, plainly expressed in the deed. This view is confirmed by the description contained in the deed under which the plaintiff claims, which, while it shows that the plaintiff had not conveyed to him the piece in dispute, affirms that it had been conveyed to Sims.\nThe plaintiff claimed under a deed from one Henry F. Donaldson, who claimed under the said Henry Donaldson, bearing date the 14th day of October, 1878, in which the piece of land thereby conveyed is described as follows:\nBeginning at the northern side of the railway ground at a point situate ten links from the south-east angle of the saloon occupied on the 1st of September, 1868, by the said Henry F. Donaldson, from thence to run north sixteen degrees west one chain and seventy-five links, thence south twenty-three degrees west four chains and thirteen links to James Sims' lot, thence by the said James Sims' lot south two degrees west one chain and sixty-five links to the north side of the said James Sims' road, thence by the said James Sims' road and the railway ground eastward four chains and ninety links to the place of beginning.\nThe point of commencement of this description is, by the plan in evidence, plainly shown to be in the northern limit, not of the space of 100 feet in width occupied by the railway outside of the station grounds, but the northern limit of a space of much greater width occupied as station ground at Enfield and north of the northern limit of the Sims's road produced eastward, and such point is shown to be ten links only distant from the south-east angle of the building mentioned and shown on the plan. Then the point reached in the description and spoken of as \"the northern side of the said James Sims's road,\" is the precise point of commencement and northern limit of the piece of land 25 links in width granted to Sims by the deed of November, 1867; from that point in the northern limit of said James Sims's land, the description of the land conveyd to the plaintiff proceeds \"thence by,\" (that is, along) \"the said James Sims's road eastward four chains and ninety links to the place of beginning,\" which being a point in the northern limit of the station ground and north of the northern limit of said James Sims's road, the description plainly indicates that the course eastward from the point reached in the northern side of the said James Sims's road is along such northern side of the said road, that is, of the piece of 25 links in width granted by the deed of November, until the northern limit of that road or piece of land so granted intersects the western limit of the station ground, and thence along such limit until the place of beginning is reached.\nThis appears to be the plain intention of both of the deeds, and the appeal therefore must be allowed with costs, and judgment be ordered to be entered for the defendant in the court below.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014I am not very clear as to this case. However, the appellant has failed to convince me that there is error in the judgment. I would dismiss the appeal.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for appellant: W. A.

Taschereau J. dissenting.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1], reversing the judgment of the Divisional Court[2], in favour of the plaintiffs.\nThe action in this case was brought to obtain a declaration of title to land and the only question raised on the appeal was as to defendant\u2019s title, he claiming under a deed from his brother who was devisee of the land under his wife\u2019s will and who had been convicted of manslaughter and sentenced to imprisonment for killing his wife. The Court of Appeal held that the brother did not forfeit his devise by the crime as the conviction for manslaughter negatived an intent to kill.\nS.H. Blake Q.C. for the appellants. There is no distinction between murder and manslaughter in a case like the present. Riggs v. Palmer[3]; New York Mutual Co. v. Armstrong[4]. The principle upon which a devise fails in such a case is that one cannot profit by his own wrong. Cleaver v. Mutual Reserve Fund Life Association[5].\nAylesworth Q.C. and Murphy for the respondent. A devise will not lapse in a case such as this unless the devisee had the intention, of hastening the operation of the will. Here the crime was manslaughter which negatives felonious intent. Harris on Criminal Law[6]; and see Clark v. Hagar[7].\nThe judgment of the majority of the court was delivered by:\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014The facts are fully set forth in the judgment of Mr. Justice Ferguson, which has been reversed by the Court of Appeal.\nIn the view I take it will not be necessary to consider the question of the construction of the will, which was one of the subjects discussed in the courts below.\nI am of opinion that Mr. Justice Ferguson was entirely right in holding that the respondent, Joseph Lundy, who claims as assignee of James B. Lundy, is not entitled to the benefit of a devise contained in the will of Clementina, the wife of James B. Lundy, made in favour of her husband. The testatrix was killed by her husband, who was convicted of manslaughter therefor and sentenced to twenty years imprisonment. Subsequently to the commission of the felony for which he was so convicted and condemned James B. Lundy conveyed the land now in question, which had been devised to him by his wife, to his brother, the present respondent, Joseph Lundy.\nMr. Justice Ferguson was of opinion, that no devisee could take under the will of a testator whose death had been caused by the criminal and felonious act of the devisee himself, and that in applying this rule no distinction can be made between a death caused by murder and one caused by manslaughter, both offences having been formerly felonies.\nThe Court of Appeal drew a distinction between murder and manslaughter, and held that whilst the devisee would forfeit any gift under the will of the person whose death he had caused by an act which amounted to the crime of murder, he still might take in the case of manslaughter.\nI cannot agree in the conclusion of the Court of Appeal, nor in the reasoning by which that conclusion was arrived at. The reasoning of the court would seem to me rather to apply to a case of justifiable or excusable homicide than to a case of manslaughter. The principle upon which the devisee is held incapable of taking under the will of the person he kills is, that no one can take advantage of his own wrong. Then surely an act for which a man is convicted of manslaughter and sentenced to a long term of imprisonment was a wrongful, illegal and formerly (when felonies were recognized as forming a particular class of offences) a felonious act. I can see no principle on which to rest the decision of the Court of Appeal, and I can find no authority in support of it. On the contrary, the case of Cleaver v. Mutual Reserve Fund Life Association[8], proceeds upon reasons which admit of no such distinction as has been made by the judgment appealed against in the present case. That was itself a case of murder, but the Lord Justices lay no stress on the crime being a premeditated one, and indeed Lord Justice Fry uses language which indicates, as the ground of his decision, a principle which would include all wrongful acts, not merely felonies but misdemeanours, and this sound principle of universal jurisprudence the Lord Justice states in the following language:\nNo system of jurisprudence can with reason include among the rights which it enforces rights directly resulting to the person asserting them from the crime of that person. If no action can arise from fraud, it seems impossible to suppose that it can arise from felony or misdemeanour.\nTaking the principle thus expounded as my ratio decidendi, I am of opinion that the judgment of Mr. Justice Ferguson was right and must be restored.\nThe appeal is allowed with costs.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014I would dismiss this appeal. I adopt the reasoning of the learned judges of the court a quo who unanimously concurred in the opinion that this case does not fall under the maxim that nullus commodum capere potest de injuri\u00e2 su\u00e2 propri\u00e2, no one can profit by his own wrong, or get a benefit from his criminal act. The fallacy of the appellants\u2019 case is, it seems to me, apparent. They assume that it is from the homicide that Lundy, the husband, derives, or attempts to derive any benefit. Now, first, I do not see any evidence of it in the record. It may be that his wife, after being wounded, lived for weeks or months, in a perfect state of ability to make a new will, and if that was so, I do not see upon what principle her previous will in favour of her husband would not be perfectly valid. For it cannot be denied, I presume, that a will by any one in favour of the person who killed him is good, if made in the interval between the wound and the death. And, if she could have altered her will and did not do it, she must have persevered in her intention to bequeath her estate to her husband, though she knew his crime. So that the appellants here cannot succeed except upon the assumption that she did not have time to change her will after being wounded, and that, for there is no evidence of it, I do not see why we should assume.\nBut leaving that aside, and taking it for granted that she was killed on the spot, the appellants want us to assume that she would have altered her will if she could have done so. Upon what principle of law we can so assume I fail to see. She did not revoke her will, and how can we say that she would have revoked it had she been able to do it?\nA life insurance fund is on a different footing. There it is the death that creates the fund, if I may use that expression. But here it is not rights resulting directly from his crime, to use the words of Fry L.J. in the Cleaver case, that Lundy gets under his wife\u2019s will.\nIf Lundy, the husband, had died before trial or conviction, and left a will, would not his will be good and valid to transmit, his wife\u2019s estate that he came to under her will?\nUnder the civil law the rules on the subject are quite different. Articles 610 and 893 of the Quebec code, and 727 of the Code Napol\u00e9on re-enact the common law upon it. Demolombe[9]. But, under the English law, the appellants have failed to convince me that there is room here for the application of the doctrine they invoke.\nAnd, it may not be amiss to remark, the rule of the civil law is not applicable to a will based on the maxim that nemo ex suo delicto meliorem suam conditionem facere potest, but on the presumption that the deceased would have disinherited his slayer or revoked his will, if he had had time to do so, and on grounds of public policy.\nThe Cleaver case does not help the appellants\u2019 contentions. It is a totally different case. The learned judges in the Court of Appeal have pointed out the distinctions between the two cases. The American cases cited appear to be somewhat favourable to the appellants\u2019 contentions, but they are not law here, and were it necessary, they might easily be distinguished from this one.\nOne additional remark. This case is governed by the law as it stood before the Criminal Code, art. 965. And though there was no \u201cinquest of office, or office found\u201d have the appellants a locus standi? They have no right to the personal estate, I assume. Reg. v. Whitehead[10]. However, these points are not here in issue, and have not been argued.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Guthrie & Watt.\nSolicitors for the respondent: T. & W.

Bell had a prior lien on the fund in court for his costs.\nThe only question for decision on the appeal was whether or not the appellant, Teetzel, as solicitor of James J. Bell had a first lien for his costs as between solicitor and client on a fund in court arising from the sale of land belonging to the estate in administration of which, and in litigation to ascertain the construction of the will of the former owner, the said costs arose. The prior lien was contested on the ground that J.J. Bell had been ordered to pay costs personally to other parties to the litigation and that the lien could only attach to the balance remaining after these other parties were paid.\nThe referee before whom the administration proceedings were pending decided against the solicitor\u2019s priority. His decision was reversed by Mr. Justice Rose, but restored by the Court of Appeal.\nArmour Q.C. and McBrayne for the appellants. For the purposes of the lien the fund in court is in the same position as if it were in the solicitor\u2019s possession. Savage v. James[2].\nThe solicitor has a lien in priority to his client and must have priority over other parties. Haynes v. Cooper[3].\nWe cannot be deprived of our lien unless Ex parte Cleland[4] is overruled.\nLefroy for the respondents the Wrights, and Beck for Houghton and Clarke, referred to Pringle v. Gloag[5]; Canadian Bank of Commerce v. Crouch[6]; Brown v. Nelson[7].\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by:\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014I am of opinion that this appeal must be allowed, and the judgment of Mr. Justice Rose, who reversed the decision of the referee, must be restored.\nIn the first place, the referee had no jurisdiction to make the order or ruling which he states in his certificate, depriving the solicitor of James J. Bell of his lien for costs, and of his right to payment in virtue of that lien out of the share of his client payable under the ad- ministration decree. The authority of the referee to make such an order must be derived either under the administration decree or under some general order. I find no such direction in the administration order made by Mr. Justice Ferguson, which was reinstated by the judgment of this court and under which the referee was proceeding. Neither do I find any general order authorizing such an interference with the prim\u00e2 facie right of the solicitor to a fund which he had recovered for his client. The parties should have asked that the payment of costs should be provided for in this way by the decree. The general directions as to the powers and functions of the master, or referee, contained in the general order defining the jurisdiction of the master in taking accounts, does not, in my opinion, extend to a case like the present. It is not within the general direction to make just allowances.\nThe parties who are entitled to recover costs against James J. Bell are in no other or better position than any other creditors of his, and general creditors could not enforce an execution against this fund in court, which is just as much in the solicitor\u2019s hands as if it had been paid to him directly and personally instead of into court, except by way of execution by means of a charging or stop order. Had the fund actually gone into the solicitor\u2019s hands, it is out of the question to say that it could be taken from him by a judgment creditor to the prejudice of his lien.\nWhatever general observations of learned judges in some of the cases cited may seem to discountenance the view which I take, Lord Cairns L.J., in his considered judgment in Ex parte Cleland, In re Davies[8], points out, that to order a set off in such a case as that before him, and in such a case as the present, would be to disregard that principle of mutuality which is the essential basis of set off. In the present case, as soon as the fund in court was recovered a lien was by operation of law immediately attached to it in favour of the solicitor of James J. Bell. Therefore, if we are to regard this as a case of set off, it would be a set off against money in the hands of the court due to James J. Bell and his solicitor conjointly of money due by James J. Bell alone. It cannot be said that the solicitor\u2019s lien is subject to the rights of all creditors of the client before any set off is ordered. Take the simple case of a debt recovered in an action at law, the money being paid into the hands of the solicitor of the plaintiff, no creditor can touch that money until the solicitor\u2019s lien is first satisfied. Then, as I have before stated, the rights of a solicitor as to money in court are exactly the same as if it was in his own hands[9].\nIn the case of Ex parte Cleland[10], Lord Cairns gives expression to the principle I have propounded in the following short passage in his judgment:\nThe debt or claim, therefore, for costs is not the debt or claim of Cleland alone, it is in the view of a court of equity, and upon the principles of a court of equity, a debt or claim which has been assigned or encumbered, and the persons entitled to it are not Cleland alone, but Cleland and his solicitor, the claim of the solicitor being paramount to that of Cleland. That consideration, in my opinion, renders it impossible that the costs can be set off against the debt.\nI should say that this case of Ex parte Cleland10 does not appear to have been cited to the Court of Appeal.\nThis, it is true, is not strictly speaking a case of set off, but one in which execution against, or satisfaction out of, a fund is sought by creditors in priority to the solicitor, who recovered it, but viewed in that light, whilst the principle applied by Lord Cairns is also applicable here, its application is a fortiori. The appeal must be allowed and Mr. Justice Rose\u2019s order of the 8th of May, 1894, must be restored with costs to the appellants both here and in the Court of Appeal.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Teetzel, Harrison & McBrayne.\nSolicitors for the respondents the Wrights: Lefroy & Boulton.\nSolicitors for the respondents Houghton and Clarke: Beck & Code.\n[1] 16 Ont.

S. C. c. 135, s. 29 (b)\u201456 V. c 29 (D )\nBy R. S. C. c. 135 s. 29 (b), amended by 56 V. c. 29 (D) an appeal will lie to the Supreme Court of Canada from the judgments of the courts of highest resort in the province of Quebec, in cases where the amount in controvery is less than $2000 if the matter relates to any title to lands or tenements, annual rents and other matters or things where the rights in future might be bound.\nHeld that the words \"other matters or things \" mean rights of property analogous to title to lands, &c, which are specifically mentioned and not personal rights; that \"title \" means a vested right or title already acquired though the enjoyment may be postponed; and that the right of a married woman to an annuity provided by her marriage contract in case she should become a widow is not a right in future which would authorize an appeal in an action by her husband against her for s\u00e9paration de corps in which if judgment went against her the right to the annuity would be forfeited\nMOTION to quash appeal for want of jurisdiction.\nThe action in the case was brought by the appellant for separation de corps from his wife, the respondent. By the Superior Court the separation asked for was granted but on appeal to the Court of Queen's Bench that decision was reversed and the action dismissed. The plaintiff then sought to appeal to this court and a motion was made to quash such appeal.\nFitzpatrick Q.C. for the motion.\nMcCarthy Q.C. and Lemieux Q.C. contra. The judgment of the court was delivered by :\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE. This action was instituted in the Superior Court by the present appellant against his wife, the respondent, for separation de corps. The cause was heard by the Honourable Chief Justice of the Superior Court, Sir Louis Casault, who rendered judgment granting the conclusions taken by the appellant. From this judgment the respondent took an appeal to the Court of Queen's Bench which court allowed the appeal, reversed the judgment of the Superior Court, and dismissed the action. From that judgment the present appeal has been-taken. This the respondent has moved to quash for want of jurisdiction.\nAppeals to this court from the province of Quebec are regulated by section 29 of the Supreme Court Act, Neither in this section nor in any other part of the Act, is there any Specific reference to actions of this class\nThe first paragraph of section 29 prohibits appeals when the matter in controversy does not amount to $2,000. Here the matter in controversy is not in the nature of a pecuniary demand it is true that the respondent's claim to certain furniture specified in an inventory attached to the marriage contract of the parties (under which they were married with a stipulation that they should be separate as to property) might incidentally be affected by the result of the action if that should be ultimately decided against the respondent. It is also true, that her contingent right to an annuity provided by the marriage contract as a provision for the respondent during widowhood in case she should survive her husband would also be forfeited by a judgment adverse to her. The jurisdiction cannot however be founded on the claim relating to the furniture, for the reason that it does not appear to be of the value of $2,000. Subsection (b) of section 29 is as follows :\nUnless the matter, if less than that amount ($2,000), relates to any fee of office, duty, rent, revenue or any sum of money payable to Her Majesty, or to any title to lands or tenements, annual rents and other matters or things where the rights in future might be bound.\nIf an appeal is admissible in the present case the jurisdiction can only be referred to something contained in this sub-clause. The first part of the subsection relates to appeals in the case of claims by the Crown. It is out of the question to say that this appeal involves any title to land or to any annual rent, There only remains the words a and other matters or things where the rights in the future might be bound.\" I cannot hold that this confess jurisdiction. The other matters or things referred to must, on the ordinary rule of construction noscitur a sociis, be construed to mean matters and things ej'usdem generis with those specifically mentioned. Then these are \"title to lands and tenements and annual rents.\" We must therefore interpret the words \"other matters and things\" as meaning rights of property analogous to title to lands and annual rents, and not personal rights however important Nothing of this kind is however involved here I take the word \"title\" to mean a vested right or title something to which the right is already acquired, though the enjoyment may be postponed. Then there is no vested right to the annuity during widowhood in case the respondent should survive her husband, that is an eventual right which might or might not come to be acquired by the respondent, according to the happening or not happening of the contingency. I conclude therefore that there are no matters or things involved in the action ejusdem generis with those particularly enumerated.\nHad there been some actual right or title to lands or rents or other similar matters or things, incidentally involved in the action I should think it very doubtful if even that ought to have been sufficient to support the jurisdiction. To hold that there was jurisdiction for that reason in such a case as the present would be making an appeal, in a most important action in which the legislature had not thought fit to confer jurisdiction by a direct enactment, depend on subordinate incidents, in other words invert the usual order which requires that the accessory should follow the principal.\nIt is sufficient, however, for the present purpose to say that the appeal does not come within any of the provisions of section 29 inasmuch as the action does not involve an amount equal to $2,000, nor does it re late to any matters or things in the nature of vested property rights, which alone and not personal rights are intended by section 29 subsection (b) to be made the test of the right to appeal.\nThe appeal is quashed with costs.\nAppeal quashed with costs.\n"}

I am of opinion that this appeal must be dismissed. The parties were formerly in partnership in a business which was carried on in two departments, the carpet branch and the fancy goods branch. This partnership was dissolved and the appellant who was to continue the carpet branch of the business, undertook the winding up of that portion of the partnership affairs, and the respondent the winding up of the fancy goods part, which business he was to continue.\nThe agreement for winding up was verbal. Nothing was said expressly about remuneration for extra services Now the appellant seeks to make the respondent liable for salary and commission, alleging that his services in the winding up were much more laborious and onerous than those of the respondent.\nIt is a rule of the law of partnership, that a partner cannot charge for extra services rendered during the continuance of the partnership but this rule does not apply to extra services performed after a dissolution, in closing up the affairs of the firm ([1]). By extra services, however I understand to be meant work more than the partner claiming the allowance undertook to perform. If the business of the winding up is apportioned between the partners and each undertakes to perform the share allotted to him I take it tobe clear that one of them cannot after wards claim to be paid salary or other remuneration merely for the reason that his share of the work has been more laborious or difficult than that performed by his co-partner. The question here is therefore purely one of fact Was there an agreement or understanding that the appellant should give his time and attention to the matters which he actually did attend to and for which he now claims to be paid? No such agreement in express terms is proved, but it is not necessary that there should have been an express agreement; if one can be implied from the conduct of the parties that is enough. In the present case I think it is undoubtedly to be inferred that the appellant did take upon himself the exclusive management of all that portion of the business relating to the carpet branch, and, that being so, he must be understood as having so undertaken it on the implied understanding that he was to do this gratuitously. It was no doubt an advantage to the appellant, who was. to continue the carpet business, that he should have the sole control of all the relations with the customers who had dealt with the old firm in that department. Then the financial management for which the appellant claims extra remuneration was to a great extent connected with the carpet branch and at all events, I think the appellant must be taken to have agreed to attend to all the financial business connected with the winding up. If this was not his intention he should have expressly stipulated for remuneration. I cannot see any error in the judgment appealed against. The Court of Queen\u2019s Bench, acting on the rule de minimis non curat lex, refused to allow the appeal for the $25, part of the arbitration fees, and a fortiori we ought to do the same.\nThe appeal must be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellants : Davidson & Ritchie.\nSolicitors for respondents : Geoffrion, Dorion & Allan.\n[1] Lindley, 5 ed. p. 381.\n"}

Subsequently by a formal act of resiliation B. and M. aunulled the transfer of the half interest in the property made by B. to M. and formally relieved M. of all further obligation as proprietor par indivis for further advances toward the balance due the vendor and threw the burden of providing it entirely upon B.\nHeld, affirming the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada (appeal side) that the act of resiliation and the replacement of the title which it effected into the name of B. was a virtual abandonment on the part of M. of all previous investments made by him in the property or in the claims of others against that property of which he may have taken transfers.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada (appeal side) confirming a judgment of the Superior Court at Montreal (Gill J.), by which an incidental demand made by the appellant Murphy was dismissed.\nThe difficulties which gave rise to the litigation between the parties originated in two distinct transactions or real estate speculations one called \" the Barsalou transaction,\" on lot 615 in St. Mary's Ward, in the city of Montreal, and the other known as the \" Hall transaction \" and relating to property at the corner of St Catherine Street and Papineau Road in the same city.\nIn his factum and argument before the Supreme Court, the appellant abandoned that part of his claims which related to the Barsalou transaction and confined his demand to the sums due him by the respondent upon the Hall property venture.\nThe facts of the case which are somewhat complicated, are very clearly set out in the following reasons given by the Honourable Mr Justice Hall of the Court of Queen's Bench, when delivering the judgment of that court :\n\u201cThe two parties to this litigation were possessed of certain rights and interests in a property known as part of lot no. 615 in St. Mary's Ward, in this city. The title, which prior to 18th November, 1882, had been standing in the name of Bury was transferred on that day to Murphy, the appellant, and the respective rights of the parties in the property were determined and expressed by means of a written memorandum signed by both. The property was sold by Murphy for the sum of $13,382600, most of which remained in the purchaser's hands, under stipulations and conditions which Bury considered only as concerted methods on the part of Murphy to deprive him of his rights in the proceeds. Bury thereupon took an action against Murphy and the purchaser, asking that the imputation of payment in the deed be declared fraudulent, and that the purchaser be ordered to retain all the balance of purchase money in his hands until the court should determine the precise amount of Bury's interest therein. A subsequent action was taken by Bury against Murphy, for an account. The first action was dismissed in the Superior Court upon the ground that Bury, having trusted Murphy with his interest in the property for the purpose of selling it, had no longer an actual right of property in the land, or its proceeds, but only a recourse against Murphy in the nature of an action to account. That judgment was confirmed by the Court of Queen's Bench upon the ground that if Bury's right were a 'jus ad rem,' the ' motif of the judgment was correct, while if it were a 'jus in re,' Bury had no right, under the procedure of this province, to attach even his own property once out of his possession without an attachment saisie revendication, or saisie-arr\u00eat based in either case, upon affidavit, and hence that his action should under any circumstances, be dismissed. The Supreme Court, considering apparently that the only point in litigation was the question as to whether Bury's right was a ' jus ad rem ' or a l jus in re ' ranged itself upon the side of the latter contention and reversed the judgment without reference to the point of procedure upon which this court had principally relied ([1]). In the meantime Murphy, after first disputing his liability, had eventually been condemned to render the account called for by this second action had rendered it and had been found liable toward Bury in the sum of $5343 under the terms of the ' contre-lettre ' In connection with and diminution of his account, Murphy had brought forward certain claims against Bury to the extent, including interest, of $15,533.30 principally arising out of another transaction. These claims had been ruled ont by the court as inadmissible under the order to render an account in connection with Murphy's contre-lettre but his right had been reserved to urge the same claims by means of an incidental demand, a right of which he hastened to avail himself. That incidental demand having been contested by Bury was eventually dismissed by the judgment from which the present appeal has been taken. The items of which it is composed are based upon transactions relating to two separate properties, in connection with which these two parties Bury and Murphy had most intimate and complicated relations extending over a long term of years, one called the ' Hall property ' at the corner of St. Catherine Street and Papineau Road the other called l lot 615 ' St. Mary's \"Ward, already referred to. These properties were acquired in the year 1874, in the name of Bury. but it is apparent and is indeed admitted that the transactions were speculations in which Bury and Murphy were equally interested. It is alleged by Bury that the terms of the agreement between them were that he Bury should devote his attention to the selection, purchase, management and sale of these properties while Murphy should provide the capital necessary for securing and holding them until sales should be effected a delay which both expected to be only temporary, but owing to a collapse in the real estate ' boom,' the speculation proved a protracted burden and in the end a serious loss s\n[The learned judge, after dealing with the lot 615 transaction, continued as follows] :\n\u201cAll the other items of the appellant's incidental demand are based upon the transaction in regard to the Hall property speculation. The title to that property had also been taken in the name of respondent Bury and the first instalment of the purchase money had also been acquired in a similar way from P. A. Murphy, the appellant's brother, to whom an obligation for $4000 was given by Bury. On the succeeding day Bury transferred a half interest in the property to the appellant Murphy who thereby became liable for one-half the amount of the mortgage to his brother and also for the same proportion of the balance of the purchase money still due to the original vendor Miss Hall. As the instalments of the latter obligation fell due suits were taken by Miss Hall against Bury, with whom alone she had contracted but as fast as these demands assumed the form of a judgment, the appellant Murphy advanced the requisite amount and took a transfer of them as he did also of P. A. Murphy's obligation against Bury, but without any signification in either case, thereby confirming to a certain extent Bury's pretensions that the appellant undertook the financial burden of carrying the properties as his contribution to the partnership speculation. On the 10th March 1879, by a formal act the two parties Bury and Murphy annulled the transfer of a half interest in the property which Bury had made to Murphy on the 22nd of July 1875. This resiliation by its terms formally relieved Murphy of all further obligation as proprietor par indivis for further advances toward the balance of about $12000 still due to Miss Hall and threw the burden of providing it entirely upon Bury.\n\"What were the liabilities, if any, of Bury to Murphy after this resiliation for advances previously made by the latter in connection with the Hall property ? Recognizing even the transfer to appellant of P. A. Murphy's claim for the first instalment toward. the purchase money, and adding to it the four judgments in favour of Miss Hall for other instalments, which appellant paid - the total amounted to about $6,500, and as under the terms of their agreement, appellant assumed one-half the cost his total advances on this property on Bury's account only reached the sum of $3 250. At the time when this resiliation took place, 1879, real estate was very much depressed in value and the speculation was admittedly a losing one. Respondent says that appellant voluntarily surrendered and abandoned what he had already paid on the property as an inducement to respondent to take it over and relieve him from any further liability upon it, and it seems to us as it did to Mr. Justice Gill, a much more reasonable assumption than the pretension of appellant that Bury not only relieved him without any consideration whatever from further liability in a disastrous speculation, but actually undertook to return to him (appellant) not only the $3250 which he had advanced for Bury but a like amount which he (Murphy) had paid on his own account. The transactions between the parties were of the most complicated description. If any plain, satisfactory and in controvertible interpretation of their meaning and effect were possible, the courts would not have been called upon to adjudicate upon them. As it is we are compelled to draw the most reasonable conclusion possible from a series of transactions which seem for some purpose or other to have been purposely or at least unnecessarily complicated and the solution which most commends itself to our judgment is that for which the respondent contends and which was adopted by the learned judge who adjudicated upon the case in the court below viz. that the act of resiliation of the 10th March, 1879, and the replacement of the title which that effected, into the name of the respondent, was a virtual abandonment on the part of the appellant of all previous investments made by him in the property or in the claims of others against that property of which he may have taken transfers, for the consideration therein expressed, viz. : I In order to be acquitted and discharged of the several obligations by him assumed by virtue of said sale.' It is true that afterwards the appellant again advanced to Miss Hall the amount of another judgment, $702.50, against Bury for another instalment of interest upon the unpaid balance of the purchase money, but although paid subsequently it was for interest one instalment of which had matured before the act of resiliation and the other was about to mature within a very few days of that date and its subsequent payment by appellant was to the extent of one-half only the discharge of his personal obligation and for the other half undoubtedly in fulfilment of his very natural undertaking to relieve Bury from all prior or then maturing interest, in consideration of the latter's taking the property and relieving Murphy from all future liability either for principal or interest.\n\"The result is that the judgment dismissing appellant's incidental demand in the Superior Court is confirmed. A. majority of the court see no reason to differ from the conclusion of Mr. Justice Grill that the lack of signification of the different transfer$ under which appellant claimed to have acquired obligations and judgments against the respondent Bury, without signification upon the latter, would alone have been a valid defence against any legal demand based thereon and the judgment ' a quo ' might have been confirmed upon this consid\u00e9rant alone, treated as a preliminary objection, without investigation of the facts and respective pretensions of the parties, but the whole case having been carefully considered we have deemed it best to state our views at length upon the merits of the issues and only incidentally upon the legal objection founded upon lack of signification.\n\u201cMr. Justice Boss\u00e9 concuss in the above notes except in regard to signification, which under the special cir cumstances of this case he thinks was unnecessary\" The portions of the judgment of the Superior Court, more particularly relating to the Hall transaction, are as follows ;\n\u201cConsid\u00e9rant 2o. Que quant aux autres item qui ont rapport \u00e0 la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 Hall, il y eut une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 form\u00e9e \u00eatre les parties pour la dite propri\u00e9t\u00e9, et que Murphy s'\u00e9tait oblige de payer la moiti\u00e9 de l'obligation que sou fr\u00e8re, P. A. Murphy, avait sur la dite propri\u00e9t\u00e9, c'est-\u00e0-dire l'item susdit de $4,000 et la moiti\u00e9 de l'hypoth\u00e8que de Melle.

Que par l'acte du 10 mars 1879 entre les dites parties, devant Mtre L. O. H\u00e9tu, notaire, qui a mis fin \u00e0 la dite soci\u00e9t\u00e9, Murphy a abandonn\u00e9 tout recours contre Bury pour les cr\u00e9ances qu'il pouvait avoir contre la dite soci\u00e9t\u00e9 et par suite contre Bury par le fait qu'il annulait l'acte par lequel ii \u00e9tait devenu propri\u00e9taire de la moiti\u00e9 indivise de la dite propri\u00e9t\u00e9 Hall associ\u00e9 en icelle afin d'\u00eatre d\u00e9charg\u00e9 des obligations qu'il avait assum\u00e9es en y entrant, sans faire aucune r\u00e9serve quant aux paiements qu'il pouvait avoir faits pour acquitter la propri\u00e9t\u00e9, abandonnant le tout parce qu'ii voyait qu'il ne pouvait y faire que des pertes ;\n\u201c4o. Qu'\u00e0 tout \u00e9v\u00e9nement Murphy ne peut demander paiement \u00e0 Bury d'aucune de ses dites pr\u00e9tendues cr\u00e9ances hypoth\u00e9caires acquises par transports et subrogations, parce qu'il n'a jamais fait signifier ces transports et subrogations au dit Bury ;\n'' Consid\u00e9rant en effet qu'en effectuant les dits paiements, Murphy acquittait sa propre dette pour la moiti\u00e9, et pour le surplus ne pouvait qu'\u00eatre subrog\u00e9 contre la soci\u00e9t\u00e9, et le moyen de faire valoir ses droits contre son associ\u00e9 serait par l'action pro socio ;\n\u201cConsid\u00e9rant qu'en tenant compte des faits de la cause et les circonstances sous lesquelles se trouvaient les sp\u00e9culations de terrain en ce temps et endroit-l\u00e0, et d'apr\u00e8s le texte de l'acte lui-m\u00eame l'interpr\u00e9tation \u00e0 donner au dit acte du 10 mars 1879 est bien que Murphy a abandonn\u00e9e tous droits \u00e0 la dite propri\u00e9t\u00e9 Hall en perdant ce qu'il y avait mis ;\n\u201cConsid\u00e9rant que s'il n'y a pas eu soci\u00e9t\u00e9, et encore qu'il y aurait eu soci\u00e9t\u00e9 elle n'affecterait pas le dernier item en date du 22 novembre, 1880 et post\u00e9rieur \u00e0 la dissolution il est certain que le demandeur incident ne peut r\u00e9ussir pour aucun des dits items parce que ses transports et subrogations n'ont jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 signifi\u00e9s an d\u00e9fendeur incident, ainsi que l'exigent les articles 1571 et 2127 du C. C. et la jurisprudence de la Cour d'Appel, avant de pouvoir former sa demande en justice.\n\u201cPour ces motifs maintient les d\u00e9fenses du d\u00e9fendeur incident comme bien fond\u00e9es et d\u00e9boute le demandeur incident des conclusions de sa dite demande incidente avec d\u00e9pens, etc.\"\nBeique Q.C. and Monk Q.C. for appellant.\nBarnard Q.C. for respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by :\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014This appeal must fail. Upon the facts of the case as well as upon the construction of the deed of March, 1879, I adopt in its entirety the reasoning of Hall J., in the Court of Appeal and the consid\u00e9rants of the Superior Court. The appellant's incidental demand was rightly dismissed.\nIt is proper however that we should also sanction the law laid down by the two courts below on the necessity of the signification of a transfer or sale of a debt or right of action, as a condition precedent absolutely required to vest the transferee or purchaser with the full right of action against the debtor, the necessity of which signification is not removed by proof of knowledge by the debtor of the transfer or sale ; and it is when he issues his writ that all of a plaintiffs right of action, in any case, must have fully accrued. We also hold that the want of such signification is put in issue by a d\u00e9fense au fonds en fait,\nA repetition here of all the controversy, or a review of the authorities on the question, would be useless. It has been done in so many cases that I could add nothing now to it. When at the bar, I succeeded years ago as the attorney of the defendant, in the case of Mignot v. Reeds ([2]) in getting an action upon a transfer dismissed on demurrer for want of an allegation of the signification of the transfer. The juris prudence has since been far from uniform, though the case of Charlebois v. Forsyth ([3]) should have put an end to any controversy.\nWe hold with the two courts below, that the appellant's incidental demand could not in any case have been maintained for want of signification of the deeds of transfer and sale upon which his claim is based. There is undoubtedly great weight in the appellant's contention that there is no room for the application of that doctrine to the present case, for the reason that his claim is based on legal subrogation ([4]). But as on the merits his action must fail, it becomes unnecessary to further investigate that part of the case.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for appellant : F. D.

The controversy between the parties in this case relates to the control and editorship of a certain newspaper, called Le Progr\u00e8s de V Est, published in the city of Sherbrooke. To avoid confusion, owing to the similarity of names, I will call the plaintiff, respondent, simply Charles, and the defendant, appellant Arthur.\nThe document upon which Charles sues Arthur, is dated the 24th February 1890 and reads as follows ; The parties, plaintiff and defendant who had hereto fore published the said newspaper as partners, or joint owners :\nSe donnent mutuellement quittance de tous comptes et demandes \u2022pour toutes les affaires qu'elles ont fait ensemble comme \u00e9diteurs et propri\u00e9taires du journal Le Progr\u00e8s de l'Est, et imprimeurs, depuis l'entr\u00e9e du dit Arthur B\u00e9langer \u00e0 l'atelier jusqu'\u00e0 ce jour, et ce dernier s'engage \u00e0 acquitter seul les dettes contract\u00e9es an nom de B\u00e9langer et Compagnie do mani\u00e8re que le dit.

Le dit Charles B\u00e9langer devient, \u00e0 partir de ce jour, directeur et r\u00e9dacteur du dit journal son nom devant para\u00eetre comme directeur en t\u00eate du dit journal et pour ses services et son influence comme tel, le dit Arthur B\u00e9langer lui alloue quatre cents piastres par ann\u00e9e, tant par impressions, annonces, etc. qu'en argent jusqu'au montant de cette somme, et le dit Arthur B\u00e9langer ne pourra mettre fin \u00e0 cet engagement sans le consentement du dit Charles B\u00e9langer.\nAfter carrying on the business for a time under this agreement, and publishing the paper as a supporter of the Liberal party, a dispute arose in 1891 between the parties as to the support to be given to the Liberal candidate in Sherbrooke, at an election then pending and Arthur, not pleased at the stand Charles intended to take and actually took in relation thereto, dismissed him from the editorship.\nHence the present action by Charles, who asks by his conclusions, that he be declared to be the \"r\u00e9dacteur\" and \"directeur\" of the newspaper in question, to have his name inserted in the paper as such and that he be declared to be entitled to the editorial control of the paper, and that defendant be ordered to grant him editorial control of the paper and to deliver to him the exchanges ; that he be held thereto by all legal means, and that he be condemned to pay 55,000 as damages to him, the plaintiff.\nArthur pleaded to this action that he had a right to dismiss the plaintiff as he had done. That plea, in my opinion, has been conclusively established. It cannot be questioned that under the agreement between the parties, above mentioned, Arthur was vested with the full ownership of this paper, with power to sell it at any time, and that Charles became thereafter the salaried employee and editor of and for Arthur, the owner. The document says so in plain terms, and no surrounding circumstances can be admitted to make it say the contrary.\nThat being so, the respondent's contention that he was in a position of absolute independence towards Arthur is utterly untenable. It is true that by the last part of art. 3 of the said agreement Arthur bound. himself not to put an end to Charles's employment as editor, without Charles's consent. But to contend that, in virtue of this stipulation, Charles's rights in the editorial share were above his employer's rights, is a proposition I cannot accede to, though he was d directeur \" besides being editor. This stipulation is, of necessity, impliedly accompanied by and subject to the understanding that the owner's responsibility and interests should be respected in the columns of the paper and the owner was the sole judge of the manner in which that was to be done. The respondent would contend, forsooth, that he was even at liberty to direct his writings against his employer. That is what his contentions virtually amount to. The paper had always, or for along time, been known as an organ or supporter of the Liberal party. On the eve of the election I referred to, Charles as editor wrote an article unknown to Arthur, in which he abused the Liberal party in unmistakable terms, concluding by saying that in Sherbrooke the Liberals were \"rari nantes in gurgite vasto,\" which is cruelly translated in Sherbrooke French by : \" Ils sont comme les pois dans une soupe claire.\" Such conduct on the part of Charles deserved dismissal, and he cannot complain if he got it. When an editor finds that his opinions are not in accord with those of the proprietor he must either submit or quit. And if he takes advantage of the confidence that is reposed in him to abuse his proprietor's political friends, and in the midst of a political battle turns traitor to the party he is paid to support, his conduct cannot be too severely censured.\nIn the present case Arthur, the owner, would have had a perfect right to change the political colour of his paper and Charles the editor would have had to follow him and obey his orders, or abandon the editorial chair. But the interversion of these relative rights and duties that Charles contends for cannot be sanctioned. He certainly, also, had a perfect right to change his political views, but he had not the right to change the political colour of Arthur's newspaper, without Arthur's consent.\nI would allow the appeal and dismiss the action with costs in the three courts against respondent.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant : White, Cate & Wells.\nSolicitors for the respondent : Brown, Morris & McDonald.\n"}

She sold the land to M. and executed a transfer acknowledging payment of the purchase money, which transfer in some way came into the possession of M.'s solicitors, who had it registered and a new certificate of title issued in favour of M., though the purchase money was not, in fact, paid. M.'s solicitors were also solicitors of certain judgment creditors of D., and judgment having been obtained on their debts the purchase money of said transfer was garnisheed in the hands of M. and an issue was directed as between the judgment creditors and the wife of D. to determine the title to the money under the garnishee order, and the money was, by consent, paid into court. The judgment creditors claimed the money on the ground that the transfer of the land to D.'s wife was voluntary and void under the statute of Elizabeth and that she therefore held the land and was entitled to the purchase money on the re-sale as trustee for D.\nHeld, reversing the decision of the Supreme Court of the North-west Territories, that under the evidence given in the case the original transfer to the wife of D. was bon\u00e2 fide; that she paid for the land with her own money and bought it for her own use; and that if it was not bond fide the Supreme Court of the Territories, though exercising the functions and possessing the powers formerly exercised and possessed by courts of equity, could not, in these statutory proceedings, grant the relief that could have been obtained in a suit in equity.\nHeld further, also reversing the judgment appealed from, that even if the proceedings were not bon\u00e2 fide the garnishee proceedings were not properly taken; that the purchase money was to have been paid by M. on delivery of deed of transfer and the vendor never undertook to treat him as a debtor; that if there was a debt it was not one which D., the judgment debtor as against whom the garnishee proceedings were taken, could maintain an action on in his own right and for his own exclusive benefit; that D.'s wife was not precluded, by having assented to the issue and to the money being paid into court, from claiming that it could not be attached in these proceedings ; and that the only relief possible was by an independent suit.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Supreme Court of the North-west Territories reversing the judgment for defendant at the trial.\nThe facts of the case are thus stated in the judgment of the court:\nOn March 23rd, 1881, Edward Donohoe, the husband of the appellant, agreed to purchase from one George K. Leeson certain lands in the town of Calgary, North-west Territories, for the sum of $1,100 payable in one year. Before the expiration of the year an arrangement was entered into by which Leeson made the transfer of the land, not to Edward Donohoe but to his wife the present appellant, she paying him, from her own moneys, as she contends, but from her husband's as the respondents contend, the $1,100 purchase money. The husband subsequently transferred to her, for the nominal consideration of one dollar, all his interest and such proceedings were thereafter taken that on the 16th of March, 1889, a certificate of ownership was issued in her favour under the Territories Real Property Act by which it was certified that she was then the owner in fee simple of the property in question, subject to certain encumbrances She so continued the registered owner until the 1st of September, 1892, a period of more than three years. On or about that date she, with the concurrence of her\nhusband, entered into an agreement with one Joseph H. Millward by which she agreed to sell to him the property for $1,800 cash, the purchaser to assume a mortgage of $3,000 that had in the meantime been placed upon it.\nA transfer dated 1st September, 1892, was executed (in which the payment of the $1,800 was acknowledged) and placed in the hands of the solicitor of the Donohoes. In some unexplained manner this document found its way into the possession of the purchaser Mill ward's solicitors and it was thereupon registered and a new certificate of title issued in his (Millward's) favour, the certificate in favour of Mrs. Donohoe being cancelled. This registration took place before and without payment of the $1,800 purchase money, and so far as appears in the absence of any agreement on the part of the vendors that credit was to be given for the purchase money, and notwithstanding the fact that the evidence showed that the payment of that money and the delivery of the title deeds were to be contemporaneous acts. But it so happened that the solicitors of Millward were likewise the solicitors of five firms or individuals who had claims against Mrs. Donohue\u2019s husband amounting in the aggregate to about $1,168, and the idea was conceived that the $1,800 purchase money might be resorted to to pay off the claims of these five creditors. Consequently the purchase money was not handed over to Mrs. Donohoe. Five actions at law were instituted against the husband for the recovery of the debts mentioned, and before judgment (which was subsequently obtained) garnishee summonses were issued (as might be done under the special provisions of the Judicature ordinance) on the five actions against Millward. Upon the return of these summonses (it appearing that Mrs. Donohoe claimed the $1,800 in Millward's hands and that judgments by nil dicit had in the meantime been entered up) an order was made consolidating the five actions and directing an issue as between the five judgment creditors as plaintiffs and Mrs. Donohoe as sole defendant, as to whether these moneys in the hands of the garnishee were at the time of the service of the garnishee summonses the moneys of the plaintiffs (the judgment creditors) or any of them as creditors of Edward Donohoe as against the defendant. A consent order was subsequently made under which the purchase money in Millward's hands was paid into court where it still is. Upon the trial of the issues before Mr. Justice Rouleau it appeared that the only ground upon which the plaintiffs in the first instance based. their right to the purchase money was that the transfer from Leeson and Edward Donohoe to the defendant, Mrs. Donohoe, in 1889 was void as against creditors under the statute 13 Elizabeth, ch. 5, having been as was alleged a voluntary transfer and having been made for the purpose of defrauding creditors ; that she therefore held the land and the purchase money arising from its' sale as a trustee for him ; that these moneys were consequently his moneys and that they were due and owing not to his wife but to himself, and were therefore attachable by garnishee process at the instance of his (judgment) creditors.\nMr. Justice Rouleau, without then determining whether the transfer in question was voluntary or whether it was executed for the fraudulent purpose alleged, held that it could not be attached by garnishee proceedings but only by a direct suit in court, and he therefore dismissed the proceedings with costs. Upon appeal to the Supreme Court in bane, McGuire J. in a most elaborate judgment held that the transfer was voluntary and, being fraudulent, was void as against not only existing but subsequent creditors, and he further held that the purchase money was attachable in Millward's hands by the plaintiffs. In this, Richardson J. concurred. Wetmore J. came to the conclusion that the moneys were not attachable, but inasmuch as in his view the transaction impeached was a fraudulent one, and as the purchase money had at the instance of Mrs. Donohoe been paid into court as if proper proceedings had been taken in the first instance, and as these moneys in a proper suit brought for the purpose would have been declared to be the moneys of her husband for distribution amongst his creditors, the court was seized of jurisdiction to rightly distribute them to the proper parties: and he consequently concurred in the opinion of McGruire and Richardson JJ. that the appeal should be allowed.\nRouleau J. on the other hand adhered to the opinion expressed at the trial and further held that upon a review of the evidence the original transfer to Mrs. Donohoe was neither voluntary nor entered into with a fraudulent purpose.\nThe appeal was therefore allowed, and it is from that judgment that an appeal is asserted to this court.\nArmour Q.C. for the appellant. The bon\u00e2 fides of the transfer to Mrs. Donohoe cannot be inquired into in garnishee proceedings. Vyse v. Brown ([1]).\nThere was no debt for which Donohoe could have sued alone, and if there was one due to him and his wife jointly it could not be attached on a judgment against him alone. Macdonald v. Tacquah Gold Mines Co. ([2]).\nGibbons Q.C. for the respondent referred to Masuret v. Stewart ([3]); May on Fraudulent Conveyances ([4]). The judgement of the court was delivered by:\nSEDEGWICK J.\u2014In my view the first, the fundamental, question to be considered upon the present appeal is as to whether the garnishee proceedings in question were properly taken, assuming for the purpose of this inquiry that the transfer impeached was, and might have been, declared to be void as against creditors in a suit properly instituted for that purpose.\nThe provisions of the Judicature Ordinance sections 305-312 are, so far as any questions involved in this case are concerned, identical with the corresponding sections of the English Common Law Procedure Act, 1854, secs. 60-67 now incorporated in the rules of the Supreme Court 1883, Order XLII, Rules 32 and 34 and Order XLV. as well as with corresponding enactments in Ontario and Nova Scotia where the provisions of the English Judicature Act have been substantially enacted, and the cases decided in England, and in Canada as well, as to the meaning of these provisions, may usefully be examined in determining the questions in controversy here.\nNow one elementary principle runs through all these cases, viz., to enable a judgment creditor to obtain an order compelling a third person (the garnishee) to pay to him a debt which he would otherwise have to pay the judgment debtor, the debtor must be in a position to maintain an action for it against the garnishee, and the debt must be of such a character that it would vest in the debtor's assignee or trustee in bankruptcy if he became insolvent. There are cases where, even with both of these conditions present, garnishee process will not lie, but these cases do not concern us now. There must in all cases be the beneficial interest, as well as the right of action against the garnishee, in the judgment debtor. Further, the claim of the debtor must be a debt: it must arise ex contractu not ex delicto. Now apply these principles to the present case. Was there here a contractual obligation between Millward on the one hand and Edward Donohoe on the other, which the latter in his own right and for the exclusive benefit of himself or his estate could enforce in an action at law or a suit in equity? In my opinion there was not, and that for two reasons. First: There was no agreement or understanding between the parties that Millward should have any time\u2014a period of credit\u2014to pay the $1,800. The agreement was that that money was to be paid upon delivery of the transfer. In the absence of any explanation on the subject I must assume that the transfer was without authority treated as delivered and so registered. Under such circumstances the Donohoes might have brought one of several forms of action in order to obtain redress; they might have brought a common law action to recover damages by reason of the conversion of the instrument of transfer. If as a matter of fact there had been a delivery of the deed and it contained an acknowledgment of the payment of the purchase money, they could not at law, in the absence of fraud, maintain an action for it. They would be estopped by their deed. They might, however, have elected to accept the delivery and then sue in equity, not upon their contractual rights but to assert a lien on the land sold by reason of the purchase money not having been paid and obtain a decree giving effect to that lien. Still, all the while they might have stood upon their rights and demanded back their deed. They never undertook with Millward that he was to become their debtor for a single moment, and until they elected so to treat him he was only a wrong doer in his relations with them and liable to be treated accordingly. But secondly, assuming that there was a debt of some kind, to whom was that debt due so far as Millward was concerned? Could Edward Donohoe in his own name and for his own benefit have recovered it? As between the husband and the wife the conveyance to her even if voluntary was a perfectly valid one. So, too, as between him and her assigns. If he could not claim against her he could not against them. The deed is void as against creditors only ([5]), and the land as between her and him being hers, she had a right to sell to Millward without intervention or interference on her husband's part. The land therefore being hers, the contract being made with her, Millward was bound to pay her, her husband having no possible right to the price or any part of it. It is clear then that he could not, without at least joining his wife as plaintiff, sue Millward in his own name, and if not the debt was not, under the authorities attachable in his hands at the instance of Donohoe's creditors. The case of Vyse v. Brown ([6]) is on this point exactly analogous to this (assuming here that, as in that case the instrument was voluntary):\nEven supposing, said Vaughan Williams J., that the plaintiff had taken the proper steps to set aside the settlement as void, and had succeeded in doing so, even then Brown could never have been placed in the position of being obliged to pay over the money to Vyse ; the settlement would still be valid and subsisting between the parties ; and, although in such a suit Brown might be directed to pay over the whole or a sufficient part of the settled fund to the creditor that could never be by reason of his becoming indebted to the judgment debtor.\nAnd see Webb v. Stenton ([7]) and Boyd v. Haynes ([8]). I am unable to find any English or Canadian case at variance with the case from which this extract is taken, and I think it is directly in point in favour of this appeal. If then there is nothing more than this in the case, if the alleged debt is not attachable, then the proceedings, being taken without authority, must fail.\nBut the argument is that Mrs. Donohoe has precluded herself from claiming the advantage of this lack of jurisdiction by reason of the nonattachability of the debt, because in the first place she assented to the issue in its present form, and because in the second place she did not move to set aside the proceedings, but asked that the money in Millward's hands should be paid into court, thereby, it is said, consenting that that court should have absolute power to deal with it as might be thought right. I must confess I cannot appreciate the force of either of these contentions.\nThe issue settled upon by both parties was in effect this: \"Was the purchase money in Millward's hands the money of Donohoe's judgment creditors as against Mrs. Donohoe?\" Perhaps the issue should have taken the form of an inquiry as to whether the money in question was a debt due from Mill ward to the husband or a debt due to the wife, but what substantial difference is there between the two statements? The real question to be determined was as to the attachability of the money. Determine that fact in the negative and the plaintiffs' case must fail. Besides if Mrs. Donohoe is to be estopped from asserting her rights because of words that counsel have used in the pleadings, she can surely be allowed to insist upon a strict interpretation of the language creating that estoppel. If so, the answer to the question as framed in the issue must be in the negative. The moneys garnisheed were never at any time the moneys of the judgment creditors. They might become so but they certainly were not at the time of the service of the garnishee summonses. Nor could they though \"bound\" by the attaching process ever become their moneys until, after due course of law, payment over had been made to them. But, waiving this point, the issue was substantially a proper one. Bear in mind that the deed of transfer to Millward was executed by both husband and wife and it might well be that there was a contractual obligation between all parties that as between the husband and wife the money was to be paid to the husband, and if so then the moneys in that event would be attachable. But all that was a matter to be determined on the trial of the issue, a thing of the future, and in my view some such question as that is just as likely to have been within the contemplation of the parties when the issue was settled as an issue to determine whether certain dealings between Donohoe and his wife four or five years previously were fraudulent and void under the statute of Elizabeth.\nAs I view the case it was the plaintiffs, not the defendant, who sought to give evidence upon an issue not raised. The issue raised was property or no property; the issue upon which the case was decided upon appeal was fraud or no fraud; and that too, notwithstanding the universal rule that where an action is brought with the express purpose of setting aside a settlement, there must be an allegation in the statement of claim that the settlement is fraudulent. Richardson v. Horton ([9]); Holderness Y. Rankin ([10]); Davy v. Garrett ([11]); Wallingford v. Mutual Society ([12]); Kerr on Fraud and Mistake ([13]). I entirely agree with the trial judge in the view that the whole inquiry as to the circumstances under which Mrs. Donohoe became possessed of the property in question was irrelevant,\u2014foreign to the issue agreed upon by the parties.\nThen as to the question whether Mrs. Donohoe is to be estopped from claiming that these moneys are non- attachable because she with Millward s consent obtained an order directing the moneys attached to be paid into court. The statute authorizes payment into court by the garnishee. The order directing payment expressly renders the money subject to the issue. If the issue is decided in favour of the defendant, the money according to the terms of the order is to go to her. By what process of reasoning can it be made to appear that, because the person claiming the money asked that for her own protection the person holding the money in the exercise of his statutory privilege should pay it into court, the issue of property or no property in the money, which without such request must be decided one way, must because of such request be decided the other way? A person's rights are ordinarily determined as they stand at the time of the institution of proceedings against him. If these rights are to be minimized or absolutely taken from him by subsequent acts or omissions of his own, there surely should be conclusive evidence of them. How can the payment of this money into court at her request make that money which otherwise would be hers, the money of strangers?\nThe questions still remain: \"Were the instruments under which the defendant acquired the property in Calgary, voluntary within the meaning of the statute of Elizabeth, (although the expression \"voluntary\" is not there used) and if so, were they executed for the purpose of hindering, defeating, delaying or defrauding her husband's creditors? In considering these questions all the circumstances at the time the instruments were made must be looked at and not subsequent events, except such as must be taken to have been in the contemplation of the husband at the time of transferring the property and from which a fraudulent\n[Page 694 ]\nintention at that time may be gathered. Mackay v. Douglas ([14]); Ex parte Russell ([15]); In re Maddever ([16]).\nAfter a repeated perusal of all the evidence 1 have come to the conclusion that the transaction was a bon\u00e2 fide one, the property having been purchased by the wife and paid for with her own money. The husband never owned the land. His only interest was an agreement for purchase from one Leeson for $1,100. According to the evidence of himself and his wife he never paid one dollar of this money, but the whole of it was paid by the wife, he transferring for a nominal consideration his interest, and Leeson transferring the fee simple for the expressed consideration of $1,100. This was in March, 1887. Now what was the condition of affairs at this time? The husband was a blacksmith and had been working at his trade at Anthracite from 1887, but had never otherwise carried on or contemplated carrying on business there. He appears to have been a thriftless person, while his wife appears to have been a good business woman\u2014everything that her husband was not. Anthracite coal had been discovered there and was being largely worked, bringing a considerable population to the place. It has been conclusively proved that she in her own name, for her own benefit, entered into a partnership with one Gorman, for the purpose of carrying on at Anthracite an hotel business (articles of partnership being duly executed) ; that they together purchased an hotel, the instruments of purchase being produced in evidence ; that they together conducted an hotel business on a pretty large scale on the premises so purchased ; that all this time the husband was working at his trade, taking no part in the management of the hotel except as the occasional messenger of his wife, and not pretending to have any interest in it; that after a time she and Gorman dissolved partnership (the written articles of dissolution being produced) and that she went on with the business on her own account and for her own benefit until long afterwards, when the coal mines were shut down ; that while engaged in the business she had 45 or 50 . Permanent boarders; that she sold liquors (although a propitiatory liquor law was then in force) and that her net profits averaged five or six hundred dollars a month. All this is undisputed. And it was with the money so earned that as she says she paid to Leeson the $1,100 for the Calgary property and with her husband's assent took from him a deed in her own name. Now both husband and wife were examined by the plaintiffs; they were both made their witnesses and such is the evidence they gave. I have searched most diligently to see if there is any evidence which casts suspicion upon it but in vain, and I agree with the opinion of the trial judge as expressed in his final judgment that the transaction was one entered into in the most perfect good faith and without reference to the husband's creditors whether present or future, and when it appeared that all his debts (they were few and of small amount) had been paid off by her long before the institution of the present proceedings additional weight is added to the oral and documentary testimony in support of the contention that the original transaction was in all respects a bon\u00e2 fide one.\nIn coming to these conclusions I have not been uninfluenced by the consideration that the onus of proving mala fides was strongly on the plaintiffs in the present case. They have in my view signally failed in showing that the transaction was a voluntary one, while the evidence both documentary and oral points almost conclusively the other way. It does not, it seems to me, in the view of the case that I have taken so far, appear necessary to discuss at length the question as to whether the present plaintiffs, all being subsequent creditors, have a locus standi to attach Leeson's transfer to Mrs. Donohoe of the 24th of March, 1888, or her husband's transfer of 2nd March, 1889. It has been proved as already stated that all Donohoe's debts existing at these dates were wholly paid off long before the institution of the present proceedings, and it has not been shown that there was any connection between the debts now in existence and the old debts. Had such connection been shown, that is, had it been proved that these debts were contracted for the purpose of obtaining funds to pay off the old ones, or had it been shown that the transfers were made with express intent to \" delay, hinder or defraud \" future creditors, or that at that time Donohoe was about to engage in trade and the transaction was entered into in contemplation of possible future indebtedness, had facts such as these been proved, then I would suppose that the plaintiffs had such a locus standi. But in my view on all these points they have signally failed to adduce evidence.\nThere remains to be considered one other point upon which the respondents rely in support of the judgment below. Section 8, subsections 1, 4 and 5 of the North-West Territories Judicature Ordinance enact in effect that in the administration of justice in the Territories effect shall be given to equitable principles, that equitable estates rights, titles, duties, liabilities, & c., shall be recognized and enforced, and that too, whether these, rights, &c.,. appear incidentally or are set up as the substantial ground of action or relief.\nMostyn v. West Mostyn Coal & Iron Co. ([17]); Salt v. Cooper ([18]); Re Tharp ([19]); McDougall v. Hall. ([20]); Hedley v. Bates ([21]); Searle v. Choat ([22]); Howe v. Smith ([23]); London, Chatham & Dover Railway Co. v. South Eastern Railway Co. ([24]); Western Waggon & Property Co. v. West ([25]); are all cited in support of the contention that in the present proceedings, inasmuch as the evidence shows that the transfers now impeached are void under the statute of Elizabeth and would so be declared by an English court exercising chancery jurisdiction, the Supreme Court of the Territories was bound in these proceedings to make a like declaration and as a consequence order payment to the judgment creditors. I have no fault to find with the principles laid down in all of these cases, but none of them support the position contended for. It may be admitted that the Supreme Court of the Territories has all the jurisdiction formerly exercised by the common law and chancery courts in England\u2014that it is a court of equity as well as a court of law, and that it is bound in cases where common law and equity principles come in conflict to give effect to the latter. But the question remains: \"Would a court of equity in England before the Judicature Act or since, in a case such as the present where the proceedings are purely statutory \u2014fixed and defined by express enactment and interlocutory as well\u2014give the relief claimed? There is no precedent or authority for such a proposition. Here the plaintiffs relied upon the garnishee provisions of he Ordinance for relief. Had they succeeded in bringing themselves under those provisions the money in dispute would have been theirs. But so far as this position is concerned they admit they are outside, but they say \"on general equity principles the money is ours, therefore give it to us.\" The patent answer surely is: \"The money may be yours, but equity has devised a machinery to determine that. Bring your suit in the ordinary way. File your bill. Join all necessary parties. Bring in the husband. He has a right to show that his wife's property shall not be appropriated to pay his debts. Bring in the custodian of the fund. He has a right to insist that the money in his hands is paid to the proper party. Bring in all persons claiming under the wife and other parties in interest. Let the issues be defined and a trial on those issues be had and so let equity prevail.\" That, as I understand it, is equity. It is upon principles such as these that courts of equity act. Thus is the Supreme Court of the Territories, bound as it is to administer equity, to act. To dismiss this appeal would be to give to the court a jurisdiction and authority hitherto unasserted by any court of equity whether in England or here.\nI am of opinion that the appeal should be allowed and the judgment of Mr. Justice Rouleau restored, the whole with costs, both in this court and the court below.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellant: Costigan, McCaul & Bangs.\nSolicitors for respondents: McCarthy & Harvey.\n[1] 13 Q.

Coffill (Plaintiffs)\nAppellants\nAnd\nJoseph Creighton (Defendant)\nRespondent\n1894: Nov. 5; 1895: Jan. 15.\nPresent:\u2014Sir Henry Strong C.J., and Taschereau, Gwynne, Sedgewick and King JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF NOVA SCOTIA.\nChattel mortgage\u2014Affidavit of bona fides\u2014Compliance with statutory forms\u2014Change of possession\u2014Levy under execution\u2014Abandonment.\nN. executed a chattel mortgage of his effects and shortly afterwards made an assignment to one of the mortgagees, in trust for the benefit of his creditors. The assignee took possession under the assignment.\nHeld, affirming the decision of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, that there was no delivery to the mortgagees under the mortgage which transferred to them the possession of the goods.\nThe Bills of Sale Act, Nova Scotia, R.S.N.S. 5th ser. c. 92, by s. 4 requires a mortgage given to secure an existing indebtedness to be accompanied by an affidavit in the form prescribed in a schedule to the act, and by s. 5 if the mortgage is to secure a debt not matured the affidavit must follow another form. By s. 11 either affidavit must be, \"as nearly as may be,\" in the forms prescribed. A mortgage was given to secure both a present and future indebtedness, and was accompanied by a single affidavit combining the main features of both forms.\nHeld, affirming the decision of the court below, Gwynne J. dissenting, that this affidavit was not \"as nearly as may be\" in the form prescribed; that there would have been no difficulty in complying strictly with the requirements of the act; and though the legal effect might have been the same the mortgage was void for want of such compliance.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia reversing the judgment for plaintiffs at the trial.\nThe material facts governing the decision of the appeal are as follows:\u2014 The plaintiffs (appellants) were merchants doing business at Bridge water, in the county of Lunenburg, under the name of Reid, Coffill & Co. The defendant (respondent) is the sheriff of the county of Lunenburg, and as such sheriff seized certain goods under an execution issued against one Alexander Nelson, who at one time also did business as a merchant at Bridge-water. The goods were the property of the said Alexander Nelson, who gave a chattel mortgage to the plaintiffs of the property in question previously to the seizure by the defendant as sheriff. It was claimed by the defendant that the chattel mortgage did not set out the agreement between the parties, as required by the Bills of Sale Act. and that the affidavit accompanying the chattel mortgage was not in compliance with the statute, chap. 92, Revised Statutes of Nova Scotia, fifth series, and that the chattel mortgage for these reasons was inoperative against the defendant seizing the goods as sheriff under the said execution. The plaintiff's contention was that the chattel mortgage and affidavit were in compliance with the statute; that if not, the plaintiffs were in possession of the goods at the time of seizure from the grantor in the chattel mortgage, and in such case the statute had no application; or that the sheriff had abandoned the levy made by him on the goods under the said execution, and was a trespasser in selling them.\nThe mortgage was given to secure an existing indebtedness and also to secure the mortgagees as indorsers of notes of the mortgagor not matured. As to the first section 4 of the Nova Scotia Bills of Sale Act, R.S N.S. 5th ser. ch. 92, requires the mortgage to be accompanied by an affidavit in the form given in schedule A of the act, by which form the mortgagor makes oath that: \"The amount set forth therein as being the consideration thereof is justly and honestly due and owing by the grantor to the grantee, and the chattel mortgage was executed in good faith and not for the purpose of protecting the property mentioned therein against the creditors of the mortgagor or of preventing the creditors of such mortgagor from obtaining payment of any claims against him.\"\nSection 5 of the act requires a mortgage given to secure future advances or to secure the mortgagee against indorsements of bills or notes, to be accompanied by an affidavit in the form given in schedule B. the material part of said form being as follows:\n\"The mortgage hereto annexed truly sets forth the agreement entered into between the parties, and truly states the extent of the liability intended to be created and covered by said mortgagor, and that such mortgage was executed in good faith and for the express purpose of securing the mortgagee against the payment of the amount of the liability of the mortgagor and not for the purpose of securing the goods and chattels mentioned therein against the creditors of the mortgagor, nor to prevent such creditors from recovering any claims they may have against such mortgagor.\"\nSec. 11 of the act is as follows:\n\"11. The affidavits mentioned in sections four and five of this chapter, shall be as nearly as may be in the forms in schedules A and B respectively.\"\nIn this case the mortgage, as stated above, was to secure both an existing debt and liability against indorsements, and the affidavit of the mortgagor was as follows, omitting the formal portions:\n\"2. The amount of $625.32 set forth therein as being part of the consideration thereof is justly and honestly due and owing by me the grantor to the said grantees or mortgagees, and the said mortgage truly sets forth the agreement entered into between the said parties thereto and truly states the extent of the liability intended to be covered by me in respect of the notes therein mentioned, upon which the said firm of Reid, Coffill & Co. are liable for me as accommodation indorsers.\"\n\"3. The said mortgage was executed by me in good faith and for the express purpose of securing to the said mortgagees the said amount owing by me to them and of securing said mortgagees against the payments of the amounts of their liability for me as aforesaid, and not for the purpose of securing the goods and chattels mentioned therein against my creditors, nor to prevent such creditors from recovering any claim they may have against me.\"\nThere was no delivery of the goods to the mortgagees as such, but the mortgagee Coffill took possession of the effects of the mortgagor under the assignment to him as trustee executed after the mortgage. This was claimed to be a possession of the goods by the mortgagees which made the statute of no application.\nIt was also contended by the plaintiff that the sheriff, after seizing under the execution, abandoned the levy by leaving the goods on the premises with no one in charge of them. The defendants contended that under the facts proved there was no abandonment in law, and also that there was evidence of a man having been left by the sheriff to watch the goods.\nAt the trial a verdict was given for the plaintiffs, the trial judge holding that the affidavit was substantially in the form required by the act and that the mortgagees had possession of the goods. The verdict was set aside by the court en banc on the grounds that there was no possession under the mortgage; that the affidavit was not \"as nearly as may be\" in the prescribed form; and that the sheriff had not abandoned the levy. The plaintiffs appealed.\nRussell Q.C. for the appellants. The words \"as nearly as may be\" in the act do not mean as nearly as possible, but only that there shall be no unnecessary deviation. Parsons v. Brand[1]; Bird v. Davey[2]; Thomas v. Kelly[3].\nThe act did not contemplate a mortgage to secure the two kinds of indebtedness mentioned in sections 4 and 5. The affidavit here covers the essential parts of both forms.\nPossession by the assignee takes the case out of the statute. McLean v. Bell[4]; McMullin v. Buchanan[5].\nBorden Q.C. and Roscoe for the respondent. As to the defect in the affidavit see Archibald v. Hubley[6]; Morse v. Phinney[7].\nThere is nothing in the act to show that possession does away with the necessity for an affidavit.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014I am of opinion that this appeal must be dismissed with costs for the reasons stated in the judgment of my brother Sedgewick.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014On the appellant rested the onus to convince us that the form he has to make good in this case is as nearly as may be in the form prescribed by the statute. His task was an arduous one. He has not succeeded, and could not succeed. I am of opinion that the appeal should be dismissed. I adopt Mr. Justice Graham's reasoning.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014This case, in my opinion, turns wholly upon the question whether the affidavit annexed to the chattel mortgage under which the plaintiffs claim was a sufficient compliance with ch. 92 of the 5th series of the Revised Statutes of Nova Scotia; and reading that statute, as I am of opinion it always must be read, in the light of sec. 11 of ch. 1 of the same series I am of opinion that it was, and that, therefore, the appeal should be allowed with costs and judgment be ordered to be entered for the plaintiffs in the court below, in accordance with the decision of Mr. Justice Henry, the learned trial judge.\nSEDGEWICK J.\u2014Three questions were raised at the argument of this appeal, viz.: (1). Were the plaintiffs entitled to succeed by virtue of the alleged delivery to them of the goods referred to in their chattel mortgage? (2). Were the levy and sale under execution of the goods regular? And (3). Was the chattel mortgage invalid by reason of non-compliance with the statutory provisions of the Bills of Sale Act?\nThe first two questions were practically disposed of at the argument. The evidence showed that there never had been any possession of the goods by the plaintiffs under their chattel mortgage, even although the plaintiff Coffill may have had possession under, another instrument, and further that there was no intentional or actual abandonment of the levy so as to render the sheriff's sale ineffectual.\nThe sole question remaining is as to the validity of the chattel mortgage.\nThis instrument was executed by Alexander Nelson in favour of the plaintiffs for the purpose of securing an existing indebtedness of $625.32 and for the further purpose of securing them against loss in respect of two promissory notes, amounting in the aggregate to $500, which they had indorsed for his accommodation. Section 4 of the Bills of Sale Act refers to the case of a chattel mortgage executed for the first purpose, and specifies the character of the affidavit that must accompany it in order to make it valid as against creditors.\nSection 5 refers to the case of a chattel mortgage executed for the second purpose, likewise specifying the character of the affidavit that must accompany it.\nSection 11 enacts that the affidavits mentioned in sections 4 and 5 shall be as nearly as may be in the forms in schedules A and B respectively, and in the schedules the forms are given.\nThese forms are not in words identical and it is open to much argument to say that they are substantially identical in effect.\nThe affidavit accompanying the chattel mortgage in question did not comply with either form but rather attempted to combine the two, selecting some words from the one and others from the other, doubtless with a view of giving effect to the statutory requirements.\nThe question then is: Is this affidavit as nearly as may be in the forms in schedules A and B?\nIn my view it is not. There would in my judgment have been no obstacle (so far as the evidence goes) in the way of the mortgagor swearing to an affidavit in which the first form might be used in relation to the existing debt and the second form in relation to the accommodation notes. It was not the function of the gentlemen who drafted this instrument to assume the responsibility of using language in a statutory affidavit differing in words (whether or not differing in substance) from the prescribed form, in the hope that identity of meaning in the words used would secure validity for it. The affidavit was not as nearly as it might have been in the statutory form. There was a clear, manifest and altogether needless departure from it, and when that is the case it is not proper that we should be astute in inquiring the extent to which the volunteered form is equivalent to the statutory one.\nIn my view this case is a much stronger one against the instrument than Hubley v. Archibald[8] or Morse v. Phinney[9].\nEven if it be admitted that the legal effect is the same it does not necessarily follow that the affidavit is valid. If a form might have been followed but is knowingly and unnecessarily departed from, even although there is no alteration in the legal effect of the document, I know of no principle of construction which makes that a compliance with the statute. Thomas v. Kelly[10].\nOn the whole I am of opinion the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nKING J. concurred.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for appellants: H. T.

The plaintiffs (appellants) in this case were creditors of the insolvent estate of one Jorgenson who had assigned under the Act relating to assignments and preferences to creditors. The defendant Anderson was also a creditor, and the defendant Lee an inspector of the estate. The assets of the estate were offered for sale by tender and purchased by the insolvent\u2019s wife who gave as security for payment notes indorsed by defendant Anderson. After the tender of the purchase had been approved by the inspectors, Anderson induced the defendant Lee to join him in securing the payment, and they took a chattel mortgage on the stock so purchased to protect themselves. The estate paid a small dividend, and the plaintiffs brought an action to have defendants account for any profit they may have made out of the sale of the stock.\nOn the trial judgment was given for the plaintiff and a reference ordered to ascertain what profit the defendants had received The Divisional Court varied this judgment by declaring that plaintiffs should receive the difference between their claims against the estate and what they would have received in common with the other creditors by way of dividend, with liberty to apply to the court if the amount could not be agreed upon. The Court of Appeal reversed the decision of the Divisional Court and dismissed the action, holding that no loss to the estate had been proved.\nThe Supreme Court allowed the appeal and restored the judgment of the trial judge. Taschereau J. dissenting. The court held that the defendant Lee, as inspector, could not obtain an advantage for himself from his position and that the creditors were entitled to a reference to ascertain what profit, if any, he had derived from the transaction.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nMoss Q.C. and Parker for the appellants.\nS.H.

The defence was that the bills and notes were accepted and indorsed for the accommodation of the bank, and that defendant had been induced to accept and indorse them by fraud and misrepresentation. It was proved at the trial that Morrison, the agent of the bank, had represented to defendant that the transactions were in the business and for the interest of the bank, which was engaging in matters forbidden by the Bank Act and had to adopt the course pursued by the agent.\nThe trial judge rejected evidence of conversation between a third party, who was on some of the paper in suit, and the agent who succeeded Morrison, as to what had taken place between such third party and Morrison in regard to some of the notes. The ground of his rejection was that the evidence was irrelevant and that it only arose out of cross-examination. He admitted other objectionable evidence, ruling that only the answer had been objected to.\nA verdict was given for plaintiffs for the amount of one note and of an overdrawn account, and for defendant in respect to all other claims. The Supreme Court of New Brunswick gave the bank judgment for another and a larger note and defendant judgment for all the rest, including that on which he failed at the trial. Both parties appealed.\nThe Supreme Court of Canada ordered a new trial on the ground that the evidence rejected at the trial should have been admitted, as it related to a matter relevant to the issue, and that the trial judge was wrong in ruling that only the answer to another question was objected to, as there was a general objection to all the evidence at the time.\nAppeal allowed with costs and new trial ordered.

Wigle & Son, he had no interest in it; also that at the most he could only be liable in respect to the business of a general country store, which was the business of the firm before he withdrew, and not for that of buying and selling real estate and investing in securities, which his son alone had carried on and in respect of which the notes in question were given.\nThe courts below held that public notice of dissolution of the partnership between defendant and his son had not been given; that defendant was aware that his name still appeared as a member of the firm on the bill-heads and in other ways; and that he was aware of the general nature of the new business carried on by his son in the firm name; defendant was, therefore, held liable on the notes.\nThe Supreme Court affirmed the judgment of the Court of Appeal.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nMcCarthy Q.C. and Fleming for the appellant.\nCowen for the respondent.\n"}

The appellants were sued personally as well as in quality and it is in my opinion a matter of indifference to the respondent whether she had a judgment against the trustees in quality or against them personally, and to the latter she is strictly entitled.\nTASCHEHEAU J.\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench, confirming a judgment of the Superior Court by which the appellants were condemned under art. 1056 of the Civil Code to pay to the respondent $4,000 damages for the death of her husband under the following circumstances\nOn the 5th February, 1890, Patrick Byrne, the deceased, was walking along\" the sidewalk on Notre Dame Street, in Montreal, when, on reaching the spot opposite a large building known as the Ferrier block he was killed by a window which fell on him from the third story of the building. The respondent alleges by her action that the defendants were then in possession of the said building in their quality of executors and trustees (administrateurs par fiducie,) ([1]), under the will of the late Honourable James Ferrier who died on the 30th of May, 1888 ; that, by the said will, the powers of the said appellants as executors were extended over he year and a day prescribed by law ; that the hinges which supported the said window were previously broken or cracked, and not strong enough to support it ; that the said appellants were therefore guilty of negligence in not seeing that this window was firmly secured; that Patrick Byrne's death was due to the negligence and .culpable imprudence of the appellants ; that the respondent, under these circumstances, has right to be indemnified by the appellants for the damages amounting to $10,000, resulting to her from his death caused by the said accident of which the appellants are answerable in law.\"\nBy the writ, as amended, the appellants were summoned \" as well personally, as in their quality of testamentary executors and trustees of the late Hon. James Ferrier in virtue of his will \"\nAn objection taken by the appellants to an amendment made on the 10th September, 1891, by the respondent, with leave of the Superior Court, should be considered in limine\nBy the writ and d\u00e9claration the appellants were originally impelled only personally and in their quality of executors. The amendment in question consisted in adding them to the case in their quality of trustees. Their objection to this proceeding cannot prevail. It rests upon a mere question of procedure, and upon such questions the decisions of the provincial courts, according to a well established jurisprudence of this court, are not to be interfered with, except under special circumstances, none of which appear in this case : Gladwin v. Cummings ; Dawson v. Union Bank ([2]); Mayor of Montreal v . Brown ([3]); Boston v. Lelivvre ([4]). The Court of Queen's Bench has sanctioned the act of the Superior Court in the matter, and we cannot be asked to reverse the concurrent decisions of the two courts on a question of this nature, even were we inclined to doubt its legality. in this case, however, the appellants have no ground of complaint against this granting of leave to amend by the Superior Court in the exercise of its discretion. It was argued that if the executors and the trustees had not been the same persons, as in this case, the trustees, if not summoned with the executors in first instance could not have been mis en cause by simply amending the writ, and consequently that the appellants here, having by the original writ been summoned only in their quality of executors, could not be brought in the case in their quality of trustees by a simple amendment, when prescription against the action had been acquired. Now, it is true, I presume, that if the trustees had been different Persons from the executors a new writ of summons would have been necessary to bring them in the case. But why? Because then they would not have been before the court at all on a writ against the executors only. But when as here, the trustees and the executors are the same persons, there was no necessity, as pointed out by the learned Chief Justice of the Queen's Bench, as they were before the court qua executors to issue a new writ to bring them in. nunc pro tune qua trustees. Connolly y. Bonneville ([5]) ; The Ontario Bank y. Chaplin ([6]) ; Lefebvee y. Seath ([7]).\nThey were, therefore, rightly held to be parties to the case in the Superior Court in their quality of trustees, as well as personally and in their quality of executors.\nI will go on with the consideration of the appeal by the trustees, as argued before us, assuming for the present that there is such an appeal, as distinct from the appeal by the appellants personally, or in their quality of executors. The appellants' contention on this branch of the case is more one in the nature of an exception \u00e0 la forme, than of an objection to the merits. They argue that the judgment against them as trustees for the whole estate (as they assume it to be) cannot stand because, under the will of the late James Ferrier, they were at the time of this accident in possession of the building in question exclusively as trustees for the children of his son, George Ferrier, and not at all as trustees for the estate generally. That contention is founded in law ; a judgment against them as trustees for the whole estate, so as to be executory against the whole estate could not be supported. But as I read the writ with the declaration and the will together, it is only as trustees in possession of this particular building, for George's children, that the appellants are sued as trustees at all, and in that quality only that they could be condemned. Then they are summoned as trustees, (as provided for by the will, which the word trustees under the will, or in virtue of the will, unquestionably mean, and when the will provides that as to this building the appellants are trustees for George's children exclusively, I do not see how it could ever be possible for the respondent to contend that the judgment she has obtained against the appellants, as trustees, is against them as trustees of the whole estate. However, all difficulty on this point will be set at rest by our ordering, as the whole record is before us ([8]), that to the judgment against the appellants as trustees, be added the words : \"as trustees for the benefit of the children of George Davies Ferrier.\" That is the judgment which the Superior Court must have intended to give, and which the learned Chief Justice of the Court of Queen's Bench evidently also took it for granted had been rendered on this issue by the Superior Court.\nThe next question that arises on this part of the case, is as to the liability of the owners of this building for the damages arising from the accident in question. On this point there is no difficulty that I can see. The respondent's right to recover is plain. The accident was due to a want of repairs, or a vice de construction, or perhaps both, and that is conclusive as to the owners' liability. Art, 1055 C. C. ; 2 Sourdat no. 1169.\nThe case is just the same as if Byrne had been killed by a stone falling from the wall of the house or by the crumbling of the wail itself.\nThe owner of property abutting on a highway is under a positive duty to keep it from being a cause of danger to the public by reason of any defect, either in structure, repair or use and management, which reasonable care can guard against. Demolombe des Contrats ([9]) Rancour v. Hunt ([10]) Laurent ([11]) Pollock on Torts ([12]). And he is responsible for all the damages which may result from any neglect of that duty.\nThe owners here might also, perhaps, be held liable under the rule respondeat superior, contained in art\u00bb 1054 of the Civil Code Laurent ([13]) S\u00e9randat v Saisee ([14]) Morlera v. Roques ([15]) Ville de la Tour du Pin v. Collomb ([16]) ; Schumberger v. S\u00e9bastien ([17]) ; Goulet v. Stafford ([18]).\nHowever, their liability under art. 1055 is so clear that it is unnecessary to determine here whether they would also fall under the circumstances of the case under art. 1054. How far they are affected by a judgment against the trustees does not arise in this case. The question has not been raised at the bar and is not passed upon by the courts below.\nI would hold, then, that the condemnation against the appellants qua trustees, or h\u00e9ritiers jiduciaires, for George's children is unimpeachable. Arts. 869, 981a, et seq. CC. ; Montvalon des Succession ([19]); Laurent ([20]); Succession of Franklin ([21]).\nIt has not been impeached, however. The appellants in their quality of trustees were not parties to the appeal to the Court of Queen's Bench, and they, in that quality are therefore not before this court where to no appeal lies but from the Court of Queen's Bench. We could not consequently, in any case, have interfered with the judgment against them in that quality. It stands as rendered by the Superior Court. The fact that both parties assumed before us and in the Queen's Bench that the trustees, as well as the appellants personally and as executors, were parties to the appeal cannot give us jurisdiction. However, as the case was fully argued on their part I deemed it better to satisfy them that they had lost nothing by not joining in the appeal, though my remarks on this part of the case must, of course, remain obiter dicta.\nI will now consider the appeal of that part of the judgment which holds the appellants liable for the consequences of the accident in their quality of executors of the will of the late James Ferrier generally. The respondent on this branch of the case contends that the whole corpus of the estate of the late James Ferrier is liable for the damages accruing to her from the death of her husband and that her action is therefore rightly directed against the appellants in their quality of executors The court quo has maintained this contention This judgment cannot, in my opinion, be supported. The respondent's action does not lie against the estate, and did it lie against the estate it could not have been brought against the executors alone. It is undoubtedly true as remarked by the learned Chief Justice of the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench that the seisin of the executor overrides the seisin of the legatee whenever a conflict between them. Archambault v. The Citizens' Ins. Co. ([22]) Normandeau v. McDnnnell ([23]). But it is only as a depositary that the executor is seized ([24]). And his possession is the possession of the legatee ([25]). Pothier, Introd. \u00e0 Cour d'Orl\u00e9ans ([26]) Pothier Donat & Test. ([27]) ; Delvincourt ([28]) ; Laurent ([29]). Peendant qu'une chose est en d\u00e9p\u00f4t\" says Domat ([30]) ; \"le ma\u00eetre en conserve la possession, et son d\u00e9positaire poss\u00e8de pour lui.\nThe executor represents the deceased it has been argued. That is so in a limited sense. But the accident in question has not been caused by the deceased James Ferrier; and the respondent's claim is not one that originated in the late James Ferrier's life time, one which he left at his death attached to his succession. And the executor does not represent the legatees. Nor can he e exercer les actions de la succession, et les actions contre la succession, qui ne sont pas du chef du testateur, ne peuvent pas non plus \u00eatre exerc\u00e9es contre lui. Roux v. Crochet ([31]); Chalupt v. Bernard ([32]) ; Coin-Delisle ([33]); Domolombe Donation ([34]); Marcad\u00e9 ([35]); Dal. Rep. Suppl. vo. Dispositions ([36]). By art. 919 of the code it is enacted, it is true, that the executor may be sued for whatever falls within the scope of his duties, and it has been held in de L\u00e9ry v. Campbell ([37]), and that class of cases through that seems to be a controvertible point that as the payment of the testator's debts falls within the scope of his duties he might be sued for them (though a judgment against him does not bind the heirs or universal legatees). But those cases have no application; this is not an action for a debt or an obligation of the testator, or one which concerns in any way the execution of the will. It is against the executor, it has been argued for the respondent that third parties must look to for redress in the event of their having any claim against the estate. But this argument rests on a fallacy. It is petitio principii. It assumes that the respondent has a claim against the whole estate for an accident caused by the negligence of those in charge of a house exclusively bequeathed to George's sons. But that is the very point to be determined, and which, in my view of the question, must be determined adversely to the respondent. Why the whole estate should be responsible for her damages I entirely fail to see. If damages had been caused to this particular house, in 1890, it has been further argued on her part, \"it is the executors as such who would have been entitled to sue to recover the damages done to the estate, and reversing the proposition it must likewise be the executors who are liable to be sued for damages caused to a third party by something belonging to the estate, which was used by them for its benefit.\" But here again the respondent s reasoning is faulty. If any damage had been done to this house in 1890 it is not the whole estate which would have suffered thereby, but only George's representatives, the owners of the house. And the damages claimed here by the respondent are not d damages caused by something belonging to the estate which was used by them for its benefit,\" to quote the respondent's own words ; this house does not belong to the estate, and it was not, in 1890, used by the executors for the benefit of the estate. It belongs to and is the legal possession of George's children, to whom exclusively it has been bequeathed, and who became seized with it as owners immediately at the testator's death. Arguendo Woolrich v. Bank of Montreal ([38]) ; Dall. Rep. Suppl. vo. Dispositions ([39]). There has been no partage, it has been further said for the respondent. But this building has not been bequeathed par indivis, but directly and exclusively to George's children, whose ownership the appellants, as executors, do not represent. Duplessi sur Cout. de Paris ([40]) ; Laurent ([41]) A judgment against an executor alone is, as to the legatees, res inter cilios acta, and is not executory against the estate, as held by this court in Lionais v. The Molsons Bank ([42]). And an action against him would not interrupt a prescription that has begun to run in favour of the legatees.\nIt has been also said for the respondent that the administration of the succession as to third parties is indivisible, and that consequently a claim against the estate is well brought against the executor. But this again is unsound reasoning. First, she has no claim against the estate, and secondly, an action upon a claim against the estate not arising from the de cujus or the execution of the will, is not well brought against the executor alone.\nThen, in 1890, the appellants' functions as executors had lapsed so far at least as concerns this building. The administration of George's share in their hands is as distinct and separate from the administration of the other shares, bequeathed by the late James Ferrier, as if different persons were administrators of each of those shares. This shows that it is as trustees that they were in possession of this building and not as executors If the will had named one person executor and another person trustee, it is clearly the trustee who would have been in possession of this building for George's children when the accident happened. And if this accident had been caused by the building bequeathed to the appellant, James Ferrier, personally, the respondent I am sure would have instituted her action against him personally, and not against him as executor of the estate. Now, the building in question in this case belongs to George's representatives, exclusively, just as much as the building bequeathed to James Ferri\u00e9, the appellant, now belongs to him and not to the estate.\nAnd by the express terms of the will itself, whether the appellants be considered as administrators under art. 921 of the civil code or whether as trustees under art. 981a their powers as executors had come to an end when this accident happened. The will does certainly give them as executors the seizing of the real estate as well as of the personal estate, but there is an express limitation put upon this extension of their powers by the testator : \"And the powers of my executors shall, so far as it is necessary for the fulfillment of this my will, extend not only over all my personal but also over all my real estate,\" says the will. Now, so far as it was necessary for the execution of the will the duties of the executors, as executors, had been all fulfilled when this accident happened. They had duly registered the will with a certificate of the testator's death, as required by art. 2098 of the code, and their functions were effete. Guinchard v Laneuville ([43]). If the respondent's contention were to prevail the appellants would never be trustees or would never have possession of this building as trustees. They would continue to be merely executors, and in possession merely in that quality, up to the time when George's. children will all be of age. Now that cannot be; the will says the contrary. The appellants. it is true, appear to have given leases of the house in question in 1890, and since, in their quality of executors. But they were wrong in doing so. Though this is of no consequence whatever, it is as trustees that. they should have been described in the leases.\nThen, the respondent is now estopped from contending that it was as executors that the appellants were in possession of this building in 1890. She has, on this record, upon the issue between herself and the appellants qu\u00e2 trustees, a judgment which I have already commented upon, declaring them to have been in possession qu\u00e2 trustees. The direct and necessary result of that judgment is that they were not in possession qu\u00e2 executors. This, it seems to me, is conclusive against her on this part of the case. She cannot be allowed to take such incompatible positions.\nHowever this is quite immaterial in my view of the question. Assuming that it was as executors that they were in possession in 1890, and that it is now open to the respondent to so contend, her action, in my opinion does not lie against them in that quality so as to bind the estate\nMy conclusions, therefore, on this part of the appeal are: 1st. It is res judicata against the respondent upon this record that it is not as executors that the appellants, were at the time of this accident, in possession of the building in question.\n2nd. Even if the executors had been in possession the corpus of the estate is not liable for the respondent's damages.\n3rd. Even if the executors had been in possession and assuming that the whole estate might be liable, this action does not lie against the executors alone\nThe appeal by the executors should therefore be allowed, and the action, as to them, dismissed.\nI now come to the consideration of the action as \"against the appellants personally.\nNeither the Superior Court nor the Court of Queen's Bench seem to have passed on this issue. Although by the judgment the condemnation would seem to be against the appellants qu\u00e2 executors and trustees only, yet the action as to them personally is not dismissed. How that happened there is nothing in the record to show. It seems impossible to attribute it to anything else than to an oversight, for which, undoubtedly, the parties themselves are mainly responsible. I would not feel justified in presuming that they, on one side or the other, have paid more attention to the case in the courts below than they have in this court. That there is, on the record, such an issue between the appellants and the respondent personally is unquestionable. The writ summons them personally, in no ambiguous terms. The respondent, by her declaration, \"se plaint des d\u00e9fendeurs tels que d\u00e9sign\u00e9s au dit bref.\" She then charges them with the negligence that caused the accident. The conclusions, I notices, are not in clear terms against them personally, but they cannot but be taken, when read with the preceding allegations, as conclusions against all the parties described in the writ of summons. And they have so been taken by the appellants themselves. They appeared and pleaded jointly as summoned, that is to say personally as well as in their quality of executors and in their quality of trustees.\nBy the general issue they allege that they are not indebted either personally or in their quality of executors and trustees. By a second plea they allege that they were not personally in possession of the building in question when this accident happened, or in any way personally responsible for the said building or the said accident and that they could in no case be held responsible for it, or in any way be held personally responsible for this accident.\nAnd that the case was treated all along on both sides, as involving the appellants' personal liability, further appears, if more were necessary, at the trial, when James Ferrier one of the appellants was called as a witness on behalf of the defence The respondent immediately upon the said James Ferrier being sworn, objected to his examination \"inasmuch as he was one of the defendants, the issue being common to all the defendants.\" Then the appeal to the Queen's Bench was taken, as appears by the inscription itself, by the defendants \"personally for any rights they may have.\" These last words are not in the writ of summons, but they may be treated as ex abundanli cautelelu; they are meaningless; any party to a case appears to defend any rights he may have. It is evident that they considered the action still pending against them, for if the judgment of the Superior Court had put them personally out of the case they would not have had to appear as appellants in the Queen's Bench.\nAfter joining issue with the respondent in the Superior Court, after going to trial on that issue, after having been parties to the appeal in the Court of Queen's Bench, the appellants cannot but be yet considered, for all intents and purposes, as parties to the case in their individual capacity. They were in the case by the writ of summons, and they have never since ceased to be parties to it, either by a judgment or by any act of procedure that I can see on the record, either here or in the court below. They are therefore parties to this appeal. So that we have to consider this issue, and render upon it the judgment that, in our opinion, the court below should have given.\nNow, are the appellants personally liable for the damages resulting to the respondent from the said accident? To this question there is to my mind, room for but one answer. They are the parties primarily liable ; they are the guilty parties in the first\" degree; they are the parties responsible above and before any others ([44]). It is their personal fault and negligence which is the immediate cause of this accident. They were at the time, in actual possession of this building; it was under their exclusive control and superintendence, whether as trustees or executors, as d\u00e9positaires or sequestrators, or in any other fiduciary capacity whatever, does not make the least difference, or lessen in any way their own personal liability for tortious negligence whereby a third party suffered damages.\nCulpa tenet suos autores. They are tort-feasors. It -was their duty to keep this building in repair, and it is to a breach of that duty that Patrick Byrne's death is due. Aubry & Rau ([45]) ; Addison on Torts ([46]) ; Sherman & Redfield on Negligence ([47]) ; Beven on Negligence ([48]); Roberts v. Mitchell ([49]).\nIn a case of this kind there may sometimes be a doubt as to the liability of the cestui que trust, or the principal, but upon the liability of the wrongdoer himself there is no room for controversy. He cannot use his fiduciary quality as a shield, and claim immunity because he was in possession in the name of others. Pollock on Torts ([50]).\nThis fundamental principle of what Demolombe calls \"la personnalit\u00e9 de la peine\" ([51]) governs as to third parties, all mandataries, trustees, depositaries, or bailees of whatever species and therefore rules this case ; for, under the express provision of art. 891a of the code, it is as depositaries or sequestrators that the appellants, at the time of this accident, were in possession of this building. The following authorities have therefore their full application. Beauguillot v. Caillemer ([52]);\nLe g\u00e9ant d'une propri\u00e9t\u00e9 peut \u00eatre condamn\u00e9 personnellement \u00e0 des dommages inter\u00eats, \u00e0 raison d'un fait commis par lui en sa qualit\u00e9, lorsque ce fait a le caract\u00e8re de d\u00e9lit ou quasi-d\u00e9lit; en ce cas le g\u00e9rant ne peut opposer l'exception de mandat. A driver by his negligence caused, an accident. He and his master were condemned solidairement. L'Etat v. Berthet ([53]).\nDans tons les cas, il va de soi que le mandataire est personnellement responsable envers les tiers de d\u00e9lit ou quasi-d\u00e9lits qu'il a commis dans l'accomplissement du mandat ([54]).\nCelui qui a commis- un d\u00e9lit ou quasi-d\u00e9lit n'est pas recevable \u00e0 soutenir pour \u00e9chapper \u00e0 toute responsabilit\u00e9 qu'il n'a agi que par les ordres ou pour le compte d'autrui ([55]).\nGuillouard, Mandat ([56]) ; Hood v. Stewart ([57]) ; Camp- v. Church of St. Louis ([58]). Mer v. Broussais ([59]).\nLa r\u00e8gle que le mandataire repr\u00e9sente le mandant \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard des tiers, n'est pas applicable en cas de quasi-d\u00e9lits, le mandataire est alors tenu de r\u00e9parer le dommage qu'il a cause par sa faute.\nL'ex\u00e9cuteur testamentaire est un mandataire, et comme tel, passible des dommages caus\u00e9s par sa n\u00e9gligence.\nGertran v. Dehaulme ([60]) ; Perignon v. Syndic du chemin de fer de Gisors ([61]).\nLe mandant peut suivant les circonstances \u00eatre d\u00e9clar\u00e9 responsable du quasi-d\u00e9lit commis par son mandataire, dans l'exercice de son mandat. Mais sa responsabilit\u00e9 ne fait point obstacle \u00e0 celle du mandataire, qui, en prenant part an quasi-d\u00e9lit, encourt les consequences du fait illicite auquel il a participe.\nAs to the findings of fact of the Superior Court, concurred in as they have been by the Court of Queen's Bench, the appellants cannot expect us to reverse. We could not do so without disregarding a well settled-jurisprudence as to appeals on questions of fact. Moreover the evidence, though not all one way, is in my opinion very strong against the appellants, so much so that it would, to my mind, have justified an indictment for manslaughter. An action as this one, in the express-terms of art. 1056 of the code under which it is brought does not prejudice the criminal proceedings to which. the parties may be subject. Neither can the appellants expect us to interfere upon the amount of damages and they rightly refrained from pressing this part of their appeal.\nWe could not very well hold that the courts below erred in estimating the loss of a husband at $4,000, when we ourselves have estimated at $3000 the loss of a finger. Gingras v. Desilets ([62]).\nThe result is 1st that the appeal of the defendants in their quality of executors is allowed, and the action dismissed as against them in that quality ; no costs.. 2nd. As to the action against the appellants in their quality of trustees, there being no appeal on that issue. the judgment of the Superior Court stands as rendered for $4000 and interest from May 27th, 1893, and costs in Superior Court distraits, and with the addition of the words after as trustees :\"for the benefit of the children of George Davies Ferrier.\"\nAs to the action against them personally, judgment will be entered for $4,000 and interest from May 27th, 1893, date of judgment in the Superior Court, with costs in the Superior Court distraits. Each party paying his costs of the appeals in the Queen's Bench and in this court; appeal allowed; no costs. The judgment will therefore thus end :\nCondamne les d\u00e9fendeurs tant personnellement qu'en leur qualit\u00e9 d'h\u00e9ritiers fiduciaires (trustees) pour le b\u00e9n\u00e9fice des enfants de George Davies Ferrier a paver \u00e0 la demanderesse Ia somme de $4,000 avec int\u00e9r\u00eat du 27 mai 1893, et les d\u00e9pens de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure distraits \u00e0\n\"Et sur l'issue entre la demanderesse et les d\u00e9fendeurs en leur qualit\u00e9 d'ex\u00e9cuteurs testamentaires met les parties hors de cour.

W., who purchased on behalf of, and to protect, some of the legatees of W., without any change being made in the manner of conducting the business. A bookkeeper was employed to keep the books required for the various interests, with instructions to pay the moneys received at the office of the co-proprietors into a hank, whence they were drawn upon cheques bearing the joint signatures of the parties interested, and the profits were divided equally between the representatives of the parties interested, some in cash, but generally by cheques drawn in a similar way M N D who looked after the business for the representatives of D., paid diligent attention to the interests confided to him and received their share of such profits but J.C.B. who acted in the W. interest, so negligently looked after the business as to enable the book-keeper to embezzle moneys which represented part of the share of the profits coming to the representatives of W. In an action brought by the representatives of W. to make the representatives of D. bear a share of such losses.\nHeld, affirming the judgment of the Superior Court, and of the Superior Court sitting in review, that the facts did not establish a partnership between the parties, but a mere ownership par indivis, and that the representatives of D. were not liable to make good any part of the loss, having by proper vigilance and prudence obtained only the share which belonged to them.\nEven if a partnership existed, there would be none in the moneys paid over to the parties after a division made.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the superior Court for Lower Canada, District of Montreal (in Review) (composed of Ouimet, Davidson and deLorimier JJ.) affirming the judgment of Jett\u00e9 J. in the Superior Court.\nIn 1864 the late William Workman and A. M. de-Lisle of Montreal, entered into a joint adventure under the name of the Workman and deLisle syndicate on several occasions purchasing considerable real estate for purposes of speculation, the profits being divided equally from time to time as made. The business was managed by William Workman up to the time of his death in February, 1878.\nUpon the death of William Workman, A. M. deLisle and the executors of William Workman (Joel C. Baker Robert Moat and John Moat) continued the business of the syndicate.\nOn the 17th February 1880 A. M. deLisle died, and M. Nolan deLisle et al. (the respondents) are his legal representatives. The business of the syndicate still continued to be managed by the representatives of the original parties.\nThe executors of the late William Workman, finding it necessary to realize the interest of their testator in the joint property in order to settle certain bequests made by the will offered such interest for sale by public auction in March, 1882, and it was purchased for the greatest part by Thomas Workman, brother of William Workman. The transfer to Thomas Workman was executed on the 24th July, 1882, but not registered to avoid difficulties as to titles and a contre lettre of that date, executed by Thomas Workman, Robert Moat as tutor to his son William (a grand-nephew of Thomas Workman and a legatee under the will of William Workman) and Mrs. J. C Baker (a daughter of William Workman and also a legatee under his will), set forth that the said purchase was made and paid for to the extent of five elevenths in favour of William Moat and to a like extent in favour of Mrs. Baker leaving Thomas Workman interested to the extent of one eleventh.\nThe William Workman estate was still left with large undivided interests in bailleur de fonds and mortgage claims.\nThe business which represented the interest of the estate William Workman and the deLisles was then known as the Syndicate Workman and deLisle, and that represented by the interest between Thomas Workman and the deLisles was known for the purpose of distinction and had separate books under the name of deLisle and Workman syndicate.\nIn 1881 the deLisle and Workman syndicate engaged a man called Cott\u00e9 as book-keeper. He kept the books of the William Workman private estate and the books of the Syndicate Workman and deLisle, and the Syndicate deLisle and Workman. The usual course of business was for the representatives of the Workman interest, who for this purpose acted through Mr. J. C. Baker, and the representative of the deLisle interest, who acted through Mr. Nolan deLisle, to look after their respective interests, and for Cott\u00e9 from time to time, as profits were made, to deliver to Mr. Nolan deLisle cheques or cash, as the case might be, for the deLisle share, and to deposit with Moat & Co. the bankers of the Workman estate the cheques and cash for the other share. No power of attorney was given by one to the other. Cott\u00e9 continued to act as book- keeper until the 24th May, 1888, when he fled the country on its being discovered that he had in the course of his duties embezzled from all the estates.\nIn 1889 Thomas Workman died leaving as executors Henry Archbald, John Murray Smith, and Walter Norton Evans, the appellants in the principal suit under consideration in the present appeal.\nThis suit was brought by the said executors against the representatives of the late A. M. deLisle to recover the sum of $2, 743 part of the defalcations of Cott\u00e9, which represented moneys which should have been received by the representatives of \"Workman and for which the plaintiffs alleged they had a right to make the defendants responsible.\nThe defendants, besides pleading to the principal action, brought an action in warranty against J. C. Baker et al, the representatives of the William Workman estate, claiming that, in so far as the principal plaintiffs had suffered any loss for which they might have a recourse, such loss had been suffered by the negligence of the William Workman estate represented by Baker in the common office, in not looking after Cott\u00e9.\nFurther, the defendants having asserted in the principal action that the said Thomas orkman was merely a pr\u00eate-nom for others, William Moat and J. 0. Baker, as well personally as executor of his wife, in whose interest the late Thomas Workman had purchased the share of the syndicate property, as before mentioned, intervened to ratify and support the proceedings taken by Thomas Workman's executors to the extent of ten elevenths of the sum claimed.\nThe facts of the case and the nature of the proceedings will be more fully understood from the judgment of Mr. Justice Taschereau hereinafter given.\nGeoffvion Q.C. and Abbott Q.C. for appellants.\nBe\u00efque Q.C. and Lafleur for respondents. The judgment of the court was delivered by\nTASCHEREAU J. This is a case of a rather complicated nature, and the fact that the voluminous evidence oral and documentary, submitted to our consideration, is partly taken in reference to another case not before us upon this appeal, has made the investigation of the evidence adduced more than usually difficult.\nThe principal action, Archibald v. deListe, which I shall consider first, is one by the Thomas Workman estate against the deLisle estate. The plaintiffs, now appellants, are the testamentary executors of the late Thomas Workman. It is necessary, for a proper understanding of my remarks, that I should in limine state the precise nature of the controversy between the parties.\nThe plaintiffs, appellants, allege by their declaration :\n1. That they are the legal representatives of the late Thomas Workman.\n2. That at all the times hereinafter mentioned the said Thomas Workman, or the plaintiffs as his legal representatives, were interested jointly and in equal shares with the defendants in certain real estate in the district of Montreal, in a joint adventure which was carried on by them together and the returns from which were equally divided from time to time between them.\n3. That the said Thomas Workman departed this life on the ninth day of October, one thousand eight hundred and eighty-nine.\n4. That during all the times and periods hereinafter mentioned one Honor\u00e9 Cott\u00e9 was the book-keeper and kept the accounts of the said joint adventure and received the cash of the said joint account\n5. That whilst acting as such book-keeper the said Cott\u00e9 received from time to time large sums of money which he did not credit in the books showing the transactions and receipts made on behalf of the plaintiffs and defendants on such account, but embezzled the same.\n6. That heretofore, to wit, on or about the twenty-third day of May, eighteen hundred and eighty-eight, the said Cott\u00e9 absconded, and that thereupon an inquiry was made into the transactions of the said joint account, whereby it appears that large sums of money had been so embezzled by the said Cott\u00e9. 7. That by agreement between the parties the course of business between them under which the said, joint account was conducted, was that all sums of money received by the said Cott\u00e9 for the said joint account and available from time to time for division-between the said co-adventurers, were deposited in the bank, to the credit of a certain adventure carried on by the representatives of the late William Workman and the defendants and known as the Workman and deLisle syndicate, and thereupon cheques were drawn for the amounts to which the said Thomas Workman or the plaintiffs or defendants, were entitled according to their share in the said amounts so deposited, or so received by the said Cott\u00e9 for the purposes of the said joint account and available for division, and the same were charged in the books of the said joint account as moneys paid to the respective Co-adventurers.\n8 That the cheques for the amounts to which the said Thomas Workman became entitled were always drawn to the order of his bankers Messrs. R. Moat & Co. and in the ordinary course of business should have been handed by the said Cott\u00e9 to the said firm in exchange for their receipts.\n9. That during the year eighteen hundred and eighty-five cheques to the order of R. Moat & Co. were drawn and signed by the representatives of the Workman and deLisle syndicate on the second of November the third of November and the fifth of November for the sums respectively of two hundred dollars, one hundred and twenty dollars, and five hundred dollars, forming a total of eight hundred and twenty dollars currency, being parts of amounts received by the said Cott\u00e9 and available for division and to which the said Thomas Work-man was entitled and the said cheques having been so drawn, the said amounts were chargel in the books of the said joint account by the said Cott\u00e9 as cash paid to the said Thomas Workman.\n10. That the said Cott\u00e9 did not deposit the said cheques with the said R. Moat & Co. in accordance with the agreement between the said parties and the usual conduct of the said business but retained the same in his possession although the amount thereof had been charged as having been received by the said Thomas Workman or the plaintiffs, whereby the balance of cash et the credit of the said joint account was made to appear greater than it actually was, and the amount of the shortage of the said Cott\u00e9 was made to appear less and the fraud and embezzlement of the said Cott\u00e9 were concealed to the extent of the amount of the said cheques.\n11. That the facts of the said transaction were only discovered by the plaintiffs and the said Thomas Workman after the absconding of the said Cott\u00e9. 12. That the said cheques having been so retained by the said Cott\u00e9 were never presented for payment, but remained and are now in the possession of the said Workman and deLisle syndicate, and the funds available therefor from time to time in the said bank account have been drawn out upon other cheques for the uses of the said joint adventurers and went into and became part of the funds of the said joint adventurers.\n13. That by reason of the premises the plaintiffs have sustained damage to the extent of eight hundred and twenty dollars, and the defendants were benefited to that extent.\n14. That during the year eighteen hundred and eighty-seven the said Cott\u00e9 charged in the books of the said joint account as cash payments made to or on behalf of the said Thomas Workman the following sums, namely :\nOn the first of September, eighteen hundred and eighty-seven, four hundred dollars.\nOn the second of November six hundred dollars\nOn the sixteenth of November three hundred dollars.\nOn the thirtieth of November, two hundred dollars, none of which sums were ever paid by him. or received by the said Thomas Workman.\n15. That the said Cott\u00e9 further received from one Morn at different times sums amounting to four hundred and twenty-three dollars and ten cents which sums were payable by the said Morin entirely to the said Thomas Workman the said defendants having no interest therein whatever\n16. That, notwithstanding, the said Cott\u00e9 received the said sums of money, and credited them to the joint account of the said business, and wrongfully paid them into the funds of the said joint account, by reason whereof the said defendants were benefited to the extent of the said sum of four hundred and twenty-three dollars and ten cents, and the said plaintiff and the said Thomas Workman were damaged to the extent thereof.\n17. That on the discovery of the said transactions the plaintiffs required the defendants to allow an entry to be made in the books of the said joint account, crediting them with the amount of said sums charged against the account of Thomas Workman, and of moneys belonging to him received by the said Cott\u00e9 which went into the funds of the said joint account, to the end that the plaintiffs might be credited and receive from the funds of the said joint account the said amounts, as by law they are entitled to do.\n18. That the defendants refused to pay the said amount or to allow the said entries to be made.\n19. That the plaintiffs declare that they are willing that the said cheques should be cancelled, upon payment by the said defendants to them of the said sums, or upon their receiving credit therefor in the hooks of the said joint account.\n20. That the said sums united form a total sum of two thousand seven hundred and forty-three dollars and ten cents, which the plaintiffs now claim from the defendants.\nThe defendants pleaded to this action that they and the plaintiffs were joint owners and not partners: that from lands sold each party received his share and neither is responsible to the other; that while they had an office and books in common the respective parties attended to their own interests ; that defendants took care Cott\u00e9 paid them their share and it was through plaintiffs' gross negligence that he embezzled the latter's share that especially did this occur through the fault of Baker, who persisted in employing Cott\u00e9 even after his intemperate and untrustworthy habits had been pointed out by the defendants ; that the four cash items charged were amounts received by Cott\u00e9 for plaintiffs, which they should have immediately demanded and received from Cott\u00e9 as the defendants immediately demanded and received the similar amounts by him collected for them ; that with regard to the cheques the defendants obtained at the same time similar cheques for similar amounts received by Cott\u00e9 or plaintiffs ; that Bott\u00e9, knowing defendants would immediately present their cheques, took care to provide funds, but relying on the negligence of Baker kept plaintiffs' cheques in his own possession, and they were found in his drawer after he had fled from the country ; that with regard to the Morin collections the money belonged exclusively to plaintiffs, and through the like negligence Cott\u00e9, who made the collection, was permitted to embezzle it ; that the defendants never were the agents of the plaintiffs for collections or responsible therefor, or for the dishonesty of Cott\u00e9, who was the agent of Thomas Workman alone ; that defendants have never, in any shape, benefited by the Morin moneys so belonging to Thomas Workman, and. any entries to the contrary are erroneous.\nBy consent the action was taken for a specific sum instead of an action pro socio or communi dividendo so that no question arises as to its nature and form\nBy the judgment of the Superior Court the action was dismissed. That judgment was confirmed in the Court of Review, Mr. Justice Davidson dissenting.\nI will refer immediately to a question of law, arising from the facts in evidence, which was argued before us as it had been in the two courts below. The plaintiffs contend that they and the defendants were partners in the speculation in question, and that the rules applying to partnerships should govern the present controversy. The defendants, on the other hand, take the position that there was no partnership between themselves and the plaintiffs, but a mere ownership par indivis, and that what Cott\u00e9 embezzled was the plaintiffs' moneys, they, the defendants, having got their half and nothing more.\nOn this point the appellants have failed to convince me that the Superior Court, Jette J., and the majority of the Court of Review who held that there was no partnership between the parties, were wrong, though it must be conceded, that there is room for the appellants' contention to the contrary ([1]). The consid\u00e9rants of the formal judgment of the Superior Court on this point are, however, to my mind unanswerable, and I would adopt them without further remarks. Nolan deLisle, I may further remark, had clearly not the power to form a partnership between his principals and the plaintiffs.\nI do not see, however, that the plaintiffs' case would at all be strengthened if they had succeeded in establishing that there was a partnership in the matter. If as found in the courts below, the loss of the plaintiffs' share by Cott\u00e9's frauds was after a division between them and the defendants, or rather, I should say, that it was exclusively the plaintiffs' share that was embezzled by Cott\u00e9, and by their negligence, or the negligence of their a\u00e8rent their case fails whether there was a partnership or a mere joint ownership par indiois between them and the defendants It is un questionable law that partners may stipulate that the profits of the concern will be divided at fixed periods before the end of the partnership ([2]) And that is What, expressly or tacitly, took place between the plaintiffs and the defendants Art 1844 of the Civil Code has therefore no application here as after each such division the partnership, as it were, is at an end, quoad the sums or things divided. Each of the partners then becomes individually the owner of the sums or things divided. Then the plaintiffs themselves, in their declaration, allege that the sums they claim is their share. Now that is a clear admission that there must have been a division for otherwise these sums would belong to the partnership.\nI now pass to the evidence. It would be perfectly useless for me to give the details of it here. There are two facts, I may remark, upon which there is no room for controversy The first is that no fraud whatever is charged or proved against the defendants or their agent, Nolan deLisle. That was conceded at the argument. And the second that the defendants received no benefit whatever from the moneys embezzled by Cott\u00e9. They did not receive a cent more than they were entitled to. They escaped from Cott\u00e9's frauds by being more vigilant than the plaintiffs. That is what as a matter of fact the two courts below have found to be the result of the evidence and that finding is, to my mind, entirely supported, assuming that to be a matter of inference from the facts proved upon which we could interfere. The plaintiffs had they acted as the defendants or their agent did, would not have been the victims of Cotte's frauds. Cotte was in fact, it seems to me unquestionable, enabled to pursue his systematic fraudulent dealings by the plaintiffs' negligence. He calculated on their dilatoriness to conceal his plundering\". Had the deLisle estate followed the plaintiffs' ways of doing business Cott\u00e9 would have robbed them as he did the plaintiffs. That is the whole case, and that being established the plaintiffs are out of court. Vigilantibus non dormientibus subvenit lex.\nI entirely agree in the elaborate judgment delivered by Mr. Justice Ouimet in that sense in the Court of Review and in the carefully drawn motifs of Mr. Justice Jett\u00e9'in his formal judgment in first instance.\nI should add that, as to the Morin item, $423100 claimed by the action, for the reasons given by the two courts below the plaintiffs' claim must also fail. Nolan deLisle swears that as a matter of fact this sum was never paid to the concern, and consequently that the defendants never received the half of it. Upon contradictory evidence the two courts below have come to the conclusion that this was so and that conclusion must stand.\nI would dismiss the principal appeal with costs distraits to the attorneys of the respondents.\nNow, as to the appeal on the action in warranty, deLisle et at v. Baker et al. The deLisles, upon being sued by the Thomas Workman estate in the action I have considered as above took an action in warranty against Baker et al. the appellants on this issue, as executors of the William Workman estate. They set forth by their declaration the issues on the principal action and allege that the transfer to Thomas Workman was mainly to serve the interests of the principal parties interested in the estate of William Workman, and on the understanding between the transferors and transferees that the business should continue to be managed, as it had previously been, on behalf of the William Workman's estate, to wit, by Baker who employed Cott\u00e9 ; that the said estate deLisle never undertook to manage the business of Thomas Workman or the \"parties to whom he lent his name but it was to be looked after by the William Workman estate through the negligence of which any loss suffered has arisen. Wherefore it is prayed that Baker et al. as executors of the William Workman estate be condemned to indemnify deLisle et al from any condemnation obtained against the latter.\nThe defendants in warranty, now appellants, denying these allegations, pleaded that it was arranged that all moneys should be paid direct to Moat & Co. as the bankers of Thomas Workman ; that the executors of William Workman had no power to make the alleged arrangements, which however, did not exist; and they had no interest in the new joint account.\nThe judgment a quo declares that the executors of the William Workman estate, the present appellants, were rightly sued in warranty by the deLisles, and maintains the action in warranty but concludes that as the principal action against the deLisles had been dismissed the court could condemn them the appellants only to the costs of the action.\nAn objection has been taken by the respondents, deLisle et al, that this is upon this issue an appeal merely for costs, which, in accordance with the jurisprudence of this court, following the rule laid down by the Privy Council and other courts in England, we should not entertain ([3])\nBut this ease is not governed by that rule. In Yeo v. Tatem ([4]), the Privy Council held that although an appeal will not lie in respect of costs only, yet, where there has been a mistake upon some matter of law which governs or affects the costs, the party prejudiced is entitled to have the benefit of correction by appeal\u00bb I refer also to Attenborough v. Kemp ([5]); and to Inglis v. Mansfield ([6]), where Lord Brougham said :\nIn the House of Lords, as well as in the Privy Council and Court of Chancery, you cannot appeal for costs alone, but you can bring an appeal on the merits, and if that is not a colourable ground of appeal for the purpose of introducing the question of costs, the Court of Review will treat that not as an appeal for costs but will consider the question of costs as fairly raised.\nThe present appeal falls under the rule laid down in these cases.\nHere, what the appellants complain of is that, in law, the action in warranty against them should have been dismissed and that there is an error in law, in the judgment appealed from, which maintains it. And under the cases above cited this is not in my opinion, an appeal merely for costs, though the result of the error in law which they complain of was, under the circumstances, by the judgment of the court a quo, merely to make them liable for the costs.\nThe case is quite distinguishable from those of Moir v. Huntingdon ([7]) ; and McKay v, The Township of Hinchinbrooke ([8]). What we held in those cases is that where the state of facts upon which a litigation went through the lower courts has ceased to exist so that the party appealing has no actual interest whatsoever upon the appeal but an interest as to costs, and where the judgment upon the appeal, whatever it may be, cannot be executed or have any effect between the parties except as to costs, this court will not decide abstract propositions of law merely to determine the liability as to costs where these were in the discretion of the courts below, for it might well be that the condemnation to such costs would have been the same though the party appealing had succeeded on the merits of the case * the condemnation as to costs in such a case by the court appealed from is not a necessary legal consequence of the judgment on the merits. It is not sufficient that a matter of law or of principle is involved ; the party seeking to appeal must have an actual interest to have that question reviewed. Such was the course followed by the Privy Council in Martfey v- Carson (1), to which I referred in McKay\n(1) 20 Can. S. C. R 694. The judgment of the Privy Council is as follows :\nWhereas there was this day read at the board a report from the judicial committee of the Privy Council dated the 4th July instant, in the words following, viz.:\nYour Majesty having been pleased, by your general order in council of. the 22nd .November, 1890 to refer unto this committee a humble petition of Robert Car- son in the matter of an appeal from the Supreme Court of Canada between Truman Celah Clark, appellant and the said Robert Carson, respondent, setting forth that the above named appellant, alleging that he felt aggrieved by a judgment of the Supreme Court of Canada of the 30th April, 1889, petitioned Your Majesty in Council for leave to appeal from the\nsaid judgment to Your Majesty in Council, which leave was granted by an order of Your Majesty in Council of the 8th February, 1890; that the appellant duly lodged his petition of appeal in the Privy Council office on the 1st December, 1890, that the appellant, when he petitioned Your Majesty in Council as aforesaid, deed poll dated the 13th October. 1885, duly executed by him and registered in the Land Registry Office, in the city of Victoria,British Columbia, the convened to his wife, Barbara Clark, all his right, title and interest in and to all the real estate owned by him, together with all easements enjoyed therewith, which said real estate and easements claimed are set. forth in the statement of defence and counter-claim of the v. The Township of Hinchinbrooke ([9]). But here the case is quite different. By the judgment against which the appellants, defendants in warranty, now appeal, they have been declared to be the warrantors of the plaintiffs m warranty. And as the plaintiffs on the principal action have appealed from the judgment dismissing their action, they might have obtained here a reversal of that judgment and obtained a condemnation against the defendants deLisle, plaintiffs in warranty. That condemnation would then have reflected on the appellants defendants in warranty, as it is res judicata between them and the plaintiffs in warranty, so long as that judgment stands, that they are their warrantors against the condemnations on the principal action. (In what form and by what means, the plaintiffs in warranty could then have obtained a judgment against the defendants in warranty we are here not concerned with). It-follows clearly that the appellants Baker et al., have an interest upon this appeal distinct and separate altogether from the condemnation to costs. They are, or were when they took this appeal, exposed to suffer from the consequences of the judgment which declares them to be warrantors of the plaintiffs in warranty, and are consequently entitled to be heard upon their appeal asking to be relieved, from that judgment.\nNow, as to the legality of that judgment. The only point it determines, as I have previously remarked, is that the estate William Workman is the warrantor of\nappellant in the action, and humbly praying that Your Majesty in Council will be pleased to rescind the said order in council of the 8th February, 1890, giving leave to appeal as aforesaid, and to dismiss the appeal with costs. The Lords of the Committee, in obedience to Your Majesty s said\ngeneral order of reference, have taken the said humble petition into consideration, and having heard counsel for the parties on both sides, their Lordships do this day agree humbly to report to Your Majesty as their opinion that this appeal ought to be dismissed. the deLisle estate on the action instituted against the latter by the Thomas Workman estate. As I have said it is the testamentary executors of the William Work-man estate who are accused of negligence by the plaintiffs in warranty, and it is for that negligence that the plaintiffs in warranty ask that the estate itself of William Workman be held liable. It seems to me doubtful, if, in such a case, it is not only the executors personally, and not qua executors, against whom the action should have been brought. I refer on this to what we held in this court in Ferrier v. Trepannier ([10]). However in the view I take of the case I will assume that the estate of William Workman was rightly brought into the case through its executors. I may also assume in favour of the plaintiffs in warranty, present respondents, that their action in warranty could be brought as it has been, and that they were not obliged to wait till a condemnation was obtained to then proceed against their warrantors by a principal action. That seems to me a mere matter of form, and a question which obviously may give rise to many difficulties in the \"procedure under certain circum-stances, but which, as I view it, cannot affect a case where the principal action and the action in warranty are both en \u00e9tat, and together submitted for judgment. I refer to the authorities cited in Gauthier v. Darche ([11]). The authorities cited in Central Vermont v. La Compagme d'Assurance ([12]), from the modern jurisprudence in France, evidently relate to controversies as to procedure or jurisdiction, and the Court of Queen's Bench, in that case would perhaps have hesitated to dismiss the action in warranty had they found that the accident there in question had been caused by the negligence of the defendant in warranty. There are a number of reported cases in France where, for instance, the return by a bailiff being impugned, the bailiff is sued in warranty, and called in the case to defend his acts and indemnify the party who employed him for all condemnations and damages that he may be liable to or suffer, in consequence of the illegality of said acts. Bioche ([13]) refers to many cases of that nature.\nIt is after all, a mere question of words and of the name of the proceeding. For it is only as regards the principal action that the action in warranty is an incidental demand; between the warrantee and the warrantor it is a principal action ([14]) ; and that action may be brought only after the judgment on the principal action. The plaintiff in the principal action may object to the delay which might result from the defendant's action in warranty, but if he does not I do not see that the defendant in warranty has any interest to object to the manner in which he is called in where no question of jurisdiction arises or he does not suffer any prejudice thereby.\nIn a recent case of Compagnie l'Abeille, in the Court of Appeal of Paris ([15]), a common carrier, sued in damages for an accident to one of his passengers, brought an action in warranty against a third party whose negligence had been the immediate cause of the accident.\nAnd the books are fill of such instances where two actions en responsabilit\u00e9 are joined under the name of warranty.\nIn another class of cases an instance of which is re Granier v Cambard ([16]) before the Court of Cassation a third party is brought in as warrantor en garantie simple et responsabilit\u00e9 in an action en declaration d'hypoth\u00e8que ([17]).\nThe case of The Royal Electric Co. v. Leonard ([18]) is distinguishable. There the action in warranty had been taken by the plaintiff on the principal action, and the action was based on a contract with a third party. Moreover, the conclusions of the action in warranty, as shown by the judgment of my brother Fournier who delivered the judgment of the court, were absolutely untenable.\nThe appellants' contentions on this point would not seem to me well founded.\nI would, however, allow the appeal, on the ground that the dismissal of the principal action was, under the circumstances of the case fatal to the action in warranty. The court having held on the first action that the defendants deLisle were not liable to the Thomas Workman estate, it follows that the William Workman estate is not liable towards them, the deLisles. The declaration in warranty is based on the essential allegation that in so far as the said principal plaintiffs have suffered any loss in the premises for which they have any recourse against the said estate deLisle, such loss has been suffered by the negligence of the said William Workman estate, represented in the said common office by the said Joel Baker in not looking after the said Cott\u00e9, and preventing him, which they could easily have done with common care and prudence, from robbing the said Thomas Workman or those he represented.\"\nNow, it being determined that the principal plaintiffs have not suffered any loss for which they have any recourse against the estate deLisle, the estate deLisle, upon their own allegations, have no action in warranty against the William Workman estate. Mais je dois supposer, says Boncenne, (vol. 3, p. 419) ce qui d'ailleurs est le plus ordinaire, que les deux causes r\u00e9unies sont parvenues jusqu'\u00e0 leur terme commun, avec le demandeur originaire, avec le d\u00e9fendeur qui s'est, \u00e0 son tour, constitu\u00e9 demandeur en garantie, et le tiers qu'il a fait assign\u00e9 pour y r\u00e9pondre. Le premier perd-il son proc\u00e8s ? Les deux autres le gagnent a la fois, et ii est condamn\u00e9 envers eux \u00e0 tous les d\u00e9pens ; car son action avait rendu n\u00e9cessaire le recours en garantie.\nThat is, of course, when the defendant in warranty was a warrantor of the principal defendant\u00bb If he is not a warrantor, and has wrongly been called in as such, the action in warranty is dismissed with costs against the plaintiff in warranty. But in both cases it must be dismissed. No question of that kind as to costs arises in the present case ; none were asked against the principal plaintiffs ([19]).\nThe action in warranty consequently fails, in my opinion whether the William Workman estate were warrantors of the deLisle estate or not. If they are not warrantors, cadit questio ? If they are warrantors it is only of condemnations that might have been given against the warrantee, not of all false accusations or unfounded complaints that the warrantee might be subject to.\nThe plaintiffs in warranty might very well have postponed the bringing of the action in warranty till after the judgment on the principal action. They elected to take proceedings against their warrantors before they had themselves been condemned ; they have done so at their own risks. They based their action upon an eventuality, and that never happening they alone must bear the consequences thereof, for the defendants, appellants on this issue, if at all their warrantors, were warrantors of their damages and condemnations, not of their fears of damages, nor of contingent liabilities. It is not their fault if an unfounded action has been taken against the warrantee. And it is likewise not their fault if the warrantee did not get the costs of the action in warranty included in the judgment of dismissal of the action against the principal plaintiffs.\nIn the case I previously referred to of La Compagnie l'Abeille ([20]) the principal action was dismissed in appeal, and the court declared consequently \" qu'il n'y a lieu de statuer sur Ia demande en garantie,\" and condemned the plaintiff in warranty to the costs on his action. \"We should perhaps adopt that course here. For, to use the words of the Cour de Cassation, in another case of 8th January, 1894 ([21]) : \" Il n'y a plus en effet de garantie \u00e0 exercer, lorsque sur la d\u00e9fense du garantie, la demande originaire tombe.\"\nIn a previous case, a consid\u00e9rait of a Court of Appeal was as follows :\nAttendu que l'action en garantie a \u00e9t\u00e9 soumise aux premiers juges, que s'ils n'y ont pas statue, c'est que, en \u00e9cartant la demande principale, ils n'avaient pas besoin de s'occuper de la demande en garantie ([22]).\nAnd the Cour de Cassation, in an action en garantie formelle, held that:\nAttendu que l'action principale \u00e9tant \u00e9cart\u00e9e, il ne peut pas y avoir lieu a garantie ([23]).\nAnd, said the same court in the same sense, in another case :\nLe demandeur qui succombe au principal peut \u00eatre condamn\u00e9 aux frais de l'action en garantie, sur le seul motif qu'elle a eu pour cause la demande principale, sans que la Cour soit tenue d appr\u00e9cier le m\u00e9rite de cette action en garantie ([24]).\nI have already remarked that here no costs were asked against the principal plaintiffs. In the province of Quebec, in apposite cases of Peck v. Harris ([25]) and Lyman v. Peck ([26]), on appeal, the principal action having been dismissed, the action en garantie, was also dismissed with costs against the plaintiff en garantie.\nIn a case of Aylwin v. Judah ([27]). the court having dismissed the principal action, held on the action en garantie formelle that the court could not consequently adjudicate upon it, and ordered the costs thereof to be paid by the plaintiff in the principal action.\nIn an action of Fraser v. St. Jorre, and St. .Jorre plaintiff in warranty v. Dumais, defendant in warranty, Mr. Justice Casault, in 1877, at Kamouraska, having dismissed the principal action adjudicated as follows on the action in warranty :\nConsid\u00e9rant que le d\u00e9fendeur en garantie \u00e9tait le garant formel du demandeur en garantie, qu'il aurait d\u00fb prendre son fait et cause et que les moyens qu'il a invoqu\u00e9s dans ses defenses \u00e0 la demande en garantie n \u00e9taient pas une r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la dite demande en garantie les dites d\u00e9fenses du d\u00e9fendeur en garantie sont renvoy\u00e9es avec d\u00e9pens, et vu le renvoi de l'action principale, l'action en garantie est renvoy\u00e9e sans frais.\nI would allow the appeal of the defendants in warranty and declare that the principal action having been dismissed, a decision on the merits of the action in warranty has become unnecessary, with an order that the costs on that issue be paid by the plaintiff in warranty to the defendants in warranty, distraits to their attorneys.\nThere remains the appeal on the intervention Moat et al v. deLisle et at.\nIn consequence of the pretension set forth by the defendants in an amended plea to the principal action, that the late Thomas Workman was only a pr\u00e9te-nom, William Moat and Joel C. Baker the latter both personally and in his capacity of executor under the will of his wife Louisa Frothingham Workman, became intervenants, as representing ten elevenths of the amount sued for by the Workman estate in the principal action and prayed acte of their concurrence and approval of the conclusions taken in the principal demand for one eleventh.\nThe defendants in pleading to the intervention practically repeated their defences to the principal action and again concluded for its dismissal.\nThe principal action have been dismissed, the courts below dismissed the intervention. No other judgment was possible * having espoused the cause of the plaintiffs, their joint owners, the intervenants must bear the consequences of the defeat of the action. Consequently, the principal appeal being dismissed, the appeal on the intervention must likewise be dismissed with costs distraits to the attorneys of the respondents in that appeal.\nA good many irregularities appear in connection with the proceedings on this issue. They, however, affect questions of practice, or matters in the discretion of the court of first instance with which we cannot interfere.\nAppeals in the principal action and the intervention dismissed with costs.\nAppeal in the action in warranty allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants : Abbotts, Campbell &Meredith.\nSolicitors for the respondents : Barnard & Barnard.\n[1] Troplong, Suci\u00e9t\u00e9, nos. 19 et Seq.\n[2] 7 Pont no. 430 ; 26 Laurent, nos. 440 et seq.\n[3] Witt V.

M. & Co., composed of T. and M., arranged to pay his other creditors 50 per cent of their claims, \u0442. M. & Co. indorsing his notes for securing such payment, they to be paid in full but payment to be postponed until a future named day. \u0442. M. & Co. were secured for indorsing by an agreement under seal, by which it was agreed that if F. should at any time, in the opinion of \u0422. M. & Co., or either of them, become incapable of attending to his business, the debt due T. M. & Co. should at once become due and they could take possession of the stock in trade, book debts and property of F. and sell the same for their claim, having first served on F. a notice in writing, signed by the firm name, stating that in their opinion F. was so incapable; and that on a change in the firm of T. M. & Co. the agreement should enure to the benefit of the firm as changed if it assumed the liabilities of, and took over T.\u2019s indebtedness to, the old firm.\nThis arrangement was carried out, and some time after the date for payment to T. M. & Co., payment not having been made, a bank to which F. was indebted failed, and T. M. & Co., then consisting of T. and. N., M. having retired, persuaded F. to assign his book debts to them, and afterwards served on him a notice as required by the agreement, and took possession of his place of business and stock. F. then agreed to act for T. M. & Co. until a certain day after, and resumed possession, but when T. \u041c. & Co. returned on said day he disputed their right and ejected them from the premises. Two days after he assigned to the official assignee for the benefit of all his creditors, and T. M. & Co. issued a writ to replevy the goods from him and the assignee. Held, affirming the decision of the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench, Gwynne J. dissenting, that F. and the assignee were guilty of a joint conversion of the property replevined. Gwynne J. held that there was no conversion by either.\nHeld, also, affirming said decision, Gwynne J. dissenting, that if T. M. & Co. formed an honest opinion that F. was incapable such opinion must govern, though mistaken in point of law or fact, illogical or inconclusive; that they were justified in believing, from his loose business methods, waste of time over small matters, financial embarrassments, and acting under the direction of his creditors, that F. was worn down by worry and generally unfit for business; that the fact that the notice would not have been given if certain demands of \u0442. M. & Co. had been complied with did not necessarily show mala fides; and that the change in the firm of \u0422. M. & Co. did not vitiate the notice as one of the original members clearly formed the opinion, if one was formed, and conveyed it to F.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench for Manitoba ([1]) affirming the judgment at the trial against the defendant Francis, but reversing such judgment in favour of the defendant Bertrand.\nThe material facts of the case are sufficiently stated in the above head-note and fully set out in the judgments given on this appeal. On the trial of the action of replevin judgment was given for the plaintiff against the defendant Francis, but the learned trial judge held that Bertrand, the official assignee, was not guilty of a conversion of the goods. On appeal to the full court the plaintiff had judgment against both defendants.\nEwart Q.C. for the appellants. Only the original members of the firm of Turner, McKeand & Co. could take advantage of the agreement and enforce it. Dedrick v. Ashdown ([2]); Doe d. Stephens v. Lord([3]).\nThe Chief Justice at the trial held that there was no general conversion, and his finding should be upheld. Replevin would not have lain in such a case as this at common law. Then as the property was in Francis he had a right to transfer it, and the statute law of Manitoba does not authorize this action.\nNicoll v. Glennie (1) is very similar to this case Oil the question of conversion.\nHowell Q.C. and Darby for the respondents. If Turner did in fact form the opinion that Francis was in-capacitated the court will not inquire as to the grounds on which it was based. Allcroft v. The Bishop of London (2).\nAs to plaintiffs\u2019 title to the property, see Knights v. Wiffen (3); White v. Nelles ([4]).\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014I concur in the judgment of Mr. Justice King.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014I would dismiss the appeal for the reasons given in the courts below. The appellant took a new point before us under the third clause of the agreement, but he cannot be allowed to do so because, if that point had been taken in the court below, evidence might have been brought upon it Owners of Ship Tasmania v. Smith (5).\nGWYNNE J.\u2014This action was instituted by a writ of replevin issued out of the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench for the province of Manitoba, upon the 22nd day of September, 1893, by the plaintiffs Turner and Naismith, trading under the name, style and firm of Turner, McKeand & Co. against the defendant Francis and the defendant Bertrand, the former of whom by an indenture bearing date and executed upon the 28th day of August, 1893, conveyed and assigned to the latter all the goods, chattels, credits and effects, which are the subject of this action, in trust for the benefit of the creditors of the defendant Francis.\nThe plaintiffs, as constituting now the firm of Turner, McKeand & Co., claim the said goods and chattels, credits and effects to be their property and to have been wrongfully taken from their possession by the defendants.\nThe plaintiffs in their statement of claim allege that the defendants took the goods of the plaintiffs, that is to say, all the stock in trade consisting of dry goods, &c., and general merchandise contained in the store or building, situate on the north side of the main highway at Headingly in Manitoba, lately occupied by F. H. Francis (the defendant of that name) and also a certain book of accounts called Journal No. 1, lately kept by the said F. H. Francis in his business as a retail trader and unjustly detained the same, &c., until, &c.\nTo this statement of claim the defendants have pleaded:\n1st. That they did not take the said goods as alleged; and\n2nd. That the said goods were the goods of the defendants and not of the plaintiffs.\nThe plaintiffs joined issue upon the pleas. As to the first of them it may be here observed, that if the goods were ever taken by any one from the possession of the plaintiffs, they were so taken, as indeed is the contentention of the plaintiffs, on the 24th August, 1893, by the defendant Francis alone who by indenture upon the 28th of the same month, while the goods were in his actual possession as apparent owner, assigned them to the defendant Bertrand, in trust for the benefit of the creditors of Francis. Bertrand never in any manner took or was a party to any taking of the goods out of the possession of the plaintiffs.\nThis action was instituted in the form of an action of replevin instead of conversion for the purpose no doubt of the plaintiffs thereby obtaining possession of the book called the journal no. 1, which contained as they allege an assignment by Francis of his book debts to the plaintiffs for their exclusive benefit. Certainly, as was contended by the defendants in the court below, there was no joint taking, but that does not conclude the action, for the second plea of the defendants and upon which the plaintiffs have joined issue has raised the question of property in the goods, which issue, if found in the defendants\u2019 favour, entitled them to the goods. That plea admits a taking and the issue joined upon it is: Did the property in the goods which, it is not questioned, did originally belong to Francis, pass to the defendant Bertrand under the indenture of assignment for the benefit of the creditors of Francis, or, on the contrary, had the plaintiffs then, as they claim to have had, prior title to and property in the goods by title from Francis superior to the title professed to be passed by the deed of assignment to Bertrand, by reason whereof, as the plaintiffs contend, nothing passed to Bertrand, and that the goods, or the monies realized from the sale thereof (for they have been sold by arrangement between the parties to abide the result of this action) are the property of the plaintiffs.\nThe plaintiffs have produced in evidence an instrument bearing date the 10th Sept., 1891, executed under the hands and seals of the defendant Francis of the first part, and by the plaintiff Turner and one John Chetwood Martindale, then trading as wholesale grocers under the name, style and firm of Turner, McKeand & Co. of the second part, as the foundation of the title which the plaintiffs set up to maintain their assertion that the goods in question are their property. It is unnecessary to set out that instrument in full, though I shall have to refer to it and some of its provisions. For the purposes of this suit it is sufficient to say that we are concerned only with the instrument in so far as it relates to an old debt amounting to the sum of $5,259 due by Francis to Turner and Martindale, constituting the then firm of McKeand & Co., which that instrument was executed to secure; for although the instrument operated also as security for a further sum of $3,600 due by Francis to other persons for which sum Turner & Martindale became security, yet that sum has either been paid in full by Francis to the persons to whom it was due, or settled by compromise with them, so that, as I have said, we are concerned only with the old debt of $5,259, or as much thereof as still remains unpaid. Of this debt there remained due in 1893 the sum of about $4,800, for which sum, as the plaintiff Turner says in his evidence, judgment was entered against Francis in August of that year. The old firm was dissolved on the 30th June, 1893, by the retirement therefrom of Martindale. Upon this dissolution the plaintiff Turner entered into partnership with the plaintiff Naismith and they have been carrying on business together in partnership from the 1st July, 1893, under the name, style and firm of Turner, McKeand & Co.\nI propose now to consider the construction and operation of the instrument as regards the old debt of $5,259, 1st, as if the old firm was still existing, and 2nd, if necessary, as to what effect if any the dissolution of the old firm and the formation of the new had upon it.\nNow by the instrument it is witnessed and it is thereby covenanted and agreed by and between the parties thereto,\n1. That in the event of the death of the said party of the first part, or in case the said party of the first part shall at any time, in the opinion of the said parties of the second part or of either of them, from any cause become incapable of attending to his business, then and in either of such cases the said sum of five thousand two hundred and fifty-nine dollars, or any part thereof which shall then remain unpaid, shall become due and payable by the party of the first part to the said parties of the second part notwithstanding, that the first day of December 1892 shall not have arrived.\nHere it is necessary to observe that by a previous clause it had been recited that it had been agreed between the parties that the said sum of $5,259 should be due and payable in one year from the first day of December, 1891, subject to the proviso thereinafter contained, namely, the provision above recited from the instrument, which then proceeded as follows:\n2. And if at any time it shall be the opinion of the said parties of the second part or either of them that the said party of the first part is so incapable of attending to his business, as aforesaid, a notice in writing signed by the firm name of the said parties of the second part stating that in their opinion the party of the first part is so incapable shall be served by them upon the said party of the first part or left at his usual place of abode, and such notice so served and the date of such service shall be and determine the date of such incapacity.\n3. And it is further covenanted and agreed by and between the said parties hereto, that forthwith upon the death of the party of the first part, or upon the party of the first part becoming incapacitated from attending to his business as hereinbefore mentioned and provided, it shall be lawful for the parties of the second part, &c., to enter into and upon, and to take full and complete possession of, all the personal property, stock in trade, book debts, real estate, credits and effects in Manitoba of the said party of the first part, and to keep, hold and retain full and complete possession thereof, and to proceed with all reasonable despatch to sell and dispose of the said real estate, stock in trade, personal property, book debts, credits and effects of the said party of the first part, and to receive and hold the proceeds thereof and to apply the moneys which the said parties of the second part may receive from such sale or sales in payment first of the said sum of $5,259, or so much thereof as shall then remain unpaid, with interest at the rate of eight per cent per annum,\nand secondly, in payment of all costs, charges and expenses incurred in carrying into effect the said purpose; and thirdly, to hand over to the party of the first part all surplus moneys realized from the sale, and all property not sold.\nNow the first question which suggests itself is: Can it possibly be held to have been the intent of the parties to this instrument that the provisions above contained in the paragraph numbered three, recited from the instrument and thereby purported to be given, should be unlimited in duration so long as the parties of the second part should suffer the old debt of $5,259, or any part thereof, to remain unpaid; and that at any time, however remote, the parties of the second part, by serving upon the party of the first part a notice to the effect stated in the above paragraph numbered two, might enter upon and take possession of and dispose of to their own use all the property subsequently, it may be, acquired by the party of the first part by purchase from other wholesale traders with whom he was dealing on terms of credit, while the parties of the second part, as the plaintiff Turner has stated the fact to be, only sold to him goods for cash, after the execucution of the said instrument, and so cut out all the creditors who furnished the party of the first part with the property so xo be taken and applied by the parties of the second part with eight per cent interest thereon ? If the instrument invested the parties thereto of the second part with any such power, then if the party of the first part should carry on his business for twenty years and then die, while the parties of the second part should suffer the debt to remain unsatisfied, or if the parties of the second part could, while the party of the first part was still carrying on his business, at the expiration of such twenty years by serving a notice upon him, that in their opinion he was incapacitated from attending to his business and that therefore they would exercise the power now claimed, it must, I think, be admitted that if they could succeed in their contention a most ingenious device is after many years contrived which would have the effect of overriding and rendering nugatory all provisions of the law and all decisions of the courts relating to chattel mortgages, bills of sale, frauds upon creditors, and the rights of purchasers for value of chattel property from persons in the actual possession thereof as owners.\nBut whatever may be the power conferred by the instrument over the property it cannot in my opinion be construed as conferring any such power unlimited in its duration.\nThe provisions contained in the clause of the instrument above cited in the paragraph numbered 1, are plainly limited as to their duration.\nThe sole object of that clause appears from its contents to have been to expedite the time of payment of a debt before it should become payable, in the event of the death of the debtor, or of his becoming at any time, in the opinion of his creditors, the parties of the second part, incapable of attending to his business: Such being the sole effect of the death, in the event of its occurring, or of the debtor at any time becoming incapable, &c., which is provided for in the clause, the death therein referred to, and the event of the debtor becoming at any time incapable, &c., as provided for in the same clause, must be limited to their respectively occurring before the debt (the time of payment of which was to be expedited by their occurring), should become payable according to the time originally fixed for its payment, that is to say, the first of December, 1892.\nThen the clause recited from the instrument as set out above in the paragraph numbered 2 plainly, as it appears to me, relates wholly to the expediting of the time of payment of the debt as provided for in the first clause and without which it is plain that the first clause would have been incomplete.\nIn the case of death, that event happening no doubt determined the incapacity of the deceased to attend to his business, and therefore the second paragraph says nothing as to the case of death; but the parties of the second part never could expedite the time of payment of the debt by forming an opinion as to the incapacity of the party of the first part to attend to his business if they should keep that opinion unexpressed, a creature of their own minds or of the mind of one of them; provision therefore is made in the second paragraph above, without which the first would be incomplete, for signifying the opinion so formed to the party of the first part by service of a notice upon him, and by providing that the incapacity, however long the opinion may have been entertained by the parties of the second part, should date only from the time of the serving of such notice. Until at least service of such notice the time of payment of the original debt could not be expedited for incapacity of the party of the first part to attend to his business, as contemplated by the first clause. The first clause was therefore incomplete without the second which must be taken and read with, and as forming part of, the first, and this appears to me to be the true literal construction of the second clause. The language is:\nIf at any time it shall be the opinion of the parties of the second part, &c., that the party of the first part is so incapable of attending 10 his business as aforesaid.\nNow the words \u201cso\u201d and \u201cas aforesaid\u201d as here used cannot be construed as equivalent or as substitution for \u201cin the opinion of the parties of the second part,\u201d &C., for these latter words are themselves expressly used in the clause. The words \u201cso\u201d and \u201cas aforesaid\u201d as here used must, I think, be construed as referring to the party of the first part becoming incapable of attending to his business, \u201cso as aforesaid\u201d mentioned in the preceding clause and for which provision is therein made in the event of its occurring as therein contemplated, that is to say, at any time before the 1st December, 1892, when the debt would in due course become payable. The first clause of the agreement being thus incomplete without the second they must be read together, and being so read must clearly, in my opinion, be limited as to their operation to the time elapsing between the 10th September, 1891, and the 1st December, 1892. Then if these clauses be so limited, is there any reason why a more unlimited operation should be given to the third paragraph ? Its language is:\nAnd it is further covenanted, &c., that forthwith upon the death of the said party of the first part, or upon the party of the first part becoming incapacitated from attending to his business as hereinbefore mentioned and provided, it shall be lawful for the parties of the second part,\u201d &c.\nThe language here used \u201c it is further covenanted, &c.\u201d seems at the outset to show that what is provided for in the clause is something in connection with and in furtherance of what had gone before.\nNow the first clause, for any beneficial purpose would have been as incomplete without the third clause as it would have been, as above shown, without the second; for if the first and second had stood alone without the third, the parties of the second part to the instrument would have had no means of recovering judgment of the debt, the time for payment of which was expedited by the first clause, except by action, which in the event of the death of the party of the first part or of his becoming incapable to attend to his business might have proved a very protracted mode of realizing what in those events might prove to be a very insufficient Security. This third paragraph was therefore introduced for the purpose of providing a speedy mode of recovery of the debt the payment of which was so expedited by the occurrence of the death or such incapacity of the party of the first part. The powers professed to be conferred by the third paragraph\u2014\nforthwith upon the death of the party of the first part or upon his becoming incapacitated from attending to his business as hereinbefore mentioned and provided.\nThese latter words apply equally to the death of the party of the first part as to his becoming incapacitated &\u0421.,\u2014the death and the incapacity mentioned in the first clause of the instrument whereby it was provided that the time of payment of the debt should be expedited by the occurrence of either before the debt should become due by lapse of the time originally established for its becoming due; supplemented to this and as necessary to complete the benefit contemplated as conferred by the first paragraph, the third provides that forthwith upon the death of the party of the first part, that is the death before mentioned in the first paragraph, and forthwith upon the party of the first part becoming incapacitated from attending to his business as before mentioned and provided in the first and second paragraphs taken together, it shall be lawful for the parties of the second part, &c., to obtain satisfaction of the debt the time of payment of which was so expedited by the means mentioned in the third paragraph. Thus construed the whole three clauses are consistent and all are necessary to give efficacy and completeness to the first. What the parties were providing for, as I think, sufficiently appears upon the instrument, namely, the possibility of the death, or the incapacity of the party of the first part to attend to his business occurring before the sums mentioned in the instrument should mature due by the lapse of time appointed for that maturity. So the first clause provides that the debt made due to the parties of the second part upon the 1st of December, 1892, shall become due and payable by the party of the first part to the parties of the second \u05d9 part, notwithstanding that the said 1st day of December, 1892, shall not have arrived, in the event of the death of the said party of the first part or of his becoming incapable, in the opinion of the parties of the second part, of attending to his business; such death or incapacity must of necessity occur before the 1st December, 1892, but the first clause being incomplete as to the event of incapacity occurring, the second clause was introduced to remove such incompleteness,, and as both first and second were incomplete without the third, it was inserted as indeed necessary to the completeness of the whole, and all three must be cons trued together as having relation to the expediting the time of payment of the debt as mentioned in the first paragraph. We thus give to the whole a natural, and rational construction and avoid the extravagant contention urged on behalf of the plaintiffs that the instrument of the 10th September, 1801, gave to the parties thereto of the second part power unlimited in duration over all property the defendant Francis should ever thereafter acquire, so long as any part of the said debt of $5,259 should remain unpaid, which debt the parties of the second part might suffer to remain unsatisfied while they might be receiving interest thereon for the express purpose of enabling them, at their pleasure, to assert this extraordinary control which is now contended for over a person in business, trading with the rest of the world in ignorance of the peculiar power claimed to be enjoyed by these favoured creditors over the property of the common debtor.\nThe appeal should be allowed with costs, in my opinion, upon the above considerations alone, and judgment be ordered to be entered for the defendants in the court below with costs, and for the delivery to them of the goods in question or payment of the proceeds arising from the sale thereof.\nBut assuming the power proposed to be conferred by the instrument of September, 1891, upon the parties thereto of the second part to be unlimited in duration, as now contended by the plaintiffs, the question remains: Did or did not the condition precedent arise which was necessary to arise before the powers proposed to be given by the instrument could come into force and be exercised ?\nIn solving this question it is necessary to attach a definite meaning to the expressions used in the instrument, viz.:\nIn case the said party of the first part shall, in the opinion of the parties of the second part, or of either, from any cause become incapable of attending to his business, &c., &c.\nin the first paragraph, and the expression:\nForthwith upon the party of the first part, becoming incapacitated from attending to his business as hereinbefore mentioned and provided it shall be lawful for the parties of the second part\n&c., &c., as in the third paragraph.\nFrom the terms of the instrument it is quite plain that it never was intended that the parties of the second part should have it in their power at any time they pleased, while Francis\u2019 debt to them remained unpaid, without any cause whatever but influenced by mere caprice at their own arbitrary will and pleasure, to declare the party of the first part to have become in their opinion incapable of attending to his business, and upon serving upon him a notice to that effect, that it should be lawful for them to take possession of his property and to dispose of it under the powers in the instrument, as the property of a person no longer capable of attending to his business It is obvious that when the instrument was executed Francis was deemed to be perfectly capable of attending to his business, and what was intended to be provided for was, the possible event of his falling into a condition different from that in which he then was, of such a nature as in the opinion of the parties to the instrument of the second part to render him incapacitated, that is, made by some cause or other incapable of attending any longer to his business. The only cause which could render a person, perfectly capable of attending to his business, incapacitated from doing so any longer must be a cause physical or mental, so that the incapacity contemplated by the instrument must be one arising from some physical or mental cause having such an effect upon the party of the first part as to render him, in the bon\u00e2 fide opinion of the parties of the second part, or of one of them, incapacitated from attending any longer to his business. The condition precedent was thus of a twofold character; 1st, that there should be shown to be some change in the condition or conduct of the party to the instrument of the first part, which, 2ndly, in the bon\u00e2 fide entertained opinion of the parties of the second part, or of one of them, had the effect of rendering the party of the first part incapacitated from any longer attending to his business. I have said \u201c in the bon\u00e2 fide entertained opinion of the parties of the second part,\u201d for it is manifestly not the intent, of the instrument that the parties thereto of the second part should acquire a right to exercise the powers mentioned in the instrument upon their merely serving a notice upon the party of the first part that they were of opinion that he had become incapacitated from attending to his business if they in fact and in truth did not entertain the opinion. Whether they did or did not in truth entertain the opinion within the meaning contemplated by the instrument raises a question not to be concluded by their simply serving a notice upon Francis stating that they entertained the opinion; the truth or falsehood of such a statement is a matter to be inquired into like any other question of fact and determined by the reasons which may be given in support of the opinion, and by the acts and dealings of the parties professing to entertain the opinion with the person incapacitated in their opinion from attending to his business.\nIf they can give no reason for their entertaining the opinion which should influence the judgment of rational men acting in good faith, or if their own dealings with the party are inconsistent with their entertaining the opinion, the natural inference to be drawn is that it is not true that they entertained the opinion the actual bon\u00e2 fide entert\u0430\u0456\u043f\u0456ng of which is an essential element in the condition precedent. An opinion to be entertained is, according to all dictionaries of the English language\u2014\nthe judgment which the mind forms of the proposition, the truth or falsehood of which is supported by a degree of evidence which renders it probable but does not produce absolute knowledge or certainty.\nIf the parties professing to entertain the opinion that, the defendant Francis had become incapacitated from carrying on his business cannot support the judgment they profess to have formed of such incapacity by some such probable evidence as should satisfy rational men of their sincerity in the judgment they profess to have formed, they must abide the natural consequence in such a case of a judgment being rendered to the effect that in truth and in fact they did not entertain the opinion, and that their conduct in the premises is attributable to a wholly different cause, and this is the judgment which, in my opinion, the evidence in this case warrants.\nThe facts disclosed in the evidence are that from the time of the execution of the instrument of September, 1891, Francis proceeded with the carrying on of his business as before. He continued purchasing goods from the old firm of Turner, McKeand & Co., who, as the plaintiff Turner says, sold to him for cash \u2018 only, and from other wholesale dealers upon terms of credit.. Three wholesale dealers who have dealt with him for ten, eleven and twelve years respectively, testify that during all that period there was no change whatever observable in his capacity for attending to his business, that he was a very careful, painstaking honourable, cautious and capable man.\nUpon the 30th of June, 1893, however, the Commercial Bank of Manitoba failed. Upon that day the plaintiff Turner, as he himself testifies, went out to Headingly, where Francis carried on his business, to see him with regard to the failure of the bank, because, as he said, Francis had a big discount there and he was afraid that the failure of the bank might get Francis into trouble. He thought that the bank would go to work and crowd a great many people in the country, and that he, Turner, would be the first to move; accordingly, without communication with any of Francis\u2019 other creditors, he went out to Headingly, where, at Francis\u2019 store there, he heard that Francis was not feeling well; from there he went down to Francis\u2019 house and saw him, and \u201c first told him that the bank had failed and asked for an assignment of book debts in the shape of notes or otherwise to cover the Turner, McKeand & Co. account.\u201d Turner says that Francis replied that he was not feeling well and that he asked Turner to come again another time, and that he would see him later. Francis, as to this interview, says that Turner came up to the house and asked him for an assignment of his book debts for the benefit of Turner, McKeand & Co. and also to sign a demand note which he had with him, and said: I see you are a little rattled; I will not bother you any more tonight,\nand then left. Francis says that Turner found him not at all ill, but working at his books. Turner says that his next interview with Francis was on the 12th July, in Winnipeg, when he says he pressed Francis for the covering of the account, the old account, by notes or otherwise, and that after talking together for some little time they arranged that they should go out together the next day to Francis\u2019 place to get from him farmer\u2019s notes, book debts or whatever he had to cover the account; that they went out together the next morning, and upon arrival at Francis\u2019 place he refused to give an assignment of any debts at first. Being asked if he did not ask him for any reason why he had promised the night before, but refused the following morning, he answered:\nNo, I did not that I know of,\nthat he did not ask for any reason in direct words, that Francis argued about the thing a little and being asked\u2014\nwhat was the reason for his objecting as far as you could make out ?\nhe answered \u2014\nwell I made out, I asked to let my clerk go out there and collect and he demurred to that and I think that was the reason he objected, and after a while we came to an understanding that we would appoint his Mr. Fowler.\nThen he says that after a while Francis agreed to assign the book debts and produced his journal no one\u2014in which Turner wrote and Francis signed the following: \u2014\nKnow all men by these presents that I, Frederick Henhurst Francis, of the Parish of Headingly, for valuable consideration given by James Louis Turner and Daniel Naismith trading as Turner, McKeand & Co. of the City of Winnipeg (the receipt whereof is hereby acknowledged) do hereby assign, transfer and set over all the accounts in journal number one used as a ledger since 1890, from, page twenty-three to page four hundred, and do hereby grant and assign accounts and all causes of action now pending to the aforesaid James Louis Turner and Daniel Naismith trading as Turner, McKeand & Co.\nand at the foot thereof Turner subscribed the following with the name of Turner, McKeand & Co..\nWe hereby authorise Mr. Alfred Fowler, of Headingly, our agent to collect above assigned accounts and also give him the right to appoint agents so to do.\nAt the same time as this was executed Turner says that it occurred to him that he would look after the other commercial creditors of Francis; accordingly that he suggested to Francis that he should give him such a note, and he got from Francis a list of the accounts due, and Francis signed a note prepared by Turner for the above purpose. Turner says that his idea in getting this demand note for the other creditors was that the commercial creditors should come in ahead in case judgment should go against Francis at the suit of the Commercial Bank or any one else. He said that though this is not quite usual, yet commercial men do this to help each other.\nAs to the above assignment of the book debts Turner says that \u201c it was to be acted upon through Mr. Fowler in a quiet way.\u201d Mr. Fowler was to get out a detailed statement of account and appoint his own agent. Mr. Fowler he says \u201c appointed Mr. Francis for the store.\u201d\nTurner says that he gave Mr. Fowler the right to appoint any one, but that he would naturally infer that he Fowler would appoint Mr. Francis or his son.\nHe naturally inferred that Fowler would do so because he was an old friend of Francis and had formerly been in partnership with him. His, Turner\u2019s, intention was that Fowler should make out detailed statements. He thought he would appoint Mr. Francis, and he requested Mr. Fowler to get statements out as quickly as possible in detail, upon getting which it was Turner\u2019s intention, as he said, to send out a collector to go over the country. This is the material substance of Turner\u2019s account of what took place on the 13th July when he left and, as he says, did not see Francis again until the 19th, or it may be the 18th August.\nNow, with reference to the above assignment of debts, it is to be observed that it professes to proceed upon consideration proceeding from Turner and Naismith, the plaintiffs in this suit, and does not mention even the old debt to show that the assignment was made for the purpose of securing it. No trust purpose whatever is stated; it professes to be an absolute sale and assignment to Turner and Naismith for consideration paid by them. Yet it is perfectly clear that this was not the fact, and that it was executed for some trust purpose cannot be doubted. From Turner\u2019s evidence that he at the same time procured from Francis his promissory note for the amounts due to his creditors, other than the Commercial Bank, including the debt due to the old firm of Turner, McKeand & Co., the reasonable inference to be drawn is that these other creditors, equally with the old firm of Turner, McKeand & Co., were to share in the benefit of the assignment, and if they were, as no distinction is made in the assignment between the debts due to those creditors and the old debt due to Turner, McKeand & Co., they should all share alike in the benefit of the assignment. But it cannot be doubted that the assignment was executed upon some trust purpose, and as none is mentioned in the assignment we must collect by parol evidence dehors the instrument what that trust purpose was; we have seen Turner\u2019s evidence upon that subject. Now, the evidence of Francis as to what took place on the 12th and 13th July, is as follows: He says that the meeting between him and Turner on the 12th July took place in this wise; that feeling in difficulties he consulted with some of his creditors, who advised him to see Turner as one of the largest of his creditors, and talk over his affairs with him; that he accordingly went to see Turner and had a conversation with him at the Clarendon Hotel on the evening of the 12th, during which (to use Francis own language):\nTurner asked me how old my eldest son was ? I said eighteen years of age, and he said I might appoint him to collect the accounts\u2014 it does not make any difference at all\u2014only a matter of form\u2014and he said, \u201c who do you think would do ? \u201d And I said Mr. Fowler knows my affairs pretty well and has been associated with me in business\u2014\nThe conversation resulted in Francis agreeing to give to Turner a demand note to cover the debts of all the commercial creditors and an assignment of the book debts for the benefit of all the creditors including the Commercial Bank. He said that the object of the demand note was that it might be used in the event of the Commercial Bank endeavouring to garnish any of Francis\u2019 debts. He said that they went out on the 13th to Headingly to complete the above arrangement and that Francis then gave Turner a list of the commercial creditors whose accounts were to be covered by the demand note, the amount of which Turner filled in; and then in the presence of Fowler and his son who were in the store with him he signed the assignment in the journal which Turner himself wrote\u2014and said that he would act as trustee for all the creditors. The journal with the assignment in it was left with Francis in the store. Being asked what understanding if any he had with Turner as to what Fowler was to do he replied\u2014\nMr. Turner said, to make out a list of the book debts from the journal and get them down to Winnipeg as soon as you can in order that the commercial men may have a list if they want it; and I said: What am I to do with the list? and he said: Who was appointed to look after your affairs ? and I said Mr. Redmond and Mr. Whitla, and he said, give it to Mr. Redmond and be can do with it according to the instructions he has received at the meeting of your creditors\u2014\nand Francis added that in accordance with the instructions so given by Mr. Turner the list was made out and given to Mr. Redmond. This is the substance of what took place up to and including the 13th July.\nNow as to what took place under the assignment of debts, between the 13th July and the 19th August, Turner says that he knew nothing and made no inquiries, as to what Francis was doing about the book debts. Being asked why he went out again on the 19th August, his answer was that it was on the advice of his solicitor\u2014that they had hunted round every place they could think of (whatever that meant) and his solicitor said it was the best thing to do, to drive out. Accordingly he went out to Headingly and took with him his solicitor and an employee named McLean. When they got to Francis\u2019 store they found Francis and Fowler there, and Turner demanded of Francis the book containing the assignment of the debts, and Francis at once peremptorily refused to give it up alleging as his reason that they had been assigned for the benefit of his creditors, whereas Turner was claiming it, and demanded it to be given up for his own benefit. Francis said that he had taken legal advice upon the subject and would not give up the book; in this Fowler supported Francis. The latter thereupon left his store saying that he was going to his house and would be back in three hours when, as Mr. Turners solicitor understood, he would turn them out, if they should be there I suppose he meant. Then, and for the first time, appears to have been entertained the idea of trying to overcome Francis\u2019 persistent refusal to give up to Turner the book containing the assignment of debts, by invoking in aid the instrument of the 10th September, 1891, upon the ground or pretense that Francis had within the meaning of that instrument become incapacitated to attend to his business, for then and there the following notice was written out and signed by Mr. Turner and given to McLean to serve, who followed Francis to his house and served it on him there:\nIt is the opinion of this firm that you are incapacitated from properly attending to business within the meaning of the agreement between you and this firm, dated the 10th September, 1891, and we intend forthwith to take possession pursuant to the provisions of said agreement.\nAnd take notice that our said firm now consists of James Louis Turner and Daniel Naismith jr.\nAnd we hereby demand from you immediate payment of the sum of $4,600, more or less, due and payable to us under the said agreement.\nDated Headingly, Man., August 19,1893.\nTURNER, McKEAND & CO.\nTo F. H. FRANCIS, Esq., Headingly, Man.\nTurner says, that this notice was then written out at Headingly, and being asked if he had had any idea of having it written out before he went out on that day, he replied that he had brought out the agreement of September 1st, 1891, with him intending to act under it \u201c if there was any of this want of business going on,\u201d by which he said he meant: \u201c If the business was not going on in a proper way,\u201d which he further explained by saying:\nI mean to say that business was not run in a proper way if a party makes a big lot of book debts and do not return them and packs away the books and hides them.\nThen the evidence of Mr. Turner\u2019s solicitor as to what took place on the 19th August after service of the notice on Francis, is very significant and is substantially as follows:\nFrancis came down to the store about half an hour after the notice was served. He did not say very much, except that he seemed to be indignant and said he was going away and would be back in three hours; and as I understood him, he was going to throw us out then. He then went down to his house.\nMr. Turner and his solicitor then went to their dinner at the hotel, and while they were at dinner Francis came and sat down and had a conversation with Turner, during which Turner said\u2014\nthat he felt himself forced to take this step from the position Mr. Francis had taken about the book debts, and that he had brought a man to collect them; that his principal object was to assist Mr. Francis and that he still hoped there was some way of Mr. Francis getting out of his difficulties.\nThey then left the table and walked for miles on the prairie, during which time Turner and Francis were, as he says \u201c discussing the matter in the most friendly way.\u201d Francis said that he was afraid\nthat now, after all these years, the course Turner had taken was going to ruin him.\nTo which Turner replied,\nthat he had no wish to ruin him, but to assist him; that if a man were put in to collect these he thought there might be enough to pay off Turner, McKeand & Co. and leave a surplus for the other creditors, and that he thought if that were done Francis\u2019 credit would be improved and that he could get out of his difficulties ultimately.\nThe solicitor then says:\nIt was suggested (he does not say by whom) that it might be hard to control the Commercial Bank; now that it was in liquidation they might proceed to extremities, but Mr. Turner urged and I urged, that it would be much better to carry out the course we intended, which course was, in the first place, to collect the book debts.\nAfter a lot of discussion they got to the store, without arriving at anything definite. Then the solicitor says:\nI left Mr. Turner and Mr. Francis in conversation and walked out a little distance, when Mr. Turner came over to where I was, and in consequence of what he said I went back to Mr. Francis and said to him: Mr. Turner says that you would like for us to go out of possession until you can have an opportunity of seeing your creditors.\nAnd the solicitor proposed to him that McLean should remain in possession \u201c until such times as might be necessary\u201d; to this Francis objected, it is unnecessary to state, the reason alleged. The solicitor then suggested that Francis should take substitution from McLean and so that McLean and Francis should hold joint possession of the stock in trade both for himself (Francis) and for Turner McKeand & Co. The solicitor says:\nI told Mr. Turner in Mr. Francis\u2019 presence that I thought there might be some risk in giving up possession and leaving it in Mr. Francis\u2019 own possession, but Mr. Francis said no there would be none, that he would undertake that we would be in the same position as we were then on the following Thursday, that no change would be made in connection with the stock; and the book debts were particularly mentioned. Mr. Turner seemed satisfied with this.\nNow the plain meaning of all this is that Francis agreed that upon Turner giving up what he called his rightful possession of Francis\u2019 premises and property, and which Francis insisted was wrongful, and giving Francis until Thursday the 24th to consult his creditors upon the matter, both parties should upon Thursday at 6 o\u2019clock be in the same position in which they then were, which was nothing more than this that Turner should be in the position of claiming to be entitled to the book debts for his own use independently of the instrument of September 1891, and to be in possesssion of the whole of Francis\u2019 property under that instrument subject to the trusts thereof, all which Francis absolutely denied, repudiated and resisted, and that in the meantime Francis should consult his creditors, in whose hands he then was and by whose advice he would naturally act in the premises.\nThe mode adopted for carrying out this arrangement was that Mr. Turner\u2019s solicitor drew out on the back of Turner\u2019s appointment of McLean as his agent the appointment by McLean of Francis as his substitute which the solicitor procured Francis, who was without a solicitor present to advise him, to sign as accepted by him. But notwithstanding such acceptance the fact remains that it was merely assented to for the purpose of securing the result agreed upon, namely, that upon Thursday the 24th August both parties, unless Francis should submit to Turner\u2019s demands or to some part thereof, should be in the same position as they then upon the 19th of August were, viz., Turner insisting that he was, as above, entitled to the book debts irrespective of the agreement of September, 1891, and also that he was in legal possession of Francis\u2019 property under the agreement of 1891, subject to the trusts thereof, and Francis denying that Turner had any such right, title or possession and asserting that on the contrary Turner was a trespasser upon Francis\u2019 premises and property.\nThe evidence of Francis as to what took place between the 13th July and the 19th August, and upon the latter day, is that he delivered to Mr. Redmond, as it had been agreed with Turner that he should, a list of his liabilities and that shortly afterwards he received a parcel of postal cards of which the following is a sample:\nWINNIPEG, MAN., 13th July, 1893.\nDEAR SIR,\u2014We beg to notify you that \u041c\u0433. F. H. Francis of Headingly, has assigned his account against you amounting to $ to us and that you are requested to make payment either to Mr. Alfred Fowler of Headingly, our agent, or his agent, at Mr. Francis\u2019 store at once.\nTURNER, McKEAND & CO.\nUpon receipt of these cards he took them into Winnipeg to consult with Mr. Redmond and Mr. Whitla, two of his creditors, who at a meeting of his creditors held prior to the 13th July were appointed a committee to interview the liquidator of the Commercial Bank and under whose advice he was acting. He was advised by his creditors not to distribute the post card circulars, for that if he did Turner might thereby obtain an advantage. Accordingly acting upon the advice of his creditors he did not distribute the post cards and he told Turner that he had not sent them out and did not intend to do so. This took place about three weeks after the 13th July.\nThen he says that about a week before the 19th of August there was a meeting of his creditors at Mr. Whitla\u2019s office at which Mr. Turner was present; at that meeting Mr. Turner addressing the other creditors said:\nPerhaps gentlemen you don\u2019t know that I hold an assignment of Mr. Francis\u2019 book debts here in my pocket, and it is for Turner & McKeand.\nThereupon Mr. Bethune, a creditor, got up and said:\nWell, that is not what you told me about that Mr. Turner; you told, me that it was for the benefit of all the creditors.\nMr. Bethune, who has been examined as a witness in the case, swore that Mr. Turner did inform him that he had got an assignment from Mr. Francis, and that he held it for the benefit of his, Francis\u2019, creditors; and he added that Turner said that his main object in taking the assignment was to protect the debts from garnishing proceedings, if such should be taken by the Commercial Bank.\nMr. Redmond was also sworn as a witness in the cause, and he stated that Mr. Turner informed him that he had taken the assignment of the book debts, but that he had taken it in trust for all the creditors out-side of the Commercial Bank.\nThat he did so take it is in truth quite consistent with the form of the assignment, as already shown, which did not state for what trust purpose it was made; although written by Turner himself it did not state that it was taken for his benefit or for that of Turner, McKeand & Co. The purpose for which it was taken was left open to be established by evidence, and Turner\u2019s own admission of the purpose for which it was made by Francis, and accepted by him; should be in itself conclusive against him, apart from the evidence of Francis.\nThen Francis says that he saw Turner, in Winnipeg, on the afternoon of the 18th August, and that then, for the first time, Turner asked him for the book (by which I understand him to mean the book containing the assignment) \u201c for the firm of Turner, McKeand & Co.,\u201d and he said he was going to send a man out to collect, whereupon Francis asked him what he was going to do with the proceeds, to which he replied:\nI am going to collect them for Turner, McKeand & Co.\nTo which Francis answered:\nIf you send a man out in that way, you will force me to do a thing that all will regret.\nBy this, of course, he meant that he would make an assignment. To this Mr. Turner said:\nDon\u2019t do anything to-night and I will come out on Saturday afternoon (the next day) and we will talk over affairs and come to a satisfactory arrangement all round.\nAnd I, he says:\nthen agreed that I would not make an assignment until after he had a conversation with me on the 19th.\nIn the morning when he went to his store he found Mr. Turner and his solicitor there, they having come out the night before. Then Turner made a demand for the book and Francis refused to give it, and shortly afterwards the notice was served as already stated in the other evidence.\nThe evidence of the solicitor already given is abundantly sufficient in itself to show that in the arrangement made by him with Francis it was never intended or supposed, that by signing as \u201c accepted\u201d the paper signed by McKeand, Francis should be deemed to be departing in the slightest degree from the attitude of determined resistance to the action of Turner in his attempt to take possession of his premises and property; but it may be well in closing the evidence to give Francis\u2019 evidence upon this point as showing his understanding of the matter, and of the position in which he felt himself to be, unassisted as he was by any legal advice. Being asked why he did mark that paper as \u201c accepted,\u201d he replied, that he did it to get them out of the store, that he was there perfectly helpless. That he told them he would eject them from the store, and that Mr. Darby, Turner\u2019s solicitor, said to him: \u201cif you dare do that you will do so at your own risk, now I warn you.\u201d That it was Saturday afternoon, he added, and he had no chance of coming into Winnipeg to consult any one, because the lawyers would be away on Saturday afternoon, and he knew the other creditors\u2019 stores would be closed and he made up his mind that he would go and see the other creditors and his solicitor in connection with the seizure, and he said further, that he had a talk with Mr. Turner after the service of the notice upon him, and that he said to him that if he would give Francis his guarantee that he would act for the benefit of the creditors, he might take the book and the stock and his house and everything he owned, that he did not wish to keep anything for himself, that he was in the hands of his creditors and dared not give him, Turner, any preference if he wanted to. He wanted an opportunity to come down to Winnipeg to see his other creditors and a lawyer, and so he signed saying: \u201c It does not prejudice me or prejudice you, we will all be in the same position if nothing is done in the meantime, because I will not dispose of the stock.\u201d So things remained in statu quo; he went into Winnipeg consulted the other creditors and his lawyer; and when Turner came on the 24th and demanded the books and said also that he had come under the agreement of September 1891, he told Turner that he had no books to give him, and when closing his store at 6 o\u2019clock in the evening he turned him out of the store and retained undisputed possession of his property until the 28th August when he made the assignment to Bertrand for the benefit of his creditors.\nNow from all this evidence it is apparent that up to the last moment Turner was dealing with Francis as a person perfectly capable of attending to his business; and indeed it is impossible to avoid drawing from the evidence as given by Turner himself, the inference that it was because of Francis\u2019 capacity to attend to his business, and his persistent refusal to place Turner in a position which would enable him to claim the right of applying to his own benefit the assignment of the debts which Francis had made to Turner, McKeand & Co. upon the express agreement, as he insists, and as Turner himself admitted to Mr. Bethune and Mr. Redmond, that they would hold the assignment of the debts in trust for the benefit of his Francis\u2019 creditors, that induced Mr. Turner to have the notice served upon the 19th August, and not any bon\u00e2 fide belief in the assertion made therein that in the opinion of his firm Francis was incapacitated from attending to his business within the meaning of the instrument of September 1891.\nThe assignment of book debts which was made upon the 13th July 1893, was not made or asked to be made in virtue of that instrument. There, can be no doubt entertained upon the evidence that, in point of fact, that assignment was made with intent that the assignees Turner, McKeand & Co. should hold it if not for the benefit of all the creditors alike as sworn by Francis and admitted by Turner himself to one of Francis\u2019 creditors, at least for the benefit of all outside of the Commercial Bank as stated by Turner to another of such creditors. To the last moment Turner was insisting however upon getting the book containing the assignment into his possession with the declared intention of using it for the exclusive benefit of his firm, although if Francis was really, in the bon\u00e2 fide opinion of the firm, incapacitated within the meaning of the instrument of September 1801, they would have been as much entitled to the book debts as to any other property belonging to Francis under that instrument.\nThe only possible conclusion to be drawn from the evidence and from Turners own conduct in the premises throughout is that in point of fact he did not and that his firm did not upon the 19th August 1891, when the notice was served, or at any time, entertain within the meaning of the instrument of September 1891, the opinion that Francis was, within the meaning of that instrument, incapacitated from attending to his business; and that the notice was served in the hope and expectation, by the false pretence that Turner\u2019s firm did entertain the opinion therein expressed, to obtain !hereby an undue advantage over the other creditors of Francis whose persistent resistance of which attempt, in the interest of his other creditors, was perfectly justifiable and commendable.\nAssuming therefore the old firm of Turner, McKeand & Co. to be still in existence, and the powers conferred by the instrument of September 1891, to be unlimited in duration, there is nothing shown in evidence to displace the right of Bertrand to any part of the property expressed in the indenture of the 28th August 1893, to be assigned to him by Francis.\nThe appeal therefore must be allowed with costs and judgment be ordered to be entered for the defendants in the court below and for return to the defendant Bertrand of any of such property as may, if any does, remain unsold, and for payment to him of the moneys realised from the sale of such as has been sold. I have not thought it necessary to inquire whether the new firm of Turner, McKeand & Co., consisting of the plaintiff Turner and Naismith, have any interest whatever in the premises under the instrument of September 1891, although if it had been necessary I may say that I can see nothing in the evidence which shows that Martindale, one of the parties to that instrument, ever parted with, or that the new firm ever acquired, his interest in the old debt of $5,259, and yet the instrument of September 1891, provides, from a superabundant excess of caution, that the powers conferred thereby upon the old firm should not be vested in any new firm formed by substitution or addition unless such new firm shall have assumed the debt due by Francis. However, as already said, this is in my opinion, for the reasons above given, immaterial now.\nSEDGEWICK J.\u2014In concur in the judgment of Mr. Justice King.\nKING J.\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench for Manitoba in favour of the plaintiffs in an action of replevin. The case turns upon the right of plaintiffs to take possession, as security for a debt, of a stock of dry goods, etc., belonging to defendant Francis.\nIt appears that, in the year 1890, Francis became insolvent. Amongst his creditors was the firm of Turner, McKeand & Co. of Winnipeg, then composed of Turner and one Martindale, to which firm he owed, for goods sold, the sum of $5,259, upon promissory notes then overdue. An arrangement was then made, with assent of all creditors, to the effect that the creditors, other than Turner, McKeand & Co., should accept a compromise of their claims at about 50 per cent, to be secured by promissory notes of Francis, indorsed by Turner, McKeand & Co., and that the latter firm should be paid in full, but that the payment of their claim should be postponed until the 1st day of December,1892 Accordingly, Turner, McKeand & Co. gave their indorsements, amounting in the aggregate to $3,631. In consideration of all this they were to have certain security, the character of which was expressed in an agreement under seal made on the 10th day of September, 1891. By this it was, inter alia, covenanted and agreed that, in the event of Francis\u2019 death, or in case he should at any time, in the opinion of the parties, of the second part (Turner and Martindale), or either of them, from any cause become incapable of attending to his business, then, and in either of such cases, the said sum of $5,259 should become due, although the 1st of December, 1892, might not have arrived, and the amount of the indorsements should at once become payable, although the notes might not be due or might be in other hands.\nIt was also provided that in the event above referred to a notice in writing, signed by the firm name, stating that, in their opinion, Francis was so incapable, should be served upon him, or left at his usual place of abode, and that such notice so served, and the date of such service, should be and determine the date of such incapacity.\nIt was further agreed that forthwith, upon the death of Francis, or upon his becoming incapacitated from attending to his business as therein before mentioned and provided, it should be lawful for Turner, McKeand & Co., their agents, etc., or either of them, to enter into and upon, and to take full and complete possession of, all the personal property, stock in trade, book debts, real estate, credits and effects of Francis, and to keep and hold possession, and proceed with all reasonable dispatch to sell and dispose of the same, and out of the proceeds to satisfy the amounts due under the agreement, repaying to Francis any surplus, etc.\nIt was also agreed that, in case of a change in the firm of Turner, McKeand & Co., the agreement and security should enure to the benefit of the members of the firm as changed, provided that the latter firm should have assumed the liabilities of the old one as indorsers as aforesaid, and should also have taken over the indebtedness of Francis to the old firm.\nAfter the completion of this transaction, Francis continued on in his business at Headingly, a place about 12 miles from Winnipeg, and from time to time reduced the aggregate amount of Turner, McKeand & Co.\u2019s contingent liability upon the indorsed notes.\nOn the 1st December 1892, the amount due Turner, McKeand & Co. for goods sold became payable, but it was not paid, and it does not appear that they pressed for payment By September following, the sum was reduced from its original amount of $5,259 to about $4,600.\nOn 30th June, 1893, Martindale retired from, and Naismith entered, the firm which continued on under the same name. It does not appear that the new firm became indorsers of the Francis notes, although the evidence leads to the inference that it took over the indebtedness of Francis to the old firm for goods sold.\nAbout the same time a local bank with which Francis dealt, and to which he was indebted, went into liquidation, with the result that Francis was obliged to lay the state of his affairs before his creditors, when it was seen that he was in an embarrassed condition, and a couple of his creditors were appointed to advise with him. This was about the 13th July.\nBefore that time, and soon after the failure of the bank, Turner, McKeand & Co. apprehending that the bank might take proceedings for the recovery of its claim, persuaded Francis to assign the book debts to them. This was done or attempted by a memorandum entered in one of Francis\u2019 books of account. Turner, McKeand & Co. upon this, sent out to Francis printed forms of notice of assignment to be filled up and sent to the several debtors. Francis, fearing the effect of this upon his other creditors, under whose directions he was then acting, did not send out the notices, but notified his other creditors, and, on inquiry of Turner McKeand & Co., told them that he had delivered some of the notices, implying that he had delivered them to the debtors, but secretly having reference to the delivery to his creditors.\nOn 19th August Turner, accompanied by his solicitor and a clerk named McLean, went out to Headingly and demanded the book containing the assignment of the book debts. Francis refused, and then Turner caused the following notice to be served:\nIt is the opinion of this firm that you are incapacitated from properly attending to business within the meaning of the agreement made between you and this firm, dated the 10th September, 1891, and we intend forthwith to take possession pursuant to the provisions of said agreement. And take notice, that our said firm now consists of James Louis Turner and Daniel Naismith, jr., and we hereby demand from, you immediate payment of the sum of $4,600 more or less clue and payable to us under the said agreement.\nDated Headingly, Man., Aug. 19, 1893.\n(Sgd.) TURNER, McKEAND & CO.\nTo F. H. FRANCIS, Esq.,\nHeadingly, Man.\nTurner forthwith took possession of the premises, and of the stock of goods, etc., and placed McLean in charge. Francis protested, but apparently did not raise the question of his alleged incapacity, and afterwards, upon the same day, with the assent of Turner, accepted possession from McLean under an appointment in writing (accepted in writing by Francis), by which Francis was to act as a substitute of McLean under Turner, McKeand & Co., and to hold jointly with McLean until the 24th August, up to the hour of 6 p.m.\nTurner and his party, including McLean, then returned to Winnipeg, and on the 24th August went back again to Headingly to resume personal possession. Francis, however, disputed his right, and with aid of superior force ejected Turner. Two days afterwards he made an assignment to Bertrand, the official assignee, in trust for the benefit of all his creditors. Bertrand went into possession and so remained until 22nd September, when the proceedings in replevin were begun, and in a few days afterwards an agreement was come to, under which Bertrand sold the property for benefit of whom it might concern.\nUpon trial of the action before Taylor C.J. judgment was given against Francis, but in favour of Bertrand. On appeal plaintiffs were held entitled to recover against both.\nThe contention on the part of Bertrand was that there was no evidence of a joint conversion. On this point the reasons of the learned judges in appeal satisfactorily show that, if there was a conversion at all, Bertrand is jointly liable with Francis.\nUpon the main point, viz., as to plaintiffs\u2019 right to the goods, the chief contention of appellants is that the event had not arisen warranting the plaintiffs to take possession, because that, as contended, the alleged opinion as to Francis\u2019 incapacity to attend to his business was not a real, but merely a pretended opinion; and further, that the notice was not such as the agreement provided for, inasmuch as it purported to be the opinion of Turner and Naismith, while the latter had in the circumstances no power to act in the matter.\nIt was argued that the language used in the agreement in authorizing the taking possession, required that there should be incapacity in point of fact, but the words of reference \u201c as hereinbefore mentioned and provided,\u201d bring down and incorporate the qualification that the incapacity is to be determined by the opinion of Turner, McKeand & Co. Of course this means an honest opinion, one that is real and not pretended. But if honest it governs, even although mistaken in point of law or fact, illogical or inconclusive. The essential thing is that there shall be an honest determination of the thing to be determined. And the right to judge extends to everything that enters into the formation of the honest judgment. In language quoted by Mr. Justice Killam from Allcroft v. Bishop of London ([5]), Lord Bram well says:\nIf a man is to form an opinion, and his opinion is to govern, he must form it himself on such reasons and grounds as seem good to him.\nIn a fair sense a man may be said to be incapable of attending to his business when he is not able to give to it the attention that it reasonably requires. This may arise from a number of causes differing in kind, e.g., from illness affecting mind or body, from state of health not amounting to illness, from physical restraint or absence, from intemperate habits, from undue attention, to outside matters taking the mind unduly from the particular business, or from any cause operating upon the individual materially impairing his efficiency as a business man. The agreement extends to incapacity however caused, and therefore covers different degrees of incapacity, for the nature and degree of incapacity varies with the cause. The plaintiffs had assumed large obligations for Francis, and while they seemed content with his personal responsibility, so long as he appeared to them able to apply himself efficiently to his business, they sought to protect themselves from loss in case, at any time, he should, in their opinion, from whatever cause become inefficient or incapable. But, however caused, the incapacity must be such as to materially affect efficiency and injure the business, or be calculated to do so.\nThen, did plaintiffs come to an honest and real opinion as expressed in their notice of August 19th ? The learned Chief Justice has found that they did, and the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench has unanimously agreed that the finding ought not to be disturbed.\nThere would not appear to be much doubt that Turner was moved to give the notice because of his failure to get the books from Francis. This is the conclusion upon the whole evidence, and is also established by the evidence of his solicitor, Mr. Darby, who says that, in the conversation that took place with Francis after the seizure, Mr. Turner said that he had felt himself forced to take this step from the position that Mr. Francis had taken about the book debts; that he expected to get the book debts and that he had brought a man up to collect them. But strictly this merely means that he would not have resorted to extreme rights of seizure, etc., if he had received certain security.\nThe learned counsel for defendants properly pressed Turner closely for the grounds of his opinion that Francis was incapable. And indeed it was to have been expected that one who was authorized to form an opinion and did claim to have formed it, and who certainly acted as having done so, should have been able to give some reasonable ground for his alleged opinion, if it was a real opinion.\nDisengaged from irrelevant matter, what he says is about as follows, and in his own language\nI think he is incapacitated from properly attending to his business and was so for some time. * * * His business ways lately to me were not satisfactory in many ways. * * * Both in the way he was worrying himself in not getting enough of goods, and his neglect of business matters. * * * Not only in the way of not paying notes, but in not collecting properly from his customers, and from the talk of others I judged that I had better look after myself. * * * He wasted too much time coming into Winnipeg. * * * I thought it was to buy a small jag of goods.\nThe following questions and answers are then put and given:\nQ. These are the only objections you had to him ? A. I haven\u2019t got any more to say about it.\nQ. So that it was as much his financial incapacity that you objected to as anything else ? A. No, it was the way the man is worn down by worry. He is generally unfit for business.\nIf Turner is to be believed in this, and if he, rightly or wrongly, honestly thought that Francis was worn down by worry, and generally unfit for business, of which his (in Turner\u2019s opinion) loose business methods, waste of time over small matters, financial embarrassment, and the placing of himself in the hands of his creditors and accepting their direction, may be thought to be signs, it cannot be said that Turner had so little ground for his conclusion that Francis\u2019 efficiency as a business man had become materially impaired, that we cannot suppose him to have been honest in the conclusion he professes to have reached.\nThe following passage from the judgment of Mr. Justice Killam appears to put the case very concisely:\nBad judgment or improper management would not constitute incapacity, but to a business man having the opportunity of observing the party they might not unreasonably, according to circumstances, indicate that the party was incapable, to a serious extent, of attending to the business. Mental worry, due to business troubles or to other causes, might easily affect a business man so as to make his attention to business fitful and partial, so as to prevent his bringing to bear upon his business his full mental and physical powers.\nNext, as to the notice; the agreement authorized either of the original members of the firm to form the opinion and give the notice. Turner clearly formed the opinion, (if one was formed at all), and the notice manifestly purports to express and convey it to Francis. There could have been no question in Francis\u2019 mind at the time, that Turner was an active promoter of what was being done.\nFor these reasons, which are substantially those given below, the conclusion of the Chief Justice at the trial ought not to be set aside, except as varied by the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench, and this appeal should be dismissed.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellants: W.

He afterwards started to finish his work and in doing so he ran over and injured a child.\nHeld, affirming the decision of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick, that from the moment he had started to complete the business in which he had been engaged he was in his master\u2019s employ just as if he had returned to the master\u2019s store and made a fresh start.\nThe doctrine of contributory negligence does not apply to an infant of tender age. Gardner v. Grace (1 f. & f. 359) followed.\nIf in a case tried without a jury evidence has been improperly admitted a court of appeal may reject it and maintain the verdict if the remaining evidence warrants it.\nAppeal from a decision of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick[1] sustaining a verdict for the plaintiff and refusing a new trial.\nThe defendant Merritt is a grocer in St. John N.B., and his teamster, Gorman, having been sent out one day with parcels of goods for delivery to customers, delivered all but one and then went home to his supper; after supper he started out to finish his work and on the way ran over the infant child of the plaintiff who brought an action against Merritt for compensation. On the trial of the action it was shown that the child ran out from the sidewalk to the middle of the street when the waggon was approaching and evidence was admitted of the nurse who attended the child after he was hurt to the effect that since the accident he was affected with urinary trouble. The trial judge, who tried the case without a jury, found that the action of the child in running out upon the street contributed to the accident, but that it could have been avoided by the exercise of reasonable care on Gorman\u2019s part, and he gave a verdict for the plaintiff. A judgment for defendant or a new trial was moved for on the grounds that Gorman, having abandoned defendant\u2019s business when he went to his supper, could only resume it by returning to the place where he had delivered the last parcel and that he had not, in fact, resumed it when the accident happened; that the negligence of the child caused the accident; and that the evidence of the nurse should not have been admitted, as she was not called as an expert and was contradicted by the physician who attended the child. The verdict having been sustained defendant appealed to this court.\nC. A. Stockton for the appellant. Gorman was not in defendant\u2019s employ when the accident occurred. Rayner v. Mitchell[2]; Mitchell v. Crassweller[3]; Storey v. Ashton[4].\nThere was contradictory evidence as to the speed at which Gorman was driving, and the whole being consistent with the absence as well as with the existence of negligence a non-suit should have been granted. Cotton v. Wood[5].\nArmstrong Q.C. for the respondent was not called upon.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by: THE CHIEF JUSTICE (Oral):\u2014We are all of opinion that this appeal should be dismissed. Negligence by the servant of the appellant is clearly proved, in fact there could not be a stronger case, and the defence as to contributory negligence entirely fails, not only on the authority of Davies v. Mann[6], but also on the opinions expressed in Gardner v. Grace[7], where the cause of action was an injury to a child of three years of age. In that case Channell B. said:\nThe doctrine of contributory negligence does not apply to an infant of tender age. To disentitle the plaintiff to recover, it must be shown that the injury was occasioned entirely by his own negligence.\nThis seems to be the result of the cases, English as well as American, though there may be some contradictory decisions.\nA new trial is asked for on the ground of the improper admission of the evidence of the nurse who attended the plaintiff\u2019s child, that in her opinion a urinary trouble with which the child was affected resulted from the accident. I cannot find in the record that any such opinion was expressed by the nurse, but if it was, we could reject her evidence altogether and still maintain the verdict.\nThe case was tried by a judge without a jury, and the position of a Court of Appeal in such a case, as distinguished from a case tried with a jury, is clearly pointed out by Bramwell B. in the case of Jones v. Hough[8], in these words:\nA great difference exists between a finding by a judge and a finding by the jury. Where the jury find the facts the court cannot be substituted for them, because the parties have agreed that the facts shall be decided by a jury; but where the judge finds the facts there the Court of Appeal has the same jurisdiction that he has, and can find the facts whichever way they like. Another point argued was that Gorman was not in the employ of the defendant when the accident happened. That he was in such employ at the time there can, in our opinion, be no doubt. Whatman v. Pearson[9] was a stronger case than the one before us, and I do not think the learned counsel has been successful in his attempt to distinguish it from the present. Though Gorman had for a time abandoned his master\u2019s business, he had resumed it when he started out to deliver the remaining parcel just as much as if he had returned to the store and made a fresh start.\nAs to damages Mr. Justice Hanington, in giving judgment in the court below on the motion for a new trial, says:\nThis case comes clearly within the doctrine laid down in Whatman v. Pearson(1). If there is any cause for complaint it is that the damages are too small.\nIn this I entirely concur.\nI think the learned judge who tried the case was right in his findings as to the facts, as well as in his ruling as to the law.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: C.

(1887) c. 167\u2014Waiver\u2014Estoppel.\nB. applied to a mutual company for insurance on his property for four years giving an undertaking to pay the amounts required from time to time and a four months note for the first premium. He received a receipt beginning as follows: \u201cReceived from B. an undertaking for the sum of $46.50 being the premium for an insurance to the extent of $1,500 on the property described in his application of this date,\u201d and then providing that the company could cancel the contract at any time within fifty days by notice mailed to the applicant and that non-receipt of a policy within the fifty days, with or without notice, should be absolute evidence of rejection of the application. No notice of rejection was sent to B. and no policy was issued within the said time which expired on March 4th, 1891. On April 17 B. received a letter from the manager asking him to remit funds to pay his note maturing on May 1st. He did so and his letter of remittance crossed another from the manager, mailed at Owen Sound April 20th, stating the rejection of his application and returning the undertaking and note. On April 24th the insured property was destroyed by fire. B. notified the manager by telegraph and on April 29th the latter wrote returning the money remitted by B. who afterwards sent it again to the manager and it was again returned. B. then brought an action which was dismissed at the hearing and a new trial ordered by the Division Court and affirmed by the Court of Appeal.\nHeld, affirming the decision of the Court of Appeal, Gwynne J. dissenting, that there was a valid contract by the company with B. for insurance for four years; that the statutory conditions in the Ontario Insurance Act (R.S.O. [1887] c. 167) governed such contract though not in the form of a policy; that if the provision as to non-receipt of a policy within fifty days was a variation of the statutory conditions it was ineffectual for non-compliance with condition 115 requiring variations to be written in a different coloured ink from the rest of the document and if it had been so printed the condition was unreasonable; and that such provision, though the non-receipt of the policy might operate as a notice, was inconsistent with condition 19 which provides that notice shall not operate until seven days after its receipt.\nHeld, also, that there was some evidence for the jury that the company, by demanding and receiving payment of the note, had waived the right to cancel the contract and were estopped from denying that B. was insured.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] affirming the judgment of the Divisional Court[2], by which the verdict for the defendants was set aside and a new trial ordered.\nThe action in this case was brought by one Barnes on an alleged contract by the defendant company to insure his property for $1,500. Barnes applied to the company for insurance to this amount for four years, and gave an undertaking to make the payments that should be required from time to time and a note for the first premium. He received a receipt from the company for such undertaking, describing the amount mentioned therein as the premium for insurance on the property described in his application, and providing that the company could cancel the contract within fifty days by written notice mailed to Barnes, and that non-receipt of a policy within such time was to be taken, with or without notice, as absolute evidence of the application. Barnes received no notice of rejection and no policy within the fifty days, but after the time had expired payment of his note was demanded and the amount sent, his letter of remittance crossing one from the manager notifying him that his application was not accepted and enclosing his undertaking and note. Two days after this letter was received the insured property was destroyed by fire, of which Barnes notified the company, and shortly after received back the money he had remitted, which he sent to the company again and was again returned to him. He then brought his action for the insurance.\nThe documents above referred to and the correspondence between the parties are all set out in the judgment of the Chief Justice on this appeal.\nBarnes died while the action was pending and it was revived in favour of his executrix, Frances J. Garroway, who is the present respondent Francis J. Bradt. The trial judge held that the contract of insurance was at an end when no policy was received by Barnes at the expiration of the fifty days. His judgment was reversed and a new trial ordered by the Divisional Court, confirmed by the Court of Appeal.\nAylesworth Q.C. for the appellant. If there was any contract at all between the company and Barnes, it was one for only fifty days certain, to be enlarged in the discretion of the board of directors. See Billington v. The Provincial Ins. Co.[3]\nThe demand for payment of the note was no waiver of the condition for terminating the contract. McGeachie v. The North American Life Ins. Co.[4]; Frank v. The Sun Life Association[5].\nCameron for the respondent, referred to Hawke v. The Niagara Mutual Ins. Co.[6]; Smith v. Mutual, Ins. Co.[7]\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE:\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, affirming an order for a new trial of the action granted by the Queen\u2019s Bench Divisional Court.\nThe original action was instituted by Benjamin Barnes against the appellant to recover on an alleged contract of insurance against fire, and upon the death of Barnes was revived by the respondent as the executrix of his will. The property had originally been insured by the appellants under a policy which expired on the 15th January, 1891. On the 13th of January, 1891, Barnes applied to the appellants, through their local agent at Parkhill, in the neighbourhood of which the insured property was situated, for a renewal of his policy for a further term of four years, and he thereupon signed and delivered to the agent three documents, viz: an application for the insurance, being a printed form filled in, a document described as an undertaking, and a promissory note for the premium. The application was headed as follows:\nApplication of B. Barnes of the Township of West Williams to the Dominion Grange, Mutual Fire Insurance Association, for insurance against loss or damage by fire or lightning to the amount of $1,500 for four years from the 13th January, 1891, on the following property:\nThen followed a description of the property and certain questions to be answered by the agent and his answers thereto. The paper called \u201cThe Undertaking\u201d was as follows:\nUndertaking.\n$46.50. January 13, 1891.\nPolicy No. 19960.\nI, B. Barnes, being desirous of becoming a member of the Dominion Grange Mutual Fire Insurance Association for four years from the date hereof, agree to hold myself liable to pay to the said Association, at such times and in such manner as the Directors thereof may determine, such amounts as may be required from time to time, not to exceed in any case forty-six dollars and fifty cents.\n(Signed)B. BARNES\nAnd in the margin was the following \u201cReceived on this undertaking by note $15.25.\u201d The promissory note for the premium was as follows:\nJanuary 13, 1891, No. 19960.\nOn the first day of May next I promise to pay to the Dominion Grange Mutual Fire Insurance Association fifteen 25\/100 dollars at the head office of the company, Owen Sound, value received, being for premium on the application for insurance to the amount of $1,500 this day made. And in case this note is not paid at maturity the policy to be issued to me will become void, although the holder of the note may proceed to collect the same.\n(Signed)B. BARNES.\nAnd on the margin of the note was the following:\nPremium..............................................................\n$ 13 95\nPolicy fees...........................................................\n1 30\n$ 15 25\nIn exchange for these documents the agent gave Barnes a receipt as follows:\nProvisional receipt No. 16. January 13, 1891.\nReceived from B. Barnes, post office, Parkhill, an undertaking for the sum of $46.50, being the premium for an insurance to the extent of fifteen hundred dollars, on the property described in his application of this date numbered 16. Subject however to the approval of the Board of Directors who shall have power to cancel this contract at any time within fifty days from this date, by causing a notice to that effect to be mailed to the applicant at the above post office. And it is hereby mutually agreed, that unless this receipt be followed by a policy within the said fifty days from this date the contract of insurance shall wholly cease and determine, and all liability on the part of the Association shall be at an end.\nThe non-receipt by the applicant of a policy within the time specified is to be taken, with or without notice, as absolute and incontrovertible evidence of the rejection of this contract of insurance by the said board of directors. In either event the premium will be returned on application to the local agent issuing this receipt, less the proportion chargeable for the time during which the said property was insured.\nAnd in the margin of this receipt were written the following words: \u201cPaid per note on above $14.25; agent\u2019s fee $1. January 13, 1891.\nOn the 4th of March, 1891, the term of fifty days from the date of the receipt expired. No policy was sent to Barnes, nor was any communication whatever made to him up to the 17th of April, 1891, when the manager of the appellants\u2019 association sent him by mail a postal card, in these words:\nThe Dominion Grange Mutual Fire Insurance Association.\nTo B. Barnes, Parkhill, P.O.\nOWEN SOUND, April 17th, 1891.\nDEAR SIR,\u2014Your note given for policy No. 19960, amounting to $15.25, falls due on the first day of May next. Please remit promptly, returning this card with cash or post office order.\nYours fraternally.\nR.J. DOYLE, Manager.\nOn the 20th of April Barnes mailed at Parkhill a registered letter, addressed to the appellants\u2019 manager at Owen Sound, containing $15.25, the amount of the premium note, which fell due on the first of May, 1891, for the payment of which they had asked by their postal card of the 17th. This letter reached the appellants on the 23rd of April, 1891, and the money enclosed was entered in their cash book as having been received from Barnes.\nA letter dated 18th of April, 1891, but bearing the Owen Sound postmark of the 20th April, 1891, was written by appellant\u2019s manager to Barnes:\nWe return herewith undertaking No. 19960 and your short date note. The board have decided not to receive application. Thanking you for the offer of the risk.\nThis letter must, of course, have crossed Barnes\u2019 letter containing the remittance of the money to pay the note.\nOn the 24th of April the insured property was destroyed by fire, and on the 27th of April, 1891, Barnes by telegraph notified the manager of the appellants of the loss.\nOn the 29th of April, 1891, the appellants\u2019 manager wrote and posted the following letter to Barnes:\nWe received your application for insurance dated the 13th of January last, on the 21st of January, and we wrote on the 3rd of February to our agent, Mr. McLeish, on the subject. The deposit should have been $18, instead of $13.95, and the undertaking should have been $60 instead of $46.50. On the 18th of April this application came before the board and was declined; We mailed you your undertaking and short date note on the 18th inst. We received your money here on the 23rd inst., and we now return it herewith, viz., $15.25, as we cannot enter it in our book.\nOn the 9th of May, 1891, Barnes returned the money to the appellants in a letter in which he says:\nI return you your insurance money, $15.25, which you dunned me for.\nAnd on the 13th of May, Doyle, the respondent\u2019s manager, again sent back the money and wrote Barnes as follows:\nWe received to-day $15.25 from you for note which was returned to you on the 18th of April last. We have no note against you for this amount. We have no insurance in this company in your favour in force since the expiry of your provisional receipt on the 3rd of March last. Your application for insurance was declined by the Board, of which you were duly notified. There was no use in your sending this money here, as we have no claim against you.\nOn the application which was produced from appellants\u2019 custody there appeared this memorandum:\n4-2-91. Unless agent give satisfactory explanation respecting question 28.\n(Signed)A.E.\n(Signed)G.F.\nDeclined 18-4-91. Cancelled and notes returned 18-4-91.\nThis action was commenced on the 29th of June, 1891. The original plaintiff died in October, 1891, leaving a will by which he appointed the respondent his executrix. Probate having been granted to the respondent the action was revived by her.\nSeveral defences were set up. First, it was insisted that on the proper construction of the application, interim receipt, premium note and undertaking, there was no subsisting contract at the time of the loss, but that the same had lapsed by reason of non-delivery of a policy within the fifty days. It was also pleaded that there was fraudulent misrepresentation in the application; that there was fraud in making the claim for loss; and a release which was obtained from the respondent pendente lite was set up at the trial. This release was impeached by the respondent as having been obtained by fraud, intimidation and undue influence.\nThe action came on for trial before Mr. Justice Falconbridge and a jury. The burthen of proving the loss and the facts impeaching the release was upon the respondent, and it also lay upon her to establish that there was an existing contract at the date of the loss. At the conclusion of the plaintiff\u2019s case the learned judge, considering that, according to the proper construction of the written contract, the agreement for insurance had lapsed at the end of the fifty days, and also considering that there was no evidence of waiver or estoppel, withdrew the case from the jury and entered judgment for the defendants (the present appellants.)\nAs regards the issue as to the release, there can be no doubt but that evidence impeaching it sufficient to establish a prim\u00e2 facie case was given by the respondent.\nA motion for a new trial having been made before the Divisional Court of Queen\u2019s Bench, two questions arose, viz. First, a pure question of law, involving the legal construction of the provisional contract of insurance and the applicability to it of the Ontario Insurance Act R.S.O. ch. 167, and the further question, whether, if there had been a lapse of the insurance according to the contract by the non-delivery of a policy within the fifty days, the condition providing for such lapse had not, by reason of the conduct of the appellants in relation to the demand for payment and the receipt of the money, been waived by them, and whether they were not estopped from setting up the condition. The first question is purely one of law, the determination of the second depends upon the sufficiency of the evidence to establish a prim\u00e2 facie case of waiver or estoppel.\nThe learned judges who constituted the Divisional Court (the Chief Justice and Mr. Justice Street) were of opinion that there was one provisional contract of insurance, not merely for the fifty days, but for four years, subject to determination by the Association by notice within the fifty days, or by non-delivery of a policy within that term; that to this contract the provisions of the Ontario Insurance Act were applicable; that the conditions of the interim receipt were at variance with the standing conditions as to determination of contracts of insurance by notice; that the conditions of the statute applicable to variations of the standing conditions not having been complied with these standing conditions governed the contract, and therefore, notice not having been given to the insured in compliance with the 19th standing condition (section 147 of the statute), the provisional contract of insurance created by the interim receipt had not been determined at the time of the loss. The court, therefore, ordered a new trial, and directed that the appellants should pay the costs.\nOn appeal to the Court of Appeal that court was equally divided. The learned Chief Justice of Ontario was of opinion that the appeal should be dismissed for the reasons relied upon by the Divisional Court, and also, apart from the statute, for the additional reason that there had been a waiver of the condition as to the effect of non-delivery of a policy within fifty days. Mr. Justice Maclennan concurred in this conclusion, for the reason that the statutory condition as to notice had not been complied with. Mr. Justice Burton and Mr. Justice Osler agreed with the trial judge. These learned judges considered that there had been a completed contract of insurance only as to the fifty days, and that as to the residue of the four years term no contract was created by the interim receipt; that there was as to that at most a mere proposal for insurance, requiring for the constitution of a contract the assent of the appellants, which was never given.\nI am unable to agree with the learned judges of the Court of Appeal who treated the contract embodied in the interim receipt as one limited to the fifty days. The application is for an insurance for four years; it is so specifically stated in the introductory paragraph of that document. The words are:\nApplication of B. Barnes * * * for insurance against loss or damage by fire or lightning * * * for four years from the 13th of January, 1891, on the following property:\nThis is the only contract Barnes is shown to have ever proposed or assented to. The receipt must be considered as an acceptance of this proposal. In terms it is so. What other meaning can be attributed to the initial clause:\nReceived from B. Barnes an undertaking for the sum of $46.50, being the premium for an insurance to the extent of $1,500 on the property described in his application of this date, numbered 16.\nWhat is this but an acceptance of the proposal embodied in the application? Then the premium secured by the note is the entire instalment of the premium then due for the whole four years, not a part of it proportioned to the term of fifty days. The receipt also speaks of the contract as an entire contract, that is, a contract according to the terms of the application. The appellants recognize that some contract was created by the receipt; then that contract could only have been an agreement in the terms of the application, for Barnes never assented to any other. These and other considerations convince me that, in the construction of the contract, the Queen\u2019s Bench Division and the judges in appeal who concurred in their view were entirely right. This provisional contract was, however, subject to two conditions subsequent; first, it might be put an end to by the appellants at any time within the fifty days by notice; secondly, it was to lapse and determine ipso facto if no policy was delivered within the fifty days. Were these provisions subject to the Ontario Insurance Act? It has been determined, and cannot, on the strong, clear and express language of section 114, be open to dispute, that that enactment applies to all contracts of insurance against fire, and is not restricted to contracts in the form of policies. The words are:\nThe conditions set forth in this section shall, as against the insurers, be deemed to be part of every contract, whether sealed, written or oral, of fire insurance hereafter entered into, or renewed, or otherwise in force in Ontario.\nIt must, therefore, necessarily apply to such a contract as that before us, at least according to the construction I place upon it. Then what is the effect of the statute as applied to this receipt? The statutory condition 19 provides how insurances are to be terminated by notice from the insurers. It requires that such termination can only be at the end of five days after a formal service of notice to that effect, or seven days after the receipt at the post office of the assured\u2019s address of a registered letter containing the notice. If the contract before us is to be considered as one terminated by notice it is manifest that it had not been terminated according to this statutory condition at the date of the fire. There was no formal service of notice, and the appellants\u2019 letter dated the 18th of April, posted at Owen Sound on the 20th April, was only received at Parkhill on the 22nd of April, and the fire occurred on the 24th of April. There was therefore no interval of seven days as required by the statutory condition. It must, however, be remembered that the receipt provides that the non-receipt of a policy within fifty days shall operate as incontrovertible evidence of the rejection of the contract by the directors. Is this, or is it not, a variation of the statutory condition in question? If it is, as Mr. Justice Maclennan points out, it is ineffectual for non\u2011compliance with section 115, which requires such variations to be printed in a different coloured ink from the rest of the document in which it is contained. If that requirement had been complied with the question would then have been raised, to be determined by the court, as to whether it was a reasonable condition. Still it might stand with the statutory condition if not inconsistent with it. This depends on whether the negative fact of the non-receipt of the policy is or is not intended as an equivalent for notice, in other words, whether it is not intended as a negative mode of giving notice. I think there can be no doubt that it must be so considered. What is a written notice of rejection but evidence of rejection. Then where the appellants say in their receipt that the non-receipt of a policy shall be taken as incontrovertible evidence of rejection, they say in effect that it shall operate as a notice. The law, however, says that notice shall be in writing, and most reasonably requires that a defined interval shall elapse between its receipt and its operation as a termination of the contract. It would, in my opinion, be to sanction an evasion of the wholesome provision of the statute, to hold that this condition of the receipt is not entirely inconsistent with standing condition 19. Had the device of printing it in a different coloured ink been adopted I think no court could have held it to be a reasonable condition.\nI therefore with great respect must entirely dissent from the ruling of the learned trial judge and the opinions of the learned judges in the Court of Appeal who concurred with him.\nUpon another point I also concur with the learned Chief Justice of Ontario. I am of opinion that there was at least some evidence of waiver for the consideration of the jury in the facts, that the payment of the premium was demanded by the letter of the 17th of April; that it was paid accordingly and retained for six days by the appellants; that at the time the letter of the 17th of April was written the directors had not determined to reject the risk. Whether this is sufficient to establish waiver or to estop the appellants we are not called upon now to determine. All I do say is, that there was some evidence for the jury. I cannot treat the post-card of the 17th of April as the mere mistake of a clerk; of course a jury might so consider it, but it is entirely a question for a tribunal called upon to decide on the facts. No one can deny, that in the interval between the receipt of the post-card and the receipt of the letter posted at Owen Sound on the 20th of April, Barnes was justified in believing that his insurance was carried by the appellants, and that he was thus relieved from the necessity of protecting his property by other insurance.\nI am of opinion that the appeal must be dismissed with costs.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014The appellant has, in my opinion, made out a strong case, but I will not dissent from the conclusion reached by the majority of the court that the appeal should be dismissed. GWYNNE J.\u2014It appears to me to be free from doubt that there was no contract of insurance in force at the time of the fire. Billington v. The Provincial Insurance Co.[8] seems to me to be a conclusive authority in favour of the appellants. There the company accepted the risk and, in accordance with their practice where the risk extended only over a short period, instead of a formal policy they issued a certificate which stated that the plaintiff was insured subject to all the conditions of the company\u2019s policies, of which he admitted cognizance, and that in the event of loss it would be replaced by the policy. The late Chief Justice of this court, Sir Wm. Ritchie, delivering the judgment of the court there says[9]:\nIf there was no short policy plaintiff was clearly out of court. Unless followed by a policy within thirty days from the date of the provisional receipt the insurance by the terms of the receipt wholly ceased.\nThat appears to be the case here, and I am, therefore, of opinion that the appeal should be allowed and the action in the court below dismissed with costs.\nSEDGEWICK and KING JJ, concurred in the judgment of the Chief Justice.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Creasor & Smith.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Meredith, Cameron, Judd & Drumgole.\n[1] 22 Ont.

Watt ([5]),\nThe \"privilege mentioned in the act will not be held to grant a monopoly if another construction is possible, \"which it is.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE\u2014The appellant company was-originally incorporated in 1880, under the General Act, Consolidated Statutes (Canada), c. 65, for the purpose of manufacturing and selling illuminating gas in the city of St. Hyacinthe. The municipal authorities of. St. Hyacinthe were assenting parties to this incorporation.\nOn the 11th of January, 1881, the city council of St. Hyacinthe passed, a by-law granting to the appellant company an exclusive right and privilege to manufacture and sell gas in the city of St. Hyacinthe, both for lighting the streets and public places and for supplying the citizens therewith, for the term of twenty-five .years from the date of the by-law, and the appellants were thereby authorized to build gasworks and to make use of the streets and public roads-of the city for placing the pipes necessary for distributing gas.\nIn 1882 the persons then composing the appellant company under the first incorporation obtained from the legislature of the province of Quebec a special Act of incorporation, being the Act 45 Vic. c. 79. The first section of this statute enacted the incorporation under the same name of the shareholders of the former company, and declared that the real estate, franchises, and assets of every kind belonging to the company so formed should belong to the company incorporated by the act, and should form part of its property to all intents and purposes. The fifth section of this act is in the following words :\nAll the powers and privileges conferred upon the said company, as organized under the said general act, either by the terms of the act itself, or by resolution, by-law, or agreement of the said city of St. Hyacinthe are hereby reaffirmed and confirmed to the company as incorporated under the present act, including their right to break up, dig and trench so much and so many of the streets, squares, highways, lanes and public places, within the limits of the city of St. Hyacinthe and the adjoining parishes in the county of St. Hyacinthe, as may be necessary for laying down the mains and pipes required to make the necessary connections between their works and the premises of their patrons, doing no unnecessary damage in the premises, and taking care, as far as may be, to preserve a free and uninterrupted passage through the said streets, squares, highways, lanes and public places while the said works are in progress, and in addition it shall be lawful for the company, in substitution for gas, or in connection therewith,. or in addition thereto, to manufacture, use and sell electric, galvanic or other artificial light and to manufacture store and sell heat and motive power, derived either from gas or otherwise, and to convey the same by pipes or wires, and with the same privilege and subject to the same liabilities as are applicable to the manufacture, use and disposal of illuminating gas under the provisions of this act.\nThe city of St. Hyacinthe did not in any way con-sent to this legislation, and was no party to it.\nThe last mentioned act did not recite or refer specifically to the by-law of the 11th January 1881 or to the agreement entered into thereby between the city of St. Hyacinthe and the original company, conferring the monopoly, as regards gas, therein mentioned. Since 1882, up to the date of the action, the appellants had, to the exclusion of any other company, supplied gas for lighting purposes to the city and its inhabitants, and since 1887 they have also sold and supplied electric light. On the 16th February, 1894, on a petition presented. by Antoine Morin, a by-law was passed by the city council of St. Hyacinthe, authorizing him, or any company or firm which he might subsequently form, to make use of the streets and. roads of the city for placing poles, wires and other apparatus necessary for the construction of a line for the sale of electric light to the inhabitants of St. Hyacinthe. The appellants protested against the adoption of this by-law.\nSubsequently Antoine Morin and his associates applied to the Lieutenant-Governor in Council under a general act of the province, for letters patent of incorporation, which were accordingly issued on the 19th of April, 1894, and thereby the respondent com-pany was incorporated.\nJoy the letters patent of incorporation the object of the respondent company was declared to be as follows :\nPour l'achat, la possession et l'exploitation de forces motrices hydrauliques pour toutes sortes de fins industrielles, et notamment pour la production et la distribution, la vente et la location de la lumi\u00e8re de la chaleur et de la force motrice produites par l'\u00e9lectricit\u00e9.\nUpon their organization the respondents proceeded to make contracts with individuals citizens of St. Hyacinthe, for lighting their houses and places of business by electricity, and at once began to construct in houses and streets of . Hyacinthe a line and installation which at the date of the institution of the present action they were in process of completing.\nThe appellants insist that by the fifth section of their special Act of incorporation of 1882 a like monopoly and exclusive privilege to furnish electric light was coffered upon them as was in terms conferred upon them by the by-law of the 11th January, 1881, in respect of gas.\nThe respondents' contentions are that the fifth section, according to its proper legal interpretation, does not extend the exclusive privilege, which the by-law assumed to confer as to gas to electric lighting; secondly, that the by-law itself was ultra vires ; and thirdly that if the construction of the fifth section of the Act of 1882 is such as the appellants insist the enactment itself was ultra vires of the Quebec Legislature.\nI shall not have to consider the two last objections as I entirely agree with the courts below, which have both construed the fifth section of the Act of 1882 in the manner the respondents contend for. I therefore confine my judgment exclusively to this question as to the proper meaning of the fifth section.\nIn the first place it is a most important consideration to be borne in mind in the construction of this Act of the legislature, that it is a private Act to which the city of St. Hyacinthe was not a party, and which was not in any way assented to by it. It is none the less a private Act for the reason that it contains a clause declaring it to be a public Act ([6]). In Dawson v. Paver ([7]), Wigram V. C. says that;\nWhether an Act is public or private does not depend upon any technical considerations (such as having a clause or declaration that the Act shall he deemed a public Act) but upon the nature and substance of the case.\nAnd in Maxwell on Statutes ([8]) it is said that\nenactments which invest private persons or bodies, for their own benefit and profit, with privileges and powers interfering with the property or rights of others, are construed more strictly perhaps than any other kind of enactment.\nThe courts take notices that these Acts are obtained on the petition of the promoters, and in construing them treat them as contracts between the applicants for them and the legislature on behalf of the public, and the language in which they are expressed is treated as the language of the promoters, and the maxim verba fortius accipiuntur contra proferentem is applied to them ; and the benefit of any ambiguity or doubt is given to those whose interests would be prejudicially affected, especially when such persons are not parties to the Act nor before the legislature as assenting to it. And particularly is this so where exorbitant powers, such as a monopoly, are conferred.\nFurther, it has been laid down by as high an authority as could be quoted that :\nIf words in a local or Personal Act seem to express an intention to enact something unconnected with the purpose of the promoters and which the committee if they had done their duty, would not have allowed to be introduced, almost any construction, it has been said, would seem justifiable to prevent them from having that effect ([9]).\nHaving referred to these general rules applicable to the construction of private acts, I now proceed to examine the particular enactment in question, viz., the fifth section of the appellants special Act of 1882. In the first place, as I have already said, there is no recital of the by-law of the 11th January, 1881, and nothing on the face of the act to show that the attention of the legislature was called to its terms, or that it was in any way brought to their notices. The general confirmation of privileges conferred by the former general act, or by resolution, by-law or agreement of the city of St. Hyacinthe, contained in the first part of the section, would not, it is manifest, by itself confer any other exclusive right than that relating to the exclusive privilege, for twenty-five years, to light with gas. If the proposition of the appellants is correct, the monopoly which they claim as to electric lighting must be conferred by the subsequent part of the section, expressed in these words; And in addition it shall be lawful for the company in substitution for gas, or in connection therewith or in addition thereto to manufacture, use and sell electric, galvanic or other artificial light, and to manufacture, store and sell heat and motive power derived either from gas or otherwise, and to convey the same by pipes or wires, and with the same privilege and subject to the same liabilities as are applicable to the manufacture, use and disposal of illuminating gas under the provisions of this act\nThe question then is really narrowed to this : Must we say that it was intended by the legislature by the words \" with the same privilege \" without more and without having before them the by-law which defined the extent of the privileges as to gas, to grant to the appellants for their own exclusive private profit and advantage, a monopoly of selling electric light in the city of St Hyacinthe for the term of twenty-five years?\nI am of opinion \"that but one answer is admissible to this question, that which has already been given by Mr. Justice Grill in the Superior Court and by the Court of Queen's Bench. The purpose of the promoters in procuring their private act must be deemed to have been merely to extend their own powers and to confirm existing by-laws and agreements The grant of a new exclusive privilege of electric lighting was something entirely unconnected with these purposes, something which concerned not merely the appellants themselves, but which would operate very prejudicially against the interests of the inhabitants of the city of St. Hyacinthe, and which it is not to be presumed the legislature would have granted without their consent, or at least without hearing them. To construe the statute in the way contended for by the appellants would therefore work a great injustice and would be in direct violation of the general principles of construction applicable to such legislation, already referred to. It is said that the word \" privilege \" must necessarily mean an exclusive privilege to sell electric light, but I think that is not so inasmuch as this word p privilege \" can be referred to the privileges already conferred by the general act and by the by-law, and specified in the former part of the fifth section viz. the privilege of breaking up, digging and trenching the streets, squares, highways, lanes and public places \" and this interpretation is strengthened by the consideration that the \" privilege \" is coupled with a declaration that it is to be subject to the s same liabilities\" as apply to the manufacture of gas such liabilities being manifestly those before specified, viz., liabilities to take due care in exercising the privilege, to preserve a free passage through the streets, and to do no unnecessary damage.\nI am of opinion that the appeal must be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant : Geoffrion, Dorion & Allan.\nSolicitors for the respondent : Lafleur & Macdougall.\n[1] 45 V. c. 79.\n[2] Par. 4.\n[3] Pp. 273-5.\n[4] 22 Can.

Arpin v. The Queen (14 Can. S.C.R. 736); Schwersenski v. Vineberg (19 Can. S.C.R. 243); and City of Montreal v. Lemoine (23 Can. S.C.R. 390) distinguished.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada (appeal side) affirming the judgment of the Superior Court in favour of the plaintiffs.\nThe action was upon a policy of insurance against fire issued by the defendant company to one Duval on a quantity of lumber in his yard on the river Nicolet and assigned by Duval to the plaintiffs. One of the conditions of the policy was that it should be forfeited if the claim was in any respect fraudulent and the defence of the company to the action was that Duval in his application for insurance had materially [exaggerated the quantity and value of the lumber and obtained thereby insurance above its value and that he had fraudulently exaggerated the amount of his loss. The contention of the plaintiffs on this appeal was that the fraud charged had not been directly proved, but had to be presumed from the evidence which was not sufficient, and also that Duval's fraud could not deprive them of the benefit of the policy. The courts below held that the charge of fraud had not been made out and gave judgment against the company.\nThe material facts of the case with the pleadings and substance of the evidence are set out in the judgment of the court.\nTrenholme Q.C. and Lafleur for the appellants. \u00c1 clear case of fraud has been made out and the evidence can be dealt with by this court as well as the court of first instance. Bland v. Ross ([1]).\nDuval's fraud forfeited the policy and the assignees are in no better position than he would be.\nBeique Q.C. and Geoffrion Q.C. for the respondents. There is no direct evidence of fraud and it cannot be presumed If it could Duval's fraud cannot affect the innocent assignees.\nTwo courts have found that no fraud was committed and this court will not interfere with those findings. Arpin v. Tue Queen ([2]); Schwersenki v. Vineberg ([3]); City of Montreal v. Lemoine ([4]).\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by :\nTASCHEREAU J. By this action instituted in March 1884, the respondents, as assignees of one Evariste Duval, claim from the company appellant the sum of $5,000, being the amount of an insurance policy issued' on the 7th September 1883, by the appellant to the said Duval, concurrently with other policies in various other companies, amounting altogether to $17,000, on a quantity of lumber then piled in a yard on the river Nicolet, which lumber was but two weeks afterwards destroyed by fire.\nThe appellants pleaded in answer :\n1 That the policy was obtained by the false and fraudulent representations of Duval that the lumler insured was worth $30,000 whereas at no time during the existence of the policy was it worth half that sum :\n2. That Duval, in the application, materially exaggerated the quantity and value of the lumber mentioned therein, and thereby obtained from the appellants and other companies, represented by the same agent simultaneous insurances to the amount of $17,000 over and above $12,000 prior insurance \u2014thus making $29,000 of insurance in all whereas the lumber thus insured was worth not more than $11,500; the whole contrary to one of the conditions of the policy which was to be null in such an event:\n3 That the insurance was forfeited in accordance with a clause in the policy, because Duval falsely and fraudulently exaggerated the amount of the loss in his claim, by putting it at $36,515.68, whereas it did not exceed $11,500.\nAfter a protracted and voluminous enqu\u00eate the Superior Court gave judgment for the amount claimed. This judgment was confirmed by the majority of the Court of Queen's Bench, Hall J., in a dissenting opinion, holding that though the charge of fraud had not been made out, yet the lumber destroyed was proved to have been worth not more than $15,482.\nThe company now appeals from that judgment. The controversy here as in the courts below, bears exclusively on questions of fact.\nWe are of opinion that the appellants have fully made out their case.\nIt is in order, before reviewing succinctly the salient parts of the evidence adduced on both sides to consider a proposition of law strenuously relied upon by the respondents. Conceding, on this argument at least, that if the appellants' contentions as to overvaluation and over-insurance by Duval prevail a clear case of fraud has been made out against him, they pressed upon us the uncontrovertible maxim that fraud is not to be presumed, odiosa et inhonesta non sunt in lege pr\u0153sumenda, and argued there from that as the appellants' proof of overvaluation rests entirely upon presumptions and inferences of facts their defence must fail. The respondents would thus seem to contend indirectly at least, that the courts cannot find fraud unless it be directly proved. But, for obvious reasons, this proposition is untenable.\nThere would be very little protection against fraud if such was the law. Those who intend to defraud do all in their power to conceal their intent.\nTheir acts could not defraud if they were not clothed with the garb of honesty. \u00c1 maxim of the criminal law, based on the same principle is that the guilt of the accused is never to be presumed. But that does not mean that a criminal shall not be convicted if he has not taken a witness for his crime.\nIt is likewise, as a general rule, only by presumptions and circumstantial or inferential evidence that dishonesty can be proved.\nAs Coquille said, a long time ago :\nSelon les r\u00e8gles do droit, la fraude ne peut \u00eatre prouv\u00e9e que par conjectures, parce que ceux qui veulent frauder travaillent de tout leur* pouvoir pour la couvrir. Or, as says Dumoulin :\nElle ne serait pas fraude, si elle n'\u00e9tait occulte. Ce sont donc les circonstances qu'il faut principalement consid\u00e9rer, fraus consistit in circumstantiis. '.\nIt is useless to insist further on this point.\nAnother legal proposition put forward by the respondents at the hearing is just as untenable. They argued that even if Duval's fraud has been established, they nevertheless are entitled to recover against the company, because, as they contend, they cannot be held answerable for his fraud. This is a startling pro position. They, as assignees, would have a right of action though their assignor had none. They would have been subrogated to a claim vitiated by fraud, but would yet claim the right to pocket the benefit of that fraud. What a protection to frauds on the insurance companies would such a doctrine carry if it were to prevail.\nI will now briefly review the facts of the case.\nThey, in limine, are of a nature to throw discredit on the respondents' claim. Duval, when he took this insurance in his own name, did so, he has to admit, in direct violation of a contract he had with the respondents, by which he had covenanted that all insurances on this lumber would be taken in their name as security for their advances. And he not only concealed this from the agent but concealed it also from the respondents till after the fire. Nay, more, during two days after the fire that one of the respondents was down at Nicolet discussing with him the loss and the claim against the insurance companies, he, Duval, never said a word of these additional insurances he had so taken on the 7th of September. It is only later, and then not from him at all, but from the companies, that the respondents heard of these new insurances. Now this suppressio veri, though perhaps not alone directly affecting the result here, as it may be that Duval was not bound to disclose it, yet cannot but at the very outset of the case, under the circumstances, tell unfavourably against him. And it may be doubtful whether if he had revealed the fact that he was so acting in fraud of an express agreement with his creditors the agent would have taken the risks at all.\nAnother feature of the case which, at its inception, cannot but strike one's attention, is the enormous addition made by Duval to the insurance previously carried by the respondents on this lumber. The latter, though they had over $25,000 at stake, and usually kept this lumber pretty fully covered, had insured for $ 12,000 only, and Duval was aware of it. He, however, on the 1st of September, not only doubles that amount but takes additional insurances to the amount of $17,000, thus, behind the respondents' back, increasing the insurance from $12,000 to $29,000. The reason he gave to the agent for this large increase was the accumulation of sawn lumber in his yard, caused by the Whitehall Company not taking delivery as agreed. Now, it was then not over two working weeks since this Whitehall Company had ceased their shipments. And so it would have been in that short space of time, if we believe him that the insurable value of the lumber in this yard would have increased from $120000 to $29,000. The thing is incredible on its face. But we have, moreover, direct evidence by Kelly the agent of this Whitehall Company, from a statement he personally prepared for his principals three days only before the fire that the whole quantity of sawn lumber in the yard sold to them, but not yet delivered, amounted to only 545,000 feet, of the value of $5,523.75. So that Duval's additional insurance for $17,000 was over three times more than the value of the lumber upon which he then himself, instilled it.\nThe controversy, I ought to have remarked before, turns principally on the amount of lumber that the logs must have produced during the season of 1883, the respondents contending that the fire destroyed 3,820,348 feet, as sworn to by Duval in his proof of loss, whilst the appellants say that there cannot have been in the yard then more than 1621162 feet. As to the value of the lumber, and the quantity of logs that came down to the mill, there is no dispute.\nThe plan resorted to by Duval and the respondents to establish the quantity of lumber burned is this: to take, in the first place, the amount of sawn lumber carried over from the season of 1882 as per inventory of December of that year viz. 844828 feet 2nd the number of logs made in the winter of 1882.83, and a few scattered logs picked up or bought from others; then deduct from the total the lumber sold before the fire the lumber saved from the fire, and that produced from the logs un sawn at the time of the fire, and the difference should, as they contend, represent the quantity burned, which by that method they would make out to have been 3,820,348 feet, of the value of $36515.88.\nThe respondents' case rests, it is rightly remarked by the Court of Appeal, almost entirely on the oral evidence of one Marchand, Duval's culler, and on four specifications professing to be four original reports made by him to Duval of the logs cut in the shanties in the months of December January February and March of the winter in question. He says those are the original statements made each month by Albert Duval brother and clerk of his employer, from his, Marchand's, dictation and reading from his culler's book which he brought down from the shanties; that after A. Duval had completed the statement it was again checked over to insure correctness; that he Mar chand, then signed the statement, and went back to the shanties for another month's operations. It is a singular fact that a copy of these so-called specifications was never sent to the respondents, though Duval, by his contract with them had bound himself to do so. The respondents never saw them till after the fire. And one cannot but be struck with the similarity in the appearance, as exhibited to us in manuscript, of the paper, the writing, the ruling, which is by hand and consists of double lines of red and blue pencilling, which would lead one who had to do with documentary evidence to say at once that they were all prepared at the same time. They profess to contain an inventory of the different kinds of logs, their length, and contents in board measure. But Marchand's original culler's book, from which all these figures were read out, has disappeared and that disappearance has taken place only after the insurance companies' contestation of this claim. Now Marchand's statements, it is amply proved by the best possible evidence that an insurance company can almost ever bring in such a case, cannot be accurate and no credence can be attached to his testimony. According to his calculations the cut of logs produced on an average during that season :\u2014\nPine\n159.\nft.\nper log\nSpruce\n87\n\"\n\"\nHemlock\n121\n\"\n\"\"\nBass.\n132\n\"\n\"\nAsh\n109\n\"\n\"\nHis logs, however, were of the same quality and size as those cut by George Ball and, McCaffrey, two respectable mill owners on the same river. Yet for the same year, Ball's pine logs gave only 70 feet, and McCaffrey's 89 whilst Duval claims 159 feet for his. In spruce, McCaffrey's logs only produced. 53 and a half feet Ball's logs produced 57 whilst according to Duval's theories his produced 87 feet. In hemlock, McCaffrey and Ball got 90 feet per log, whilst Duval claims that he got 121. In bass, Ball got 80 feet per log, but Duval claims to have had 132. In ash Ball got 80 feet per log but Duval claims he got 109 feet. On an average, upon the whole of the operations, Ball & McCaffrey got 78 feet per log, but he, Duval, claims to have got 116. So that according to Marchand if his statements were correct Duval would have got, out of the same quantity, quality and kind of logs, over 2,000,000 feet more than his neighbours in the same business on the same river in the same year, and made over $20,000 more than they did. Or, to put it in another form, if Duval and Marchand are to be believed, they got out of 59,000 logs as many feet in quantity and as much in dollars as any other mill owner on the same river got The same year, or ever got any year before or after the fire out of 90,000 logs of the same kind and size. Or, Duval would have made, according to the calculations of one Welch, an expert examined in the case, a profit, in 1883, of 57 and a half per cent. And yet his neighbours were doing a flourishing business and he was a bankrupt.\nIf a comparison is made with the result of 1882, the year preceding the fire, taking Duval's own figures, his 59,000 logs gave him, in 1883, 2,300,000 feet more than the same number would have given him in 1882. And the average, upon the whole of his operations would be 116 feet per log for the year of the fire, though only 78 feet for the preceding year. An explanation of how he could in 1883 get 38 feet more per log than his neighbours, whilst in 1882 he got only the same number as they did, has not been attempted. The reason is plain. Logs have not such a power of expansion.\nIf we apply the same test to the years succeeding the fire, as far as proved in the case, the result is the same, over 2,000,000 feet more for the same number of logs in 1883.\nEvery such test that can be applied reveals the extraordinary coincidence that the over-valuation by Duval is over two million feet. This harmony in the results tells heavily against the respondents.\nDuval would have us believe that his 59,000 logs of 1883 were all of 11 inches and over. But that is incredible. It is in evidence that of the whole cut of 1885 for the same mill, from the same limits one third and, of the whole cut of 1887 more than one half, were under eleven inches. McCaffrey's and Ball's logs for 1883. also comprised a large number under eleven inches It is moreover in evidence that instead of the logs of 1883 being cut on the 11 inch limit and being unusually large, as Duval and Marchand swear, the foremen who cut the logs and the men who handled them were ordered to cut them of nine inches and over and that they did cut them that size and even down to eight inches. And the evidence is all one way by the men who made and handled and saw the logs, that they were logs of the same size and description as were made in all other years on the same river from 1882 to 1887 inclusive for that mill and for all the other mills on the Nicolet; all the witnesses say they were the ordinary logs of the river Nicolet.\nNot a single reason has been given, or attempted to be given, to explain why in 1883 alone a different kind and size of logs should have been made or their production so enormously increased and a result attained so much larger than that of every other year and every other mill on the same river., Tourville himself, one of the respondents, has to admit that it is the same description of lumber that is sawn from year to year in the locality.\nThere is another piece of evidence, the result of which also carries great weight against the respondents. in fact, in every form in which an outside check can possibly be availed of by the appellants, as ' well remarked by Mr. Justice Hall in the Court of Appeal, the case presents the clearest evidence of uniform and systematic exaggeration of such an extent, and under such circumstances, as to he absolutely in compatible with good faith.\nIt is in evidence that all the lumber sawn at the mill up to the 14th of August was piled and loaded under contract at 40 cents per 1000 feet, for which Duval paid $605.64. Now $605644 at 40 cents per 1,000 feet gives 1,514,100 feet, or say in round numbers 1,600,000 as the total output up to the 14th of August, two weeks before the application for insurance and five weeks before the fire. Now as he claims that the fire destroyed 3,820,348 feet, and that he sold 2,232,279 feet before the fire all sawed during that season except 844828 feet it follows that he claims that he sawed 5207 999 feet before the fire. And if 1,600,000 feet only were sawn up to the 14th of August, it follows he sawed the balance of 3600,000 in the five weeks from the 14th of August to the 21st of September, whilst it took him eight weeks after the fire from the 21st of September to the 17th of November, running under pressure, to saw 1,427,351 feet, in that same mill, after it had been put in a better condition.\nOr to put it in another way, his mill during 30 days would have cut 120,000 feet a day. And yet the respondents have to admit in their factum that from 35, 000 to 40,000 a day was the utmost that it could ever give. And here again this evidence establishes over 2,000,000 feet as Duval's over-valuation. The same result is obtained by a comparison of the cost of sawing. Taking Duval's own figures again, he would have to be able to saw 2,000,000 more feet before the fire for the same wages that it would have cost him after the fire when the mill had been repaired. How it happened could not, of course, be explained. l Then, by asserting as he does that he sawed 5207, 000 feet before the fire, he claims that he sawed before the fire for $1.50 per 1,000 feet, the same lumber that cost him $2.50 per 1.000 feet after the fire in a better mill.\nAgain, it cost him in wages to run that mill 48 days after the fire $3,555.51 or $74 a day, against $7.862.84 for a pretended 144 days before the fire or $54 perday. At the same rate of $74 per day he must have run only 106.days before the fire, and at 30,000 feet per day cut Only 3,180,000 feet before the fire and not 5207000 as claimed:\nThe respondents attempted to support their estimates by proving the capacity of the mill and the number of days it was in operation during that season. But far from succeeding in doing so their evidence on this point turns out to be more favourable to the appellants' contentions than to theirs\nAccording to one Chabot's evidence upon which they mainly rely on this part of their case, the mill would have cut 75,000 logs. Now Duval himself cannot claim more than 59,000 the boomage account is there to check him. So that Chabot evidently proves too much; his exaggerations result from his own figures. .Moreover, according to his own estimates, the cut gave in 1883 only 80 feet per log, whilst Duval claims 116. So that, on the controversy as to the average output, the respondents' principal witness entirely supports the appellants' contentions. That which makes against his point who swears may be believed, although that which makes for it is disbelieved.\nThe respondents' evidence as to the number of piles in the yard is also unreliable. Assuming the number '. claimed by Duval to be proved we still are without satisfactory evidence of the quantity contained in each pile. We have on this point nothing but opinions of a vague and unreliable nature, proved withal to be untenable by the various tests I have alluded to. The same may be said of the evidence as to the number of logs sawn after the fire.\nAs to the evidence of the two Duvals the remarks that I made as to Marchand's evidence fully apply. Their figures are based on Marchand's statements and they, like him, swear to what is conclusively proved to have been physical impossibilities. The number of witnesses who swear to such things cannot have any weight. Non numerantur, sed ponderantur.\nSuch are the principal features of the evidence in the case.\nIf as it has been well remarked ([5]) the force and effect of circumstantial evidence depend upon its incompatibility with, and incapability of, explanation or solution upon any other supposition than that of the truth of the fact which it is adduced to prove, the appellants' case is as clearly made out as a case of this nature can ever possibly be.\nThe evidentiary facts, the facts they rely upon, are unmistakably proved. Their absolute incompatibility with the respondents' theories is also patent. There is no room for any other solution, if these facts are true but that Duval grossly and wilfully exaggerated the quantity of his lumber, both on the 1st of September on his application for insurance and in his statement of loss after the fire It is an utter impossibility that the calculations resulting from respondents' own evidence could be correct and that Duval had the quantity of lumber he claims to have had and upon the incorrectness of these calculations there is no room for controversy. The logic of figures is irrefutable.\nSuch a number of cogent circumstances so closely connected with each other, each separately tending to the same mathematical result and rationally consistent with but one solution circumstances which it is impossible to conceive to have been fraudulently or designedly brought together, and as to which there is no room whatever for the hypotheses of confederacy or error, irresistibly lead to the conviction that the fact of over valuation by Duval to which they all unequivocally depose is true. The united force of so many coincidences carries of itself the conclusion to which its various elements converge. Such an array of facts and figures cannot possibly mislead. It amounts to demonstration, carrying with it absolute certitude, which no oral evidence can weaken.\nThe disappearance, unsatisfactorily explained, of the culler's pass books, and of all the papers which might have thrown any light upon the controverted facts, is a feature of the case that I should have alluded to previously. The rule omnia pr\u0153sumuntur contra spoliatorem is one based on common sense and reason. If these papers had supported the claim they would have been scrupulously taken care of and their non-production justifies us, in law, to come to the conclusion that they would, if forthcoming be adverse to the respondents' contentions. Mill owners it is proved by Rutherford Welch and Ward, always preserve these hooks. And when is it that they have disappeared d Only when a contestation by the insurance companies was dreaded They were in existence when an arbitration about this same fire mentioned in the record took place but were not produced before the arbitrators though called for. The ignorance or loose business habits of Duval are invoked as an excuse for their non-production, but ii ne faut pas prendre l'ignorance pour l'innocence, ni la rusticit\u00e9 ou la rudesse pour la vertu.\nThe appellants have made out the clear case that is required to justify us, nay to oblige us, on an appeal even upon questions of fact, not to adopt the conclusions of the court below. If the case had been tried by a jury a verdict for the respondents would undoubtedly have been set aside, as being against the weight of evidence and a new trial ordered. But, as we are here judges of the facts of the case, as the courts below were, our judgment must be to dismiss the action.\nFurther there are abundant reasons why this case should not be held to fall under the general rule that, upon such an appeal against the concurrent findings of two courts we should not interfere.\nFirst it was not tried by a jury. 2nd. The judge who determined it in the first instance did not hear the witnesses but gave his judgment upon written depositions. 3rd. The Court of Appeal expressed great doubts in adopting the findings of the judge of first instance. 4th. The judgment of the Court of Appeal was not unanimous, Mr. Justice Hall finding it proved that Duval had over-insured for more than one-half the quantity and value of the lumber. 5th. By the consid\u00e9rants of the judgment of the Superior Court it does not appear that the non-production by the respondents of the written documents bearing on the controversy was taken into consideration. 6th. The Court of Appeal appears to have given weight to a piece of evidence of undoubted illegality the award upon a certain arbitration about this fire to which the appellants were not parties. On all these grounds the case is distinguishable from Gray v. Turnbull ([6]); North German Co. v. Elder ([7]); Allen v. The Quebec Warehouse Co. ([8]) * Council of Brisbane v. Martin ([9]); and that class of decisions which we have ourselves given effect to in this court in various in stances inter alia, Arpin v. The Queen ([10]); City of Montreal v. Le Moine ([11]); Schwersenski v. Vineberg ([12]); and from which we do not intend here to deviate.\nThe case falls under the exceptions foreseen in all the decisions wherein the general rule was followed, and the following have their full application; indeed, they enlarge the duties of a Court of Appeal further than is required to justify the allowance of this appeal l\nThe judicial committee is not bound by the decision of the court be low upon a question of evidence, although in general it will follow it ([13]).\nThe parties are entitled to have the decision of the Court of Appeal on questions of fact as on questions of law, and the court cannot excuse itself from the task of weighing conflicting evidence and drawing its own inferences and conclusions, though it should always bear in mind that it has not heard nor seen the witnesses for which due allowance should be made As a rule a court of appeal will be disinclined to interfere, when the judge hearing the witnesses has come to his decision upon the credibility of witnesses as evidenced by their de meanour but otherwise in cases where it depends upon the drawing of inferences from the facts in evidence ([14]).\nAnd in Bigsby v. Dickinson ([15]) it was held that :\nAlthough the Court of Appeal, when called on to review the conclusion of a judge of first instance, after hearing witnesses viva voce, will give great weight to the consideration that the demeanour and manner of the witnesses are material elements in judging of the credibility of the witnesses, yet it will in a proper case act upon its own view of the conflicting evidence.\" \"Of course,\" said James L.J. in. that same case, \"if we are to accept as final the decision of the court of first instance in every case where there is a conflict of evidence our labours would be very much lightened, but then, that would be doing. away with the right of appeal in all cases of nuisance, for there never is one brought into court in which there is not contradictory evidence.\"\nAnd Bramwell L.J. said :\nThe legislature has contemplated and made provision for our reversing a judgment of a Vice Chancellor where the burden of proof has been held by him not to have been sustained by the plaintiff and where he has had the living witnesses and we have not If we were to be deterred by such considerations as these which have been presented to us from reversing a decision from which we dissent it would have been better to say at once that in such cases there shall be no appeal.\nAnd in Jones v. Hough ([16]) Bram well L.J. said :\nFirst, I desire to say a word as to our jurisdiction. If, upon the materials before the learned judge, he has, in giving judgment come to an erroneous conclusion upon certain questions of fact and we see that the conclusions are erroneous we must come to a different conclusion, and act upon the conclusion that we come to, and not accept his finding. I have not the slightest doubt that such is our power and duty. A great difference exists between a finding by the judge and a finding by the jury. Where the jury find the facts, the court cannot be substituted for them, because the parties have agreed that the facts shall be decided by a jury; but where the judge finds the facts, there the Court of Appeal has the same jurisdiction that he has, and can find the facts whichever way they like. I have no doubt, therefore that it is our jurisdiction, our power and our duty; and if, upon these materials. judgment ought to be given in any particular way different from that in which Lindley J. has given it, we ought to give that judgment.\nThe cases of Thurburn v. Steward ([17]), and Symington v. Symington ([18]), though they have but a limited application, yet may be referred to on the point. Also what our present Chief Justice said on the subject in Ph\u0153nix Ins. Go. v. Magee ([19]); and the case of Russell v. Lefran cois ([20]), where this court reversed the concurrent findings of the two courts below upon a question of fact, and the Privy Council refused leave to appeal. True it is, that there the credibility of any of the witnesses was not directly questioned; but here, even upon that point we are in the same position as the two courts below were, their conclusions having been exclusively reached, as ours have to be, upon the mere reading of written depositions.\nIn Aitken v. Mc Meckan ([21]) the Privy Council, and in The Queen v. Chesley ([22]) this court, also reversed on a question of fact.\nWe have here, according to the express terms of the statute, to give the judgment which, in our opinion, the Court of Appeal should have given, and that court should have exercised their power to reverse the decision of the Superior Court. The law would be absurd indeed if on the one hand it gave an appeal on questions of fact, whilst on the other hand such an appeal could never be allowed. It is on the assumption that there may be error in the judgment, although two courts have concurred therein, that the right of appeal is given in such a case, even on questions of fact.\nThe judges of the Appellate Court are as capable in such a case,\nsays Lord Kingsdown in Bland v. Ross ([23]),\n(and indeed are presumed to be more capable), of forming an opinion for themselves as to the proof of facts and as to the inferences to be drawn from them.\nIn Chard v. Meyers ([24]) Strong V.C., now Chief Justice of this court said upon the same point :\nI concede that when there is a balance of evidence causing the de termination of a question of fact to be dependent altogether on the credit to be given to particular witnesses, it is almost impossible for the court, on such an appeal as this, to overrule the decision of the master in whose presence the witnesses have been examined. But if there is as I find here a balance of direct testimony, and the circum stances point strongly to one conclusion, and against the other, I know: of no reason why the court may not review the evidence, and reverse the master's finding.\nAnd the learned judge reversed the master's finding discrediting a witness upon whose evidence the master had determined the case.\nAdd in Morrison v. Robinson (1) the same learned judge held that the rule that where the decision of a question of fact depends altogether upon the credit to be given to the dire it testimony of conflicting wit nesses, the court, as a rule, will adopt the finding of the master, who has had the advantage of hearing the witnesses, applies only where the evidence being directly contradictory there are no circumstances pointing to the probability of one statement rather than of the other\nWe do not fail to take into consideration I need hardly say, that the fact of the two provincial courts having come to the same conclusion enhances the gravity of our duties, and imposes upon us more than might perhaps be required under other circumstances the strict obligation not to allow the appeal without being thoroughly convinced that there is error in the judgment. But, at the same time, we would unquestionably be forgetful of our duties if we did not form an independent opinion of the evidence and give the benefit of it to the appellants if they are entitled to it. Over-insurance must be put a stop to as much as it is in the powers of the courts to do it. Therein lies one of the greatest sources of fraud in connection with the insurance business. If the assured is not in part a co-assurer with the company, that is to say, if the par ties to the contract have not a common interest in the preservation of the property insured one of the most efficient safeguards against fraud and crime is removed. Any such contract where the assured might expect to make a profit by the destruction of the property in sured is, in law, tainted with immorality. And to re quire from a company, when called upon to pay a loss\n(1) 19 Gr. 480. 131\/2 over which hangs any suspicion, a stronger proof than the appellants have made in this case to defeat a fraudulent claim, would be virtually to leave the assurer at the mercy of the assured, a result which obviously, in the public interest, even more than in the companies' interest, should by all possible means be averted.

Damages were claimed and allowed by the Superior Court on several heads of injury, all of which were acquiesced in and settled by the defendant company except one by which the plaintiffs were awarded $5,500 for the closing up of a right of way which he claimed to have enjoyed for over thirty years. The company appealed from this portion of the judgment on two grounds both of which had been pleaded, namely, that the plaintiff's action, not having* been taken within two years from the time the wrongful act complained of was committed, was pre scribed by art. 2261 C. C. and also by the Railway Act, and that the alleged closing up of the right of way was the unauthorized act of the contractor for the construction of the road for which the company was not responsible. The Court of Queen's Bench gave effect to this latter contention and reversed the judgment of the Superior Court as to this head of damage, and also held that the amount awarded to plaintiff was not justified by the evidence and that the judgment was ultra petita in that said amount covered past and future damages and relieved the company from the obligation to restore the right of way which was asked by the declaration\nThe plaintiff appealed from such judgment to this court.\nTaylor for the appellant. The judgment of the Superior Court was not ultra petita. The company had the choice to restore the property or pay damages and cannot complain if the latter is ordered. Pion v. The North Shore Railway Co. ([1]).\nThe company is not relieved from liability on the ground that the wrongful act was committed by the contractor. The Railway Act entitles the plaintiff to compensation from the company for any damage sustained by the building of the road. See Pion v. The North Shore Railway Co. (1); Morrison v. The City of Montreal ([2]); Wood v. The Atlantic & North-West Rail way Co. ([3]); Railway Act, 1888, sees. 92 and 145.\nThe damages were continuous and the prescription does not apply. Grenier v. The City of Montreal ([4]). Abbott Q.O. for the respondent. The contractor was entirely independent of the company who could not have prevented him from doing the injury complained of Hughes v. Percival ([5]); Steele v. The South Eastern Railway Co. ([6]); Ellis v. The Sheffield Gas Go. ([7]).\nThe plaintiff's action was prescribed. See McGilliv ray v. The Great Western Railway Co. ([8]); May v. The Ontario & Quebec Railway Co. ([9]).\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014I am of opinion that this appeal should be dismissed for the reasons given in the judgment of Mr. Justice Taschereau,\nTASCHEREU J.\u2014Under article 2261 of the Civil Code the appellant's right of action was prescribed when he instituted these proceedings. The doctrine of the continuance of damages relied upon by him to answer the plea of prescription, does not help him in this case ([10]). It has been carried too far in the cases he quoted. The prescription runs from the act which causes the damage, when the damage complained of results exclusively from that act, without any new tortious act from the tortfeasor, and when the damage complained of could have been foreseen and claimed for at the time that the quasi offence which caused it was committed, or within two years there from. Had the plaintiff then a right of action, in which he would have recovered compensation for prospective damages, including those he now claims s That is the question. If he then had that action as the appellant here clearly had after the company's acts he complains of, the prescription runs from the time his right of action accrued. Breakey v. Garter ([11]). There is no new right of action arising every day of the year. The damages are consecutive but not successive. And I can see no difference on this point between injuries to property and bodily injuries. Compare Canadian Pacific Railway Co. v. Robinson ([12]).\nI would dismiss the appeal.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014The sole question upon this appeal is whether or not the defendants are responsible for the acts of an independent contractor employed by them in the construction of their railway in digging and carrying away and depositing upon the line of railway earth taken from a piece of land of one Howell alto gether outside of the railway land but situate between the land of the plaintiff and a highway called Hallowell street, and over which land of Howell at the place where the soil was dry and the earth taken away there from the \"plaintiff claims to be entitled to a right of way from his own land to Hallowell street. The sole ground upon which the claim of the plaintiff to make the defendants responsible for these the acts of their independent contractor is rested, is a clause in the contract between the defendants and the contractor whereby, as is claimed, the defendants, by agreeing to provide the contractor with necessary borrowing pits, have made themselves responsible for his acts even though such acts should constitute trespass upon the property of others or otherwise tortious to others. The only clauses in the contract having any relation to the question are those numbered respectively 22 and 32 and are as follows: \u2014\n22. In cases where the adjoining roadbed excavations are insufficient to form embankments the deficiency will generally be made by widening the cuss and by putting wider ditches through then; but there are special cases where earth will have to be hauled several miles to make up embankments, and it is understood that the cost of this haul is to be included in the contract or schedule price and also the cost of any trestle work that may be required to deposit it, and in no case will the contractor be allowed to borrow without the consent in writing of the engineer.\n32. Roads constructed to and from any point on the line of railway for the convenience of the contractor for the conveyance of the material or otherwise must be at his own risk cost and charges but the company will provide the necessary land for the right of way and borrow pits.\nThe necessary land for borrow pits in this clause mentioned are plainly, as it appears to me, places where by the consent in writing of the engineer given under clause 22 the contractor has been allowed to borrow earth. It is not suggested that the place in question was such a place or that in point of fact the contractor had any actual authority whatever from the defendants to take earth from the place under consideration. Upon no principle of law can the defendants be made responsible for independent tortious acts of the con tractor * for his acts if tortious to the plaintiff the con tractor himself alone must be responsable. Appeal dismissed with costs.\nSEDGEWICK J.\u2014I am of opinion that this appeal should be dismissed both on the ground of prescription and on the ground that the company is not liable for the wrongful act of the contractor.\nKING J. I concur in the judgment of Mr. Justice Gwynne.\nGIROUARD J.\u2014I agree with Mr. Justice Taschereau that the plaintiff's action was prescribed. The appeal must fail also on the ground taken by Mr. Justice Gwynne.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant : Taylor & Buchan.\nSolicitors for the respondent : Abbotts, Campbell & Meredith.\n[1] 14 App. Cas. 612.\n[2] 25 L.

Danjou v. Marquis-(3 Can. S. C. R. 251) and McDonald v. Abbott (3 Can. S. C. R. 278) followed.\nMOTION to quash for want of jurisdiction, an appeal from the Superior Court for Lower Canada sitting in review at Montreal.\nBy R. S. C. ch. 135 an appeal would lie to the Supreme Court from the decision of the court of final resort in the province only such court, in the province of Quebec, being the Court of Queen's Bench. By 54 & 55 Vic. ch. 25, an appeal was granted from the Superior Court in Review in cases where, and so long as, no appeal lies from the judgment of that court when it confirms the judgment rendered in the court appealed from which by the law of the province of Quebec are appealable to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council.\nIn this case the appellants, Barrington and others petitioned the Superior Court for a writ of mandamus to compel the City of Montreal to proceed with certain works on the streets of the city under the provisions of a statute of the province. The Superior Court ordered a peremptory writ of mandamus to issue and, the Court of Review, on appeal by the city, reversed the judgment of the Superior Court and set aside the order for the writ. The petitioners then took an appeal to the Supreme Court from the decision of the Court of Review.\nThe respondent's factum did not raise the question of jurisdiction but on the appeal being called for hearing:\nEthier Q.C. moved to quash the appeal.\nThis case is not within 54 & 55 Vic. ch. 25. The judgment of the Superior Court was not affirmed and an appeal could have been taken to the Court of Queen's Bench. It is therefore governed by Danjou v. Marquis ([1]), and Mac Donald v. Abbott ([2]).\nWeir for the appellant contra. The cases cited were determined under the provisions of R. S. C. oh. 135 but the law has been since altered and appeals from the Court of Review are now allowed This case is within the terms of the present Act.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by :\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE (Oral) It is quite clear that we have no jurisdiction to entertain this appeal. The case of Danjou v. Marquis (1), expressly decided that an appeal did not formerly lie to this court from a decision of the Court of Review that court not being the court of last resort in the province. By 54 & 55 Vie. ch. 25, passed since the decision in Danjou v. Marquis (1), an appeal is allowed from decisions of the Court of Review in certain cases but that statute does not apply to the case before us; it only provides for such appeals when the judgment of the court of first instance has been affirmed, and no appeal lies to the Queen's Bench. Here, the judgment of the Superior Court has been reversed by the Court of Review, and there was nothing to prevent the appellant from appealing to the Court of Queen's Bench.\nThe case cited and that of MacDonald v. Abbott ([3]), which follows it, govern the case before us and the appeal must, therefore, be quashed.\nAppeal quashed without costs\nSolicitors for the appellants : Weir & Hibbard.\nSolicitors for the respondent : Roy & Ethier\n[1] 3 Can.

(Plaintiff) Respondent.\n1895: October 16, 17; 1895: December 9.\nPresent: Taschereau, Gwynne, Sedgewick, King and Girouard JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.\nRailway company\u2014Loan of cars\u2014Reasonable care\u2014Breach of duty\u2014Negligence\u2014Risk voluntarily incurred\u2014\u201cVolenti non fit injuria.\u201d\nA lumber company had railway sidings laid in their yard for convenience in shipping lumber, over the line of railway with which the switches connected, and followed the practice of pointing out to the railway company the loaded cars to be removed, the railway company thereupon sending their locomotive and crew to the respective sidings in the lumber yard and bringing away the cars to be despatched from their depot as directed by the bills of lading.\nHeld, that in the absence of any special agreement to such effect, the railway company\u2019s servants while so engaged were not the employees of the lumber company, and that the railway company remained liable for the conduct of the persons in charge of the locomotive used in the moving of the cars; and that where the lumber company\u2019s employees remained in a car lawfully pursuing their occupation there, the persons in charge of the locomotive owed them the duty of using reasonable skill and care in moving the car with them in it, so as to avoid all risk of injury to them.\nOn the trial of an action for damages in consequence of an employee of the lumber company being killed in a loaded car which was being shunted the jury had found that \u201cthe deceased voluntarily accepted the risks of shunting\u201d and that the death of the deceased was caused by defendant\u2019s negligence in the shunting, in giving the car too strong a push.\nHeld, that the verdict meant only that deceased had voluntarily incurred the risks attending the shunting of the cars in a careful and skilful manner, and that the maxim \u201cvolenti non fit injuria\u201d had no application. Smith v. Baker ([1891], A.C., 325), applied. APPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1], affirming the judgment of the Queen\u2019s Bench Divisional Court[2], in favour of the plaintiff.\nThe plaintiff sued, as administrator of the estate of Thomas F. Hurdman, who was killed on the 30th December, 1892, under the following circumstances:\nThe deceased was employed by the Shepard & Morse Lumber Co., proprietors of a yard for piling and sorting lumber, about two miles from the Canada Atlantic Station at Ottawa.\nThe railway company had lent rails to the lumber company, which had constructed switches and sidings upon their own property, separated from the defendants right-of-way by a fence, and closed by a gate under the control of the lumber company.\nThe mode of doing business between the companies was that the lumber company made out and presented the bills of lading from their Ottawa office to the railway company at the station in Ottawa, and freight was paid by the lumber company from Ottawa to the point of destination, but, as a matter of convenience to the lumber company, the railway company gratuitously hauled empty cars from Ottawa to the yard to be loaded, and brought them away when loaded. At the outset, the lumber company sorted the cars and collected them for the railway company by means of horses, as they objected to allow locomotives inside their yard, but afterwards, without any special arrangement, the practice changed, and the railway company, at the request of the lumber company, sent their engine and force of yardmen into the lumber company\u2019s yard, to do the sorting and moving of cars.\nOn the 30th December, 1892, the railway company, at the request of the lumber company, sent an engine and a working force of four men, to leave empty cars and bring away the cars shipped, and also to bring away any other cars pointed out by the lumber company, even though not billed or shipped, and to do the shunting in the yard required for the purpose of sorting and arranging the cars. The car in which the deceased was killed was not yet shipped or billed, but the yard-master of the railway company was requested to shunt and bring it away to Ottawa, to be subsequently billed. This was a closed or box car filled to the roof with lumber, and when coupled for the purpose of placing it on another siding was still in the possession and under the control of the lumber company. The counting of the lumber was not completed, and the deceased and another employee of the lumber company were in the car counting the lumber, in a narrow space across the middle of the car from one door to the other. The yard\u2011master waited for them to finish and get out of the car, but they told him not to wait, saying that it was all right; that they would soon finish counting and look out for themselves.\nThis car was then coupled to the train, shunted several times, and finally dropped or allowed to run down into another siding, when it collided with cars standing on that siding with sufficient force to cause the lumber in the car to be moved, and deceased was fatally injured.\nIt appeared that this mode of shunting was in common use on railways.\nThe jury answered the first three questions submitted to the effect that there had been negligence in the management of the car, in giving the car too strong a push, and that they believed the accident was the result of such negligence. The fourth question and the answer of the jury thereto were as follows: 4. Q. Did the deceased, knowing the danger, voluntarily accept the risks of shunting? A. The deceased voluntarily accepted the risks of shunting.\nOn the finding of the jury a verdict was entered for plaintiff which was affirmed by the Divisional Court and the Court of Appeal.\nChrysler Q.C. and Nesbitt for appellant: There is no evidence of negligence. The immediate cause of the death was the shifting of the lumber in the car, not the impulse given to the car. Callender v. Carleton Iron Co.[3]\nDeceased was not killed by the negligence of any persons who were at the time, and under the circumstances, the servants of the company.\nMurray v. Currie[4]; Murphy v. Caralli[5]; Rourke v. White Moss Colliery Co.[6]; Donovan v. Laing Syndicate[7].\nThe conveying of deceased in the car was not assented to by the defendants and must be presumed to have been at the request and for the purposes of the lumber company, and at their risk. Deceased placed himself upon the train voluntarily, and was not lawfully there at the time of the accident. Sheerman v. The Toronto &c. Railway Co.[8]; Graham v. The Toronto &c. Railway Co.[9]; Blackmore v.Toronto Street Railway Co.[10]\nThe jury having found that deceased voluntarily incurred the risk of shunting, the plaintiff cannot recover. Volenti non fit injuria. Thomas v. Quartermaine[11]; Thrussell v. Handyside[12].\nSee also Moffat v. Bateman[13]; Smith v. Baker[14].\nIf a man rides on a freight train as a matter of convenience to himself, the railway company receiving no reward, and is told there is danger, but ageees to take his chances, and the car being put in too rapid motion, he is hurt, could he recover? That is the neat question here. Gallia v. London and North Western Ry. Co.[15] The jury has found, for the purposes of this case, the very facts above stated.\nMcCarthy Q.C. and Blanchet for the respondent.\nThe jury found that the death of the deceased was the result of the appellants\u2019 negligence. The deceased did not voluntarily accept the risks arising from the negligence. If the deceased assumed the ordinary risk of shunting, when performed with reasonable care, his undertaking was with the lumber company in whose service he was, but appellants seek to use it to shelter themselves from the consequences of negligence established against them. There was no undertaking between the deceased and appellants. From the time the negligent act was committed deceased was physically restrained from saving himself; he was compelled to remain on the car.\nThe doctrine of volenti non fit injuria does not apply in cases where negligence has been proven and found by the jury, and the deceased was not volens within the legal meaning of the maxim. It was necessary for defendants to prove not only that deceased had agreed to accept the risk, but also that he agreed to waive all recourse for consequent injury. Smith v. Baker[16]; Osborne v. London and North-Western Railway Co.[17]; Brown v. Leclerc[18]; Thrussell v. Handyside[19]; Town of Prescott v. Connell[20]; Heaven v. Pender[21]; Pollock on Torts[22].\nThere was no loan of the engine by the appellants to the lumber company, and the appellants did not cease to have control over the conductor, engine driver, fireman and brakeman employed by them while shunting. They continued to remain their servants handling their own engine and cars. The appellants could have dismissed or withdrawn from the work the men controlling the engine at any time, which the lumber company could not have done, and this is the test for the purpose of determining whose servants they were at the time the accident occurred. See Cameron, v. Nystrom[23]; Johnson v. Lindsay[24]; Jones v. Liverpool[25]; Oldfield v. Furness[26].\nTASCHEREAU, SEDGEWICK and GIROUARD JJ. were of opinion that the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014This action was brought by the administrator of a deceased person against the defendants to recover damages from them for the death of the deceased, caused, as is alleged, by the negligence of the defendants and their servants.\nIn the statement of claim it is alleged that the deceased was a clerk in the employment of a company called the Shepherd & Morse Lumber Company, at their lumber yard adjoining the line of the defendants\u2019 railway near the city of Ottawa, his duty being to count the lumber placed by the Shepherd & Morse Co. in the care of the defendants for carriage on their railway; that in the lumber yard there were a number of switches connected with the defendants\u2019 line of railway, and that upon the day in question certain cars, the property of the defendants, were upon the said switches for the purpose of being loaded with lumber; that while the deceased was lawfully in one of the said cars, counting the lumber therein for his employers, certain servants of the defendants who were in charge of and operating a locomotive of the defendants for the purpose of moving the cars in the said lumber yard when loaded with lumber, proceeded to move the car in which the deceased was so lawfully employed as aforesaid from the switch or siding upon (which it was and to place it upon another switch or siding where other cars were, and that the defendants\u2019 servants in charge of the said locomotive so carelessly and negligently shunted and removed the car in which the deceased so was, that by reason of such negligence of the defendants\u2019 servants the said car was made to collide with such force and violence with other cars upon the switch into which the car in which the deceased was so as aforesaid was shunted, that the deceased was thereby killed; and that the collision so causing his death was caused by the careless and negligent handling by the defendants and their servants of the said cars, and the careless and negligent coupling of the same and by the negligent and wrongful acts of the defendants and their servants in having shunted or kicked the said car in which the deceased was with greater force and violence than was necessary and in not having applied the breaks of the said car in time to prevent the said collision. To this statement of claim the defendants pleaded in substance that they were not liable. The learned judge before whom the case was tried with a jury submitted certain questions to the jury which they answered as follows:\n1. That there was negligence in the management of the car in question.\n2. In giving the car too strong a push.\n3. We believe the accident was the result of the negligence aforesaid.\nThe fourth question put to them was\u2014\nDid the deceased knowing the danger voluntarily accept the risk of shunting? To which they replied\u2014\nThe deceased voluntarily accepted the risk of shunting.\nThe parties came to an agreement that if the plaintiff was entitled to judgment upon these findings the damages for which such judgment should be entered should be $750. The learned judge who tried the case thereupon entered judgment for the plaintiff which judgment has been maintained by the Court of Appeal for Ontario.\nIn this appeal from that judgment the learned counsel for the appellants contended that judgment of non-suit should have been entered as had been moved upon the part of the defendants in the courts below, or that judgment should be entered for the defendants upon the above answer of the jury to the fourth question submitted to them. His contention in support of the non-suit was:\n1. That the deceased was not killed by the negligence of any persons who were at the time and under the circumstances the servants of the defendants.\n2. That there was no evidence to go to the jury establishing negligence conducive to the accident.\n3. That under the circumstances in evidence it did not appear that the defendants or the persons in charge of the locomotive owed any duty to the deceased and so that the defendants could not be guilty of negligence in the performance of any duty owed to him.\nAnd as to the judgment for the defendants upon the answer of the jury to the fourth question it was contended that this finding of the jury entitled the defendants to the benefit of the principle volenti non fit injuria.\nNow as to the contention that the persons whose negligence is alleged to have caused the death of the deceased were not, at the time of the occurrence of the accident which caused the death, the servants of the defendants and in their employment, but were then in the employment of, and the servants of, and under the control of, the Shepherd & Morse Lumber Company, the facts are these: This lumber company have a lumber yard alongside of the main track of the defendants\u2019 railway, from which latter into the lumber yard there are several switches or sidings for the convenience of the shipping of lumber by the defendants\u2019 railway. Formerly the practice had been for the lumber company to draw the lumber from their yard by horses on to the railway of the defendants, to be by them conveyed to the destination indicated by the lumber company. A different practice was introduced as being doubtless more convenient for both the lumber company and the defendants; no agreement as to the matter was proved to have been entered into, but the practice was as follows: The defendants supplied cars as required to the lumber company to be loaded; when loaded the lumber company sent a list to the defendants of cars which they had loaded and ready for removal, whereupon the defendants sent their servants to the lumber yard with a locomotive for the removal of the loaded cars from the respective sidings in the lumber yard upon which they were and to bring them into the defendants\u2019 station at Ottawa, whence they were despatched as directed by bills of lading signed by and on behalf of the lumber company. Upon the evening preceding the day on which the fatal accident occurred the lumber company sent to the defendants a list of cars which they had in the yard loaded and ready for removal. The car in which the deceased was when killed was not one of the cars upon that list, but on the following day the defendants\u2019 servants in charge of a locomotive sent for the purpose of removing the cars on the list took this car also, as it was loaded while they were in the yard upon such employment. There was not a particle of evidence that there was any agreement between the defendants and the lumber company that the defendants\u2019 servants while employed with the locomotive in removing the cars from the lumber yard should be the servants of the lumber company, and under their control, nor was there anything in the evidence from which it could reasonably be inferred that the defendants\u2019 servants so employed were in truth the servants of the lumber company and under their control; or that the lumber company ever assumed to exercise any control whatever over the defendants\u2019 servants in the use of the locomotive and the removal of the cars; all that was suggested was that the servants of the lumber company pointed out to the defendants where the cars stood which were to be removed. In short, there was nothing whatever in the evidence to indicate that the defendants\u2019 servants in removing the loaded cars on to the track of the defendants were acting otherwise than in the employment of, and as the servants of, and for the benefit of, the defendants; and so the contention before us that the servants of the defendants when in charge of the locomotive moving the loaded cars from the yard of the lumber company to the railway of the defendants, were while so engaged the servants of the lumber company and in their employment and under their sole control, and were not the servants of the defendants, or in their employment, cannot be maintained; none of the cases cited support that contention. Then as to the contentions that there was no evidence to go to the jury of negligence, assuming the deceased to have been a person to whom under the circumstances in evidence any duty was due, and that the defendants did not owe to him any duty even though the persons in charge of the locomotive should be regarded as the servants of the defendants and in their employment and under their control. The circumstances upon which this question as to owing a duty to the deceased depends are these: One Clarke, who was in charge of the locomotive, and of the engineer, fireman and brakesman employed in working it, says that after he had coupled the car in which the deceased was to the locomotive he stood for the space of about half a minute by the car in which the deceased and another young man, servants of the lumber company, were employed in counting the lumber, and that the young man, whose name is Ashler\nlooked out and wanted to know if I was waiting for them and I says, yes, and then he said go on with your work we are all right.\nYoung Ashler gave similar evidence. He says \u201cClarke wanted to know if we wanted him to wait,\u201d and being asked if he told him not to wait he answered \u201cyes,\u201d and being asked if the deceased told him to say not to wait he answered \u201cyes.\u201d Thereupon Clarke, without giving any notice to the engineer that the young men were on the car, gave to him a signal to proceed which he accordingly did, and after shunting about, moving loaded cars from one switch in the yard to another, collecting the cars to be removed, finally shunted the car in which the young men were upon a down grade with such force that the car in which the young men were came into violent collision with another car, and by such collision and the displacement of the lumber in the car in which the young were the deceased was killed. Now assuming the defendants to be answerable for the conduct of the persons in charge of the locomotive used in moving the car, and that the deceased was in the position of a person to whom the defendants owed the duty of moving the car with all due care and skill, there cannot be a doubt that upon the evidence given the case could not have been withdrawn from the jury, and they have found that the death of the deceased was caused by negligence in the car having been given too great a push. There was evidence to the effect that the push given to it was too strong and altogether unnecessary for the purpose of attaining the object in view; and, indeed there was besides evidence of negligence in other respects, namely, in not notifying the engineer that the young men were in the car and in not having brakesmen upon it.\nNow, Clarke having taken the car and removed it with the young men in it lawfully pursuing their business in the service of their employers counting the lumber, there cannot, I think, be entertained a doubt that under such circumstances Clarke owed to the young men the duty of taking care that the car should be moved with the utmost skill and care so as to avoid all risk of any injury occurring to them. This proposition appears to me so free from doubt that I cannot think it necessary to seek for an authority to maintain it. In Heaven v. Pender[27], a question arose as to whether a dock owner who had received into his dock a vessel to be repaired and painted by its owner owed any duty to a painter employed by the owner of the vessel to paint so as to be subject to an action at suit of the painter for negligence in a staging, upon which the painter had to stand when painting the vessel, not being sufficiently secure, whereby the painter fell and sustained injuries, and it was held by the Court of Appeal, reversing the judgment of the Queen\u2019s Division, that the dock owner did owe a duty to the painter, and the action was sustained.\nLord Esher, Master of the Bolls, giving his judgment in that case, says: The questions we have to solve in this case are: What is the proper definition of the relation between two persons, other than the relation established by contract or fraud, which imposes on the one of them a duty towards the other to observe with regard to the person or property of each other such ordinary care or skill as may be necessary to prevent injury to his person or property, and whether the present case falls within such definition?\nHe then proceeds to discuss several cases in illustration of the proposition he enunciates, and then adds:\nThe proposition which these recognized cases suggest, and which is therefore to be deduced from them is, that whenever one person is by circumstances placed in such a position with regard to another, that every one of ordinary sense who did think, would at once recognize that if he did not use ordinary care and skill in his own conduct with regard to those circumstances he would cause danger of injury to the person or property of the other, a duty arises to use ordinary care and skill to avoid such danger.\nThen he adds:\nWithout displacing the other propositions to which allusion has been made as applicable to the particular circumstances in respect of which they have been enunciated, this proposition includes, I think, all the recognized cases of liability. It is the only proposition which covers them all.\nHe then proceeds to criticise Langridge v. Levy[28]; George v. Skivington[29]; Corby v. Hill[30]; Smith v. London and St. Katharine Docks Co.[31]; Indermaur v. Dames[32]; Winterbottom v. Wright[33]; the judgment of Cleasby B. in Francis v. Cockrell[34]; and he concludes that the true principle upon which every one of these cases can be rested is that embodied in the above proposition as enunciated by him.\nNow although Lords Justices Cotton and Bowen declined to concur in the applicability of the rule as enunciated by him to the several cases which he had criticised and to which he had applied it they do not dissent from its applicability to the circumstances of that case of Heaven v. Pender[35]; and this appears from the judgment of the court in LeLievre v. Gould[36]. There the judgment in Heaven v. Pender35 was attempted to be applied by counsel to a case to which it never was intended to apply and to which it had no application. There mortgagees of the interest of a builder under a building agreement advanced money to him from time to time on the faith of certificates given by a surveyor that certain specified stages had been reached; certain untrue statements had been made but without any fraud; in some of the certificates the mortgagees advanced monies to their prejudice; and it was sought to make the surveyor responsible to the mortgagees for negligence in the giving of the certificates which was contended to be in breach of a duty the surveyor owed to them; but Lord Esher, Master of the Rolls, there says:\nThe case of Heaven v. Pender35 has no bearing upon the present question. That case established that under certain circumstances one man may owe a duty to another even though there is no contract between them. If one man is near to another or is near to the property of another a duty lies upon him not to do that which may cause a personal injury to that other or may injure his property.\nAnd Bowen L.J. says:\nIs there any duty known to the law in such a case as the present? It is said that Heaven v. Pender35 and cases of that class show that the defendant had a duty to the plaintiff. It is idle to refer to cases which were decided under totally different aspects and upon totally different considerations of the law.\nAnd A.L. Smith L.J. says[37]:\nThe decision in Heaven v. Pender35 was founded upon the principle that a duty to take due care did arise when the person or property of one was in such proximity to the person or property of another, that if due care was not taken damage might be done by the one to the other. The judgment of the Court of Appeal in Hearen v. Pender35 and the principle upon which it proceeded as enunciated by the Master of the Rolls, affirmed as that principle has been in Leli\u00e8vre v. Gould[38], is a conclusive authority that in the present case, that principle is conclusive in favour of the plaintiff, if authority were necessary, that the servants of the defendants in taking the car in which the deceased, as appears in evidence, was, owed a duty to him to take care that the car should be moved with all necessary care and skill, the breach of which duty would constitute actionable negligence, from responsibility for which in the present case the defendants cannot escape unless their last contention can be adjudged in their favour, namely, that upon the answer of the jury to the fourth question submitted to them they are entitled to have judgment entered for them. The law, as now settled by the judgment of the House of Lords in Smith v. Baker[39], is that the maxim volenti non fit injuria has no application in the case of injuries occasioned by the negligent conduct of the defendants. It is unnecessary to inquire whether the very trifling evidence of consent, as extracted above, justified the finding of the jury that \u201cthe deceased voluntarily accepted the risks of shunting,\u201d but in view of the nature of that evidence, coupled with the finding of the jury that the death of the deceased was caused by negligence in the shunting, namely, in giving too strong a push to the car in which the deceased was, it is impossible to construe the finding of the jury in answer to the fourth question in any other way than that the deceased voluntarily incurred the risks attending the shunting of the cars in a careful and skilful manner. To construe the finding as that the deceased voluntarily incurred the risks of shunting however improperly, carelessly and negligently conducted would be utterly at variance with the evidence, with the plainest principles of common sense and with the principle as now firmly established by the judgment of the House of Lords as to the application of the maxim volenti non fit injuria; and as the jury have found that the death of the deceased was due to the negligence of the defendants in shunting the car in which the deceased was in a careless and negligent manner by giving to the car in which the deceased was a stronger push than was necessary, the verdict and judgment for the plaintiff must stand and the appeal must be dismissed with costs.\nKING J.\u2014It seems very clear that the operation of shunting the cars which occasioned the injury was directly under the control of the railway company\u2019s servants. For their own, as well as for the lumber company\u2019s purposes, in order to facilitate the carrying on of mutually advantageous business, the railway company sent their engines under the control of their own servants upon the lumber company\u2019s premises to take out such cars as the latter company might indicate, in order to their being put in course of transportation by the railway company. There is no reason at all for concluding that there was a loan by the railway company of its servants to the lumber company.\nIt seems also clear that the deceased was rightfully in the car. He was doing the work of his employers, the lumber company, counting and tallying the lumber which they had put in the car. It is said that the work of counting was finished before the accident took place. Asher, the fellow servant with deceased in the car, says that he himself had finished his count. Of the deceased, he does not seem sure: \u201cI guess he had finished it; but he had not finished his work on the tallies.\u201d This latter was incidental to the work of counting, and even although it might have been done afterwards the remaining in the car to finish it can not render his being there wrongful.\nThen it is said that (apart from any question as to deceased being volens) the defendants owed to the deceased no duty or care, or at most only that of abstaining from reckless or wanton conduct. But when, for their own purposes, they chose to move the loaded car with the lumber company\u2019s servants in it, they owed to them a duty to exercise reasonable care to prevent injury to them. Such a duty is independent of contract. Foulkes v. Metropolitan District Railway Co.[40]; Sewell v. British Columbia Towing Co.[41]; Meux v. Great Eastern Railway Co.[42]\nA duty to exercise reasonable care arises in the use of things dangerous to life, and the evidence clearly shows that the operation in question was dangerous to persons in the car.\nThe jury have found that there was a want of reasonable care in giving the car too strong a push. It is argued that there was no evidence of this. But a rate of speed was testified to which (although denied) was shewn to be excessive, and which, if it existed, was caused directly by the act of defendants\u2019 servants.\nThere was also evidence that as a result of the concussion the end of the car was bulged out by the shifting lumber. This also was some proof of excessive force.\nThen we come to what is really the most material point, viz: the effect of the finding of the jury that the deceased, knowing the danger, voluntarily accepted the risks of shunting. But what is meant by the \u201crisks of shunting\u201d? Prim\u00e2 facie, the risks ordinarily incident to the operation when performed with reasonable care and skill. The defendants, however, say that the question (as left and as passed upon) covered as well risks arising through want of reasonable care and skill in the operation. Undoubtedly they are entitled to rely upon any observations of the learned judge in his charge to the jury in explanation of the question submitted. And the learned judge said:\nDid the deceased, knowing the danger, voluntarily accept the risks of shunting? As I understand that, what are you asked to consider in regard to that is this, that the young man placed himself between these boards when he knew the car was to be put in motion, and did he apprehend, did he know, that there was danger, that he was in a position of peril from the liability of the car being put in too rapid motion, and that the result of the rapid motion would be in the concussion to cause the lumber to go together and so injure him and destroy his life? Did he, knowing nothing of the danger, having it before his mind, knowing the conditions which existed, voluntarily place himself in a position of danger and run the chances of the car being run too rapidly, of there being a concussion, of the lumber coming together and of the result which happened? Did he, knowing the danger, voluntarily accept the risk of shunting? If you think that he, knowing the danger that would arise from too rapid shunting of the car from a collision, from the moving of the lumber, knowing of that danger, voluntarily, of his own will accept the risks in staying in the car while the car was being shifted, then you will say yes. If you think he did not, then you will say no.\nThe learned judge himself thinks that the question did not cover the risks of negligence, and the several courts through which the case has passed are of the like opinion.\nNow the operation of shunting a car, loaded as was this, was intrinsically dangerous to any one inside the car, that is to say, it was intrinsically dangerous notwithstanding the exercise of reasonable care and skill in the doing of it. Such inherent dangers were voluntarily assumed by the deceased. Is it found that he assumed further risks? The learned counsel for de- fendants argue that it is because the learned judge pointed out, as an example of the risks, that of the car being run too rapidly, and it is argued that this implies negligence. But this is not necessarily so. A too rapid motion of the car might well happen notwithstanding the exercise of reasonable care. Where it is sought to put the deceased in the position of a consenting party to the omission of reasonable care in the doing of an act which, with reasonable care, was sufficiently dangerous, it ought to be presented clearly to the jury so that they might distinguish in their minds between the taking of risks ordinarily incident to a dangerous operation, and the taking of the added risks arising from want of reasonable care and skill.\nSuch a presentation was not made, and so the defendants cannot treat the finding as conclusively covering risks arising from their own want of reasonable care.\nThe defendants\u2019 counsel distinctly disclaimed any desire to seek a new trial (probably in view of the moderate damages assessed upon the present trial), and hence the expediency of seeking a more explicit finding upon the point was not presented.\nNor do I think that much would be gained by a new trial, for, from the simple facts of deceased\u2019s knowledge of the danger inherent in shunting, and that, in reply to an inquiry of defendants\u2019 servant having charge of the operation, as to whether the deceased wanted him to wait until the counting was finished, the deceased said to him not to wait, I think that a jury would hesitate very much before inferring that he foresaw and fully appreciated the risk of accident from the want of reasonable care, and voluntarily assumed to take such risks upon himself.\nFor these reasons, which do not differ from those presented by the learned judges who have heretofore had to deal with the matter, I think that the appeal should be dismissed.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Chrysler & Lewis.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Kidd, Blanchet & Jones.\n[1] 22 Ont.

C. P.\nA partner in a commercial firm which made a \"judicial abandonment was indebted to the firm at the time of the abandonment in a large amount overdrawn upon his personal account. Subsequently he made and carried out a composition with the creditors of the firm and with the approval of the court the curator transferred to him, by an assignment in authentic form, \"all the assets and estate generally of the said late firm,\" \" as they existed at the time the said curator was appointed.\" At the same time the creditors discharged both him and his partners from all liability in respect of the partnership.\nHeld, affirming the decision of the court below that the effect of the judicial abandonment was to transfer to the curator not only the partnership estate, but also the separate estate of each partner as well as the partners' individual rights as between themselves.\nHeld, reversing the decision of the court below, the Chief Justice and Taschereau J. dissenting, that the assignment of the estate by the curator and the discharge by the creditors, taken together, had the effect of releasing all the partners from the firm debts, but vested all the rights which had been transferred by the abandonment in the transferee personally and could not revive the individual rights of the partners as between themselves, and that, in consequence, any debt owing by the transferee to the partnership at the time of the abandonment became extinguished by confusion.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of Queen's Bench, for Lower Canada ([1]), affirming a judgment of the Superior Court ([2]) which condemned the defendant to pay to the plaintiff $10,261.08, part of the sum contributed by the plaintiff towards the capital of a commercial partnership formerly existing between them and one J. H. Smith which had terminated upon their making a judicial abandonment for the benefit of the firm's creditors.\nThe following statement of the case is taken from judgment of Mr. Justice Sedgewick.\nOn the 31st December, 1886, John MacLean, the defendant and appellant, Alexander Stewart, the plaintiff, and James Hardisty Smith, mis en cause, entered into partnership, MacLean's contribution to the capital being $4,480.91, Stewart's $25,222.47, Smith's $303550.96. Before the expiration of the term of five years, viz., on the 22nd July, 1891, the partnership was dissolved by a judicial abandonment which the partners made at the demand of their creditors. At the time of the abandonment, according to the partnership books, there stood to the credit of Stewart's capital $17,185.22, to the credit of Smith's capital $27,379.44, and to the debit of MacLean's $29,079.31.\nAlthough the statement prepared at the time of the abandonment showed a surplus of assess over liabilities of about $15000 it is nevertheless admitted that the partnership was wholly insolvent, the plaintiff ,himself testifying that the assets of the estate were not more than enough to pay fifty cents on the dollar. Afterwards an arrangement was come to by which MacLean, with the knowledge and assent of his partners, undertook to pay, and did eventually pay, a composition of fifty cents on the dollar to ordinary creditors, and the full claims of all privileged creditors, in consideration of which the assets of the firm were transferred to him personally, the creditors at the same time discharging both him, and his partners as well from all liability in respect of the partnership. This action is brought by Stewart against MacLean to re cover from him his proportion of the amount appearing in the firm hooks at the time of the abandonment as having been drawn from the firm assets.\nThe action was tried in the Superior Court, and judgment was entered in favour of the plaintiff for $10,261.081\/2, with interest.\nUpon appeal to the Court of Queen's Bench this judgment was sustained.\nBe\u00efque Q.C. and Greenshields Q.C. for the appellant. Respondent's right of action was extinguished as a necessary consequence of the discharge granted to appellant.\nAn abandonment by a commercial firm includes by operation of law, not only the partnership property but also the private property of the partners, and the curator is vested with all the property abandoned, whether disclosed or not disclosed in the inventory. Reid v. Bisset ([3]); Re Macfarlane ([4]); Lewis v. Jeffrey ([5]); Ontario Bank v. Foster ([6]); Bedarride, Fail lites ([7]); C.P.C. arts. 772 & 778; Pardessus, Droit Commercial ([8]).\nBinney v. Mutrie ([9]), is not a case in point. First because there was neither abandonment, or composition, or discharge, and second, because under the English law, unless otherwise provided, only the use of capital is contributed (Lindley on partnership 5 ed. pp. 402 403). whereas under the French law the capital contributed becomes the property of the firm, and on liquidation is treated like any other asset ([10]).\nMacmaster Q.C. for the respondent. The abandonment and the composition effected by the appellant did not extinguish the rights and obligations of the partners between themselves\nThe members of a partnership who obtain a discharge by abandoning partnership assess to creditors may reciprocally exercise their personal recourse in the settlement of partnership accounts between themselves ([11]).\nThere is no subrogation.\nA partner can claim an account and partition from his co-partners. Arts. 1898, 712-727 C.C. In this account and partition each returns to the mass what he has received, the debts are deducted and the balance divided between the partners. Returns are due only from co-heir to co-heir not to legatees nor creditors of succession. Art. 723 C.C. The abandonment absorbed the assets and left nothing available to form the mass, but the drawings of the partners. The partners having been discharged from the partnership debts, the mass must return to them in its entirety; it is then applied towards the payment of the capital which is due to each partner ([12]).\nThe abandonment is not a mode of either extinguishing obligations or releasing from debts except to the extent that they are paid or remitted. The claims of the creditors subsist for the unsatisfied portion of the debts until they release the partners The claims of the creditors against the partners and the claims of the partners inter se are totally distinct and separate. Now the creditors could not release the partners from the claims they might have inter Se. While their assets were in the hands of their creditors these claims of the partners inter se could not be exercised to their prejudice, but once discharged the claims of the partners inter se were untramelled.\nThe conveyance to MacLean was simply a conveyance of the assets of the co-partnership and did not include the assets and liabilities of his co-partners It did not pass the individual estate and rights of each partner and rights cannot be taken away by implication. As regards the creditors the overdraft could not he looked upon as an asset. It added nothing to the rights of the creditors. The overdraft is nothing more or less than a result of the \"keeping of the reckoning \" between the partners. As to the plea of compensation there is no foundation whatever for it. Appellant simply bought the bankrupt estate from the creditors at the rate of fifty cents on the dollar on the amount due to firm creditors. He received money's worth in goods and credits and cash on hand for the amount he paid in the form of composition, and. he cannot make the payment avail in the double capacity of satisfying his obligations to his late partners and purchasing the bankrupt stock.

Bird ([17]).\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014I can see no error in the judgment appealed against; therefore, adopting the reasons assigned by Chief Justice Lacoste in delivering the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench, I am of opinion that this appeal must be dismissed.\nFOURNIER J.\u2014I concur in the judgment prepared by Mr. Justice Sedgewick in this case.\nTASCHEREAU J\u2014I dissent for the reasons stated by Chief Justice Lacoste. This appeal should be dismissed.\nSEDGEWICK J.\u2014His Lordship stated the facts of the case as above set out and proceeded as follows :\u2014 In my view the appeal must be allowed and that upon three grounds which I shall, as briefly as I can, point out.\nI am willing to admit, and it may be taken for granted for my purpose, that had the firm been dissolved in the ordinary way, there having been no judicial abandonment, and had the action been brought for the winding up of the partnership and the distribution of its assets upon the basis of the partnership articles, amongst the different partners, the defendant Stewart would rightly have been called to pay the amount of the judgment recovered in the present action. But in my view the case here presented is a different one calling for the application of different principles. There is no question here as to the legal consequences which follow upon the judicial abandonment by the members of a partnership of the firm assets for the benefit of its creditors. Such an abandonment transfers to the curator not only the estate and rights of action of the partnership but also the estate and rights of action of each member of that partnership. It may be that theoretically the property still remains in the firm or in its several members but all right of action in respect of it passes over exclusively to the curator, their right of action for the time being ceasing. The claim now in suit, if a valid one was a right of action which the plaintiff had against MacLean at the time of the dissolution and passed by virtue of the abandonment and subsequent proceedings to the curator. In my view that right of action so transferred and vested in the curator has never yet been re-transferred to the plaintiff. It went from him by operation of law. it has never been restored either by operation of law or by any act of any person qualified or authorized to make such restoration In the present case the abandoned property was in effect purchased by the defendant MacLean, but assume that no such transaction had taken place and that the insolvent estate had been wound up under the Code by the curator, and distributed by him as therein directed, in that case it could not, I think, be contended that Stewart could proceed by action and recover for his own benefit the amount now in controversy. If MacLean out of his private or separate estate was able to pay that money, the curator and not Stewart would have been entitled to it for distribution among the joint creditors of the firm after the separate creditors of Stewart had first been paid in full. By what act or under what law did this money which otherwise would have belonged to the creditors, become the property of Stewart? Although, it is true, the creditors have discharged Stewart, the consideration for that discharge was not the transfer to him individually or to the firm of his or of the firm's property and right of action. So as far as he was concerned he was discharged but the property and rights which by the abandonment went to the curator still remained outstanding in the curator who alone might sue in respect of them. I am unable to see how the purchase by MacLean on his own account, and (we must assume) with his own money from the curator of the abandoned property could vest in Stewart any right of action. One effect of the abandonment was to dissolve the firm. From that moment the partners became strangers. Their existing liabilities and obligations toward each other doubtless remained unimpaired but each individual had thereafter a right to do business on his own account and for his own benefit without reference to any of his late associates. MacLean, therefore, had as much right to purchase the firm assets as any stranger, and was in no sense acting in the getting back of the estate as an agent or for the benefit of Stewart and its transfer to him, viewed as a transfer simply could not in any way that I can perceive ensure to Stewart's benefit. Indeed, if Stewart's right of action had passed over to the curator it makes no difference whether the curator himself realized the assets and made distribution of their proceeds or whether he sold them; so long as there was no transfer from the curator to the three partners or to himself he had no right of action.\nThe learned Chief Justice of the Queen's Bench while admitting to the fullest extent that the abandonment transferred to the curator not only the firm's rights but the rights of Stewart as well, argues that because there was a composition and discharge, that is to say, because the creditors discharged the members of the partnership in consideration of which MacLean, one of the partners, pledged himself to pay the com position, \" the partners regained the exercise of their personal rights which the abandonment had taken from them.\"\nWith all respect I must differ from this view. There was no composition and discharge in the ordinary sense in the present case so far as Stewart was con cerned. There would have been had each member been discharged; had they each undertaken to pay the composition, and had there been a transfer to the three of the abandoned estate. But here Stewart got his discharge, nothing more. If it gave him the right to recover any private debts of his own to recover the very claim in question, it would, it seems to me, have given him the right in common with his two late associates to recover the debt due the firm a position which is manifestly without foundation. I repeat, the discharge of a debtor under the Code of Civil Procedure operates as a discharge only and does not bring with it, as incidental thereto or otherwise, any right of action which he may have had before abandonment. I am therefore of opinion for this reason that the action should have been dismissed.\nThere is, however, another ground upon which I Think the plaintiff must fail. As already stated, the effect of abandonment by operation of law Was to transfer to the curator all the property and rights of the firm as a firm and of each individual member of it. The transfer from the curator to MacLean was intended to give to MacLean every asset which under the abandonment had become vested in the curator and in my view the transfer of the 6th November, 1891, from the curator to MacLean, gives full effect to that intention. The order of the Superior Court of the 13th October, 1891, authorized the curator \"to transfer the assets and estate generally of the said firm to the said John MacLean,\" and the instrument of transfer purports to transfer and make over unto the said John MacLean \" all the assets and estate generally of the said late firm of John MacLean & Co. as they existed at the time the said curator was appointed.\"\nIt would be unreasonable to suppose that there was an intention, either on the part of the court authorizing the transfer or on the part of the parties themselves, That while what might be termed the partnership assess were to be affected the individual assets of the partners were still to remain outstanding in the curator, and it is doing no violence to the language of the instrument to hold that the expression \" all the assets and estate generally of the said late firm of John MacLean & Co. as they existed at the time the said curator was appointed,\" included the separate estate of the individual partners, as well as the joint estate of the partnership itself. That, I think, is the proper construction to give the instrument. It would follow therefore, that inasmuch as the claim now sued on was a right of action which Stewart had at the time of the abandonment, it was a right of action which became vested in MacLean by virtue of the transfer. It maybe and the learned Chief Justice throws out a suggestion to that effect, that the rights of the partners inter se were not clearly and distinctly in contemplation when the final arrangements were being made. It is clear, however, to my mind that MacLean, in offering to pay a composition to his creditors, never contemplated that he would be obliged to pay in full any indebtedness from himself to his co-partners. If such had been the intention there should have been a clear indication of it in the instrument itself.\nThere is a further ground which, in my view, necessitates the allowance of this appeal. As I have already stated MacLean, as the purchaser of the firm assets as between himself and Stewart, must be deemed to be a stranger. Supposing a real stranger, one who had never had any relations whatever with the firm had purchased the estate and paid off, whether by a composition or in full, the claims of every creditor, he would thereupon as a result become possessed of all the rights of such creditors, as well as of the curator himself. In other words he would become subrogated to their rights. In my view MacLean occupies exactly the same position. Having liquidated all the partnership debts with his own moneys the debts which before were due from the firm to the creditors became due to him personally. So far as Stewart is concerned it makes no difference whether MacLean paid fifty or one hundred cents on the dollar. Maclean becomes in effect a creditor of the firm, not for the amount of the composition paid by him, but for the full amount of the indebtedness which that composition represented. The evidence does not, I think, show the exact amount of money which as a matter of fact MacLean did pay. It does show, however, that the firm's direct and indidirect liabilities on June 30, 1891, were $281,266.41, of which the direct liabilities amounted to $164,935.91. Assuming this statement to be correct, and that he paid off this latter sum (which he in some way must have done), he would be deemed a creditor of the firm for that sum, and not, as I have already stated, for the amount he paid in liquidation of it. Now when this action was brought MacLean had either paid, or was under an obligation to pay, that indebtedness. And when Stewart, in this action, said in effect to him :\nYou MacLean, at the time of the dissolution of the firm had not only withdrawn from it your original capital, but $29,079.31 as well pay me my proportion of that overdraft\nMacLean had a right to reply, as he has in effect replied '.\nIt is true that I had overdrawn to the extent you mention at the' time of the dissolution, hut since that date I have refunded it five times over. I have paid out of my own pocket (it does not concern you how) $164,935.91 to the creditors of the firm, and if there is to be litigation between us it is from you and not from me that payment is to come.\nStewart may reply, and does reply :\nYes, but for that payment you got in consideration the assess of the firm. \"Assets,\" you admit in reply, \"representing in value only fifty per cent of the liabilities. I have more right to hold you responsible for your proportion of the difference between the value of these assess and the amount of the debts I have paid than you have to call upon me for a dollar.\nThis supposed conversation, I think, correctly represents the legal position of the parties, and it shows at least that the state of the accounts, as they appeared from the partnership books, affords no indication as to the rights of the parties as they existed when Maclean got his transfer and paid off the partnership debts. It further gives strong force to the argument of appellant's counsel that the action was wrongly brought and that the procedure prescribed by article 1898 of the Code should have been followed. On the whole, I am of opinion that the appeal must be allowed and the action dismissed, the appellant to have costs in all the courts.\nKING J.\u2014I am of opinion that this appeal should be allowed with costs, and the action dismissed with costs in the Superior Court.\nAppeal allowed with costs and action in Superior Court dismissed with costs to appellant in all courts.\nSolicitors for the appellant : Atwaler & Mackie.\nSolicitors for the respondent : Macmaster & Maclennan.\n[1] Q.

The council of Yorkville entered with the leave of the owner, who waived the formality of a by-law; they were not compelled to take proceedings in invitum, nor to pass a by-law to justify this entry, but by taking and using the land for a sewer they became established in their rights as long as they chose to remain.\nThe interest of the municipality was a legal right not necessary to be evidenced by an \u201cinstrument,\u201d and not in fact evidenced by an \u201cinstrument\u201d capable of registration, and was therefore not within the registry laws. Israel v. Leith[2]. The case of Ross v. Hunter[3], is thus not in point.\nBoth the Municipal Act and the Registry Act 56 Vic. ch. 21, sec. 83, require the registration of by-laws affecting highways, but leave others untouched.\nIt is clear that there may be interests valid without registration. McMaster v. Phipps[4]; Harrison v. Armour[5]; White v. NeayIon[6].\nHaving with the license of the owner entered for the very purpose of expending money in lasting works, and expended it, the license originally given could not and cannot be revoked without notice to the licensee, and compensation for the expenditure. A parol license executed, is in a different position from a parol license for a recurring act or a series of acts. Liggins v. Inge[7]; Winter v. Brockwell[8]; Plimmer v. Mayor of Wellington[9]. An executed license cannot be revoked at will: Wallis v. Harrison[10]; Ramsden v. Dyson[11].\nMoss Q.C. and W.D. Macpherson, for respondent. Whatever may have been the circumstances attending the construction of the sewer many years ago there is not now, and has not been for many years, anything to show that the sewer had been made use of nor in any way to indicate the presence of the sewer in or on the premises. No by-law was passed in reference to the sewer nor was any grant of the land for the purpose made. The respondent was and is a bon\u00e2 fide purchaser for value without notice or knowledge of the sewer referred to. He first became aware of its presence when the city\u2019s employees entered upon his land and were digging it up in order to get at and repair the sewer. He protested and upon their refusal to discontinue the present action was brought.\nAs there appears to have been no conveyance what the former owner gave the corporation amounted in law to a mere license to construct and maintain this sewer through his land during his life at the most, or possibly at his pleasure, or during his ownership of the property.\nIncorporeal rights cannot pass by parol license without a deed. Fenliman v. Smith[12]; Hewlins v. Shippam[13].\nThe maintenance of the present sewer cannot be justified by the license. McMillan v. Hedge[14]; Ross v. Hunter[15]; Wood on Nuisance[16]. Any license granted was revocable and was revoked by the annexation of Yorkville to Toronto increasing the servitude, by notices given by respondent, and by the conveyance of the lands. Roberts v Rose[17]; Wallis v. Harrison[18]; Goddard on Esements[19].\nThe right of the city of Toronto was an equitable interest within the meaning of section 83 of the Registry Act (R.S.O. c. 114) and as against a registered title is invalid. This case is governed by the case of Ross v. Hunter15. There is no substantial difference between the provisions of the Nova Scotia Registry Act and the Ontario Registry Act, except that in section 83 there is a clause reaching the case of equitable interests.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\u2014\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014In 1877 John Severn was seized in fee of the locus in quo and in that year gave permission to the corporation of Yorkville, now represented by the appellant, to construct a drain through the land in question for the purpose of carrying off surface and other water. The municipality made the drain accordingly.\nIn 1879 John Severn sold the land to his son George Severn. John Severn died in February, 1880. The sale to George Severn was completed before the death of John Severn. The deed by which the property was conveyed to George Severn was not put in evidence, and it does not very clearly appear whether it was executed by John Severn himself, or by those who took under his will. The parol evidence of George Severn, given on cross-examination by the appellant, is that the sale to him was carried out about the 28th of January, and that his father died on the 8th of February, 1880. By this I understand that there was a conveyance to him on the first mentioned date. It does not appear to have been disputed that this conveyance was registered; the title is spoken of in the judgment of the Court of Appeal as a registered title, and the only question as regards the registry laws seems to have been whether the interest of the municipality was an interest to which the registry laws applied, and I find it nowhere suggested that if it was there had not been such registration of the deeds as to bring the case within the operation of those laws.\nGeorge Severn, having acquired title as before mentioned, made certain mortgages. Under a power of sale contained in some of these mortgages the late Sheriff Jarvis, the father of the respondent, became a purchaser of the property for valuable consideration. Subsequently the land became vested in the respondent under a conveyance from the trustees of his father\u2019s will. These mortgages and the deed to the respondent were all duly registered.\nThe city authorities having entered and performed certain works in connection with the drain the respondent brought the present action to recover damages for trespasses committed in so entering; also damages for maintaining the drain.\nThe appellant pleaded the agreement with John Severn. The respondent replied that he and those under whom he claimed were purchasers for value and set up the registry laws.\nThe agreement by John Severn with the municipality of Yorkville, under which the drain was constructed, was proved beyond doubt. It was, however, also established that there was no by-law of the Yorkville council authorizing the taking of the land for the drain. Further, it was established by the evidence of George Severn himself, that he had direct notice of the agreement between his father and the municipality before he purchased.\nUpon this state of facts Chief Justice Armour and the Court of Appeal have successively held that the respondent is entitled to recover. Their judgments both proceed upon the ground that the respondent is entitled to the benefit of the registry laws.\nIt is not necessary that we should define with exactitude the nature of the interest in the land taken by the municipality under the agreement with John Severn. Whether that agreement is to be taken as conferring the property in the land required and taken for the purposes of the drain, or whether it is to be considered as conferring a quasi easement for that purpose, or was a mere license, can make no difference. In either case it was an interest in land to which the registry laws apply.\nIf it was the intention to give a title to the property in the land or an easement, it matters not which, then the agreement must be deemed to have been a contract for an interest in land partly performed, one which, being for the valuable consideration involved in the expenditure on the drain, a court of equity would have decreed specific performance of. If it was a mere license it would have been revocable at first but if not countermanded before money had been expended in the execution of the purpose for which it was conferred it would have by that expenditure become irrevocable, and therefore an interest in land. Plimmer v. Mayor of Wellington[20].\nUnder the original registry law equitable interests not created in writing, and therefore not susceptible of registration by memorial according to the machinery provided by the act, were held not to be within the registry laws, and so not liable to be defeated by the registration of a subsequent grantee for value from the same grantor. A familiar example of this principle was afforded by the case of a mortgage by deposit of the title deeds. If, however, there was a writing which might have been registered it was subject to be avoided by subsequent registration, although a mere equitable title might have been conferred by it. It is not, therefore, accurate, at least under the old law, to confound equitable interests with interests not conferred by a written title, and for that reason not capable of registration.\nBy the Revised Statutes of 1877, c. 114, s. 83, it was, however, enacted that:\nNo Hen, charge or interest affecting land shall be deemed valid in any court in this province, as against a registered instrument executed by the same party, his heirs or assigns.\nThis provision is clearly not restricted to interests derived under written instruments susceptible of registration, but it applies to all interests, including equitable mortgages, vendor\u2019s liens, parol contracts partly performed, and interests having their origin in verbal agreements such as the present, if it is to be viewed as a right to maintain the drain under an irrevocable license.\nI can see no ground for confining the operation of this clause to interests in land derived under some written title.\nThe consequence is that the respondent\u2019s registered title must prevail against the interest of the appellant derived under the parol agreement with John Severn, unless something has occurred to disentitle him to the benefit of this eighty-third section.\nIt is true that George Severn had notice which would have disentitled him to set up priority obtained by re- gistration. This, however, was a mere personal disqualification and cannot affect those claiming under him through a registered chain of title as purchasers for value having no notice. Within this last description the respondent is clearly included. Then it is not immaterial to notice a peculiarity in the wording of the 83rd section which does not make it essential that the registered instrument should have been executed by the grantor who conferred the unregistered interest, or even by his heirs, but gives priority even where the registered deed has been executed by the \u201cassigns\u201d of the party who conferred the prior unregistered interest.\nThe case of Ross v. Hunter[21] has, in my opinion, no application. That was a very plain case since the grantee, who had in that case omitted to register, claimed under a deed which could have been put on the registry in the ordinary manner.\nThe appellant also insisted on the Municipal Act applicable at the date of the agreement with John Severn in 1877. That act was the Municipal Act of 1873, cap. 48. By sec. 372 subsec. 10, it was enacted that\u2014\nThe council may pass by-laws for entering upon, breaking up, taking and using any land for the purposes of a sewer.\nIt was argued that such a by-law did not require registration and that the case was therefore altogether outside the registry laws.\nIf there had been a by-law authorizing the taking of this land I should have agreed in this proposition. There was, however, no by-law and for that reason there was no expropriation under the statute. Had there been a by-law a certain publicity would have been given to the title of the municipality to the land taken up by the sewer, which is entirely lacking in the absence of such an ordinance. I cannot, therefore, agree with the appellant\u2019s contention that we are to ascribe the appellant\u2019s title to the Municipal Act, treating the by-law as having been waived, and therefore to hold the interest as one conferred by a title paramount to the registry laws. I entirely agree with what is said on this point by Mr. Justice Osier in delivering the judgment of the Court of Appeal.\nIt is objected to the judgment which was entered by the learned Chief Justice of the Queen\u2019s Bench that it was too large, since, as it was contended, it would entitle the respondent to recover damages not only in respect of his own time but also for damages accrued in the time of his predecessors in title. This objection is wholly unfounded. Any damages which accrued prior to the respondent\u2019s acquisition of title cannot be said to belong to him. Then the terms of the judgment in directing a reference are that it be referred to the referee\u2014\nto ascertain the loss and damages (if any) sustained by the plaintiff by reason of the illegal entry and wrongful acts of the defendants complained of in the statement of claim herein.\nThis clearly confines the reference to an inquiry in respect of damages accrued in the plaintiff\u2019s own time.\nThe appeal is dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: H.M. Mowat.\nSolicitor for the respondent: W.D. Macpherson.\n[1] 21 Ont. App. R. 395.\n[2] 20 O.R. 361.\n[3] 7 Can.

J., and Fournier, Taschereau, Gwynne and King JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE EXCHEQUER COURT OF CANADA.\nCustoms duties\u201450 & 51 V. c. 39, items 88 and 173\u2014Exemption from duty\u2014Steel rails for use on railways\u2014Application to street railways.\nThe exemption from duty in 50 & 51 V. c. 39, item 173, of \u201csteel rails weighing not less than twenty-five pounds per lineal yard, for use on railway tracks,\u201d does not apply to rails to be used for street railways which are subject to duty as \u201crails for railways and tramways of any form\u201d under item 88. Strong C.J. and King J. dissenting.\nAppeal from a decision of the Exchequer Court of Canada[1] in favour of the Crown in an action for repayment of duties paid under protest by the plaintiff company.\nThe Customs Tariff Act, 1888 (50 & 51 Vic. ch. 39), by item 88 imposes a duty of $6 per ton on iron or steel railway bars and rails for railways and tramways of any form, not elsewhere specified, and by item 173 \u201csteel rails weighing not less than twenty-five pounds per lineal yard, for use on railway tracks,\u201d are exempted from duty.\nThe only question for decision on this appeal was, whether steel rails weighing more than twenty-five pounds per lineal yard, imported by the plaintiff company for the construction of street railway tracks in Toronto, were exempted from duty under item 173, or subject to duty under item 88. The learned Judge of the Exchequer Court held that the exemption did not apply to steel rails for street railways. The company appealed.\nRobinson Q.C. and Osier Q.C. for the appellant. The learned judge of the Exchequer Court held that the construction of the statute should be in favour of the railway company, but he decided the case outside of the wording of the act and on the general policy of the legislation.\nA street railway is not a tramway. The distinction between them is recognized in the Tariff Act of 1888.\nThis question arose in New Brunswick in Ex parte Zebley[2]; and see also Grinnell v. The Queen[3]; Ayer v. The Queen[4].\nThe course of tariff legislation shows that rails for street railways were intended to be included in the exemption.\nNewcombe Q.C. Deputy Minister of Justice, and Hodgins for the respondent. Street railway and tramway are synonomous terms.\nThe exempting item does not use the word tramway and the taxing item does.\nThe intention of the legislature was to encourage the building of long distance railways and not of those for the convenience of municipalities.\nThe learned counsel referred to Attorney General v. Bailey[5].\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014The appellant is a railway company incorporated under an Act of the Legislature of the province of Ontario passed in 1892, which gave it power\u2014\nTo acquire, construct, complete, maintain and operate a double or single track street railway in the city of Toronto and * * * * * To acquire privileges to build and operate surface railways within the limits of any municipal corporation in the county of York over roads within the same.\nIn exercise of these powers the appellant acquired an existing street railway worked by horse power in the city of Toronto, and proceeded to make large extensions to the same, and to alter the motive power to electricity.\nFor the purpose of this railway, and to be laid down in its tracks or permanent way, the appellant imported a quantity of steel rails.\nUpon these rails the customs officers of the Dominion levied a duty of $6 per ton.\nThis was done contrary to the protests of the appellant, who insisted that the rails, which weighed 69 pounds per lineal yard, ought, under the Customs Act of 1887, in force at the date of importation, to have been admitted free of duty.\nThe duties so imposed were paid under protest, and the present proceeding has been taken to recover back the amount so paid.\nThe provisions of the Customs Tariff Act 1887, (50 & 51 Vic. ch. 39) on which the decision of the question thus raised must depend are as follows:\u2014\nThe duty is imposed by\nItem 88. Iron or steel railway bars, and rails for railways and tramways of any form, punched or not punched, not elsewhere specified, $6 per ton.\nBy item 173, steel rails weighing not less than twenty-five pounds per lineal yard for use in railway tracks are exempted from duty.\nThe appellant contends that the rails in question are covered by this exemption of item 173.\nThe learned judge of the Exchequer Court says in his judgment, that he would have held these rails to have been free but for a series of Acts by which parliament has made grants of money in aid of certain lines of railway being long line railways, connecting distant points within the Dominion, but confined to that class of railways, and in no case including street railways, which are local works confined to particular cities, towns or municipalities. The learned judge thought that this indicated the policy of the legislature underlying the provisions of the Tariff Act to be to admit free only rails designed for use in the same class of railways as that which had been favoured by parliamentary grants of money. The learned judge says:\u2014\nAs the matter stands, however, and if there were no legitimate aids to assist in discovering the intention of the legislature other than the language used in the Acts of 1885 and 1887, I should think the question to be, to say the least, so involved in doubt that the plaintiff should succeed in his action.\nThe learned judge then adverts to what are called the bonus acts, and from the practice of subsidizing railways, other than street railways, by these grants, he infers that proprietors of this class of railways were alone intended to be benefited by the exemption of steel rails of the prescribed weight for \u201cuse in railway tracks.\u201d\nI am unable to assent to this as a sufficient reason for depriving the appellant of the benefit of the exemption.\nIn construing an Act of Parliament it is of course perfectly legitimate, and it is the constant practice of the courts, to call in aid the language and expressions used by the legislature in, and the intention indicated by, other statutes which are in pari maleri\u00e2. The bonus acts are, however, not in pari materia with the customs acts. Further, the circumstance that the legislature had limited its subsidies to a particular class of railways, does not in any way indicate an intention to confine the benefit of a customs exemption to the same class as that which had been thus favoured by money grants. At the utmost it warrants nothing but a conjecture of what may or may not have been the intention of the legislature. Then a mere supposition of this kind ought to have no influence on the construction of a legislative act, in either widening the language imposing duties, or in restricting that authorizing exceptions. If we are to look outside the statute to ascertain the intention of the legislature in exempting \u201csteel rails above 25 pounds per lineal yard for use in railway tracks,\u2019\u2019 I think, as was suggested by my brother King during the argument, that we find a key to that intention when we consider the general fiscal policy of the Dominion at the time this Act was passed to have been that which is stated in the factum of the Crown and which is colloquially known as \u201cThe National Policy;\u201d in other words, a system of duties imposed for the protection and encouragement of the manufactures of the Dominion. And this becomes still more apparent when we find it stated in the deposition of Mr. Gartshore, that at the date of this legislation steel rails a little under 25 pounds were being manufactured in the Dominion.\nThese considerations, however, are of little moment if the plain language of the Act itself does not exempt the rails now in question.\nThe argument for the Crown is, that the appellant\u2019s railway is a \u201ctramway,\u201d that the rails are therefore subjected to the duty by item 88 as rails for \u201ctramways\u201d and not as rails for \u201crailways,\u201d and that the exemption of rails \u201cfor use in railways tracks\u201d does not include rails for use in tramway tracks.\nI am compelled to deny the correctness of these propositions. A great deal of evidence has been given by engineers and other skilled witnesses to explain the meaning of the word \u201ctramway\u201d used in the 88th item by which the duties are imposed. This evidence, taking the term to be a word of art, was, i take it, strictly admissible. At all events, it was admitted without objection. The conclusion I draw from the depositions of the expert witnesses who have thus given their opinions is, that the word \u201ctramway\u201d was not designed as a description of such railways as that of the appellant. I take, as a fair type of the whole of this evidence, the deposition of Mr. Keefer, an engineer of very long practice, extending over some fifty years, of the highest professional reputation, and who had formerly conjoined to his professional experience practical experience in the management of a street railway company in which he was formerly interested, and had been for a series of years president of. He tells us, moreover, that he had been an. officer of the American Street Railway Association and was familiar with the working of these lines of transit, not only in Canada but in the United States. This witness clearly and accurately points out the distinction between the terms \u201ctramway\u201d and \u201cstreet railway,\u201d as those expressions are used on this side of the Atlantic, where street railways were first constructed and used, and shows that this distinction is well understood, and in what it consists. A tramway is, as the witness describes it, a line of railway laid down upon the surface of a street or common road with a rail adapted for use by ordinary vehicles. An electric railway is not intended for such use and could not with safety be so used. The tramway is constructed with a rail of a peculiar design, having a flange to prevent the wheels of an ordinary vehicle slipping off, which these rails, a section of one of which was produced to the witness, have not got. It is also shown that these rails are in all respects identical with those used for long line steam railways. The witness says \u201ca street railway may be a tram and it may not,\u201d and he says the railway he was formerly the president of had no tram, whilst the former horse railway in Toronto had. The whole of Mr. Keefer\u2019s deposition goes to show, that according to the scientific meaning of the term, as used and understood by railway engineers, the appellant\u2019s railway was not a tramway but a street railway in the strictest application of the term. And this evidence is corroborated by several other professional witnesses called by the appellant. Then, the evidence also shows, that in popular language the term \u201ctramway\u201d is not in Canada or the United States ever applied to these street or surface railways used for rapid transit in cities or towns, but that they are always colloquially referred to as street railways. Further, the evidence shows that in this country there are a class of railways well known and in common use, to which the description tramway is applicable and to which it is always applied, namely, short lines of rails connected with mills, manufactories and mines, and used for lumbering operations.\nIn addition to this evidence the enactments of the same legislature which passed the Act under consideration indicate that the difference between a street railway and a tramway was well understood, for in the Tariff Act of 1885 we find them expressly providing \u201cthat steel rails or bars not including tram or street rails\u201d should be admitted free. Therefore, when I add to this my own common experience of the non use of the term tramway as applied to street railways, which it is impossible to exclude in a case like the present, I cannot hesitate in holding that if the word \u201ctramways\u201d had been wholly omitted from item 88, and if that section had read \u201csteel bars and rails for railways of any form\u201d the duty of $6 per ton would have been sufficiently laid upon the rails now in question. And if this is so, the exemption in section 173 of steel rails weighing not less than 25 pounds for use in railway tracks would in that case have included the rails in question and they would have been free.\nIt follows that the duty in the present case must be taken to be imposed by the words \u201cfor railways\u201d in section 88 and not by the words \u201cfor tramways,\u201d and the exception of item 173 must therefore apply to rails to be used in the tracks of a railway such as the appellant\u2019s, provided they are not less than 25 pounds in weight. But even supposing that we must regard the duty as imposed by the word \u201ctramways\u201d and that the appellant\u2019s lines are tramways, I should still think that the exemption applied in their favour. The word \u201crailway\u201d is a generic word including both long lines and street and surface lines\u2014tramways as the Crown insists they should be called\u2014and there is no reason why the exemption may not be conferred by general words less specific than those imposing the duty. Then, finding the reason of the exemption to be that before indicated, viz., a policy of protection to domestic manufactures, a reason equally applicable to rails for street railways or tramways, if such street railways or tramways were intended to be included in the term \u201ctramways,\u201d there is no reason why steel rails above the prescribed weight should not be exempted from duty by the terms \u201cfor use in railway tracks.\u201d\nFor these reasons I am of opinion that the appellant is entitled to the relief prayed:\nFOURNIER J.\u2014I concur with Mr. Justice Taschereau that this appeal should be dismissed.\nTASCHEREAU J\u2014I would dismiss this appeal. I agree with my brother Gwynne\u2019s reasoning. In my opinion the appellant\u2019s contentions are untenable. They would call the Grand Trunk Railway or the Canadian Pacific Railway tramways, or call themselves a railway company in the sense that these companies are so called. I would not have thought it possible to contend that when, for instance, one speaks of the system of railways of Canada, or of the railways in Canada, the city passenger railways or street railways, or tramways, are included. These tramways do certainly not fall under the general railway acts of the Dominion or of the provinces.\nAnd if by section 18 of the appellant\u2019s own charter certain sections of the Ontario General Act are incorporated therein, it is because, in the opinion of the legislature, the appellant would not, without those special enactments, fall under that general Railway Act.\nAnd the federal legislation does not give more assistance to the appellant\u2019s case. For instance, the railways generally are empowered to purchase, lease and work other lines competing or connecting with them. Now, could the Grand Trunk Railway or the Canadian Pacific Railway under that clause acquire and work the city passenger railways of Toronto, Winnipeg and Montreal? I should think it impossible so to contend. It would be ultra vires of these railway companies to hold and work a street railway or tramway, yet that would be the result if the appellant\u2019s contentions prevailed.\nThen, by the course of the legislation of the Dominion, the difference between a tramway and a railway is constantly recognized.\nFor instance, the Criminal Code (sec. 330) punishes the stealing of any tramway, railway or steamboat ticket, the forgery (sec. 423) of any carriage, tramway or railway ticket, and the obtaining by false tickets (sec. 362) of a passage on any carriage, tramway or railway. By sec. 90 of 51 Vic (D.), 1888, power is given to cross any railway or tramway. And when, by sec. 203 of the Criminal Code, it is enacted that a copy of the section against gambling must be posted in every railway car under a penalty of one hundred dollars, I would not think that such an enactment applies to a tramway car, or that sec. 499, punishing by imprisonment for life the damaging of a railway, would apply to a street railway.\nThen, upon the evidence on this record, it is clear that street railways, in common parlance, are tramways. In fact, by the modern meaning of the term tramway hardly anything else but a street railway is meant.\nAnd how can this company be entitled to claim an exemption which, in its very terms, is limited to rails for use in railway tracks, when, as appears by the evidence, and found as a fact by the Exchequer Court, their rails are not at all like those that are used for railway tracks?\nMoreover, this statute extends of course to all parts of the country, and must receive the same construction all through the Dominion. Now, if the street railway in Montreal had ever thought of raising this question, they would have been met by the French version of the statute, which is as much law as the English version, and under that version, items 79 and 178, there would not be the least room for doubt. A chemin de fer could never be called un tramway, or un tramway be called a chemin de fer, and a street railway is nothing else in French but un tramway:\nThat the company appellant is a tramway company, or that their road is a tramway, requires in fact no demonstration. They are, in fact, nothing else but a tramway company; if not, there are no tramways in Toronto, Montreal, London, Paris, New York, a proposition that needs not be refuted. And their own contract for these rails is for \u201csteel girder tramway rails.\u201d\nI cannot see that the appellant\u2019s case is at all aided by the fact insisted upon at the argument, that it is called the Toronto Railway Company. It is clearly incorporated for the purpose of acquiring and Working a surface street railway, and nothing else,, as the Toronto Street Railway Company previously had been; it is in fact the Toronto Street Railway acquired by the city under 52 Vic. ch. 73, sec. 13, that the appellant is the continuation of.\nThen in this very Customs Act itself, 50 & 51 Vic. ch. 39, Parliament has made the distinction between railways and tramways; after taxing both railways and tramways in express terms in item 88, it exempts, by item 173, rails (of not less than 25 lbs. per lineal yard) for use in railway tracks, omitting tramway tracks. Need we go further to find the clear intention of Parliament? To my mind it is not a matter of construction, there is no room for it. It says but the one thing; tax both in item 88, exempt but one in item 173. Quod voluit dixit.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014The point raised by this appeal is as to the construction of two items, viz., 88 and 173 of the Duties of Customs Act 50 & 51 Vic. ch. 39. By the item 88, a duty of $6 per ton is imposed upon:\nIron or steel railway bars, and rails for railways and tramways, of any form, punched or not punched, not elsewhere specified.\nBy item 173 the Act authorizes to be imported into Canada free of duty:\nSteel rails weighing not less than twenty-five pounds per lineal yard for use in railway tracks.\nThe suppliant is a company incorporated by an Act of the province of Ontario, 55 Vic. ch. 99, for the purpose of acquiring and taking over from the petitioners for the Act a contract and agreement made by and between the city of Toronto and the petitioners, set out in full in the Act, for the purchase of the street railways and the properties, and street railway privileges of, and belonging to the city of Toronto, and for completing, maintaining and operating a double or single track street railway upon or along any of the streets of the city of Toronto subject to certain exceptions and qualifications in the Act specified.\nThe company is essentially a street railway company. In the month of December, 1892, it entered into a contract with a firm in England for delivery in Toronto of 3,000 tons of new, perfect, steel girder tramway rails for use upon the railways in the streets of the city of Toronto; this contract was fulfilled by the delivery of the rails at Toronto accompanied with invoices wherein they were described as in the contract for their purchase, viz., \u201csteel girder tramway rails.\u201d\nThe company also imported from Antwerp certain other rails called in the invoices accompanying them \u201csteel grooved rails and fish plates,\u201d also for use upon its railways in the streets of the city of Toronto. All these rails were respectively entered by the suppliant precisely as described in the above invoices and upon them was charged to the suppliant the sum of six dollars per ton in virtue of the above item 88 of the statute.\nThe contention of the suppliant now is that this imposition of duty was unwarranted upon the ground that the rails having been, as they in fact were, of much greater weight than 25 lbs. per lineal yard, they came within the item 173 and were therefore free of duty.\nThe effect of this contention, if successful, must be that items 88 and 173 of the Act must be read together as follows, that is to say, as imposing a duty of six dollars a ton upon iron or steel railway bars, and rails for railways and tramways, of any form, punched or not punched, except upon steel rails weighing not less than 25 lbs. per lineal yard (which are declared to be free), for all \u201csteel rails for railways\u201d when laid upon the ground constitute the railway tracks. This construction, thus limiting the duty upon steel rails for railways to such as are under the weight of 25 lbs. per lineal yard must not be adopted if another construction can be put upon the Act which will give full effect and a reasonable construction to both items. This I think can very clearly be done. Parliament by item 88 intended, I think, to refer to all rails whether of iron or steel imported for railways and tramways, that is to say, by using the word railways\u201d in such connection with \u201ctramways\u201d they meant railways ejusdem generis with tramways which street railways, I think, undoubtedly are. They are very commonly, and not unfrequently even in Acts of Parliament authorizing their construction, spoken of indifferently as tramways or street railways, and in commerce it is evident from the contract under which the particular rails in question were purchased and imported that they are known as tramway rails. Now item 173 is not, I think, to be construed as exempting from duty some part of the particular thing which by item 88 had been subjected to duty, but as providing for a different article altogether from anything intended to be covered by item 88, namely, for steel rails for use in the tracks in those great arterial commercial undertakings (for the transport by interconnection with each other throughout the continent not only of passengers but of goods, wares, merchandise, chattels and cattle of every description) which are denominated \u201crailways\u201d without any qualifying prefix, and for the construction and management of which acts have been passed for many years back both by the late province of Canada and by the Parliament of the Dominion since Confederation, and by the legislatures of several provinces of the Dominion under the title of \u201cThe Railway Act\u201d of the Dominion, or of the province passing the act. The rails in question are proved to be of such a construction that they could not be used at all upon any of ( these latter railways, but are constructed specially for use upon street railways or tramways. The rails were, I think, clearly liable to the duty charged and the appeal must therefore be dismissed with costs.\nKING J.\u2014I am of opinion that this appeal should be allowed with costs and judgment entered for the suppliant in the Exchequer Court, for the reasons stated in the judgment of the Chief Justice.\n*Appeal, dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Kingsmill, Saunders & Torrance.\nSolicitor for the respondent: Frank E.

The defendants claim the right to enter upon the said land and to take possession of parts thereof which, they claim, do constitute certain public streets and highways in the city of Toronto placed under the jurisdiction and control of the defendants by the act known as the Municipal Act and the acts passed in amendment thereof.\nThe case may be said to rest wholly upon certain admissions made by the respective parties to the suit, although much evidence was adduced. The plaintiff's case was opened upon an admission signed by the counsel and solicitor of the defendants as follows:\nThat the plaintiff George Gooderham is, and those from whom he has derived title by conveyance have been for the past twenty-five years, in occupation of part of the east half of lot number fourteen in the broken front concession in the township of York, bounded on the east by the line between lots numbers thirteen and fourteen in the said township; on the south by the northern boundary line of the lands granted by the Crown to the defendants by patent dated May 18th, 1880; on the west by lands owned by one John Smith and the Grand Trunk Railway Company; and on the north by the south limit of Eastern Avenue, formerly South Park Street. That the said lot comprises one large field containing about twenty-two and one-half acres, and fenced in on the north, west and east sides, and that such field has been so fenced for the past twenty-five years.\nThe place where, and the only place where, the Grand Trunk Railway bounds the said field on the west, as is said it does in the said admission, is where, as appears by the plan hereinafter mentioned produced in evidence, the fence along the northern side of the said field, that is, along the southern limit of South Park Street, comes in contact with the eastern limit of the said railway.\nThe learned judge, Mr. Justice Ferguson, who tried the case has found in his judgment that in point of fact it was established in the evidence before him that until the making of the lease by Gooderham to Stark the land in question was occupied by the plaintiff Gooderham, and those under whom he claims, as a pasture field for cattle and continually fenced in as such field for a period of thirty years or more.\nAssuming it to have been so occupied and enclosed for thirty years the possession of the plaintiff Gooderham, and of those under whom he claims, and so the date at which his commencement of title would begin, would reach back to the year 1859, and assuming the field to have been so occupied and fenced for the period only of twenty-five years, that would date the commencement of his title to the year 1864. Now such being admitted to be the title of the plaintiff Gooderham, the whole onus is cast upon the defendants of showing the pieces of land over and upon which they claim control and right of entry to be public streets and highways.\nThe matters of fact upon which the defendants rest their claim, as gathered from the admissions of the parties and the facts in evidence, are as follows:\u2014\nOn the 1st of July, 1853, the Honourable Henry John Boulton, then of the city of Toronto, being seised in fee simple of about 35 acres of the east half of the broken front no. 14 in the first concession from the bay of the township of York, conveyed the same by deed of bargain and sale, by a particular description therein, to James Boulton and Thomas Saulter in fee simple, who, upon the same day, by an indenture of bargain and sale by way of mortgage, reconveyed the same land to the said Henry John Boulton in fee simple, subject to redemption upon payment of the full sum of \u00a33,000 of lawful money of Canada, being the consideration money mentioned in the indenture of bargain and sale executed to them by the said Henry John Boulton, together with interest thereon at the days and times in the said indenture of mortgage mentioned. While the said James Boulton and Thomas Saulter were so seized of the said lands, subject to the said indenture of mortgage, the Grand Trunk Railway Company, in virtue of the powers vested in them by law, located their railway across the said land. This location of the railway caused considerable speculation and gave birth to expectations that the land might be made available for sale in small lots. The evidence upon this subject is that of John Smith himself, who says:\nThe railway caused this excitement and this property to be laid out. Mr. Saulter and James Boulton bought this from Henry John as a speculation, and they were going to lay it out to the railway.\nSmith owned the west half and Saulter and Boulton the east half of the lot, and the latter asked Smith if he would let his part be shewn so as to make it look like a good advertisement, to which he replied that he would have no objection to that, but that he would not consent to have his part registered because he wanted to utilize his land in farming, and did not want to lay it out in lots. Then he says that when Saulter and Boulton went to lay out their part, they found that at the point where their half abutted on Smith\u2019s half on Queen Street they could not have a corner lot unless they could get land from Smith for a road, and so, as Smith says, they said to him:\nMr. Smith, will you let us have the whole of the road and we will give you ten lots on our part.\nTo this proposition Smith agreed. James Boulton and Thomas Saulter then caused a plan to be made of the whole broken front lot, including Smith\u2019s half, showing the whole subdivided into town lots and numbered, with spaces for streets for a proposed sale by auction contemplated and advertised to take place upon the 9th day of August 1854.\nNo success appears to have attended such exposure to sale by auction if it ever took place. The plan so prepared was filed in the registry office of the county of York on or about the 26th day of December, 1854, and numbered 105. By an indenture bearing date the 5th day of May, 1855, James Boulton and Thomas Saulter granted and Henry John Boulton confirmed unto the said John Smith his heirs and assigns ten of the said lots as laid down on the said plan and numbered as follows: 141, 142, 143, 153, 234, 242, 253, 342, 346 and 351. The above lot numbered 253 was inserted plainly by mistake for it is on the plan as situate upon Smith\u2019s own or west half of the broken front lot. The lot intended as will appear hereafter was no. 243. The consideration of the deed is stated therein to have been as follows:\nIn consideration of the said John Smith having dedicated to the public and for the benefit of the said parties of the first part a street sixty-six feet wide as the same is laid down on the plan of the survey of that piece or parcel of land formerly known as lot number fourteen in the broken front of the township of York now forming part of the city of Toronto and owned by the said John Smith, James Boulton and Thomas Saulter, such street extending from the Kingston road to the south side of Front street produced east and also in consideration of five shillings of lawful money of Canada to them paid by the said John Smith.\nBy a decree of the Court of Chancery bearing date the 8th day of May, 1860, and by two final orders bearing date respectively the 17th day of January, and the 27th day of June, 1861, all the estate and interest of the said mortgagors, James Boulton and Thomas Saulter, their heirs and assigns, in the whole of the east half of the said broken front lot number 14, save and except in the lots 141, 142, 143, 153, 234, 242, 243, 342, 346 and 351, these being the lots in which Smith was interested, and excepting also the lots numbered on the said plan as numbers 161, 162, 163, 167, 168 and 189, was absolutely foreclosed. To whom or when these latter six lots were sold does not appear, nor do I think it at all important as affecting the point in issue in this case, for they are all of them on that portion of the broken front lot which lies north of South Park Street, as shown on the said plan. Nos. 161 and 162 front on Queen Street and abut on the east upon the Grand Trunk Railway; 168 lies immediately to the rear of them, abutting on the east on the Grand Trunk Railway, and on the west on a street designated on the plan as Strange Street; lot 167 is shown on the plan to front upon a street designated D\u2019Arcy Street, its north-easterly corner being distant 152 feet from Queen Street; 168 lies immediately to the south of 167, its north-easterly corner being distant 202 feet from Queen Street; lot number 189 fronts on Queen Street, having a frontage of 51 feet, 5 \u00bc inches, and a depth of 132 feet; of the other lots excepted from the decree of foreclosure, four of them, that is to say, 141, 142, 143 and 153, are situate north of South Park Street and the Grand Trunk Railway, and the other six south of South Park Street, as shown on the said plan.\nNow, upon the foreclosure of the mortgage by Henry John Boulton, it was quite competent for him to have inclosed the whole of the land comprised in the decree of foreclosure and lying to the south of South Park Street and to have abandoned the plan wholly as to such part without the let, suit, trouble, claim, demand, interruption or denial of any person whomsoever, subject only to such claim as John Smith had in virtue of his being grantee as aforesaid of the said six lots lying south of South Park Street. No person whatever other than the said John Smith coald, under the circumstances appearing in evidence, have had any right or interest in law to dispute such action upon the part of the said Henry John Boulton, his heirs or assigns; and such the estate and claim of the said John Smith his heirs and assigns was liable to be defeated by dispossession for the period limited for making an entry upon or bringing an action or suit for the recovery of real estate. That it was Mr. Henry John Boulton who first inclosed the field which the plaintiff Gooderham and those under whom he claims are admitted to have had in their occupation as a pasture field for twenty-five years prior to December 1889, there is no reason whatever for entertaining a doubt.\nThen it appears that by an indenture of bargain and sale bearing date the sixteenth day of March eighteen hundred and sixty-five, the said Henry John Boulton granted, bargained and sold to Clarke Gamble his heirs and assigns the whole of that part of the east half of the said broken lot as described in the decree of foreclosure, and by an indenture bearing date the 23rd day of November, 1870, the said Clarke Gamble conveyed the same land by the same description to George Leslie his heirs and assigns. Now although the description in these deeds was precisely the same as that in the decree of foreclosure still the field in question which was occupied throughout as a pasture field contained within its fences the whole of the east half of the lot no. 14 south of South Park Street, including the lots numbered 234, 242, 243, 342, 346 and 351, so as aforesaid conveyed to Smith, and also so much of the west half of the said broken front lot as consisted of sixty-six feet in width lying south of South Park Street and abutting upon the westerly limit of the east half of the said lot; this is apparent from Smith\u2019s own evidence and from an indenture of lease produced in evidence bearing date the 17th July, 1866, whereby Smith demised to William Gooderham, James G. Worts and George Gooderham for 21 years\u2014\nall that certain tract of land situate lying and being in the ward of St. Lawrence in the said city of Toronto, containing 50 acres more or less, being the farm now in the actual occupation of the said lessor divided into two several parcels by the Grand Trunk Railway, parcel number one lying north of the said inclosed railroad containing about thirty acres and parcel number two lying south of the said railroad, containing about twenty acres, and being composed of the west half of lot number fourteen, and lot number fifteen in the broken front formerly in the township of York, now the city of Toronto, and bounded as follows: on the north by the Kingston road, on the south by the Marsh and waters of the Bay of Toronto, on the east by land owned by the trustees of Harriet E. Gamble, wife of Clarke Gamble, and on the west by the River Don.\nIn his evidence Smith explains that the piece demised was bounded on the east by a fence which ran as now along what appears on the above map to be the west limit of Saulter Street, and that the land spoken of in the lease as owned by the trustees of the wife of Clarke Gamble is the property now in litigation, and he says that when he executed that lease he knew that the portion designated on the plan as Saulter Street, lying to the south of the railway, was enclosed within the field occupied by Gamble as pasture and by Leslie after him; of the fact that it was so occupied there does not appear to be any doubt. Now while Leslie was so in occupation of the said field, and on the 21st December, 1874, the Ontario Act 38 Vic. ch. 16, was passed, whereby it was enacted that as to all persons resident in the Province of Ontario no person after the first day of July, 1876, should make any entry or bring any action or suit to recover any land, &c., but within ten years next after the time at which the right to make such entry or to bring such action or suit should have first accrued.\nThe evidence, therefore, justifies the conclusion that on the 13th day of March, 1884, when Leslie executed the indenture of that date whereby he conveyed all the land south of South Park Street therein described to Edward Blong who was acting in the transaction as the agent of the plaintiff Gooderham, he was seized by statutory title of an absolute estate of inheritance in the whole of the land south of South Park Street, constituting the field which is admitted and proved to have been in 1889 in the occupation of the plaintiff Gooderham and those under whom he claims as one pasture field fenced in on every side, for a period exceeding 25 years absolutely freed and discharged from every estate, title, claim and demand whatsoever of the said John Smith and of all other persons whomsoever. The land, however, which is purported to be conveyed by the deed from Leslie to Blong is described therein as being composed of a part of the said broken front lot no. 14 particularly described as follows:\nCommencing at the intersection of the south side of South Park Street or Eastern Avenue with the division line between the broken front lots thirteen and fourteen, thence southerly along the said division line one thousand three hundred and sixty feet more or less to the boundary line established between the several owners of the broken front lots and the grant lately made by the Provincial Government to the city of Toronto, thence south sixty-one degrees fifty-two minutes twenty-two seconds west, on an astronomical course along such boundary line seven hundred feet more or less to the intersection with the prolongation southerly of the east side of Saulter Street, then northerly along the east side of Saulter Street one thousand four hundred and ninety feet more or less to the south side of South Park Street or Eastern Avenue, then easterly along the south side of the last mentioned street six hundred and eighty feet four inches more or less to the place of beginning, containing twenty-two acres and thirty-five hundreths of an acre and comprising among other lands\u2014\nthe several lots which are enumerated therein according to plan no. 105 registered in the registry office of the county of York. Now upon the evidence of Smith and the admission that Gooderham and those under whom he claims had had in 1889 occupation of the whole of the land in respect of which the present litigation has arisen lying south of South Park Street fenced in as one pasture field for 25 years it is plain that Leslie and those under whom he claimed had such occupation in 1884 for 20 years of which period Leslie himself had exclusive occupation for 14 years, so that he had good right and title when he executed the deed of the 13th March, 1884, to convey the whole of the said pasture field, there can I think be little doubt that the intention of the parties to that deed was to convey the pasture field of which Leslie and those under whom he claimed had such continuous possession, and that the western boundary of the piece as described in the deed being stated to be the eastern side of Saulter Street produced, arose from the draftsman assuming that the fence along the west side of the field was on such east side of Saulter Street produced. This by Smith\u2019s evidence, however, appears not to have been the case; but adopting his evidence as correct, namely, that the fence is and always has been along the west side of Saulter Street as shown on the plan then, although it must be admitted that in such case there is a piece of land east of the fence, and which was always occupied by Leslie and those under whom he claimed as part of the one inclosed pasture field which is not covered by the description in the deed executed by Leslie, still Gooderham\u2019s title to such intervening space or piece of land upon his taking possession thereof in succession to Leslie, would have been as appears by the evidence a perfectly good indefeasible statutory title had he chosen to insist upon such title. However, by an indenture bearing date the 22nd day of January, 1885, the said John Smith in consideration of sum of one thousand dollars paid to him by the plaintiff Grooderham did grant unto the said plaintiff to have and to hold to the sole use of himself, his heirs and assigns, for ever\nall and singular these certain parcels of land and premises, situate, lying and being in the city of Toronto, being part of broken lot no. 14, in front of the first concession from the Bay, composed of lots numbers 234, 242, 243, 342 and 351, according to registered plan 105, and by said indenture be released to the said plaintiff all his claims upon the said land.\nThe operation of that release is by statute declared to be,\nto exonerate and discharge the releasee from all claims and demands whatsoever which the releasor might or could have upon the releasee in respect of the said lands or upon the said lands.\nAnd by an indenture of lease of the same date he demised and let to the said plaintiff the \u201clot 346\u201d according to registered plan number 105 to have and to hold for the term of 21 years, to be computed from the said 22nd day of January, 1885, which term was further extended by an indenture bearing date the 21st day of December, 1888, for a further period of 21 years, or in all 42 years from the 22nd January, 1885.\nIt cannot, I apprehend, be doubted that at the time of the passing of the Ontario Act 50 Vic. ch. 25, that is to say, in April, 1887, the plaintiff Grooderham was solely and absolutely seized of an indefeasible estate of inheritance in fee simple in the whole of that part of the east half of the said broken front lot no. 14, which lies south of South Park Street, and also in so much of the west half of that lot south of South Park Street as is designated upon the said plan as Saulter Street, the same having at that time been held inclosed with the east half of the said lot south of South Park Street by the said plaintiff and those under whom he claims for 23 years, freed and absolutely discharged from all claims whatsoever of all persons whomsoever, save only such private claim as the said John Smith could assert by reason of the said plaintiff having accepted from him the said lease of the said lot number 346; what may be the nature and extent of such claims we are not called upon to determine in the present case; that is a matter in which John Smith is himself alone concerned, and which can be entertained and adjudicated upon only in a suit properly instituted by himself; what we are concerned with at present is only a claim asserted by the defendants, the city of Toronto, on behalf of the public, for which there is not any foundation whatever, unless it can be established, as is contended that it can be and is, upon a true construction of the Ontario statute 50 Vic. ch. 25.\nIn order to arrive at a true construction of that statute the most material element to be considered is the condition in which the land in respect of which the litigation arises, and the plaintiff Gooderham\u2019s title thereto, was at the time of the passing of the said Act.\nThe statute law bearing on the question under consideration before the passing of the said act, was as follows:\nBy the Revised Statutes of Ontario of 1877, ch. 146, sec. 67, which was simply a re\u2011enactment of a law in force ever since municipal institutions were established in Canada in 1849, it was enacted as follows:\u2014\nWhereas towns and villages in Ontario have been, or may be, surveyed and laid out by companies and individuals, and by different owners of the land comprising the same, and lands may have been or may be sold therein according to the surveys and plans thereof; therefore all allowances for roads, streets or commons which have been surveyed in such towns and villages and laid down on the plans thereof, and upon which lots of land fronting on or adjoining such allowances for roads, streets or commons have been or may be sold to purchasers, shall be public highways, streets and commons, and all lines which have been or may be run and the courses thereof given in the survey of such towns and villages and laid down on the plans thereof, and all posts or monuments which have been or may be placed or planted in the first survey of such towns and villages to designate or define any such allowances for roads, streets, lots or commons, shall be the true and unalterable lines and boundaries thereof respectively.\nSections 524 and 531 of the Ontario statute 46 Vic. ch. 18, which are but re-enactments of similar sections which had been in force ever since the passing of the act of the late province of United Canada in 1858, viz, 22 Vic. ch. 22, secs. 300, 322 and 323, were enacted for the purpose of determining and defining what roads were public roads and the rights and liabilities of municipal corporations in respect thereof. 46 Vic. ch. 18 enacts as follows:\nSec. 524. All allowances made for roads by the crown surveyors in any town, township or place already laid out or hereafter laid out, and also all roads laid out by virtue of any statute or any road whereon the public money has been expended for opening the same or whereon the statute labour has been usually performed, or any roads passing through the Indian lands, shall be deemed common and public highways unless where such roads have been already altered or may hereafter be altered according to law.\nSec. 531. Every public road, street, bridge and highway shall be kept in repair by the corporation and in default of the corporation so to keep in repair the corporation shall besides being subject to any punishment provided by law be civilly responsible for all damages sustained by any person by reason of such default but the action must be brought within three months after the damages have been sustained.\n2. This section shall not apply to any road, street, bridge or highway laid out by any private person, and the corporation shall not be liable to keep in repair any such last mentioned road, street, bridge or highway until established by by-law of the corporation, or otherwise assumed for public user by such corporation.\nThe act then repeats sec. 1 of 13 & 14 Vic. ch. 15, as still in force as follows:\nThe right to use as public all roads, streets, and public highways within the limits of any city or incorporated town in the province shall be vested in the municipal corporation of such city or incorporated town (except in so far as the right of property or other light in the land occupied by such highways have been expressly reserved by some private party when first used as such roads, streets or highway and except as to any concession road or side road within the city or town where the persons now in possession or those under whom they claim have laid out streets in such city or town without any compensation therefor in lieu of such concession or side road.)\nFrom these sections it appears to be clear, 1st, that the right of the public or a municipal corporation to use as a public highway a road or street laid out by a private person on his own property applied only to such roads or streets as were in actual use as private roads or ways to property purchased by parties, and fronting on such roads or streets.\n2nd. This right was qualified by such reservations as might have been made by the person laying out such road or street when first used as such road or street, showing very clearly, I think, that the user of such road or street as a private road or street was an essential condition precedent to the public or the municipality being in a position to acquire a right to use it as a public highway.\n3rd. A private road so in use was liable to be made a public road or highway by the application of public money for keeping it in repair and in a condition fit to be used, but until so converted from a private road or street into a public road or street the municipality were by 46 Vic. ch. 18, sec. 531, declared to be under no responsibility to keep it in repair, or liability to persons injured by its not being kept in a sufficient state of repair. In fine there must have been a private road or street in actual existence and used as a private road in order to its being converted into a public road or highway. Now from the title of the plaintiff Gooderham, as above shown to the inclosed pasture field, of which he and those under whom he claimed had actual occupation for over 23 years at the time of the passing of the Act 50 Vic. ch. 25, sec. 62, no part of that inclosure could then have been acquired for public use as a public road, street or highway, otherwise than by statutory expropriation and payment of compensation to Gooderham for the land taken for such purpose.\nThe question before us therefore simply is: Does that Act divest Gooderham of the title and right which, under such title, he had in the lands under consideration immediately before the passing of the Act, and appropriates any part of such, his property, to public use as public streets and highways? It is admitted on all hands that if the Act must be construed as so doing it would work a great injustice to the plaintiff, for which there is no precedent in legislation, and which would be in direct conflict with the provisions of the statute as to the acquisition of private property for public purposes upon payment of compensation.\nMr. Justice Osler, while admitting the injustice which such a construction works, and while recognizing the duty of the courts to avoid, if possible, attributing to the legislature the intention of committing such an injustice, thinks that intention too plainly expressed to leave to the courts any discretion.\nMr. Justice Burton relieves the legislature from the imputation of injustice in a judgment from which, before I should dissent, I should have to give it further consideration if I thought it necessary to the determination of this case that it should rest upon the view there taken. But in my opinion there is really no just ground for imputing to the legislature the unjust intention imputed. The act, properly construed, warrants no such imputation, and in fact is not, in my opinion, open to the construction insisted upon by the defendants and put upon it by the judgment appealed from. The Act, in its sixty-second section, simply re-enacts the provisions of the old section 67 of ch. 146 of R.S.O. of 1877, omitting the preamble, and for the words \u201ctowns and villages\u201d substituting the words \u201ccities, towns and villages, or any part thereof,\u201d and adding, as a proviso, the enactment in subsection 2 of sec. 531 of 46 Vic. ch. 18 above extracted. The language used in the section cannot reasonably be construed as affecting, or as intending to affect, any property so situated as to title as the property of the plaintiff under consideration is, nor, as regards the time past, anything else than roads or streets which at the time of the passing of the act were then already in existence as private roads, to the use of which purchasers of property abutting thereon were then entitled, which roads and streets so in existence the section under consideration subject to the proviso as to the non-liability of the corporation to keep the same in repair converted into public highways. That being, as I think it is, the true construction of the section the appeal must be allowed with costs and a decree be ordered to issue in the court below with a declaration that the lands the right to open which as public highways the defendants claim are not public highways by force of the said statute or otherwise, with costs in the courts below to be paid by the defendants to the plaintiff. A declaration to this effect will be sufficient to protect the rights of the plaintiff, and cannot prejudice any private right if any which the plaintiff\u2019s lessor John Smith may have in respect of the said lot no. 346 and by reason of the plaintiff Gooderham having accepted such lease thereof.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Beatty, Blackstock, Nesbitt & Chadwick.\nSolicitor for the respondent: Thomas Caswell.\n[1] 11 Ont.

McClelland (Plaintiff) Respondent.\n1894: October 17, 18; 1895: March 11.\nPresent: Sir Henry Strong C.J., and Taschereau, Gwynne, Sedgewick and King JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.\nVendor and purchaser\u2014Sale of lands\u2014Waiver of objections\u2014Lapse of time\u2014Will, construction of\u2014Executory devise over\u2014Defeasible title\u2014Rescission of contract.\nAn agreement for the sale and purchase of land contained the provision that the vendee should examine the title at his own expense and have ten days from the date of the agreement for that purpose, and should be \u201cdeemed to have waived all objections to title not raised within that time.\u201d\nUpon the investigation of the title by the purchaser it appeared that the vendors derived title through one P. a purchaser from one B.S., a devisee under a will by which the land in question was devised by the testatrix to her daughter the said B.S. and certain other land to another daughter; the will contained the direction that \u201cif either daughter should die without lawful issue the part and portion of the deceased shall revert to the surviving daughter,\u201d and a gift over in case both daughters should die without issue. At the time of the agreement B.S. was alive and had children. An objection was taken to the title but not within the ten days from the date of the agreement. The purchasers brought a suit for specific performance, or rescission of the contract.\nHeld, reversing the judgment of the court below, that although B.S. took an estate in fee simple subject to the executory devise over in case she should die without issue living at her death, inasmuch as the purchaser would get a present holding title accompanied by possession, the objection taken did not go to the root of the title and was one to which effect could not be given, not having been taken within the time limited by the agreement.\nAPPEAL from decisions of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1], affirming judgments rendered in the High Court of Justice[2] in favour of the respective plaintiffs.\nCertain lands were devised in two separate lots in fee to the testator\u2019s two daughters Anne and Bridget, with the following proviso:\n\u201cAnd be it understood that if either of my daughters die without lawful issue the part and portion of the deceased shall revert to the surviving daughter, and in the case of both dying without issue then I authorize my executors, together with the pastor of St. Paul\u2019s Church and my brother Michael Murnan, to subdivide the estate, or the proceeds of the estate, amongst my relatives, as those gentlemen whom I have appointed for that purpose may deem right and equitable in their prudence, justice and charity.\nThe appellants having acquired title through the devisees made agreements for the sale of certain portions of the lands to the respondents respectively. The agreements each contained the provision that the vendee should be obliged to examine the title at his own expense, and should have ten days from the date thereof for that purpose, and should be deemed to have waived all objections to title not raised within that time, the vendors not to furnish abstract of title, title deeds or copies thereof, or any evidences of title other than those in their own possession. And it was expressly provided that time should be considered the essence of the agreement.\nSpecific objections to the title were not made within the time specified, and the vendees went into possession of their respective lots, but after the payment of several instalments under the agreements the defects in the title were discovered, and suits were brought by the respondents for specific performance, or in the alternative for rescission of the agreements and the return of the moneys so paid.\nCook and Macdonald for the several appellants. The agreement is explicit that all objections to title not made within ten days shall be deemed to be waived. In Rosenberg v. Cook[3], a similar time limit bound the vendee. See also Imperial Bank v. Metcalfe[4].\nA vendee may agree to take the vendor\u2019s title without question and in such case he must accept whatever the vendor is able to give. Duke v. Barnett[5].\nThe vendees did not elect promptly to disaffirm and must abide by the contract. Robinson v. Harris[6]. And see also re Gloag and Miller\u2019s Contract[7]; Bown v. Stenson[8].\nArmour Q.C. for the respondents Nason and Wright. It is admitted that the title is defective and the only question is whether or not the plaintiffs are estopped from disputing it by the agreement.\nCourts are unwilling to force defective titles on purchasers. Want v. Stallibrass[9]; Saxby v. Thomas[10]; Brown v. Pears[11]. The failure to object within the time does not oblige the vendees to accept a defective title. In re Marsh[12]; McIntosh v. Rogers[13]; Martin v. Magee[14].\nWaiver by vendee cannot be based on something he did not know. Blacklow v. Laws[15]; Want v. Stallibrass[16].\nMarsh Q.C. for the respondent McClelland and Lindsey for the respondent Wright referred to Harnett v. Baker[17]; Waddell v. Wolfe[18].\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by:\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014This is an action by a purchaser of land asking for specific performance of the contract, and that the vendor may be compelled to make out a good title, and in default of his so doing that the contract may be rescinded and part of the purchase money already paid may be ordered to be repaid.\nThe agreement for the sale and purchase contained the following provision:\nThe vendee to examine the title at his own expense and to have ten days from the date hereof for that purpose, and shall he deemed to have waived all objections to title not raised within that time, and should any valid objection to the title be raised that the said vendors cannot or are unwilling to remove they shall cancel this agreement and return the money paid. The vendors not to furnish abstract of title, title deeds or copies thereof or any evidences of title other than those in their own possession.\nUpon the investigation of the title by the purchaser it appeared that the vendors derived title through Henry Callender who was a purchaser from Bridget Sherwood a devisee under the will of Ann Paterson, and it is upon the construction of this will that the objection to the title now made by the respondent is founded. This question of construction was argued in both the courts below. The testatrix, Ann Paterson, devised the land in question to her daughter Bridget Sherwood and also devised other land to another daughter Ann Wallbridge. The will contained the following direction:\nAnd be it understood that if either of my daughters die without lawful issue the part and portion of the deceased shall revert to the surviving daughter.\nThen followed a gift over in case both daughters should die without issue.\nIt was held by Mr. Justice Street first, and then by the Court of Appeal, that the proper construction of this devise was that Bridget Sherwood took an estate in fee simple, subject to an executory devise over in case she should die without issue living at her death.\nThis construction, in which I entirely agree, has not been called in question by the appellant in this appeal.\nThe fact appeared to be that Bridget Sherwood was alive and had children. The vendors at the time of the sale had therefore an estate in fee simple, defeasible in the event of Bridget Sherwood dying without leaving issue living at her death; they had also the possession of the land.\nIt was sufficiently established in evidence that no objection to the title was taken within ten days, the time limited by the clause of the contract already stated.\nThe learned Chief Justice of Ontario and Mr. Justice Osler were of opinion, in accordance with the judgment of Mr. Justice Street, the trial judge, that the objection based on the defeasible nature of the vendor\u2019s title was still open to the purchasers, and that they were entitled to a rescission of the contract, whilst Mr. Justice Burton and Mr. Justice Maclennan were of the contrary opinion. It is an elementary principle that if a vendor contracts to sell land without any saving condition as to the nature of the title he is to confer upon the purchaser, the law implies that it is incumbent on him to make out a good title in fee simple. It is, however, of course, open to the parties to such a contract to agree that the vendor shall be relieved from this obligation\nThe question before us is whether they have done so by the agreement under consideration.\nIn carrying out a sale of land the vendor is in all cases bound to deliver an abstract showing a good title unless this duty is dispensed with by the contract. Here this obligation is expressly waived by the vendees. It is therefore not open to us in the present case, as has been done in some English cases, to confine the provision of the contract requiring objections to be taken in the limited time, to objections appearing on the abstract leaving other objections not disclosed by the abstract, but discovered by the vendee, at large, to be taken at any time. In the face of the positive stipulation of the parties this could not be done here without altering the contract.\nWe are therefore brought face to face with the question whether we can altogether disregard the condition before referred to, for if it does not apply to an objection like that which has been taken it can have no operation whatever. Where the terms of the contract require the vendor to make out a title in fee simple and there is a condition like the present, and it is made to appear that the vendor has nothing at all to sell, not even the possession, it has been held that such an objection going to the \u201croot of the title,\u201d as it has been termed, is not precluded by a condition expressed in like terms with that under consideration.\nIn the case of Re Tanqueray-Willaume & Landau[19], the question arose on a contract of sale entered into by executors, who claimed to have an implied power of sale. Mr. Justice Kay held that the purchaser who did not take the objection within the time required by the condition of sale was nevertheless not concluded by it, saying\u2014\nI think the condition in these conditions of sale does not prevent the purchaser from raising an objection of that kind because it goes to the root of the whole matter.\nThis case was carried to appeal, but the Court of Appeal holding that the vendors had the power of sale which they had claimed to exercise the point in question did not there arise.\nWant v. Stallibrass[20], was an action by a purchaser to recover his deposit. The vendors were trustees under a will which conferred upon them a power of sale to arise on the death of a tenant for life. It appeared on the face of the abstract that this tenant for life was still alive. The power of sale had therefore not become exercisable, and the court held that the vendors, having nothing to convey, notwithstanding the objection had not been taken within the time required by the conditions of sale, the purchaser was entitled to recover his deposit.\nPollock B. there says:\nThe basis of the contract is that the vendor has a title, and although parties might by these conditions of sale waive even this I do not think the plaintiff has done so; on the contrary it appears to me that by failing to give any objection or requisition within the stipulated time he cannot be taken to have waived that which was the foundation of the whole contract, and which on the face of the defendant\u2019s own abstract is shewn not to exist.\nIn both the cases just referred to it is apparent that there was a total failure of consideration and that the vendee, if he had been compelled to pay his purchase money, would have got nothing whatever for it. In the present case the purchaser will get a present holding title accompanied with possession, a title in fee, defeasible it is true upon the happening of a contingency, and therefore not a marketable title, but still a title, though a precarious one. The objection here taken is therefore one which does not go to the root of the title.\nIn Rosenberg v. Cook[21], where the purchaser got nothing but possession, it was held by the Court of Appeal that he was bound by a condition requiring him to take objections in a limited time. It is true that in that case the particulars of sale did disclose that the vendor was not selling an absolutely good title. The judgment of Jessel M.R., however, shews that he was not inclined to treat such conditions as the present as merely illusory stipulations.\nIn the present case if we do not give effect to the terms of the contract we defeat the intention of the parties and, as Mr. Justice Burton observes, make a new contract for them, for if it was open to the purchaser to take the objection relied on all objections shewing that the vendors could not make a good title would also have been open indefinitely in point of time, and the clause in question would have been altogether reduced to silence. This, I think, cannot be done. I am therefore of opinion that we must allow the appeal with costs and judgment must be entered in the court below for a specific performance of the contract as claimed by the plaintiff, but without any inquiry as to title which he must, for the reasons before stated, be deemed to have waived. Had this been a vendor\u2019s action for specific performance different considerations might have been open, since the remedy of specific performance is one subject to the judicial discretion of the court. The appellants are entitled to costs in the Court of Appeal, but not in the Divisional Court.\nArmstrong v. McClelland was argued at the same time as Armstrong v. Cook and the pleadings and evidence are the same; the same judgment must therefore be entered in that case.\nArmstrong v. Wright.\nI agree with the Court of Appeal, that the objection to the title was sufficiently taken within the ten days. That appeal must therefore be dismissed with costs.\nAppeals against Nason and McClelland allowed with costs. Appeal against Wright dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Cook, Macdonald & Briggs.\nSolicitor for the respondent Nason: Joseph Nason.\nSolicitors for the respondent Wright: Lindsay, Lindsay & Evans.\nSolicitors for the respondent McClelland: Smith & Smith.\n[1] 21 Ont.

Ex parte Oriental Commercial Bank (5 Ch. App. 358) followed APPEAL from a decision of the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada (appeal side) ([1]), reversing the judgment of the Superior Court, District of Quebec ([2]). m an action brought to revendicate six \u00a1bonds of the Quebec Turnpike Trust from the possession of the defendant, by which the defendant had been condemned to restore the bonds to plaintiffs.\nThe facts of the case appear from the head note and are fully set out in the judgment of the court pronounced by His Lordship the Chief Justice.\nStuart Q.C. for the appellants.\nLanglois Q.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by :\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014The appellants who are the plaintiffs in the action are legatees under the will of the late David Douglas Young. The action is brought to revendicate from the possession of the defendant, the present respondent, six bonds or debentures issued by the Quebec Turnpike Trust, numbered, 3, 4, 5, 16, 17 and 51, the aggregate face value of which amounted to $5,000 and upon which debentures some ten years arrears of interest was due.\nThe defence set up by the respondent in his pleadings was that having been for twenty years and up wards a stock and share broker and private banker one Welch had been in the habit of borrowing large sums from him and pledging bonds as security for such loans; that Welch was indebted to him in the sum of $6,125 the amount of certain promissory notes discounted by him for Welch, and including a sum of $800 lent to the appellants through the minis try of Welch, and to secure the payment of which the bonds in question had been pledged by Welch as being his own property; that Welch was insolvent and the defendant did not know to whom the bonds belonged; that they were in the possession of Welch apparently as owner; and he prayed for the dismissal of the action unless the plaintiffs preferred to pay $6,126 and the costs.\nThe plaintiffs replied that Welch was the administrator of their father's estate and as such was intrusted with the custody and safe keeping of the bonds in question but was not authorized to deal with them in any way; that it was a matter of public notoriety that Welch was the administrator of the estate of the appellants' late father, and that such fact was known to the defendant at the time he took the bonds from the defendant Welch; that the defendant was also aware that Welch had been unfortunate in business and was not possessed of property in his own right; that the bonds in question were publicly advertised for in a Quebec newspaper, the \" Morning Chronicle,\" on the 18th July, 1883, as having been lost, and that they had been the subject matter of correspondence in the same news paper; that in the year 1883 the bonds had been filed as exhibits in a cause pending in the Superior Court wherein Rattray was plaintiff and the heirs Young were defendants, and they were indorsed as exhibits in that cause and still bore such indorsement when received by the defendant from Welch, by which it was rendered apparent that the bonds were the property of the appellants; that in consequence of the knowledge which the defendant had of the position which Welch occupied towards the appellants, and others he was bound to have made reasonable inquiry as to the ownership of the bonds, and to have exercised due care before receiving them and that by reason of his neglect so to do the respondent was not a holder in good faith. And further, that Welch was not authorized to deal with the bonds in any way, and in pledging them Welch was guilty of a fraud and conveyed no title to the respondent who was a tortious holder inasmuch as the respondent was aware when he took the bonds that he was taking them from a per son who had no power to deal with them and who was therefore fraudulently converting them.\nThe case was heard before Mr. Justice Andrews. Both Welch and the respondent were examined as witnesses on behalf of the plaintiffs and Welch was also examined as a witness for the defendant. It was proved beyond question that Welch held the bonds which were the property of the appellants as the administrator of their father's estate; that he had improperly and . dishonestly pledged them with the respondent to se cure moneys which he had borrowed for his own use. There was however no evidence to establish that the defendant was not a bon\u00e2 fide holder of the debentures for valuable consideration except the fact that some four or five years before the respondent received the debentures there had been a controversy about them between one D. Rattray and the representatives of the estate of the late D D Young, and that this controversy had been the subject of correspondence in a Quebec newspaper, the \" Morning Chronicle,\" and in addition the further fact that three of the bonds bore an indorsement which indicated that they had been filed as exhibits in the Superior Court in an action there pending of Rattray v. Young.\nMr. Justice Andrews rendered a carefully considered judgment by which he condemned the respondent to restore the debentures to the appellants. The learned judge based this decision upon the ground that the defendant did not come within any of the exceptions to the rule of law that no one can confer a better title than he has himself* that the debentures were over due and consequently the respondent took no title The case of In re European Bank. Ex parle Oriental Commercial Bank ([3]) and other authorities were relied upon by the learned judge for the proposition that negotiable securities transferred after they were due were taken by any holder for value subject to all equities affecting them, including not merely equities belonging to prior parties to the paper but also to equities of third persons, and that this rule applied to the transfer of a security negotiable by delivery which had been transferred by an agent in fraud of his principal.\nThe Court of Queen's Bench on appeal reversed this decision holding that the debentures in question were negotiable securities; that even though they were overdue that affected only their exigibility as against the parties (makers or indorsers) who were liable on the paper itself and did not apply to the case of an agent who had negotiated a security in fraud of his principal; further, that the debentures in question had been used and dealt with in the market in such a way that they could not be considered as overdue securities; and lastly, that the appellants by reason of their having placed securities transferable by delivery in the hands of an agent and thus having conferred power upon that agent to negotiate them, were estopped as against a bon\u00e2 fide holder for value, as the respondent was held to be from asserting their title to his prejudice, and for these reasons the court allowed the appeal and dismissed the action.\nI am of opinion that the court of Queen's Bench was in all respects right in holding that the respondents had no notice of the appellants' title to the bonds in question. Neither the fact of the publication of the advertisement nor the marking of the bonds as exhibits in a former action were sufficient to establish that fact. The evidence of the brokers and bankers who were called as witnesses for the appellants was strictly inadmissible, the subject of inquiry not being one in which the evidence of experts is admissible. To give effect to the opinions of these gentlemen would be to substitute them for the court on the trial of an ordinary question of fact.\nI do not agree with the Court of Queen's Bench that in general a bon\u00e2 fide holder who acquires ordinary commercial paper such as bills or notes after dishonour takes subject only to the equities of prior parties to the paper. Upon this point I agree with Mr. Justice Andrews that not merely the equities of prior parties, but also those of third parties, may be enforced against such holders. This is the effect of the decision in in re European Bank. Ex parte Oriental Commercial Bank ([4]) and I think we ought to follow that authority. In the view I take, however, this point is immaterial. It is also unnecessary to deter mine another question on which I have much doubt, namely, whether these bonds, especially having regard to the statutory authority under which they were issued and to the way in which they have been dealt with in the market, are for this purpose to be considered as ordinary mercantile securities such as bills and notes. Many American cases would seem to show that they are.\nThe ratio decidendi which I proceed upon in holding that the respondent is entitled to be protected as a bona fide holder is that of estoppel, a ground strongly relied upon in the judgment of Mr. Justice Hall in the Court of Queen's Bench. I am of opinion that the appellants, having placed their bonds, transferable by delivery, in Welch's hands, and having thus enabled him to deal with them as his own, are now, when he has committed a fraud which must result in a loss either to themselves or to the respondent, precluded from asserting their title in such a way as to throw the loss upon the respondent. In applying this principle of estoppel it appears to me that the circumstance of the bonds being overdue is of no importance. This doctrine has for its support very high and late authority. The cases of Goodwin v. Robarts ([5]); Rumball v. Metropolitan Bank ([6]); London Joint Stock Bank v Simmons ([7]); Bentinck v. London Joint Stock Bank ([8]); are all authorities strongly supporting the judgment of Mr. Justice Hall in this respect\nIn France, where the rule possession vaut applies generally to the transfer of title to movables (which are thus then on the same footing as these bonds transferable by delivery are with us) a similar doctrine is applied to such property, as is shown by Laurent ([9]) and Troplong ([10]).\nThe action having been brought for the revendication of the bonds, and not for their redemption I do not think we ought to interfere with the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench to provide relief for the appellants which they have not sought. Moreover, it is not clearly to be ascertained from the depositions for what amount the respondent is entitled to hold them in security. This may, probably, to some extent depend on the applicability and legal effect of article 1975 of the Quebec Civil Code. The judgment in this case will not, of course, in any way prejudice the rights of the appellants to maintain an action to redeem should the appellants be compelled to have recourse to such a remedy.\nThe appeal is dismissed with costs. FOURNIER J.\u2014I concur with Mr. Justice Taschereau's conclusion to allow this appeal and restore the judgment of the Superior Court.\nTASCHEREAU J. I would have no doubt on the question of the legality of MacNider's title as a pledgee to these debentures if he had acquired them in good faith. There is no room, in my opinion, for the appellants' contention that the law of the province of Quebec which governs this case differs now on this point from the law of France as to such titres au porteur notwithstanding the difference in the wording of art. 2268 of the Quebec code and the corresponding art. 2279 of the French code.\nThe owner of negotiable securities payable to bearer and transferable by mere delivery who intrusts an agent with the possession thereof, gives him, ipso facto, in law, towards third parties in good faith, the right to effectually sell or pledge them. In constituting his agent the apparent absolute owner of these securities, and conferring upon him all the indicia of ownership. he precludes himself from disputing the title of any subsequent boni tide transferee. Or, to put it in another way, the agent stands in the same position as if he had a power of attorney from the owner, authorizing him to deal with the securities in his own name, as he might think fit Or in other words airain as laid down in Smith's Mercantile Law ([11]) on the same principle in reference to agents generally :\nHe who accredits another by employing him must abide by the effects of that credit and will be bound by contracts made with innocent third persons in the seeming course of that employment, and on the faith of that credit whether the employer intended to authorize him or not, since, when one of two innocent persons must suffer by the fraud of a third, he who enabled that third person to commit the fraud should be the sufferer 2 Leroux, Prescr. nos. 1324, 1328 : Buch\u00e8re, les valeurs mobili\u00e8res nos. 802-816; Troplong, Nantisse ment, nos. 74-76, Prescript. nos. 1055, 1286 et seq. 2 Pardessus dr. comm. nos 181 313 483 ; de Folle ville, de la possession des meubles et titres au porteur, nos. 23 25 36 61 bis 116 331 590; 32 Laurent nos. 568, 575, 598; Boileux, vol. 7, p. 882; 3 Delv. 438; 4 Aubry & Ran, par. 432, notes 1 and 12; Dall. 29, 1, 384 52,5 427; 58 1. 238; B\u00e9darride Achats et ventes No. 21 ' Per Fournier .1. in Sweeny v. Bank of Montreal ([12])\nArt. 1573 C.0. supports the respondent's contention on this point, though negatively, that the simple transfer from hand to hand of such securities confers a perfect title adversus omnes.\nThe second part of art. 1027 is also based on the doctrine that possession of movable property is equivalent to a title. And in the case of $weeny v. The Bank of Montreal (1) it is evident that in all the courts but for the fact that the bank had been put upon inquiry the transfer by Rose of the securities in question in that case would have been held perfectly valid as against the true owner.\nThe question is open to still less doubt here, as the securities pledged to MacNider are payable to bearer titres an porteur, whilst in Sweeny's case, to give a title to the transferee a regular transfer of the securities there under litigation had to be made in the hooks of the company by which they had been issued.\nI would also adopt without hesitation the Court of Appeal's opinion as expressed by Mr. Justice Hall, that the Jaw as to the transfer of overdue securities that the transferee acquires no better title than the transferer had does not affect MacNider's title, assuming that art. 2287 C.C. (which would govern here, as these debentures were pledged to MacNider before the passing of the Bills of Exchange Act of 1890) extends to debentures of this nature. The judgment of the Superior Court on this point was, in my opinion, erroneous.\nThe only question that could be raised under that article were it applicable is : What title did Welch have as against the Turnpike Trust? And that would bring us back to the question whether the possession of a security payable to bearer is equivalent to a title. And unquestionably, as against the Turnpike Trust, Welch's title was perfect, and a payment in good faith by the company to him would have been unassailable. Welch could have maintained an action against the company, and there were no equities between him and the company that the company could have opposed to him. For \" the equities of the bill, not the equities of the parties \" ([13]), can alone be a defence by the maker of such an instrument.\nMacNider's title cannot be less valid as against the Turnpike Trust, than Welch's was. That is, however, what the appellants' contentions would lead to. There is nothing to help the appellants' case on this point in Daniel on negotiable instruments, relied upon by them, and by the Superior Court, though the passage they quote read alone would seem at first to bear them out. But cavendum est a fragmentis, and a reference to pars. 725 725a 722 786 803 and 1192 of the book makes it clear that what is intended by the writer is that It is only as against the maker that the transferee's title to overdue securities is not better than the transferer's. I refer to Fairclough v. Pav\u00eda ([14]); Byles on Bills ([15]); Chalmers v. Lanion ([16]); Randolph on Commercial paper ([17]); Brooks v. Clegg ([18]); Pothier, Chang ([19]) 2 B\u00e9darride Dr. com ([20]); ler Pardessus. Lettre de change ([21]); Ruben de Couder, Diet. de dr. com. ([22]).\nThe case of Tinson v. Francis ([23]), is quite distinguish able There the plaintiff's transferer could not have maintained an action against the maker.\nMalins V.C. in Ex parte Swan ([24]) said :\nThe broad proposition that the transferee of a bill after dishonour can under no circumstances have a better right against the acceptor than the drawer would have cannot at this day he maintained\nThere are cases from the United States courts that would seem to support the appellants' case on this point, but they are not governing authorities.\nThen, were it necessary to determine the point, I would doubt very much if that rule and article 2287 of the Code apply at all to promissory notes or securities payable to bearer. 2 Pardessus ([25]); Courty v. de B\u00e9ville ([26]); Sirey ([27]). For when a security payable to bearer is transfered by delivery the transferer is no longer a party to it. Story on Promissory Notes, par. 117; Ball. ([28]) cites a case directly in point. The maker is the bearer's direct debtor and there is no privity between the maker and the previous holders. Lyon-Gaen ([29]). In Cols v. Du four Clarat ([30]) it is expressly held in that sense, that the holder of a security payable to bearer is the immediate creditor of the maker who cannot oppose to him the exceptions that he would have had against previous holders. See also Barrois v. Grimonprez ([31]). These . debentures, moreover, are not promissory notes and art. 2287 0. C. is not applicable at all in the province of Quebec to debentures or like securities, even payable to order. I am not disposed to think M that, as the appellants' contention on this point would import, the words \" Bills of Exchange and Promissory notes \" in sec 91 of the British North America Act can be construed as including such debentures, and that the Federal Parliament has now exclusive legislative power over them as it has over bills of exchange and promissory notes. They are securities of the kind known under the French law as effets publics ([32]), reimbursable out of a certain fund which said fund has always been held in the province not to be seizable under execution. 4 Vic. ch. 17 sees. 21 27; 16 Vic. ch. 235, sec. 7; The Queen v. Belleau ([33]). I have not seen a single case, or a single text book where such securities have been called promissory notes or considered as such. And if these debentures are not promissory notes the case i$ governed exclusively by the French law and the Quebec Code. As said by Sir Montague Smith, in the Privy Council, in the case of Bell v. Corporation of Quebec ([34]), English and American decisions are not governing authorities in the province. Except as to the rules of evidence art. 1206 C. C., and to a certain extent as to promissory notes, by a special article of the code (art. 2340), in force as to this case, the commercial law of the province of Quebec as a general rule, is the French law.\nUpon the contention that a commercial contract is governed by the English law in the province of Quebec Aylwin J. said, in The Montreal Assurance Co. v. McGillivray ([35]) :\nA more dangerous error than this could not be committed; commercial contracts like all others are governed by the law of Lower Canada. It is in proof only of commercial matters that the rules of evidence of the law of England and are to be resorted to\nNow, under the French law, the appellants have not been able to cite a single authority that bears out their contentions and. the conclusions reached by the Superior Court in their favour on this point. I would on this point as on the first think their contention unfounded.\nHowever, I dissent from the judgment about to be rendered and I would have allowed this appeal on the ground that the respondent was not justified in taking these debentures from Welch without making the inquiry which the circumstances, to my mind, cught to have suggested to him, and that the consequence of his forbearance to do so must be held fatal to the pledge he accepted from Welch. He shut his eyes not to see; he put no questions, not to know. For we must assume that Welch would not have told an un truth if he had been asked to whom those debentures belonged. May v Chapman ([36]).\nThe facts are not disputed and this part of the case depends on inferences from the undisputed facts proved in the case, and so is, consequently, fully open to the appellants upon this appeal. And that being so no assistance can be had from a reference to the cases of London Joint Stock Bank v. Simmons ([37]); or Bentinck v. London Joint Stock Bank ([38]) and cases of that class. As said by Lord Haisbury in the Simmons case. \" no one case can be an authority for another,\" when the solution rests on the evidence.\nThe following facts are disclosed by the oral and documentary evidence in the present case : The respondent knew that Welch was a mere agent and had no business but the business of others He knew that the Young estate were owners of debentures of this same Turnpike Trust, and that they, having lost trace of them had some years previously advertised for them in the Quebec newspapers, through this very same Welch as their agent. He saw the Young's estates name indorsed on three of these debentures, or a tag as it were attached to each of them, bearing their name; as he well knew the Rattray thereon mentioned had had possession of them only as agent for the estate; he knew that Welch had some years previously made a disastrous failure from the effects of which he had never recovered; he also knew that Welch had succeeded Rattray as agent and administrator of the Young estate; he, in fact, as appears by his own plea, lent money to the Young estate through Welch as their agent. NOW, when he received these debentures from Welch, three of which were indorsed, as I re marked, so as to show that they had certainly, at one time, been part of that estate, whose agent Welch then was to his knowledge, and so bearing on their face an unmistakeable mark of infirmity it was incumbent upon him, in my opinion, to make inquiries as to Welch's right to dispose of them. Laurent ([39]).\nWhen there exist circumstances of a nature to arouse suspicion, says the Cour de Cassation inferentially ([40]), or, as says the Court of Appeal at Rouen in Fiat y. Weismann ([41]) :\nLorsqu'une circonstance accessoire et concomitante est venue \u00e9veiller les soup\u00e7ons sur la. loyaut\u00e9 du vendeur,\nthe purchaser or pledgee of securities, payable to bearer, should require the seller or pledger to justify his right to sell them\nBy wilfully shutting his eyes in such a dealing with a man whose business was essentially one of a fiduciary character McNider was not acting in good faith in the eyes of the law, whatever views the mercantile community, according to its present standard of morality, may entertain upon the matter. Jones on Pledges, 104, 105.\nOne of his own witnesses, McGie, a stock broker of twenty-five years standing, swears that, with the indorsement, Rattray v. Young, on these debentures, he would rather have had nothing to do with them. And Dean swears that, under the circumstances, he would not have advanced money to Welch upon these debentures without making some inquiry as to his powers.\nDumoulin, manager of the People's Bank, also brought in by the respondent testified in the same sense that he would have inquired from Welch about his right to these debentures if he Welch had offered them to the bank. These two witnesses, it is true, would have limited their suspicions of Welch's dealing with those debentures to the three so indorsed. But to my mind, the very name of Young in connection with any of them should have suggested to the respondent that they might possibly all of them belong to the Young estate, as he well knew that Welch was the administrator of that estate and that he was not in a financial position so flourishing as to be the owner of this amount of valuables. In fact even without these indorsements, MacNider would have shown more prudence under the circumstances, with his perfect knowledge of Welch's financial status and of his occupation, not to take these debentures from him before asking him if he had the right to dispose of them.\nOne taking under such circumstances a pledge of negotiable securities from another who is notoriously but an agent and professes to be only an agent, cannot infer the agent's authority to pledge them. He is bound to inquire and know what his authority is. Cooke v. Eshelby ([42]); Jones on Pledges, 493. But here, MacNider was afraid of the answer, and that is why, in my opinion, he did not put the question. He might have known but he preferred not to know, so as not to lose, perhaps, a good bargain. He avoided making inquiries, because they might be injurious to him. Jones v. Gordon ([43]).\nAnd when, as here, the securities pledged are overdue, the pledgee is still less justifiable in having accepted them without inquiry. For \" where a note of hand,\" (and I cannot see why this should not apply to debentures) \" is assigned after maturity, and there is fraud in the transaction the law on slight grounds will pre sume that the indorsee had knowledge of the fraud, if it appears that he omitted to satisfy himself as to the validity of the note.\" Such is the law laid down long ago in the Court of King's Bench at Quebec in a case of Hunt v. Lee ([44]). In Taylor v. Mather (note to Brown v. Davis) ([45]), Buller J. had previously held that where there is fraud in the transfer of a negotiable instrument if it be made after maturity, the slightest circumstance will be sufficient to imply notice. And it must be remembered that whilst mere possession of a negotiable instrument payable to bearer is a prima facie evidence of the holders's good faith yet that applies only to any holder taking the bill before maturity. But where such an instrument has been fraudulently disposed of by the owner's agent, as in the present case, and an action is brought by the owner against the holder proof of the fraud will throw on the holder the burden of \"proving his good faith, especially if he had received the security after maturity. Randolph on Commercial Paper, pars. 159,160,1026, 1683. Art. 2202 C.C. has then no application. The plaintiff having proved his title the onus of proving a possession sufficient to defeat that title lies on the defendant.\nI have alluded to the fact that by his plea it appears that MacNider, besides the moneys lent to Welch, personally, lent money to the Young estate. Now he claims by the conclusion of his plea a right to pledge on these debentures as well for the loan he so made to the Young estate as for the loan he made to Welch personally. There was undoubtedly nothing to pre vent Welch from pledging his own debentures for a loan made to his principals. But I fail to see in MacNider's plea any contention of that nature. The plea simply claims a tacit pledge created by the operation of the law for the Young estate's debt. A special pledge of other securities had been given by Welch for this loan. Now if, on the face of his own allegations these debentures are by law security for his claim against the Young estate, it must be that they are the property of the Young estate. Without special allegations to that effect in the plea it cannot be assumed that a pledge held by MacNider for a debt due by the Young estate belongs to any one else than to the Young estate.\nFor these reasons the appeal should, in my opinion, be allowed with costs, and the dispositif of the judgment of the Superior Court should be restored.\nGWYNNE J and SEDGEWICK J. concurred in the judgment of the Chief Justice.\nKING J.\u2014I am of opinion that this appeal should be dismissed with costs for the reasons given in the judgment of the Chief Justice.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants : Caron, Pentland & Stuart.\nSolicitor for the respondent : C.

One of the rolls was set aside as null and the other was lost. The corporation obtained power from the legislature by two special acts to make new rolls, but in the meantime the property in question had been sold and conveyed by a deed with warranty containing a declaration that all taxes both special and general had been paid. New rolls were subsequently made assessing the lands for the same improvements and the purchaser paid the taxes and brought action against the vendor to recover the amounts so paid.\nHeld, affirming the judgments in the courts below, Gwynne J. dissenting, that as two taxes could not both exist for the same purpose at the same time, and the rolls made after the sale were therefore the only rolls in force, no taxes for the local improvements had been legally imposed till after the vendor had become owner of the lands, and that the warranty and declaration by the vendor did not oblige her to reimburse the purchaser for the payment of the special taxes apportioned against the lands subsequent to the sale.\nAPPEAL from the decision of the Court of Queen's Bench, affirming the judgment of the Superior Court, district of Montreal, dismissing the plaintiff's action by which she claimed tobe reimbursed moneys paid the corporation of the city of Montreal for assessments imposed on the lands in question for their proportion of the cost of widening Saint James street and St. Lambert street. In 1866 the owners of land fronting on St. James and St. Lambert streets in Montreal, petitioned the city council for the widening of the streets mentioned, the costs of the improvements to be assessed against the lands benefited thereby as provided by 27 & 28 Vic. ch. 60 and 29 & 30 Vic. ch. 56. The council granted the petitions, by r\u00e9solution, and the improvements were made during the year 1868. A special assessment was made apportioning upon the lands benefited the cost of the works in the same year and the property of the defendant was taxed thereby for $1,755 as the proportion of the cost of widening St. James street and for $650.63 as the proportion of widening St. Lambert street.\nIn 1873 defendant sold the lands to plaintiff and conveyed them by deed with the usual warranty containing a clause declaring that all taxes, both general and special, had been paid, and three days after the execution of the deed defendant paid the $1,755 assessed for the St. James street improvements to the corporation.\nThe roll imposing the rate for the St. James street improvements was contested and by decision of the Privy Council on 1st January, 1878, in the case of The City of Montreal v. Stevens ([1]), it was set aside as null on account of irregularities in the award of the commissioners, and the $1,755 paid by the defendant was returned to her by the corporation. On the application of the city council the act 42 & 43 Vic. ch. 53 was then passed, secs. 4 and 7 of which authorized the corporation to make a new roll which was afterwards done and the property in question therein assessed for $3,33 l for the cost of the same works. The assessment affecting properties benefited by the widening of St. Lambert street was also contested but no decision arrived at as during the pendency of the suit the roll was lost. The corporation again had recourse to the legislature and obtained the act 44 & 45 Vic. ch. 73 authorizing another new roll which was made in 1881 and the lands in question assessed therein for the St. Lambert street improvements at $650.63.\nThe plaintiff paid the taxes thus imposed and claimed reimbursement under the warranty and declaration contained in the deed but defendant refused payment on the ground that the lands had never been legally taxed until after her ownership had ceased, and that the warranty and declaration had reference only to the taxes legally due at the date of the sale.\nGeoffrion Q.C. and Charbonneau for appellant. As to the St. James street item the trouble is not the new assessment, but goes back to the r\u00e9solution when the city of Montreal, on the petition of the defendants auteurs ordered the street to be widened. The charge exists from that time, en germe and absolutely for the whole cost. The assessment roll does not create the charge but only distributes it.\nWe are not dealing now with a tax. In this case the proprietors join together and agree that the whole cost will be assessed between themselves under a competent authority. The corporation is acting the part of an arbitrator between the proprietors.\nThe amount assessed between the properties by both rolls was never the debt of the corporation but the joint debt of the different proprietors interested. It is only because the commissioners had separated two proceedings that the assessment roll was annulled in City of Montreal v. Stevens ([2]).\nAs to the St. Lambert street item the roll was not null but simply lost and the new roll was only a continuation or copy of it. Moreover the proportion of the two rolls being the same the respondent has no interest in the matter of warranty to contest said proportion. Levy v. Renauld ([3]).\nLajoie for respondent. At the. time the defendant sold the plaintiff the property neither tax was due or exigible. The Saint James Street roll was declared null, and the Saint Lambert Street roll was involved in a contestation during which it was lost and deprived of legal effect. It was only after the sale and in virtue of new and special legislation, that any apportionment creating a charge upon the property was made.\nThere is no material difference between assessments of this kind and ordinary taxes. The former are expressly assimilated to the latter by 27 & 28 Vic. ch. 60 sec. 24. Vide Dalloz ([4]); Monestier v. Vincent ([5]); Thibault v Robinson ([6]).\nIt is not enough that the charge may exist in a potential state in germ it must he full-born ([7]).\nThe \" new rolls of assessment \" provided for by 42 & 43 Vic. ch. 53, sec. 4, and 44 & 45 Vic. ch. 73, sec. 1 prove the non-existence of the old rolls. Before the new could be \"out into force the old \"were blotted out one by annulment the other by loss or destruction\nHow can a right be said to survive i in germ \" after it has been blotted out? Gross v. The Windsor Hotel Co. of Montreal ([8]).\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014I am of opinion that the appeal must be dismissed.\nAs to the St James street property the taxes paid by the appellant, and which he now seeks to recover from the respondent, were never legally imposed until after the sale. This was recognized by the city, who repaid the taxes she had paid them and then imposed new and legal taxes, but taxes not coming within the clause of guarantee in the deed of sale\nAs to the St. Lambert street property, I am equally of opinion that the respondent is not liable to make good what the appellant has had to pay. The roll upon which this assessment was originally imposed was lost and without it the taxes could never have been enforced but for the intervention of the legisla-ture. If the legislature had not intervened the respondent never would have been in any way liable for these taxes to the appellant. Then this ex post facto legislation was what obliged the appellant to pay. The respondent never agreed by the clause of warranty in the deed of sale to indemnify the appellant against such act of the legislature but only against taxes lawfully imposed at the date of the sale, end these appellant has never paid, though he has paid others of the same amount attributable, however, to another legal source, an altogether different obligation created by paramount authority since the sale. Therefore for the same reasons as those contained in the consid\u00e9rants of Mr. Justice Grill's judgment and in the notes of Mr. Justice Boss\u00e9 the appeal must be dismissed.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014Tant qu'\u00e0 l'item pour l'\u00e9largissement de la rue St. Jacques, je renverrais l'appel sans h\u00e9sitation. J'\u00e9carte le paiement de $1755 fait par l'intim\u00e9e \u00e0 la corporation peu de jours apr\u00e8s la vente \u00e0 l'appelante, et le remboursement de cette somme fait par la corporation \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e en 1878. Je ne vois pas que ni l'un ni l'autre puisse affecter la question en litige ici entre les parties. C'\u00e9tait un paiement indu, c'est-t-dire sans cause ou consid\u00e9ration et fait par erreur. L'acte qui autorise la corporation \u00e0 retenir ces paiements, et les imputer sur le nouveau r\u00f4le, ne fut pass\u00e9 que quelques mois apr\u00e8s le remboursement fait \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e. La corporation \u00e9tait donc l\u00e9galement tenue de rembourser l'intim\u00e9e tel qu'elle l'a fait le 15 ao\u00fbt. 1878 Le nouveau r\u00f4le d'ailleurs est lui-m\u00eame subs\u00e9quent. Il est date du 30 novembre 1878.\nJe pose la cause comme si en fait c'\u00e9tait l'intim\u00e9e qui sur contestation du r\u00f4le de r\u00e9partition l'e\u00fbt fait d\u00e9clarer nul d'une nullit\u00e9 de non esse, et ce avant la vente par elle \u00e0 l'appelante. C'est la m\u00eame question, pos\u00e9e d'une mani\u00e8re diff\u00e9rente sans doute, mais qui ainsi d\u00e9barrass\u00e9e des faits qui ne peuvent l'affecter rend plus lucide la question l\u00e9gale que, d'accord avec la cour Sup\u00e9rieure et la cour du Banc de la Reine, nous croyons devoir r\u00e9soudre en faveur de l'intim\u00e9e. Elle a vendu l'immeuble en question avec garantie de tous troubles et stipulation expresse que les taxes et cotisations g\u00e9n\u00e9rales et sp\u00e9ciales, y compris celles de l'ann\u00e9e courante avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 pav\u00e9es. Or, elle n'a Pu par l\u00e0 vouloir stipuler que pour ce qui \u00e9tait d et payable. Or il n'y avait alors rien d'\u00e9chu, rien de payable \u00e0 la corporation. C'est l\u00e0 l'effet r\u00e9troactif du jugement rendu plus tard annulant la r\u00e9partition. La doctrine que le vendeur r\u00e9pond de toute \u00e9viction dont le germe existait lors de la vente n'est pas applicable aux contributions publiques, on droits imposes par la loi elle-m\u00eame ([9]). Que l'acheteur conna\u00eet on est cens\u00e9 conna\u00eetre tout aussi bien que le vendeur.\nSi, par exemple, une r\u00e9partition pour la construction d'une \u00e9glise est faite payable pendant dix ans, et que soit, cinq ans apr\u00e8s cette r\u00e9partition, un immeuble qui y est affect\u00e9 est vendu avec garantie le vendeur est tenu de tous les arr\u00e9rages jusqu'\u00e0 la vente, mais la garantie ne couvrira pas les cinq ann\u00e9es \u00e0 \u00e9cheoir L'appelante voudrait faire remonter la taxe en question jusqu'\u00e0 la r\u00e9solution du conseil de ville de 1867. C'est par cette r\u00e9solution, dit-elle, que cette propri\u00e9t\u00e9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 tax\u00e9e pour le co\u00fbt de l'\u00e9largissement de la rue St. Jacques.\nMais cette pr\u00e9tention n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 accueillie par le jugement a quo, et ne pouvait l'\u00eatre.\nC'est l\u00e0, de la part de l'appelante, soutenir que si son achat e\u00fbt en lieu au lendemain m\u00eame de cette r\u00e9solution et des avant toute autre proc\u00e9dure, la garantie de l'intim\u00e9e se serait \u00e9tendue \u00e0 cette taxe. Or cette proposition est erron\u00e9e. Un immeuble n'est tax\u00e9 en pareil cas, et la corporation n'y a aucun droit que pour la r\u00e9partition qui \u00e9tablit le privil\u00e8ge, et non seulement son montant. Ou en d'autres termes, il n'y a pas de privil\u00e8ge, il n'y a pas de taxes, tant que le r\u00f4le n'en a pas fix\u00e9 le montant. La corporation n'a pas de cr\u00e9ance contre qui que ce soit, avant la r\u00e9partition.\nC'est dans ce r\u00f4le et son homologation, qu'est le d\u00e9cret, qui, pour la premi\u00e8re fois, affecte sp\u00e9cialement chacun des immeubles imposables. Et comment l'intim\u00e9e aurait-elle Pu payer une taxe dont le montant n'\u00e9taient pas \u00e9tablie, on payer avant que la taxe f\u00fbt due, payer sans cause, sans dette? Il est bien vrai que la r\u00e9solution du conseil de ville a des 1867, decr\u00e9t\u00e9 que les travaux requis pour l'\u00e9largissement de la rue St. Jacques seraient faits aux frais des propri\u00e9taires int\u00e9ress\u00e9s ut universi. Mais cette r\u00e9solution par elle seule n'a pas cr\u00e9\u00e9 de taxe sp\u00e9ciale sur chacun d'eux, ut singuli ni sur chacune de leurs propri\u00e9t\u00e9s.\nLa jurisprudence de la cour de Cassation nous fournit une cause d\u00e9cid\u00e9e dans ce sens. Elle est rapport\u00e9e dans Sirey ([10]). Le sommaire s'en lit comme suit:\nLe propri\u00e9taire ou l'habitant d'une commune qui post\u00e9rieurement \u00e0 un jugement pronon\u00e7ant au profit d'un tiers des condamnations p\u00e9cuniaires contre cette commune, vend les propri\u00e9t\u00e9s qui y sont situ\u00e9es, n'est pas tenu de garantir l'acqu\u00e9reur des charges que fait peser sur lui une ordonnance post\u00e9rieure, qu'\u00e9tablit une contribution suppl\u00e9mentaire sur toutes l'es propri\u00e9t\u00e9s situ\u00e9es dans la Commune pour parvenir \u00e0 l'acquittement de ces condamnations.\nCette d\u00e9cision a, dans l'esp\u00e8ce, une application enti\u00e8re\nIci, le jugement c'est la r\u00e9solution de. 1867 et le r\u00f4le de 1878, est l'ordonnance post\u00e9rieure \u00e0 l'acquisition de l'appelante. Je ne parle plus de celui de 1868. Celui-l\u00e0, je l'ai dit, est frapp\u00e9, ab initio de nullit\u00e9 de non esse, defectustus potestactis, nullitas nullitatum.\nL'obligation cr\u00e9\u00e9e en 1867 n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 jusqu'\u00e0 la r\u00e9partition de 187.8, que l'obligation de la masse des contribuables. Ce n'est que pour la r\u00e9partition que chacun d'eux on chacune de leurs propri\u00e9t\u00e9s est devenu d\u00e9biteur. Si quid univeersitati debitur singulis non debitur, nec quod debet universitas, Singuli debent. Domat ([11]). Et c'est bien la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de l'appelante et non celle de l'intim\u00e9e qui \u00e0 Ot\u00e9 tax\u00e9e par le r\u00f4le de 1878. La corporation ne pouvait \u00e9videmment pas alors la taxer comme appartenant \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e e et c'est l'appelante seule qui pouvait contester ce nouveau r\u00f4le; l'intim\u00e9e n'y avait plus de droits\nSur l'item de $650.63 plus $45.42, pour int\u00e9r\u00eat, montant pay\u00e9 pour l'\u00e9largissement de la rue St. Lambert, j\u00e8 suis d'avis que l'appelante doit avoir jugement. Il v a une grande diff\u00e9rence entre cet item et celui de la rue St. Jacques. Ici, le r\u00f4le \u00e9tait fait et parfait lorsque I intim\u00e9e a vendu \u00e0 l'appelante; et aucun jugement n'est intervenu depuis pour l'annuler comme ii en a \u00e9t\u00e9 pour celui de la rue St. Jacques. La somme due sur la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 en question \u00e9tait \u00e9tablie et exigible, et l'intim\u00e9e \u00e9tait en faute de ne pas l'avoir pay\u00e9e auparavant. Le fait que ce r\u00f4le \u00e9tait perdu ne la relevait pas de son obligation \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard. Une copie en existait sur les livres de la cite. Le t\u00e9moin Arnoldi l'a produite \u00e0 l'enqu\u00eate.\nSi le conseil a eu recours \u00e0 un autre acte de la L\u00e9gislature, pour obtenir la permission d'y substituer un nouveau r\u00f4le ceci ne peut changer les droits et les obligations des parties et enlever les droits acquis. Ces droits et ces obligations restent ce qu'ils \u00e9taient au jour de la vente.\nIl n'y a pas ici d'effet r\u00e9troactif qui puisse les affecter. La forme que le statut 44 & 45 V. c. 73 a autoris\u00e9e pour la collection des taxes impos\u00e9es et dues des 1867 ne change pas la taxe, ni sa date, vis-\u00e0-vis des parties \u00e0 l'instance. C'est d\u00e8s 1867 que cette propri\u00e9t\u00e9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 tax\u00e9e sp\u00e9cialement par la r\u00e9partition alors faite, et rien depuis n'a affect\u00e9 la validit\u00e9 de cette r\u00e9partition.\nSi l'intim\u00e9e e\u00fbt pay\u00e9 cette somme \u00e0 la corporation elle n'aurait pas pu la r\u00e9p\u00e9ter comme elle a Pu le faire de celle pay\u00e9e pour la rue St. Jacques; ce n'aurait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 un paiement ind\u00fb.\nPar la perte du r\u00f4le la collection forc\u00e9e par la corporation pouvait \u00eatre devenue difficile soit m\u00eame impossible* mais la somme restait tout de m\u00eame l\u00e9gitimement due sur cette propri\u00e9t\u00e9; et \u00e9tant due et payable d\u00e8s avant la vente par l'intim\u00e9e \u00e0 l'appelante, elle tombe tant sous la clause de garantie de tout trouble, contenue dans l'acte que sous la stipulation expresse du paiement de toutes les cotisations, g\u00e9n\u00e9rales et sp\u00e9ciales, due sur la propri\u00e9t\u00e9.\nIl n'y a pas au dossier un mot de preuve sur la nature de la contestation de ce r\u00f4le qui para\u00eet avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 pendante lorsqu'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 adir\u00e9, et nous ne pouvons assumer que cette contestation \u00e9tait bas\u00e9e sur les m\u00eames moyens que ceux qui ont pr\u00e9valu contre le r\u00f4le de la rue St. Jacques. GWYNNE J.\u2014In the month of June, 1866, the Honourable J. A. Berthelot then testamentary executor of the will of the late Sir Louis Hypolite Lafontaine, auteur of the defendant in this suit the owner of a piece of land situate at the corner of little St. James street and St. Lambert street in the city of Montreal, together with other proprietors of land fronting on St. James street, and so interested in procuring that street to be widened, presented a petition to the council of the corporation of the city of Montreal praying that little St. James street aforesaid should be widened from Place d'Armes to St. Grabriel street the said \"petitioners, by their said petition, offering to pay the whole or such part of the cost of such improvement under the provisions of 27 & 28 Vic. ch. 60 as the said council of the corporation should think fit.\nSome time afterwards a like petition was presented to the council by the proprietors of land fronting on St. Lambert street praying in like manner for the widening of that street from Notre-Dame street to little St. James street, at the cost of the petitioners and others, proprietors of land fronting on St. Lambert street and benefited by the improvement thereby petitioned for.\nResolutions of the council of the corporation were duly passed, in the year 1867, granting the prayers of the respective petitioners, upon the express condition, however, that the whole of the cost of making the said enlargements of the said streets respectively should be borne by the said petitioners and others, the owners of land fronting on the said streets respectively and benefited by such improvements, such amounts to be levied by a special tax, rate or assessment to be apportioned and imposed by law upon the lands so fronting on the said street and benefited by the improvements as aforesaid petitioned for. UPON the faith of these resolutions or acts of the council of the corporation the said respective improvements were made and completed by the corporation in 1868.\nNow by force of the above resolutions or acts of council it cannot, I think, be doubted that the piece of land at the corner of St. James and St. Lambert streets sold by the defendant to the plaintiff in 1873, as hereinafter mentioned, was legally and effectually charged with its fair proportion as yet unascertained it is true, but still with its fair proportion, of the cost of the said respective improvements. The respective works having been performed upon the faith of the said resolutions of council the lands fronting on the said respective streets became legally charged by the resolutions and the statute in virtue of which they were passed with their fair pro-portion of the costs of the works, although such proportion remained to be determined in the manner provided in the statute in that behalf. Upon the 9th day of January, 1868, commissioners were appointed by the council under the provisions of the statute 27 & 28 Vic. ch. 60 to fix and determine the price and compensation to be allowed for each piece of ground required for the widening of said little St. James street and were ordered to begin their operation on the 15th January, 1868, and to make their report upon the 15th April following*. The amount so to be paid and allowed was duly fixed by the said commissioners at the sum of $127,788.43, which sum thereby and by force of the said resolution of council upon the petition of the said owners of property fronting on said little St. James street and benefited by the said property became a charge upon the whole of the said lands so fronting upon said St. James street, although the proportion in which the same should be borne by the several pieces of land so fronting and benefited and the owners thereof remained to be determined. By a roll of apportionment of the said sum among the several lots of lands fronting on St. James street and the proprietors thereof, made and signed by the same commissioners who had fixed the price to be paid for land required for the widening of said little St. James street upon and bearing date the 22nd day of July, 1868, the said commissioners apportioned the sum of $1,755 as the amount by which according to their valuation! the said piece of land at the corner of little St. James and St. Lambert streets was benefited by the widening of little St. James street as aforesaid.\nCommissioners appointed to fix and determine the price and compensation to be paid for each piece of land required for the purpose of widening St. Lambert street aforesaid under the resolution or act of council in that behalf, duly fixed and determined the sum to be paid for such land at the sum of $26,318.88, and they by a roll of apportionment, the date of which is not given to us, apportioned the sum of $650.63, as the amount by which according to their valuation the said piece of land at the corner of little St. James and St Lambert streets was benefited by the widening of St. Lambert street aforesaid. The particular date of this apportionment does not appear, but it also was made sometime in 1868.\nNow what by notarial deed bearing date the 26th day of November 1873 the above defendant agreed to sell, aid sold to the plaintiff for the sum of $12,200, was the said piece of land at its full value as so benefited. There cannot I think be a doubt that the \"purchase money agreed upon between the parties was so agreed upon as the price of the piece of land with the increased value attached to it by the widening of the streets, the benefit of which the venderesse had enjoyed for five years and upon the faith that a proportionate part of the cost of the said improvements had been borne and paid by her. She does not appear to have had the slightest objection to the said respective apportionments of $1,755, and $650.63 as her share of the cost of the said improvements; whatever objection there might have been to either of them she in so far as appears, was at the time of the sale of the said piece of land to the plaintiffs quite content therewith and there does not appear to be any reason for entertaining a doubt that the price agreed upon for the land was its full increased value as benefited by the said improvements so made at a cost, the defendant's proportion of which was treated by both the seller and the \"purchasers as between themselves to be conclusively fixed at the said sums of $1,755 and $650.63, so de facto apportioned against the defendant and as having been paid by her.\nNow by the notarial deed the defendant sold the said piece of land to the plaintiffs\u2014\navec garantie contre tous troubles, &c., &c., et causes d'\u00e9viction et de troubles g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement quelconques,\nfor the sum of $12,200 and by the said deed\u2014\nla dite venderesse d\u00e9clare que les taux et cotisations g\u00e9n\u00e9rales et sp\u00e9ciales des lieux pr\u00e9sentement vendus ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pay\u00e9es y compris celles de l'ann\u00e9e courante.\nIt appears now that at the time of the execution of the above deed the said sums of $1,755 and $650.63 had not, in fact, been paid to the city by the defendant, but that those sums were or at least that the said sum of $1,755 was regarded by the defendant as having been so charged upon the said piece of land and the defendant in respect thereof, that the non-payment thereof by the defendant would constitute un trouble ou une cause de trouble guaranteed against by the defendant or a breach of the above covenant of the defendant in the deed, or at least that, having regard to the fact that the price paid by the plaintiffs for the Piece of land, was its price as increased m value by the work, the defendant thereby receiving the full benefit of the work. That plaintiffs were entitled to have the amount as aforesaid apportioned against the land as the defendant's share of the cost paid by her for the plaintiffs is apparent from this, that three days after the execution of the deed of sale to the plaintiffs, and when, therefore, the piece of land was the property of the plaintiffs, the defendant paid to the city corporation the said sum of $1,755 so as aforesaid apportioned against the said piece of land and the defendant in respect thereof. That sum so paid was a payment voluntarily made by the defendant, and as so made was as I think we must hold, a payment made for the use and benefit of the plaintiffs the then owners of the piece of land purchased by them at a price which we must also, I think, hold to have been agreed upon by the parties as the full price of the land as increased in value by the widening of the streets so as aforesaid made and that sum having been so paid by the defendant the plaintiffs were entitled to enjoy the benefit thereof and the defendant had no right whatever at any time afterwards to demand and receive from the city repayment of a sum so paid; but having received repayment thereof as she appears to have done on the, 15th August, 1878, she must, clearly as it appears to me, reimburse the plaintiffs to that amount, with interest and place the plaintiffs, in respect of that amount, in as good a position as they would have been if the defendant had not demanded and received repay-ment thereof.\nThe grounds upon which the defendant now insists upon her right to retain this sum are that in 1878 the Privy Council in England affirmed a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench in the province of Quebec in appeal which affirmed a judgment of the Superior Court in a suit instituted by one Stephens against the corporation of the city of Montreal ([12]) for exacting by execution payment by the said plaintiff of the sum of $2,838.50 for which a lot of land of the plaintiff in that action had been charged tor defraying the expense of widening little St. James street, by which judgment the court, upon the purely technical ground that the roll of apportionment of cost had not been made in the precise manner required by the law in that behalf held that roll to be null and that Stephens therefore was entitled to judgment in his action, and the now defendant claims that by force of that judgment she had a right to demand and receive from the city on the 15th August, 1878, and now to retain, the $1,755 so voluntarily as aforesaid paid by her, and to subject the land now the property of the plaintiffs to the full cost of the widening of the said streets in addition to the purchase money paid by them as the full price thereof as increased in value by the work done and assumed to have been done at the cost of the defendant when that purchase money was agreed upon. But whether the defendant when she sold the property to the plaintiff did or did not know of the action instituted by Stephens, or of the grounds upon which it was based, she might have been well content, as by the sequel it appears she had good reason to be, assuming her not to have sold the property with the apportionment as made against her, and when selling the property it was important to her as well as to the plaintiffs that the amount which her lot of land as abutting on the street should contribute to the cost of work performed five years previously upon the authority of an act of council passed at the request of the owners of such lots and upon the express condition that the whole cost of the work so petitioned for should be charged upon the lots fronting on the streets in proportion to the benefit conferred upon each by the work, should be finally fixed and determined when the plaintiffs and defendant were negotiating as to the price to be paid by the purchaser for the then value of the land so increased in value. Nothing was more natural than that the price should be arrived at upon the basis that the vendor had been chargeable and charged with and had paid or should pay the precise amount as apportioned against her, whether that amount had or had not been arrived at, in the precise form prescribed by the statute. There was no necessity for their being affected by whatever might be the final result of the suit instituted by Stevens against the city. They had peculiar interests which the judgment in that case whatever it might finally be, could not and should not affect and this I think is what we must conclude to have been done when the price to be paid by the plaintiffs to the defendant was agreed upon, and as the defendant cannot retain the $1,755 so as aforesaid paid and so as aforesaid repaid to her, and so subject the plaintiffs to payment, in addition to their purchase money of that amount, so neither I think can the plaintiffs now claim to be reimbursed by the defendant the sum which in excess of the said sum of $1,755 they have been compelled to pay under the provisions of the statute 42 & 43 Vic. ch. 53. The purchase money was agreed upon upon the faith that as between the parties vendor and vendee the apportionment against the lot was legal and final and conclusive, and as between them it must still, I think, be held to have been so although by the roil substituted by 42 & 43 Vic. ch. 53 the cost for widening Little St. James street imposed upon the lot purchased by the plaintiffs has been in creased from $1,755 to $3,331.20 or nearly doubled. By that act it was enacted that payments made upon the basis of the annulled rolls should not 1)6 invalidated but should go in discharge pro tanto of the amount to be apportioned by the new roll authorized by the statute to be made. The plaintiffs therefore should and would upon the new roll have received the benefit of the said sum of $1,755 so made as aforesaid by the defendant for the benefit of the plaintiffs if the defendant who in the purchase money received by her from the plaintiffs had received the full benefit of the improvement, had not, wrongfully in my opinion, received back from the corporation the amount so paid, and having received it hack she must reimburse that amount to the plaintiffs. Then as to the $650.63 the roll by which that sum was in 1868 apportioned against the said piece of land for the cost of widening St. Lambert street never was cancelled but it was lost, and by reason thereof another act 44 & 45 Vic. ch. 73 was passed which authorized the corporation to make a new roll in its place, whereby to recover from the parties benefited by that improvement the cost thereof. Now the work having been completed in 1868, and the lost roll having apportioned against the said piece of land the said sum of $650.63 as its share of the cost of widening St. Lambert Street it is obvious that the defendant, when five years afterwards she sold the land to the plaintiffs for its full value as so improved, is the person who, in the language of the Statute 44 & 45 Vic. c. 73 was benefited by the improvement and who should therefore pay the share of the cost apportioned against the piece of land so sold by her which sum has been by the new roll fixed at precisely the same amount as had been determined by the lost roll. Upon the whole, I am of opinion that when the defendant sold the land to the plaintiffs it was so effectually charged by the act of the council of the corporation and the statute by force of which the widening of the streets was authorized to be made at the cost of the lands fronting, with. their fair proportion of such cost when determined as required by law, as to make a claim upon the land against the plaintiffs for such proportion when ascertained une trouble ou cause de trouble guaranteed against by the defendant in her deed to the plaintiffs; and further that the defendant by reason of her having in the purchase money received by her from the plaintiffs, received the full benefit of the improvement, she, as the person so benefited, is injustice bound to reimburse the plaintiffs to the extent of the said sum of $1,755 and $650.63 as apportioned by the rolls of 1868, which I think we must take to have been accepted by both parties as conclusive between them when the purchase money was agreed upon.\nThe appeal should therefore, in my opinion, be allowed with costs, and judgment be ordered to be entered for the plaintiffs in the action for the said sum of $1,755 with interest thereon from the 15th August, 1878, and for the sum of $650.63 with interest thereon from the time of the payment thereof to the corporation by the plaintiffs, together with their costs of the action.\nSEDGEWICK J.\u2014I concur in the judgment pronounced by the Chief Justice.\nKING J.\u2014I am of opinion that this appeal should be dismissed with costs for the reasons given for the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant : N.

J., and Fournier, Taschereau, Gwynne and King JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF NOVA SCOTIA.\nMortgage of trust estate\u2014Equity running with estate\u2014Equitable recourse by\u2014Construction of deed\u2014Description of lands\u2014False demonstration\u2014Water lots\u2014Accretion to lands\u2014After acquired title\u2014Contribution to redeem\u2014Discharge of mortgage\u2014Parol evidence to explain deed\u2014Estoppel by deed.\nOn the dissolution of the firm of A. & Co. by the retirement of C. D. A. the business was carried on by the remaining partners T. A. and B. A. on the same premises, which were the property of C. D. A., the continuing partners agreeing to pay off a mortgage-thereon as one of the old firm's debts. They neglected to pay and the property was sold by the sheriff under a foreclosure decree, when they purchased and took a deed describing the lands as in said mortgage, one side being bounded by \"the windings of the shore\" of Sydney Harbour, and including a \"water lot,\" part of which was known as the \"stone ballast heap,\" in front of the shore lands. They immediately re-mortgaged the lands by the same description adding a further or alternative description and, at the end, the following words:\u2014\"Also all and singular the water lots and docks in front of the said lots,\"\u2014although in fact they then owned none except those covered by the description in the deed from the sheriff, and they gave at the same time a collateral bond-to the mortgagees for the amount of their mortgage. They then conveyed the equity to C. D. A. giving him a bond of indemnity against the mortgage they had so executed. Some time afterwards T. A. and B. A. acquired by grant certain other water lots in front of the mortgaged property and used and occupied them as part of their business premises along with the mortgaged lands. C. D. A. sold the equity of redemption subject to the mortgage, and T. A. and B. A. settled their obligation under the indemnity bond by a compromise with the assignees of C. D. A., paying $8,000, and obtained their discharge. Upon proceedings being taken by the assignees of the mortgagees to foreclose the mortgage, and against T. A. and B. A. upon the collateral bond, T. A. and B. A. paid the amount due and the foreclosure proceedings were continued for their benefit.\nHeld, that the liability of the mortgagors was fully satisfied and discharged by the compromise, and as they were afterwards obliged to pay the outstanding encumbrance they were entitled to take an assignment and enforce the mortgage by foreclosure proceedings against the lands.\nPer Gwynne J.\u2014The mortgagors were only entitled to foreclosure for the realization of the amount actually paid by them in compromising their liability under the indemnity bond.\nHeld, further, that as the construction of the mortgage depended upon the state of the property at the time it was made parol evidence would be admitted to explain the ambiguity in the description of the lands intended to be affected:\nThat as there were no specific descriptions or recitals tending to shew that any other property was intended to be covered by the mortgage beyond what would be satisfied by including the water lot described as the \"Stone ballast heap,\" the after-acquired water lots would not be charged or liable to contribute ratably towards redemption of the mortgage:\nThat even admitting that the description was sufficient to include the after-acquired property, such property was not liable to contribute towards payment of the mortgage debt.\nAppeal from a decision of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia affirming the judgment of Mr. Justice Ritchie for foreclosure of a mortgage.\nThe facts and questions at issue sufficiently appear by the head-note and in the judgments reported.\nBorden Q.C. for the appellant.\nBesides the water lots described in the mortgage, certain other water lots purchased by the mortgagors since the making of the mortgage, became bound by the mortgage and must bear a proportion of the mortgage debt. Trust & Loan Co. v. Ruttan[1]; Bensley v. Burdon[2]; Irvine v. Irvine[3]; Rawley on Covenants[4]; Jones on Mortgages[5]; Goodlitle v. Bailey[6].\nIf the plaintiffs had owned the subsequently acquired water lots at the time of the execution of the mortgage, they could not have foreclosed only that portion of the property of which the defendant has become the purchaser. The same result follows if the subsequently acquired lands became bound by the mortgage. Jones v. Beck[7]; Fisher on Mortgages[8]; Story's Equity Jurisprudence[9]; Jones on Mortgages[10]; Allen v. Clark[11].\nThe words \"subject to a mortgage, dated 24th May\/' contained in the deed from plaintiff to 0. D. Archibald, do not imply or amount to a covenant or undertaking on the part of C. D. Archibald to pay off the mortgage debt. They cannot do more than make the land conveyed to him liable to contribute a proportionate part of the mortgage debt. The land so conveyed was only a portion of the lands which had been granted by the mortage in question. Fiske v. Tolman[12]; Pike v. Goodnow[13]; Strong v. Converse[14]; Drury v. Tremont Co.[15].\nThe mortgage debt has been discharged by payment. If the plaintiffs had paid on the day after the execution of the bond of indemnity it cannot be doubted that the mortgage would be thereby discharged. The present liability to pay and present right to receive concurring in the same person operated as payment and performance of the contract. Per Wilde C. J. in Harmer v. Steele[16].\nThe bond of indemnity was barred by the statute of limitations when the compromise took place more than twenty-one years after it was made. The bond, being so barred, had ceased to effect or operate upon the rights of the persons in whom the mortgaged premises were vested.\nIrrespective of the bond of indemnity plaintiffs were bound to discharge the mortgage and to indemnify therefrom the lands of C. D. Archibald. A mere release of that obligation would not affect any subsequent payment of the mortgage debt by the mortgagors, or prevent such payment from operating as a discharge of the mortgage.\nThe bond of indemnity was not a registered document and did not affect the title to the land as against the defendant who had no notice thereof. It was therefore a matter of no moment to him to know the terms of the alleged bond. The burthen is upon plaintiffs to prove notice to the defendant of this bond and compromise thereof, and they have failed to do so. Defendant's position is the same as if he had purchased with notice of the bond of indemnity, and as if that bond had remained unreleased. Under these circumstances a subsequent payment of their debt by the mortgagors would discharge the mortgage. Can the mortgagors by taking an assignment of their own mortgage acquire any right other than that of having the $8,000 paid by them on the indemnity bond applied or appropriated in payment of the mortgage debt?\nOn the question of notice counsel referred to Kettlewell v. Watson[17]; Ware v. Egmont[18], Hamilton v. Royse[19]. Ross Q.C., for the respondents.\nCharles D. Archibald in the mortgage to Forman included the \"ballast heap\" lot as well as no. 6, and therefore under the sheriff's deed Thomas D. and Blowers Archibald obtained title to it, and when they came to mortgage the Cameron and Ferris lots they took the description of the lots in their own deed and gave an alternative or further description only. This alternative description does not in terms cover more than 5, 6 and the \"ballast heap\" lots, and if the words do include anything beyond these the last words should be rejected, as falso demonstratio.\nThe equity of redemption passed to defendant, Peter Imrie, subject to the mortgage. The deed will be construed by the state of the property at the time it was made, and the court should hear extrinsic evidence to explain the description. Brady v. Sadler[20]; Templeman v. Martin[21]; Hubbard v. Hubbard[22]; Cox v. Friedly[23]; Hall v. Lund[24]; Washburn on Real Property[25]; Broom's Legal Maxims[26].\nThe mortgage describes the property as fronting on Spanish River or Sydney Harbour, and gives the natural boundaries, in favour of which a presumption exists. \"Fronting on\" is equivalent to bounded by,, and is quite unlike \"fronting.\" Angell on Water Courses[27]. Where land intervenes between a building or lot and the street, then the building or lot cannot be said to. \"front on\" or \"abut on\" the street. Lightbound v. Bebington Local Board[28]; Newport Sanitary Authority v. Graham[29]; Wakefield Local Board v. Lee[30].\nIn Litchfield v. Seituate[31] it was held that the words \"bounded by the sea\" or \"by the harbour\" takes, in that State, to low water. In this country it would be to ordinary high water mark. In Washburn on Real Property[32], a case is mentioned in which a property was \"bounded by the highlands,\" and the line was required to follow the indentures of the hills. The description in the mortgage would, therefore, be incorrect if the \"ballast heap\" is excluded, for it, and not Sydney harbour, would then form part of the southern boundary. And see Iler v. Nolan[33]; Cartwright v. Bettor[34]; Mahoney v. Campbell[35]; Gillen v. Haynes[36]; White v. Gay[37]; Roe v. Vernon[38]; Rooke v. Kensington[39]; Moore v. McGrath[40]; Walsh v. Trevannion[41].\nThere is a presumption that the description covers only the property owned. Hurly v. Brown[42]. At the time of making the mortgage T. D. and B. Archibald owned no water lots in front of 5 and 6 except the \"ballast heap.\"\nIn any case they are entitled to foreclose and sell such two lots for the whole amount of the mortgage, irrespective of the water lots in front of them.\nT. D. and B. Archibald had the right either to pay the mortgagees or C. D. Archibald, who would then be bound to protect them from the mortgagees.\nThe release to plaintiffs on the compromise had the same effect as payment in full. Cowper v. Green[43].\nAfter this payment and release the land remained as the primary fund for payment of the mortgage debt. The rights of the mortgagees would be unimpaired, but T. D. and B. Archibald could call on the owner of the equity of redemption to protect them. A grantee cannot sue his grantor on covenants for title and further assurance when at the time of deed the grantee has the title to the lands of which the grantor has not title but for which he has covenanted.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014This is an action for the foreclosure of a mortgage dated the 24th of May, 1859, by which certain lands at Sydney, Cape Breton, were mortgaged by Thomas Dickson Archibald and Blowers Archibald to William Gammell and John Christie, to secure the payment of six thousand pounds and interest.\nThe plaintiffs, James C. Mackintosh and Edward P. T. Goldsmith, are the executors of John S. McLean, deceased, in whom the mortgage became vested under a transfer from the mortgagees and several subsequent mesne assignments, and the principal defendant is Peter Imrie in whom the equity of redemption is now vested and who claims title under the mortgagors and through several intermediate conveyances of the equity of redemption. In the events which have happened and which will be hereafter stated, John S. McLean became pendente lite a trustee of the mortgage for the original mortgagors, and the action was subsequently prosecuted for the benefit of Blowers Archibald and the executors of Thomas D. Archibald, who are now the parties having the beneficial interest in the mortgage.\nIn order that the case may be clearly understood it is necessary to state the circumstances which led to the creation of this mortgage and also to refer to some of the dealings with the equity of redemption, which will explain the apparently anomalous circumstance that we find the parties who were the original mortgagors now seeking the foreclosure of the mortgage which they themselves created.\nFor some time before the 31st December, 1853, Thomas Dickson Archibald, Blowers Archibald and Charles Dickson Archibald had carried on business in co-partnership, at Sydney, as ship agents, ship builders and merchants, under the firm name of Archibald & Co. On the last mentioned date this co-partnership was dissolved, and a deed of dissolution was executed by which it was agreed that Charles Dickson Archibald should retire from the business, leaving it to be carried on by the two other partners, the latter agreeing to pay the debts of the firm, including a debt due to James Forman, to secure which Charles Dickson Archibald had, in 1849, mortgaged certain lands and buildings at Sydney on which the partnership business had been carried on and which were his own separate property, and which are the same lands and properties which are comprised in the mortgage in question in this action. Charles Dickson Archibald thenceforth resided in England and the other two partners continued to carry on the business in Cape Breton. Some time before the 16th of May, 1859, proceedings were taken by Forman, the mortgagee under the mortgage of 1849, for the foreclosure of that security and the sale of the lands comprised in it, and in that foreclosure suit a decree had been made under which, according to the established practice of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, the mortgaged property was sold by the sheriff and purchased for the amount of the mortgage debt, interest and costs, by Thomas Dickson Archibald and Blowers Archibald, to whom the sheriff on the 16th of May, 1859, executed a deed of sale. In order to raise the money to effect this purchase Thomas Dickson Archibald and Blowers Archibald had recourse to a loan from William Gammell and John Christie, and in order to secure this loan Thomas Dickson Archibald and Blowers Archibald on the 24th of May, 1859, executed, two several bonds, each for the payment of three thousand pounds, to Gammel and Christie respectively, and for further security executed on the same day the mortgage which is the subject of the present action. Charles Dickson Archibald, having discovered the fact of the making of this mortgage soon after it was effected, insisted that his former copartners had improperly dealt with his property by re-mortaging it in the way mentioned, as they undoubtedly had, inasmuch as by the agreement of dissolution they were bound to exonerate it from Forman's mortgage the burden of which they had assumed. Thereupon on the 20th July, 1859, Thomas Dickson Archibald and Blowers Archibald conveyed their equity of redemption to Charles Dickson Archibald, and they also executed a bond, bearing the same date, by which they bound themselves to Charles Dickson Archibald to indemnify him against the mortgage to Gammell and Christie. This bond recited the mortgage, the conveyance of the equity of redemption before stated, and that the obligors had agreed to indemnify Charles Dickson Archibald against the incumbrance on his lands, and the condition was as follows:\nNow the condition of this obligation is such, that if the said Thomas Dickson Archibald and Blowers Archibald, their heirs, executors administrators and assigns, do and shall well and truly indemnify and save harmless the said Charles Dickson Archibald, his heirs and assigns, from all claims of the said William Gammell and John Christie for or on account of said mortgage, and shall discharge the debt due on said premises that the same may be finally free from all liability on account of said mortgage, then the foregoing obligation to be void, otherwise to remain in full force and virtue.\nOn the 26th July, 1859, by an indenture of that date made between Charles Dickson Archibald and his son Charles William Archibald, the former, for the valuable consideration therein stated, conveyed to the latter in fee simple the lands and hereditaments comprised in the mortgage to Gammell and Christie. Subsequently, and on the 3rd of June, 1862, by indenture of that date made between Charles William Archibald and Annie Parker, the former conveyed to the latter for the valuable consideration therein expressed the same lands and hereditaments, in fee simple.\nSubsequently, Charles Dickson Archibald was declared a bankrupt in England, and Thomas Ritchie Grassie was appointed the creditors' assignee of his estate. A dispute thereupon arose between Mrs. Parker (who had previously intermarried with John Hearne Breffit), and the assignee as to which of them was entitled to the indemnity bond of the 20th of July, 1859, and the money secured thereby. Mrs. Breffit claimed that this bond formed part of her separate estate, and the assignee insisted that it formed part of the bankrupt's assets. Thereupon this dispute was compromised (subject to the approval of the Court of Bankruptcy), and a memorandum of agreement to that effect bearing date the 23rd of May, 1882, was executed. By this instrument, which recited the dispute, it was agreed that Mrs. Breffit should call in and compel payment of the full amount secured by the indemnity bond, and that of the amount she should so recover she should pay over to Mr. Grassie, as the assignee in bankruptcy of Thomas Dickson Archibald, one clear half, which Grassie should accept in full satisfaction and discharge of his claim in respect of the said bond. And it was provided that the agreement should be void and of no effect unless sanctioned by Her Majesty's London Court of Bankruptcy. This agreement which, as I have said, recited that Mrs. Breffit claimed title to the bond as part of her own separate estate, was duly sanctioned and confirmed by the Court of Bankruptcy, by an order bearing date the 15th of October, 1884.\nIn an indenture bearing date the 5th of November, 1884, and made between Annie Breffit and John Hearne Breffit, her husband, of the first part, Thomas Ritchie Grassie, the assignee in bankruptcy of Charles Dickson Archibald, of the second part, and Thomas Dickson Archibald and Blowers Archibald of the third part, and duly executed by the parties of the first and second parts, after reciting the bond of the 20th of July, 1859, the dispute between Mrs. Breffit and Grassie as to which was entitled to the benefit thereof, the agreement of the 23rd of May, 1882, before stated, and the order in bankruptcy of the 15th October, 1884, approving the compromise, there were recitals in the words following:\nAnd whereas the said Thomas Dickson Archibald and Blowers Archibald are unable to pay the said principal moneys and interest secured by the said bond, and also dispute their liability to pay the same, and whereas the said parties hereto of the first and second parts, being satisfied of their inability to pay the said moneys in full, and in settlement of the said dispute as to liabilities, agreed with the said Thomas Dickson Archibald and Blowers Archibald, subject to the sanction of the said court, to accept in settlement and discharge of the moneys payable by virtue of the said bond the sum of $8,000 in four promissory notes of $2,000 each, with interest, to be signed by the four members of the firm of Messrs. Archibald & Company, of Cape Breton, and also signed or indorsed by Mr. McLean, president of the Bank of Nova Scotia.\nThere was then a further recital that the notes had been drawn and indorsed as agreed, and had, at the request of Mrs. Breffit and Mr. Grassie, been made payable to the joint order of Mr. Charles Harris Hodgson and Mr. Arthur Torriano Rickards, the former being the solicitor of Mrs. Breffit and the latter the solicitor of Mr. Grassie, and that the notes so made and indorsed had been handed to the said Mr. Hodgson and Mr. Rickards, and that upon the notes being so handed over as aforesaid Mrs. Breffit and her husband, and Mr. Grassie, had agreed to execute the release thereinafter contained, and it was witnessed that in pursuance of the agreement and in consideration of the premises, the said Annie Breffit and John Hearne Breffit and Thomas Ritchie Grassie thereby released the said Thomas Dickson Archibald and Blowers Archibald, there and each of their estates and effects, from the bond of the 20th July, 1859, and from the sum of six thousand pounds and interest intended to be thereby secured and every part thereof, provided that the release should not extend to the $8,000 secured by the four promissory notes given in pursuance of the agreement.\nBy a memorandum indorsed on the bond, also dated the 5th November, 1884, and signed by Annie Breffit and Thomas Ritchie Grassie, it was declared that the moneys secured thereby having become vested in the last named persons, all claims in respect of the bond had been duly satisfied by the four promissory notes given in pursuance of the contemporaneous agreement, that Mrs. Breffit and her husband, and Grassie, had released the obligors, and that the bond was given up to the obligors to be cancelled. Subsequently Mrs. Breffit sold and conveyed the lands to the defendant, Peter Imrie, in whom, subject to the mortgage, the same are now vested. I have not thought it necessary to trace the chain of title by which, through several assignments and wills, the mortgage of 1859 became vested in certain persons claiming under the mortgagees Gammell and Christie. Nothing is in dispute respecting these transfers. It is sufficient to say that, the property was about to be sold to satisfy the mortgage, when, at the request of Thomas Dickson Archibald and Blowers Archibald, the late Mr. John S. McLean advanced the money due upon the mortgage, which was thereupon, by deed dated 30th July, 1888, assigned to him by George Imrie, John Love Imrie and Mary Gammell, the parties entitled thereto.\nThereupon Mr. McLean continued this action, which had been previously begun, for his own benefit, and he having since died is now represented in it by his executors.\nSubsequently Messrs. Archibald (Thomas Dickson Archibald and Blowers Archibald) paid off to Mr. McLean, or: to his executors, his advance, and the action is now being carried on for the benefit of Blowers Archibald and the executors of Thomas Dickson Archibald, who are the real and beneficial parties in interest entitled to the money secured by the mortgage of 1859.\nIn addition to the documentary evidence very little oral proof was given. Of this the only portion now material relates to certain questions as to the parcels comprised in the several mortgages of 1849 and 1859; It is not according to the English practice to raise questions of parcel or no parcel in a foreclosure suit, but under the practice prevailing in Nova Scotia according to which mortgaged lands are sold in a foreclosure suit by the sheriff, without particulars or conditions of sale, it may be convenient, in order that there may be some ascertainment of the subject of the sale, and it is with a view to this that the evidence in question was given. The cause was originally heard before Mr. Justice Ritchie who made the decree asked for by the plaintiffs\u2014the present respondents\u2014and this decree was affirmed on appeal by the full court, composed of Mr. Justice Weatherbe, Mr. Justice Ritchie and Mr. Justice Townshend, Mr. Justice Weatherbe not agreeing in all respects with the other members of the court.\nNo question was made in either of the courts below as to the right of the original mortgagors, Thomas Dickson Archibald (now represented by his executors) and Blowers Archibald, to a foreclosure judgment, nor has any such question been raised before this court either in the factums or on argument. It seems to be quite plain that in the events which have happened, and having regard to the transactions which have taken place, the Messrs. Archibald, although originally they were the parties who created the mortgage and therefore primarily the debtors bound to pay it, have become as well entitled to stand in the place of the mortgagees and to take the benefit of the assignment made to their trustee Mr. McLean as if they had previously to that assignment been entire strangers to the transaction. Originally no doubt Messrs. Archibald were the parties primarily liable to pay off this mortgage, not merely as between them and the mortgagees, but also as between them and Charles Dickson Archibald. They had purchased the lands of the latter under a sheriff's sale to realize the debt secured by the mortgage to Forman in 1849 which, by the articles of dissolution, they were bound to pay in exoneration of those lands. Therefore, having mortgaged those lands which were vested in them as mere trustees for Charles Dickson Archibald, they were, on general principles of equity, under an obligation to indemnify him against the debt with which they had improperly burdened his property. Being so bound they recognized their liability and put it into a formal shape by executing the indemnity bond. Then it cannot be doubted that if they had subsequently paid the amount secured by their mortgage to Gammell and Christie into the hands of Charles Dickson Archibald whilst he was the owner of the equity of redemption, they would have satisfied this obligation and the previous order of liability would have become inverted, and they, although still liable to the mortgagees, would as between themselves and Charles Dickson Archibald and those claiming under him have been no longer liable to indemnify them against the debt.\nThen, upon the bankruptcy of Charles Dickson Archibald, the right to the indemnity must have vested either in his assignee as a personal debt or in the person in whom the equity of redemption in the mortgaged lands had become vested. I have no doubt but that Mrs. Breffit, who was the owner of the estate which she had acquired as a purchaser for valuable consideration, was entitled to the indemnity which in equity ran with the lands. This seems to have been a matter of some doubt since it was made the subject of a compromise which was confirmed by the Bankruptcy Court. But it makes no difference, for supposing that the Messrs. Archibald (T. D. and Blowers) had paid off the full amount of the debt of six thousand pounds to Mr. Grassie and Mrs. Breffit under an arrangement between them to divide the amount, they releasing the Messrs. Archibald, they would then be no longer liable to pay or contribute to the payment of the mortgage debt as between themselves and those claiming under Charles Dickson Archibald, and if compelled to pay by the enforcement of their personal liability by the mortgagees, they could have insisted upon being subrogated to the rights of the mortgagees and have enforced the charge upon the lands. If this were not so they would have been compelled to pay twice over without any recourse to recoup them, for that would have been the result if, first having paid the indemnity to the persons entitled to it, they had then been compelled by the mortgagees to satisfy their personal obligation under the covenants in the mortgage deed, and were not entitled to take an assignment of the mortgage as a security for the second payment. The Messrs. Archibald were therefore exactly in the position of a vendor of an estate in mortgage, who is bound, if there is no provision to the contrary, to indemnify the purchaser against the outstanding incumbrance; if he does this by paying the money to the purchaser himself he satisfies his obligation, and if he is subsequently compelled by the mortgagee to pay in fulfilment of his personal liability, there is nothing to preclude him from taking a transfer of the mortgage and from enforcing it against the purchaser from himself. All this is too plain to need demonstration.\nThen, as Mr. Justice Townshend points out, the effect of the transaction between the assignee in bankruptcy and Mrs. Breffit and the Archibalds, has just the same effect as if they had paid the full amount of the six thousand pounds into the hands of Charles Dickson Archibald while he still retained the property.\nThe points really in controversy before Mr. Justice Ritchie at the trial, and before the court in banc, related first to the sufficiency of the description of parcels in the Forman mortgage to comprise a piece of land known as the \"Ballast Heap,\" and secondly, as to the effect of the mortgage of 1859 to charge certain water-lots, the title to which was not acquired by the mortgagors or by one of them until sometime after the date of the mortgage.\nAs to the first point, that respecting the \"Ballast Heap,\" we must go back to the mortgage to Forman in 1849, for if this parcel of land was not included in that mortgage the mortgagors, in the mortgage of 1859, would have had no title to it, their title to any of the lands depending on the sheriff's deed, the description in which followed that in Forman's mortgage.\nSo much of that description as has reference to the question now under consideration is as follows:\nAlso all the estate, right, title, interest and reversion of the said Charles Dickson Archibald, of and in and to those two certain lots of land situate and being at the Bar of North Sydney, aforesaid, and which heretofore belonged to John Ferris and John Cameron, the said lots fronting on the waters of Sydney Harbour or Spanish River, and being bounded on the east by the property of Samuel Plant, and on the west by the property of the General Mining Association, and containing each one hundred' acres, more or less, the said lots being now in the occupation of Messrs. Archibald & Company. At the date of the mortgage to Forman there was vested in the mortgagor, Charles Dickson Archibald, the title to certain lots or parcels of land which were then in the occupation of the firm of Archibald and Company, and which had been acquired as follows:\u2014First, lot number five, containing 120 acres, more or less, had been on the 20th January, 1792, granted by the Crown to John Henry, and had through certain conveyances made by one John Cameron become (except as regards five small parcels) vested in fee simple in Charles Dickson Archibald. Lot number six, also containing 120 acres, more or less, was originally granted by the Crown on the 1st; of June, 1794, to one Francis Jones whose devisee had conveyed it to John Ferris, by whose representatives it was conveyed to Charles Dickson Archibald in 1838.\nThe Ballast Heap lot contained three-fourths of an acre. It was a water lot filled in by discharged ballast and was originally granted by the Crown on the 8th of April, 1826, to the same John Ferris who had acquired the title to lot no. 6. It was immediately in front of lot no. 6, and was described in the Crown grant as \"part of the stone ballast heap in front of lot no. 6.\" It formed in fact a projection or continuation of lot no. 6, into the waters of the harbour. This ballast heap was included, by the same description as that contained in the Crown grant, in the same conveyance of the 1st of May, 1838, by which the representatives of John Ferris conveyed to Charles Dickson Archibald lot no. 6. The respondents in their factum state the following proposition:\nThe deed will be construed by the state of the property at the time the deed was made and the court will endeavour to put itself in the position of the parties to find out their intention, and will if necessary hear extrinsic evidence to explain the description.\nTo this proposition I assent and the parol evidence as to the state of the property at the date of the mortgage deed was, it appears to me, admissible. It appears from this evidence that long before 1849 the ballast heap and lot no. 6 were one solid piece of land; that the former lot had become an accretion to the latter; that on the ballast heap lot there was a wharf or dock; that the buildings in which the business of the firm of which Charles Dickson Archibald was a member was carried on, were situated partly on lot no. 6 but principally on the ballast heap; that in short the ballast heap and lot no. 6 were used indiscriminately for that purpose. Then lot no. 6 did not \"front on\" the waters of the harbour inasmuch as the ballast heap intervened between the water and lot no. 6 to a certain extent of water frontage, and that the description in the deed \"fronting on the waters of Sydney Harbour or Spanish River\" would therefore not be applicable if it was intended to convey only lot no. 6 excluding the ballast heap lot, but would be entirely applicable if the description in the mortgage deed is construed as including the ballast heap lot as an accretion to or an extension of lot no. 6. Blowers Archibald, examined as a witness, says that what was called the Ferris property in 1838 was \"no. 6 and the lot below the road (i.e. the ballast heap lot) with buildings 1, 2 and 3 on it,\" and again the same witness says:\nI don't recollect any particular instance where any person called that lot the Ferris property, but it was generally called the Ferris property; it was called in 1838 the Ferris property.\nEdward Phalen, another witness, says:\nI always knew this property occupied by the Archibalds to go by the name of the Ferris property.\nTaking this evidence as to the denomination which the property had by usage acquired in connection with the description, \"fronting on the waters of Sydney harbour or Spanish river,\" I have no difficulty in agreeing with both the courts below in holding that the ballast heap lot was included in the mortgage to Forman as part of the land referred to as formerly belonging to John Ferris. That the mortgage to Gammell and Christie also included the ballast heap is demonstrated by the same description, and is strengthened by the additional description of the land mortgaged \"as being all the property formerly and now in the occupation of Messrs. Archibald & Company,\" which would be falsified by the non-inclusion of this ballast heap lot, and also by the general words, \"also all and singular the water lots and docks in front of said lots.\" The conveyance by Thomas Dickson Archibald and Blowers Archibald to Charles Dickson Archibald was, for the reasons before given, also sufficient. The same observation applies a fortiori to the conveyance from Charles Dickson Archibald to Charles William Archibald, for that deed not only describes the land as formerly belonging to John Ferris and fronting on the waters of the harbour, but it also refers expressly to water lots in front of lot no. 6, and to the description in a lease made by Charles Dickson Archibald to the firm of Archibald & Company, which beyond all question included the ballast heap, since it describes the subject of the lease as \"docks, wharves, stores and other erections on the southern side\" of the main road, a description which could only apply to property which included the ballast heap. And, for the reasons just given, the descriptions of the parcels in the conveyance by Charles William Archibald to Mrs. Breffit, and by Mrs. Breffit to Peter Imrie, were also inclusive of the piece of land in question. Upon this head, which, as the question of parcel or no parcel always does, involves a question of fact only, I therefore agree with the judgment appealed against.\nAnother point which is urged by the appellant is this. It is said that inasmuch as the mortgage of 1859 to Gammell and Christie, which is now sought to be foreclosed, having contained the general description \"also all and singular the water lots and docks in front of said lots,\" and inasmuch as Thomas Dickson Archibald afterwards, in 1860, acquired title to other water lots in front of the lots described, that this after acquired property belonging to the mortgagor became subject to the mortgage, and is consequently liable to contribute to the mortgage debt in proportion to its value relatively to the other lands in exoneration pro tanto of the owner of the equity of redemption. There is more than one conclusive answer to this contention. First, the description is not a specific description but a general description which would be satisfied by applying it to the ballast heap lot. Then, the doctrine of estoppel cannot apply for the mortgage was a deed operating under the statute of uses, an innocent conveyance, unlike a fine or feoffment, which by itself will not work an estoppel[44]. Then, it contains no recital by which, apart from the operation of the deed itself, an estoppel might have been created. That the covenants will not work an estoppel is now established by the decision of Jessel M.R. in the case of The General Discount Co. v. The Liberator Building Society[45]. Apart from the common law doctrine of estoppel however, if there had been an unambiguous specific description of property as a subject of the mortgage to which the mortgagor had no title at the date of the mortgage but had afterwards acquired a title, a court of equity would no doubt under ordinary circumstances have interfered (except as against a bon\u00e2 fide purchaser for value without notice of the equity of redemption) in favour of the mortgagees to charge such after acquired lands with the mortgage debt, but the answer to any argument founded on that doctrine is conclusive from what I have already mentioned that no intention is indicated to include such after acquired property by the general words used, and also from other reasons which I shall proceed to state.\nIf there had been a specific description of the after acquired water lots so that the intention to include them had been free from all doubt, the mortgagees being therefore entitled to the benefit of the equity which I have referred to, the proposition of the appellant that they ought to bear a ratable proportion of the mortgage debt would even then have been unsustainable, for the equity in question could not have been available to the purchaser of the equity of redemption in the face of the transaction between the mortgagors, the Archibalds, on the one hand, and Mrs. Breffit and the assignee in bankruptcy of Charles Dickson Archibald, on the other hand. By that transaction the liability of Blowers Archibald and Thomas Dickson Archibald, the mortgagors, to indemnify Charles Dickson Archibald, was satisfied and discharged as fully and completely as if the former had actually paid the whole amount of six thousand pounds secured by the bond[46].\nThis being so, even if the other conditions of the right to the equitable liability to contribution had been present, it is manifest that it could not have been applied without the inequitable and unjust result of compelling payment twice over (i. e. pro tanto) according to the relative value of the subsequently acquired lots. In this respect also I therefore entirely agree with the judgment of Mr. Justice Townshend.\nLastly, a further question has been raised which is not set up in the pleadings and which does not seem to have been brought under the notice of the learned judges who dealt with the case in the courts below, and which is not in any way adverted to in the appellant's factum. It is said that Mrs. Breffit, being a married woman, was not bound by the compromise transaction which resulted in the discharge of the indemnity bond. I am of opinion that there is nothing in this objection. It sufficiently appears that the indemnity bond, so far as Mrs. Breffit was entitled to the benefit of it, was her separate property. This appears from a recital in the memorandum of agreement of the 23rd of May, 1882, entered into by Mrs. Breffit and her husband, and Mr Grassie, the assignee. That recital is as follows:\nAnd whereas the said Annie Breffit claims to be beneficially entitled as part of her separate estate to the said sum of six thousand pounds and interest, secured by the said bond, and which claim to the extent of the same being separate estate of his wife they said John Hearne Breffit expressly admits and acknowledges, testified by his being a party hereto.\nThere is only printed in the appeal book before us the part of this memorandum of agreement executed by Mr. Grassie, but if there were nothing more than this, from it and the subsequent confirmation in the Bankruptcy Court and the settlement I should, in the absence of any defence based on this alleged incompetency being raised by the pleadings, have thought it one not to be now given effect to. There is, however, much more, for the deed of release of the 5th of November, 1884, by which the indemnity bond was discharged and the compromise was carried out, Mrs. Breffit and her husband both being parties to the deed, fully recites the agreement of the 23rd of May, 1882, and its confirmation by the Court of Bankruptcy. This, therefore, read together with the recited agreement is an express recognition of Mrs. Breffit's title by herself and her husband to the money secured by the bond as money settled to her separate use. Under these circumstances it appears to be beyond question that this court ought not now to give effect on behalf of Mrs. Breffit to an objection which she has not suggested herself, and which in any case would be unsustainable, more especially as it appears from the deed of release and from other documents in evidence that in the matter of the agreement with Mr. Grassie, as well as in the compromise of the bond debt, Mrs. Grassie was advised by Mr. Hodgson, a solicitor, who acted for her alone and who must be presumed to have watched over her interests.\nThe appeal is dismissed with costs.\nFOURNIER, TASCHEREAU and KING JJ. concurred.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014This action is brought by and in the interest of and for the benefit of the defendant Blowers Archibald one of the mortgagors in the mortgage in the pleadings mentioned, in his own right and as co-executor with William H. Archibald (another defendant) of the last will and testament of Thomas D. Archibald the other mortgagor in the mortgage which is now sought to be for closed in the names of the mortgagees and their representatives and an assignee of the mortgage who holds the same in trust for the mortgagors as plaintiffs, but in the interest of the mortgagors against the appellant who claims title in the manner hereinafter mentioned. This claim of the mortgagors is based upon an equity upon which they rely as entitling them to be reimbursed out of the mortgaged lands whereof the appellant is now seized by title derived by mesne conveyances from Charles Dickson Archibald to whom, as the mortgagors allege, the land was sold by them subject to the mortgage, and the mortgagors having in discharge of their covenant contained in the mortgage paid to the mortgagees the mortgage debt, they contend that they have now an equity which entitles them to use the names of the mortgagees and of their assignees as aforesaid, in the interest of them the mortgagors to reimburse themselves out of the mortgaged lands the amount so paid by them to the mortgagees with interest thereon.\nThis equity so invoked by the mortgagors is founded upon the principle that when lands in mortgage are sold by the mortgagor subject to the mortgage the mortgage debt is treated as the amount of, or part of, the purchase money agreed to be paid by the vendee, and that therefore if the vendee does not pay the mortgage debt but leaves the mortgagor to do so under his personal obligation, an equity arises in favour of the mortgagor, upon his paying the mortgage debt, to keep the mortgage alive for his own benefit, and in the name of the mortgagee or an assignee of the mortgagee to enforce the mortgage against the mortgaged lands in order to reimburse himself to the amount of the mortgage debt so paid by him. One of the questions involved in this, in some respects very singular and complicated case is, whether the circumstances of the present case are such as to entitle the mortgagors to have the benefit of that equitable principle to any, and if any to what, amount.\nThe mortgage now sought to be foreclosed in the interest of the mortgagors, was executed upon the lands therein mentioned to the mortgagees therein mentioned, upon the 24th May. 1859. The only title which the mortgagors Blowers Archibald and Thomas D. Archibald at the time of the execution of the said mortgage had to the lands therein mentioned,. was acquired by them in virtue of a sheriff's deed executed upon the 16th of the said month of May, 1859, under a decree of foreclosure and sale, made in a suit for the foreclosure of a certain mortgage bearing date the 27th day of September, 1849, and made by one Charles Dickson Archibald, since deceased, as mortgagor, to and in favour of one James Forman, as mortgagee, and for the sale of the premises thereby mortgaged.\nCharles Dickson Archibald, the mortgagor in that mortgage, was at the time of the execution of the mortgage a partner in a trading firm consisting of himself and the said Blowers Archibald and Thomas D. Archibald, and the mortgage was executed upon property belonging to the said Charles Dickson Archibald alone in security for a sum of money which was the debt of the firm. In the month of December, 1853, the firm was dissolved by the retirement of the said Charles Dickson Archibald therefrom. By a deed of dissolution then executed the continuing partners Blowers Archibald and Thomas D. Archibald covenanted with the said Charles Dickson Archibald that they would as quickly as possible wind up the affairs of the old firm by collecting the assets and discharging the liabilities thereof, and that so soon as they should have discharged the debts due to the several creditors of the firm who should sign a deed of arrangement agreed upon as containing the terms of the dissolution, and so soon as they should be able to pay all the debts of the firm, including the said mortgage debt to Forman, which they said Charles Dickson Archibald was by the said mortgage primarily liable to pay, they would repay him such amount and also any other amount which he should be legally liable to pay, and should pay as a partner in the said firm. The decree of foreclosure in the suit upon the Forman mortgage appears to have been obtained and the sale thereunder to have taken place during the absence of Charles Dickson Archibald in England. There is a letter among the exhibits dated the 26th of May, 1859, from Thomas D. Archibald at Sydney, Cape Breton, addressed to Charles Dickson Archibald, by which it appears that the latter had, upon the 14th of the same month of May, written from New York to the former remonstrating against the foreclosure proceedings and complaining that until his arrival at New York from England he had never heard of such proceedings having been taken, for in that letter of the 26th May, Thomas D. Archibald makes use of the following language:\nIt appears to me very strange indeed that up to the time of your writing from New York you did not know that Forman had foreclosed his mortgage and sold your property on the 4th May. It was advertised on the 29th of March and Adams Archibald was in communication with Edward at New York respecting the sale. Some time previous to my leaving Halifax in the spring I took it for granted that you were advised of the time the sale was to take place, and had made up your mind to let it go. Finding the property was to be sold over our heads I made arrangements to purchase it, and bought it in at the sheriff's sale for \u00a34,500. I got the money from Gammell and Christie and gave them a mortgage from the sheriff's deed. Had I not been prepared to purchase it would have fallen into the hands of a young Englishman by the name of Butler, who came out to reside here and brought with him some \u00a36,000 to invest. I was glad to get possession of it for I expected opposition from various quarters. It is better it should fall into our hands than into the hands of strangers, and I presume you will be pleased to find it is so.\nIn addition to the fact already shown, that by the deed of dissolution Thomas D. Archibald and Blowers Archibald, who had undertaken the winding up of the affairs of the dissolved firm, were out of the assets of the firm eventually to pay off the amount secured by the mortgage as a debt of the firm, Blowers Archibald, in his evidence given in the present case, states some facts which throw light upon the passage above extracted from the letter of the 26th May, 1859, which tend to show that in purchasing at the foreclosure sale Thomas D. and Blowers Archibald were in fact \"buying in\" the property to protect Charles Dickson Archibald's rights and interests therein, and in recognition of their own liability to pay the debts secured by the mortgage out of assets of the firm, and for protection also of their own interests as occupying a part, if not the whole, of the property called the Ferris property, under Charles Dickson Archibald, in carrying on the business which they carried on since the retirement of Charles Dickson Archibald and the dissolution thereby of the old firm, and that they had no idea of acquiring the property as their own absolute property. By the evidence of Blowers Archibald it appears that the firm, which consisted of himself and Thomas D. and Charles Dickson Archibald, was formed in 1838 upon the dissolution of a firm theretofore existing under the name of S. G. Archibald & Co.; that S. G. Archibald & Co. up to and at the time of the dissolution of that firm occupied property called the Ferris property under a lease from S. G. Archibald, the then owner thereof in fee, which lease expired in 1838. That the new firm of Archibald & Co., formed in 1838, continued to occupy the same property under Charles Dickson Archibald, the then owner thereof in fee, until the dissolution of the firm in 1853, and that thereafter Thomas D. Archibald and Blowers Archibald, who still carried on the same business, continued to occupy the same property under Charles Dickson Archibald until and at the time of the sheriff's sale under the decree in the suit upon the Forman mortgage, which covered a part at least if not the whole of the property called the Ferris property. It is obvious, therefore, that in 1859, when the property in that mortgage was offered for sale under the decree of foreclosure, Thomas D. Archibald and Blowers Archibald had a sufficient motive to have induced them to have \"bought in\" the property, as Thomas D. Archibald expresses himself in the letter of the 26th May, 1859, in the interest of Charles Dickson Archibald, as well as in their own interest and not for themselves adverse to Charles Dickson Archibald, and this seems to explain the expression in the letter to the effect that he Thomas D. Archibald presumed that Charles Dickson Archibald would have been pleased to find that they had \"bought in\" the property. Accordingly we find that upon the arrival of Charles Dickson Archibald at Sydney from England, where he appears to have taken up his permanent abode, he and Thomas D. Archibald and Blowers Archibald seem to have come to an understanding with each other whereby the said Thomas D. and Blowers Archibald in recognition of Charles Dickson Archibald's right and claim to have the property so purchased reconveyed to him, agreed to convey to him to have and to hold to the use of himself, his heirs and assigns, in fee simple the estate which they then had in the lands mortgaged, that is to say, subject to the mortgage, but that they would keep him, his heirs and assigns and the lands absolutely indemnified, and saved harmless from all claim by the mortgagees upon the land for the mortgage debt. This arrangement so agreed upon was carried into effect by the execution by the said Thomas D. Archibald and Blowers Archibald of an indenture bearing date the 20th July, 1859, and a bond of the same date also executed by them. By the indenture they conveyed, among other lands, unto the said Charles D. Archibald, his heirs and assigns, the lands which were described as follows, that is to say:\nThose two certain lots of land situate and being at the Bar of North Sydney aforesaid, which formerly belonged to John Ferris and John Cameron, the said lots fronting on the waters of Sydney Harbour or Spanish River, and being bounded on the east by the property of Samuel Plant, and on the west by the property of the General Mining Association and containing each 100 acres, more or less, the said lots being now or formerly in the occupation of Archibald and Company. Also all that lot or parcel of land at North Sydney aforesaid, on which the brick store or warehouse is situated, and which formerly belonged to Clark and Archibald, the above mentioned lots described as formerly belonging to John Ferris and John Cameron, and containing 100 acres each, more or less, being subject to a mortgage dated the 24th day of the month of May now last past, and made between the said parties of the first part, and William Gammell and John Christie, Esquires, of little Bras d'Or, in the county of Cape Breton, for a consideration therein contained, together with all and singular the houses, outhouses, buildings and improvements therein and thereto belonging. To have and to hold (subject nevertheless to the mortgage incumbrance to the said William Gammell and John Christie) of the two certain lots hereinbefore mentioned unto the said Charles Dickson Archibald, his heirs and assigns forever.\nThe bond of even date with the above indenture was executed in a penalty of \u00a312,000, Nova Scotia currency, and the recitals and conditions thereof are as follows:\nWhereas the real estate belonging to the said Charles Dickson Archibald situate at the Bar (so called) North Sydney, in the county of Cape Breton, recently in the name, of the said Thomas Dickson Archibald and Blowers Archibald consisting of two lots of land formerly belonging to John Ferris and John Cameron containing each one hundred acres more or less hath been conveyed by way of mortgage to William Gammell and John Christie for the consideration of the sum of six thousand pounds by the said Thomas Dickson Archibald and Blowers Archibald by indenture bearing date the 24th day of May in the present year as by reference to said indenture will appear.\nAnd whereas the said Thomas Dickson Archibald and Blowers Archibald have this day conveyed the said premises to the said Charles Dickson Archibald and have agreed to pay off and discharge the said sum of six thousand pounds and all interest due thereon, and to save harmless the said Charles; Dickson. Archibald, his heirs and assigns, from all claims or demands of the said William Gammell and John Christie, and to relieve the said real estate from all liability under the said mortgage, they having received the benefit of the amount for which said mortgage was given.\nNow the condition of this obligation is such that if the said Thomas Dickson Archibald and. Blowers Archibald their heirs, executors, administrators and assigns-do and shall well and truly indemnify and save harmless the said Charles Dickson Archibald his heirs and assigns from all claims of the said William Gammell and John Christie for and on account of the said mortgage and shall discharge the debt due on said premises that the same may be finally free from all liability on account of said mortgage then the foregoing obligation to be void, otherwise to remain in full force and virtue.\nThe recitals in their instrument contain a statement of pre-existing facts which are here acknowledged as such for the purpose of explaining why the obligors should enter into the obligation contained in the bond to protect and save harmless the grantee of the real estate, which had been conveyed by the indenture of even date, and his heirs and assigns, subject to a mortgage, and the real estate itself so conveyed from all liability under that mortgage. The facts so admitted to exist substantially are to the effect that the real estate mortgaged by the obligors, although appearing on registry in their names as the legal owners thereof so as to make the mortgage legal and binding in the hands of the mortgagees, was in truth and justice and in equity the property of the obligee, to whom the mortgagors had in recognition of such his right conveyed by the indenture of even date the estate remaining; and that as the mortgagors had taken advantage of their apparent legal title to mortgage, as their own, lands which in truth and equity were the property of the obligee in security for moneys lent to and received and enjoyed by the mortgagors to their own use, justice and equity required that they should indemnify the transferee of the land, who was the true owner thereof, and his heirs and assigns, and the land itself so transferred from all liability under the mortgage. These facts being admitted or proved would have entitled Charles Dickson Archibald, wholly apart from the bond and if none had ever been executed, to have obtained relief in equity and indemnity from the mortgagors against the mortgage so executed, and this even after the execution of the indenture, which had conveyed the lands to him and his heirs and assigns, in terms \"subject to the mortgage.\" Those words in the indenture in the presence of the above facts would be construed as having been inserted for the purpose merely of designating the estate which the grantors had; but to the transfer of such estate there would be attached, by reason of the facts admitted, a right in equity vested in the grantee, his heirs and assigns, to have the lands relieved by the mortgagors thereof from all liability under the mortgage; and in such a case, in the event of the mortgagors paying off the mortgage and procuring a transfer of it to a trustee for their benefit, they never could have made the claim now made by them of enforcing the mortgage in the names of the mortgagees, or of the transferee thereof, for their own benefit against the lands mortgaged upon the ground that they had expressly conveyed the lands to Charles Dickson Archibald subject to the mortgage. Now the only benefit which Charles Dickson Archibald obtained by reason of the execution of the bond of the 20th July, 1859, was that he and his heirs and assigns should have the additional security of the right of maintaining an action at law upon the bond, and of recovering thereon to the amount of the penalty as security for such damage as they should sustain by reason of a breach of the condition of the bond to be assigned upon the record in the action and proved. Upon the same 20th day of July, 1859, Charles Dickson Archibald by an indenture of lease of that date demised and let to the said Thomas D. Archibald and Blowers Archibald for a term of 21 years, to be computed from the 1st day of the then present month of July, at a rental of \u00a3100 per annum of the money of Nova Scotia for the first ten years, and of \u00a36200 of like money per annum for the residue of the term, a certain water lot therein particularly described, the description of which has a bearing upon the second question raised in this case, and will have to be considered by and bye, but need not be set out at present.\nUpon the 26th of July, 1859, Charles Dickson Archibald, by an indenture of bargain and sale, granted, bargained, sold and conveyed unto one Charles William Archibald, his heirs and assigns, to have and to have and hold to his and their own use for ever\nthose two certain lots of land situate at the bar of North Sydney, in the Island of Cape Breton, known as lots numbers 5 and 6, theretofore belonging to John Cameron and John Ferris, deceased, said lots fronting on the waters of Sydney or Spanish River, and being bounded on the east by the property of Samuel Plant, and on the west by the property of the General Mining Association, and containing each 100 acres, more or less, subject to a lease of part of the said premises to Thomas Dickson Archibald and Blowers Archibald. Also all the front of lot no. 2, situate near the above described lots as the same was reserved on the sale and conveyance of the residue of the said lot no. 2 to one William Peppet, and also all and singular those wharf and water lots, and lands covered with water, situate and being in front of the said lots nos. 2, 5 and 6, as the same are delineated and described in the grant thereof to the said Charles Dickson Archibald, together with all and singular the houses, stores, warehouses, buildings, piers, wharves, quays and docks, &c., to the said several lots and parcels of land, and land covered with water belonging.\nIt is admitted that this indenture was drawn by Charles Dickson Archibald himself and not by a professional man, and the fact that it was so drawn is urged on the part of the appellant as explaining a passage therein which, as the appellant insists, is manifestly an erroneous statement of matter of fact, but which, on the contrary, is relied upon by the respondents as supporting their contention upon the second question arising in this case, and to which I shall have occasion to refer by and bye. I am at present dealing only with the question as to the equity, if any, which the mortgagors have to enforce in their own interest the mortgage in the names of the mortgagees upon the land mortgaged, whatever they may have been, deferring for the present the consideration of the question of what lands were mortgaged, which is the second question in the case. Upon the 3rd day of June, 1862, the said Charles William Archibald, by an indenture of bargain and sale of that date, granted, bargained, sold and confirmed unto Anne Parker, then a widow residing in England, and to her heirs and assigns, all the several lots of land and land covered with water which had been conveyed to him by the said indenture of the 26th July, 1859. The said Anne Parker afterwards intermarried with one John Hearne Breffit, whose wife she was in the month of May, 1882, when the transaction next hereinafter mentioned took place between her and one Thomas Ritchie Grassie, who is said to have been the creditors' assignee in England of the estate and effects of the said Charles Dickson Archibald, who in his life time, but then deceased, had become bankrupt in England. At this time Mrs. Breffit was seized of the whole of the estate which Charles Dickson Archibald had at the time of the execution by him of the indenture of 26th July, 1859, in the lands mortgaged by Thomas D. Archibald and Blowers Archibald by the indenture of the 24th May, 1859, and of all the rights and equities existing against the mortgagors in that indenture by reason of the existence of the facts which occasioned the execution of the bond of the 20th July, 1859. No one but herself and her husband in her right had any estate or interest in the estate in the said lands so conveyed to her, nor in the equities attached thereto against the mortgagors arising out of the existence of the facts aforesaid, nor in the said bond of the 20th July, 1859. That bond was not a money bond, conditional for the payment of money to the obligee, his executors, administrators or assigns. It was simply a bond the condition of which was to indemnify Charles Dickson Archibald as the true owner of the land mortgaged wrongfully by the mortgagors who had only apparently a legal title, which apparent title made the mortgage good in the interests of the mortgagees against the land, and released the heirs and assigns of the said Charles Dickson Archibald and the lands mortgaged from all liability under the mortgage; in such a bond the creditors' assignee in bankruptcy had no interest, as it is not pretended nor alleged that he had any estate or interest in the lands to be indemnified from the mortgage.\nAn instrument to which the signature of Thomas R. Grassie alone is appended has been produced in evidence which purports to contain the terms of an agreement entered into in the month of May, 1882, between Mrs. Breffit and her husband of the one part and the said Thomas R. Grassie of the other part. It is as follows:\nMemorandum of agreement made on the twenty-third day of May, one thousand eight hundred and eighty-two between Annie Breffit formerly Annie Parker widow, now the wife of John Hearne Breffit of Snarebrook in the county of Essex, gentleman, and the said John Hearne Breffit for the one part, and Thomas Ritchie Grassie of Gresham House Old Broad street in the city of London of the other part creditors' assignee of the estate and effects of one Charles Dickson Archibald deceased a bankrupt.\nWhereas by a bond dated the twentieth day of July, one thousand eight hundred and fifty-nine, under the hands and seals of Thomas Dickson Archibald and Blowers Archibald, the said Thomas Dickson Archibald and Blowers Archibald became bound unto Charles Dickson Archibald the above named bankrupt in a penal sum for securing payment by the said Thomas Dickson Archibald and Blowers Archibald their executors administrators and assigns, unto the said Charles Dickson Archibald his executors administrators and assigns of a certain sum of six thousand pounds and interest therein mentioned which said sum in the events which have happened is now due and owing; and whereas the said Annie Breffit claims to be beneficially entitled as part of her separate estate to the said sum of six thousand pounds and interest secured by the said bond, and which claim, to the extent of the same being separate estate of his wife, the said John Hearne Breffit hereby expressly admits and acknowledges, testified by his being a party hereto, but her claim is disputed by the said Thomas Ritchie Grassie as such creditors' assignee as aforesaid; and whereas the said Annie Breffit has applied to the said Thomas Ritchie Grassie to allow her to use his name for the purpose of taking proceedings for the recovery of the money due upon the said bond and has offered to pay to the said Thomas Ritchie Grassie, as creditors' assignee as aforesaid, one clear half of all moneys which she may recover in such proceedings in discharge of all his claim as such assignee to the moneys secured by the said bond, and the said Thomas Ritchie Grassie is willing to accept such offer upon the conditions hereinafter contained, provided he obtains the sanction of the Court of Bankruptcy to this agreement. Now it is hereby agreed between the said parties as follows:\n1. That the said Thomas Ritchie Grassie shall empower the said Annie Breffit, her executors, administrators and assigns, in the name of him the said Thomas Ritchie Grassie as creditors' assignee as aforesaid, and his successors in interest, to call in and compel payment of the said debt of six thousand pounds and of all interest for the same and by all legal proceedings to enforce the said bond, and to give effectual discharges of the said debt, and for that purpose shall execute all such further documents to be prepared at the expense of the said Annie Breffit as shall be necessary.\n2. That the said Annie Breffit shall with all due diligence and reasonable speed after this agreement shall have been sanctioned as hereinafter provided, take all such steps and proceedings legal and otherwise at her own sole cost and expense, as shall be necessary for recovering the said sum of six thousand pounds and interest and enforcing the said bond, and shall pay to the said Thomas Ritchie Grassie, as such creditors' assignee or his successors in interest, one clear half of any and all sums received or recovered by virtue of the said bond, free from any deduction, which same sum or sums the said Thomas Ritchie Grassie shall accept in full satisfaction and discharge of all right, title, claim and interest of him the said Thomas Ritchie Grassie as such creditors' assignee, his successors in interest, of, in and to the said bond and the moneys thereby secured.\n3. That the said John Hearne Breffit and Annie Breffit shall indemify and hold harmless the said Thomas Ritchie Grassie, his executors, administrators, assigns and his successors in interest, and the estate of the said bankrupt, against all costs, expenses, payments, judgments, orders, claims, actions, suits and liabilities whatsoever occasioned by or in any way incidental to, or arising out of any acts or proceedings legal or otherwise that may be necessary to enforce the said bond and recover the moneys thereby secured or otherwise arising directly or indirectly from the use of his name.\n4. That notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein contained, this agreement shall be void and of no effect, unless sanctioned by Her Majesty's London Court of Bankruptcy upon application duly made, as witness the hands of the said parties.\nThis instrument appears to be signed by Thomas R. Grassie alone, but it appears to have been recognized by an indenture bearing date the 5th day of November. 1884, which is executed under the hands and seals of Mrs. Breffit and her husband and the said Thomas R. Grassie which is in the terms following:\nThis indenture made the fifth day of November, 1884, between Annie Breffit the wife of John Hearne Breffit of Tyne Villa, &c., &c., &c., gentleman, and the said John Hearne Breffit of the first part, and Thomas Ritchie Grassie of, &c., in the city of London, creditors' assignee of the estate and effects of Charles Dickson Archibald deceased, a bankrupt of the second part, and Thomas Dickson Archibald and Blowers Archibald both of Nova Scotia of the third part. Whereas by a bond dated the 20th day of July, 1859, under the hands and seals of the said Thomas Dickson Archibald and Blowers Archibald, the said Thomas Dickson Archibald and Blowers Archibald became bound to Charles Dickson Archibald the above named bankrupt in a penal sum for securing payment by the said Thomas Dickson Archibald and Blowers Archibald unto the said Charles Dickson Archibald his executors, administrators and assigns of a certain sum of six thousand pounds and interest therein mentioned. And whereas the said Annie Breffit and Thomas Ritchie Grassie have both claimed to be entitled to the principal moneys and interest secured by the said bond. And whereas by an agreement bearing date the 23rd day of May, 1882, and made subject to the sanction of the London Court of Bankruptcy between the said Annie Breffit and John Hearne Breffit of the one part and the said Thomas Ritchie Grassie of the other part, the said parties agreed to take proceedings upon the said bond for the recovery of the moneys thereby secured in the manner therein provided and to divide all moneys recovered by virtue of the said bond in equal moieties between them, that is to say, that the said Thomas Ritchie Grassie should receive and take one moiety thereof and the said Annie Breffit the other moiety thereof, and such arrangement was afterwards sanctioned and the agreement duly confirmed by order of the London Court of Bankruptcy made on the 15th day of June, 1882. And whereas the said Thomas Dickson Archibald and Blowers Archibald are unable to pay the said principal moneys and interest secured by the said bond and also dispute their liability to pay the same. And whereas the said parties hereto of the first and second parts being satisfied of their inability to pay the said moneys in full and in settlement of the said dispute as to liabilities, agreed with the said Thomas Dickson Archibald and Blowers Archibald subject to the sanction of the said court, to accept in settlement and discharge of the moneys payable by virtue of the said bond, the sum of eight thousand dollars in four promissory notes of two thousand dollars each Canadian currency with interest to be signed by five members of the firm of Messrs. Archibald and Company of Cape Breton, and also signed or indorsed by Mr. McLean the president of the Bank of Nova Scotia, such notes to bear date the 16th day of June, 1884, and to be payable respectively on the 31st days of December, 1884, 1885, 1886 and 1887. And whereas such agreement was duly sanctioned and confirmed by the London Court of Bankruptcy by an order bearing date the 15th day of October, 1894. And whereas the said four promissory notes have been drawn for the said respective amounts and interest, and have been signed by five members of the firm of Messrs. Archibald and Company, and have been indorsed by Mr. McLean, the president of the said bank, and at the request of the said Annie Breffit and John Hearne Breffit and Thomas Ritchie Grassie, have been made payable to the joint order of Charles Harris Hodgson, the solicitor for the said Annie Breffit and John Hearne Breffit, and to the order of Arthur Torriano Rickards, the solicitor of the said Thomas Ritchie Grassie. And whereas the said promissory notes have at the like request of the said Annie Breffit, John Hearne Breffit and Thomas Ritchie Grassie, been handed to the said Charles Harris Hodgson and Arthur Torriano Rickards on their behalf, as they the said Annie Breffit, John Hearne Breffit and Thomas Ritchie Grassie, do hereby respectively admit and acknowledge. And whereas upon such promissory notes being handed over as aforesaid, the said Annie Breffit, John Hearne Breffit and Thomas Ritchie Grassie, agreed to execute such release as hereinafter mentioned. Now this indenture witnesseth, that in pursuance of such agreement and in consideration of the premises the said Annie Breffit and John Hearne Breffit and Thomas Ritchie Grassie do and each of them doth hereby release the said Thomas Dickson Archibald and Blowers Archibald, their and each of their heirs, executors, administrators, estates and effects from the said bond dated the 20th day of July, 1859, and from the sum of \u00bf\u00a36,000 and interest intended to be thereby secured, and every part thereof. Provided always, and it is hereby agreed and declared that this present release shall not extend to the said sum of eight thousand dollars secured by the four promissory notes before mentioned, or any part thereof.\nAnd on the back of the said bond is indorsed a memorandum which is signed by the said Annie Breffit and Thomas Ritchie Grassie, and bearing date the same 5th day of November, 1884, which is as follows:\u2014\nMemorandum\u2014the principal moneys and interest secured by the within bond have become vested jointly in Annie Breffit, wife of John Hearne Breffit of Tyne Villa, Grove Hill, Woodford, in the County of Essex, gentleman, and Thomas Ritchie Grassie of Gresham House, London, creditors' assignee of the within named Charles Dickson Archibald, and all claims in respect of the within bond have been duly satisfied by the transfer by the within named obligators to the said Annie Breffit and Thomas Ritchie Grassie, of four promissory notes for two thousand dollars each, payable respectively on the 31st days of December, 1884, 1885, 1886 and 1887, respectively, and the said Annie Breffit, John Hearne Breffit and Thomas Ritchie Grassie have by indenture bearing even date with this memorandum released the said obligors from the said bond and the moneys intended to be thereby secured and the said bond has accordingly been given up to the obligors and cancelled.\n(Signed) ANNIE BREFFIT.\n\" THOS. R. GRASSIE,\nAssignee in Bankruptcy of C. D. Archibald.\nI am unable, I must confess, to understand by what means Mrs. Breffit and her husband could have been induced to sign these instruments which so misrepresent the true nature, purport and effect of the bond and its conditions, and which are so at variance with her real rights and interest in the lands mortgaged and in the bond. Their having signed the instruments is, to my mind, only explicable by their having been ignorant of Mrs. Breffit's title and estate in the lands, and of her equitable rights against the mortgagors, by reason of her deriving title from Charles Dickson Archibald the true owner of the land as against the mortgagors. However, they have signed the instruments and we must now determine the effect of their having done so upon the present action, for to whatever extent the estate of Mrs. Breffit in the lands was affected by them, the estate of the appellant must be affected also, as he derives title from her by a deed dated the 10th April, 1885. The statement of claim is framed as an ordinary action for foreclosure of a mortgage instituted by the mortgagees, and a person deriving title by assignment from them against the mortgagors and parties alleged to be seized of the equity of redemption, of whom the appellant is one, subject to the mortgage. The appellant in his defence among other defences alleged that the mortgage was paid off by the mortgagors and so satisfied and that the present action was instituted by them in their own interest, but in the name of the mortgagees and a person to whom they had procured the mortgage to be assigned, but in trust for their benefit. In their reply to this defence the mortgagors, for there is no doubt that the action is instituted by them and in their interest, set up what is the true foundation upon which the first question in this case, as it appears to me, must depend. They allege, as they do also in their defence to a counter claim of the appellant:\nThat before the said Peter Imrie became purchaser of the equity of redemption in the lands and premises described in the said mortgage, the said Thomas Dickson Archibald and Blowers Archibald agreed with the said Annie Breffit and John Hearne Breffit, who were the immediate predecessors in title of the said Peter Imrie in the said lands and premises and the then owners thereof, that they the said Thomas Dickson Archibald and Blowers Archibald would pay to the said Annie Breffit and John Hearne Breffit the amount of the said mortgage debt and the interest due thereon, and that said mortgage should remain a charge on the said lots of land, and that the said lots should be a security therefor, and that the said Annie Breffit and John Hearne Breffit would assume said mortgage debt and the interest due thereon, and release the said Thomas Dickson Archibald and Blowers Archibald from all liability therefor; that the said Thomas Dickson Archibald and Blowers Archibald accordingly did pay to the said Annie Breffit and John Hearne Breffit the whole of said mortgage debt and all interest due thereon, and the said Peter Imrie had notice and knowledge of said facts at and before the time he became purchaser of the lands described in said mortgage.\nUpon the above allegations is rested the right of the mortgagors who, as now clearly appears, having paid and discharged the mortgage debt, have instituted this action in their own interest but in the names of the mortgagees and their assignee, who holds the mortgage in trust for the mortgagors, to charge the lands and the estate of the appellant therein with the principal of the mortgage debt so paid off amounting to $23,360 and the interest thereon from the 1st of June, 1880, which interest it is claimed amounted upon the 5th February, 1889, to $12,172.80. It is in support of the above allegations that the several documents executed respectively by Mrs. Breffit, her husband, and Thomas Ritchie Grassie were produced; there was no evidence whatever of such an agreement having been entered into or any agreement of a like effect unless the instruments produced contain within themselves such an agreement; there is no pretense that the whole mortgage debt and interest was as is alleged paid to Mrs. Breffit and John Hearne Breffit; but what is now contended is that the instruments in themselves contain an agreement quite different from that alleged, namely, that in consideration of the eight thousand dollars paid by Thomas Dickson Archibald and Blowers Archibald as mentioned in the instruments, Mrs. Breffit and her husband would assume the said mortgage debt and the interest due thereon and that the said mortgage should remain a charge upon the said Annie Breffit's estate in the said lands and that she and her husband would release the mortgagors from all liability therefor. This contention, as already observed, is quite different from that alleged in the pleadings by the mortgagors and in my opinion it cannot prevail. I cannot but think that if it had been represented to Mrs. Breffit and her husband that by the instruments which they signed they were charging her estate in the lands or incurring any obligation to pay the mortgage debt and interest and to indemnify the mortgagors from the payment thereof they never would have signed the instruments, nor if that had really been their intention could the instruments have been framed in the shape in which they were. Having regard to the circumstances under which the indenture of the 20th of July, 1859, was executed, although that deed purported to convey the lands to Charles Dickson Archibald, his heirs and assigns, subject however to the mortgage, if the mortgagors had paid off the mortgage in the life time of Charles Dickson Archibald they never could have asserted any equity against him to be indemnified to the amount of the mortgage debt out of the lands so conveyed to him even though no bond of indemnity had ever been executed by the mortgagors; the facts the existence of which occasioned the execution of the bond would have afforded a complete answer to any such claim if asserted on behalf of the mortgagors. So neither could the mortgagors make any such claim against the heirs or assigns of the said Charles Dickson Archibald; the estate of his heirs or assigns in the lands conveyed to him by that indenture would be entitled to the same protection from the assertion of such an equity by the mortgagors as Charles Dickson Archibald would himself have been entitled to, if living, and still seized of the lands so conveyed to him. The mortgagors, therefore, cannot succeed in the present suit in virtue of the words \"subject to the mortgage,\" &c., &c., contained in the indenture of the 20th July, 1859. The question is not one between the mortgagees bon\u00e2 fide seeking to enforce their mortgage security against persons who as between themselves and the mortgagees are undoubtedly seized only of an estate in the lands subject to the mortgage, but the question is: What right, legal or equitable, have the mortgagors after having in discharge of their personal obligation to the mortgagees paid and satisfied them their mortgage debt to claim to be indemnified for such payment out of the mortgaged lands whereof the appellant is seized by title derived from Charles D. Archibald, to whom the mortgagors had reconveyed the lands, nominally it is true, \"subject to the mortgage,\" but in reality for the purpose of reverting in him, his heirs and assigns, his own property, the apparent title to which the mortgagors had acquired under circumstances which vested in him the right in equity to have the lands reconveyed to him indemnified from the mortgage? The mortgagors can only sustain such a claim in virtue of an express contract of the appellant or of some one under whom he claims title. In view of the circumstances under which the indenture of the 20th July, 1859, was executed, there was not as already shown any such contract involved in that indenture notwithstanding the words \"subject to the mortgage,\" &c., &c., therein used. There was no contract existing whereby Mrs. Breffit was under any obligation either personally or through her estate in the lands to indemnify the mortgagors against the payment of their mortgage debt prior to the execution by her upon the 5th November, 1884, of the release of the bond of the 20th July, 1859, nor at any time unless such a contract is contained expressly in the terms of that release. If the bond so released had never been executed the circumstances which constituted the occasion of its having been executed, when executed, were in themselves sufficient to exclude all idea of Charles D. Archibald, his heirs or assigns, being under any obligation whatever to indemnify the mortgagors against the payment of their mortgage debt in whole or in part. It is impossible therefore, in my opinion, to hold that the release of such a bond can place the assigns of Charles D. Archibald in a worse position than they would have been in if the bond had never been executed. There had been no original contract of indemnity in existence which could be said to have been suspended only during the existence of the bond and reinstated by its release. The release contains no language amounting to a personal covenant to indemnify the mortgagors against the payment of their debt to the mortgagees, and there is no language used competent to create a charge by Mrs. Breffit in favour of the mortgagors upon her estate in the lands; and moreover such a charge even if expressly stated could only be made valid by a deed executed by Mrs. Breffit, she having been a married woman, in a precise manner prescribed by statute and not pursued in the execution of the release.\nIn fine there can, I think, be no doubt that that instrument did not operate nor was it ever intended to operate as an instrument creating a charge upon Mrs. Breffit's estate in the lands in favour of the mortgagors, and if it did not create such a charge there is no instrument which did.\nUpon what then can this equity which is insisted upon by the mortgagors be rested? There is nothing whatever in my opinion upon which it can be at all rested unless it be upon the fact of the payment of the eight thousand dollars which the mortgagors paid apart from all consideration of the accompanying release of the bond; upon that payment it may I think be rested but limited to the amount so paid and interest thereon.\nIn the absence of all evidence of any such agreement as that alleged by the mortgagors in the pleadings for their indemnity against the mortgage debt having been actually entered into between them and Mrs. Breffit and her husband, and having in view what were her real rights and interests at the time of the payment of the $8,000, and the incorrect manner in which her rights and interests were represented in the instruments signed by her, I think it impossible to construe these instruments or any of them as amounting to an agreement in consideration of the $8,000 paid by the mortgagors to Mrs. Breffit and the assignee in bankruptcy of Charles Dickson Archibald in equal shares to charge Mrs. Breffit's estate in the lands, or the lands, with a sum then amounting, according to the mortgagors' own showing, to the principal sum of $23,360, and interest thereon from the 1st of June, 1880, an amount exceeding $6,000, in the whole upwards of $29,360. As to the recital in the instruments that the mortgagors were unable to pay more than the $8,000, which seems to have been thought necessary to be inserted to give appearance of fairness to the arrangement, no stress can be laid on this, for the mortgagors seem to have had no difficulty in paying off the mortgage debt and all arrears of interest when sued by the mortgagees in 1887. To the extent of the amount of the $8,000 which was paid by the mortgagors in November, 1884, I think we may recognize their equitable right to be reimbursed out of the lands mortgaged. Mrs. Breffit must, I think, be regarded as having received the whole of that sum; for the amount which the assignee in bankruptcy of Charles Dickson Archibald who had no claim whatever upon the mortgagors received, must I think be considered as given to him by Mrs. Breffit who herself had no claim whatever to any part of the sum so paid unless by way of indemnity to herself and her estate from the mortgagees' claim under the mortgage to whom six thousand of the eight thousand dollars was then overdue for arrears of interest, not having applied the money in payment of the claims of the mortgagees; the mortgagors having paid off the mortgage in full may be permitted I think to claim indemnity out of the lands mortgaged and the appellant's estate therein to the amount of the said sum of $8,000 and interest thereon from the 5th day of November, 1884.\nThis leads to the consideration of the second question which is as to what were the lands mortgaged, which question is really narrowed to this: Was any, and if any what part of a certain water lot which was granted by the Crown to one John Ferris by letters patent dated the 8th April, 1826, covered by the mortgage? The water lot so granted is described in the said letters patent as\na water lot on the northern shore of the north-west branch of Sydney or Spanish River being part of the stone ballast heap in front of lot no. 6 granted to Francis Jones, beginning at a stake south forty-three degrees west one hundred and eight links from the south-eastern corner boundary of said lot no. 6, and thence bounded by the outline of the ballast heap to within a few paces of the extreme end, so as measure four hundred links from the shore at the extreme length to intersect the western outline of the said ballast heap at three hundred and fifty-five links from the shore, thence following the said outline to the shore, and thence along the shore to the place of commencement; also a projection on the eastern side line of the ballast heap, and near the south-eastern extremity thereof measuring sixteen feet in breadth and fifty feet in length, making the whole of the extreme breadth two hundred and four links, containing about three-quarters of an acre.\nBy an indenture bearing date the 1st May, 1838, the administrators of the estate of John Ferris, jr., conveyed to Charles Dickson Archibald, in fee simple, lot no. 6, on the north-west arm of Spanish River, by the description contained in the grant thereof from the Crown to one Francis Jones, dated 1st June, 1794, namely, as follows:\u2014 Beginning at the south-east corner of lot no. 5 below the said mill creek, from thence running by the magnet north 33\u00b0 W. 156 chains (of four rods each) more or less, to the north-east corner boundary of lot no. 5, thence north 57\u00b0 east 8 chains, thence south 33\u00b0 east 155 chains, more or less, to the shore of the river as above mentioned, thence westerly following the windings of the said shore to the place of beginning,\nand also the above water lot in front of the said lot no. 6, as described in the said letters patent therefor to the said John Ferris, dated 8th April, 1826. By letters patent bearing date the 28th day of December, 1847, three several water lots lying in front of shore lots nos. 2, 5 and 6, on the north shore of the north-west arm of Sydney harbour were granted by the Crown to Charles Dickson Archibald by special descriptions respectively in the said letters patent mentioned, the description of the water lot in front of the shore lot no. 6 is so drawn as to include within its limits the stone ballast heap lot as granted to John Ferris by letters patent of the 8th of April, 1826; and the description was so framed doubtless because Charles Dickson Archibald was then seized in fee of the water lot or stone ballast heap lot so granted to John Ferris. The description is as follows:\nAlso a lot lying in front of the shore lot no. 6 heretofore granted to Francis Jones bounded by a line beginning on the shore at the western boundary of the said lot number six and thence running south thirty-three degrees east eleven chains and twenty links more or less into the harbour to the general boundary line aforesaid\n(namely, a line extending north fifty-seven degrees east from the south end of the water lot lying in front of the shore lot number two)\u2014\nthence north fifty-seven degrees east, eight chains, thence north thirty-three degrees west, ten chains and eighty links more or less to the shore at the eastern boundary of the said lot number six, and thence westerly along the shore boundary of the said lot number six and along the boundary of a wharf lot containing about three roods heretofore granted to John Ferris the younger to the place of commencement, containing eight acres and eight perches more or less. The shore lot no. 5 was granted by the Crown to one John Henry by letters patent bearing date the 20th January, 1792, by the following description:\nAll that tract or lot of land situate, lying and being on the north-east side of the north-west arm of Prince William Henry's Sound, and known and distinguished as lot number five which is butted and abounded as follows, viz., beginning at a fir tree on the bank side being the southwest corner boundary of lot no. 6, thence running by the magnet north thirty-three degrees west one hundred and fifty-six chains of four rods each; thence south fifty-seven degrees west eight chains; thence south thirty-three degrees east one hundred and fifty-seven chains more or less to the shore side of the arm aforesaid, and from thence to be bounded down stream by the several courses of the said shore to the boundary first mentioned, containing in the whole by estimation one hundred and ten acres more or less.\nThis lot was conveyed by John Henry the grantee to John Cameron in fee simple by indenture bearing date the 2nd of August, 1822, by the same description as that contained in the original grant thereof from the Crown and by John Cameron to Samuel George Archibald by indenture bearing date the 4th May, 1839, by the same description, excepting, however, therefrom certain parcels thereof theretofore conveyed by John Cameron to divers persons therein mentioned, by the deeds therein mentioned, and by indenture bearing date the 27th June, 1839, Samuel George Archibald conveyed to Charles Dickson Archibald the lands so conveyed to him, and by an indenture bearing date the 1st of February, 1838, the said Charles Dickson Archibald became seized in fee simple of one of the pieces so excepted. Now, the indenture of mortgage bearing date the 27th day of September, 1849, executed by Charles Dickson Archibald to John Forman, covered several parcels of land besides those with which we are at present concerned; these latter are therein described as follows:\u2014\nAlso all the estate, right, title, interest, equity and reversion of the said Charles Dickson Archibald, of, in and to those two certain lots of land situate and being at the bar at North Sydney aforesaid, and which heretofore belonged to John Ferris and John Cameron, the said lots fronting on the waters of Sydney harbour or Spanish river, and being bounded on the east by the property of Samuel Plant, and on the west by the property of the General Mining Association, and containing each one hundred acres, more or less, the said lots being now in the tenure and occupation of Messrs. Archibald and Company, and also all the right, title, interest, equity and reversion which he hath, or hereafter may or can have, in or to all that lot, piece or parcel of land at North Sydney aforesaid, on which the brick store or warehouse is situate, and which formerly belonged to Clarke and Archibald.\nThe question we have now to deal with is twofold, namely: 1st. Does the above description cover (as is averred by the respondents, the mortgagors, in whose interest the mortgage of the 24th May, 1859, is sought to be foreclosed, but denied by the appellant,) the stone ballast heap lot granted to John Ferris, jr., by the letters patent dated the 8th April, 1826? And 2nd, if it does, is that lot covered by the description in the mortgage of the 24th May, 1859? As to the first branch of this question it is difficult to conceive that by the description given Charles Dickson Archibald intended to include that lot which the letters patent of the 28th December, 1847, included within the limits of the larger water lot by those letters patent granted, whereby the smaller lot so became part of the larger water lot as to be utterly inaccessible by water save over the waters outside of the smaller and within the limits of the larger water lot, and so became valueless except as part of the larger water lot. Then by the evidence of Mr. John McLean, who has known the premises as far back as 1831 and thenceforward, it appears that Plant owned the land lot east of the Ferris land lot no. 6, and that he did not own any property east of the stone ballast heap lot, all east of that lot being land covered with water and used as a public dock; so much of which land covered with water as lay east of the ballast heap lot and in front of the land lot no. 6 is covered by the letters patent of the 28th December, 1847. Then he says further that he never knew of the ballast heap lot being spoken of as part of the land lot, that it was generally spoken of as the. Ferris water lot; when Ferris owned it, it was always known to be and called a water lot. Then Blowers Archibald in his evidence says, that Archibald & Co. did not occupy the whole of the Ferris land lot in 1838, 1849 and 1859, that they occupied about one quarter of the land lot no. 6 at those dates, and about 12 acres of the land lot no. 5, that they were acting as Charles Dickson Archibald's agents in respect of the back of lot no. 5, and were in possession for him but paid no rent for the rear part of those lots, that this possession continued up to the time when the mortgage of the 24th May, 1859, was executed, and as I understand him also until 1882. Between 1838 and 1859, he says that Archibald & Co. built a number of buildings on the land lots nos. 5 and 6 above the road, that is above the road which separated or was supposed to be on the line which separated the land lots from the water lots in front, that the price of those buildings was debited to Charles Dickson Archibald and the rent was paid by paying him 6 per cent on the cost of the buildings.\nThen he further says, that in 1836 he went to the North Bar to take charge of the store which Clarke and Archibald then had there upon the Ferris property, which he indicates as store marked no. 1 on a plan produced. This store seems to be placed partly upon what was or was supposed to be part of the ballast heap lot and partly on the road which is situate upon the lot no. 6 and separates the water lot in front of lot no. 6 from the part of that lot which was occupied by Archibald & Co. from 1838 under Charles Dickson Archibald. We have thus as it appears to me the clearest possible evidence that the land or shore lots nos. 5 and 6 alone in themselves answer the description of the land mortgaged as the \"two lots which heretofore belonged to John Ferris and John Cameron.\"\nThey are two lots containing each one hundred acres; taking them together they were bounded on the east by property of Samuel Plant and on the west by property of the General Mining Association; they did front on the waters of Sydney harbour and they were then in the occupation of Messrs. Archibald and Company, while the ballast heap lot never was bounded on the east by property of Samuel Plant and instead of fronting upon the waters of Sydney harbour it was a water lot situate in the waters of that harbour. In 1849 it had become and was in point of fact used as parcel of the greater water lot granted by the letters patent of the 28th December, 1847, to Charles Dickson Archibald, and that it should have then been dealt with as the old ballast heap lot, or intended to be covered by the description given in the mortgage is to my mind inconceivable, but such a construction becomes impossible when we find that besides the two lots containing each 100 acres, as above described, the mortgage expressly covers \"also the brick store which formerly belonged to Clarke and Archibald,\" and which appears to have been or to have been suffered to be partly upon the lot no. 6 and partly upon the ballast heap lot. It is impossible to say that any part of the ballast heap lot was included in the mortgage unless it be so much as was covered by the brick store which formerly belonged to Clarke and Archibald. The mortgage therefore in fact covered only so much of the two land lots nos. 5 and 6 as the mortgagor Charles Dickson Archibald was seized of, and the brick store formerly occupied by Clarke and Archibald. Then by the mortgage of the 24th May, 1859, now sought to be foreclosed in the interest of the mortgagors they, after stating the two lots intended to be mortgaged according to the precise description contained in the Forman mortgage, add these words\u2014\"further described as follows,\" and then set out the description given of the lots nos. 5 and 6 respectively in the original grants thereof from the Crown, from which they make certain exceptions, thus alleging in effect that the two lots granted by the Forman mortgage were the land lots 5 and 6 or the mortgagor's interest therein. The mortgage then proceeds thus\u2014\nAlso all and singular the water lots and docks in front of said lots and all the right and title of the said Thomas Dickson Archibald and Blowers Archibald therein and thereto with the wharves stores and erections together with all houses outhouses buildings and improvements thereon and thereto belonging, etc.\nAnd this is only the clause which can be appealed to as being sufficient to cover the brick store which formerly belonged to Clarke and Archibald, and which in those terms was covered by the Forman mortgage. It is, however, now argued by and on behalf of the mortgagors in the indenture of the mortgage of the 24th May, 1859, that this clause commencing \"also all and singular the water lots,\" &c., is part of the previous sentence, and therefore that what the mortgage says is that the prior part of the description of the two lots, as taken from the Forman mortgage covered the land lots 5 and 6, and also all and singular the water lots in front of those lots, but such a construction is plainly impossible, for it would include the whole of the eight-acre water lot in front of lot no. 6, and the water lot in front of lot no. 5, the former of which was leased to Thomas Dickson Archibald and Blowers Archibald for 21 years by the indenture of lease of the 20th July, 1859, and the latter subsequently sold by Charles Dickson Archibald; and, moreover, there is no pretense that any part of those water lots, nor until this argument was used, which is so at variance with the residue of the argument of the mortgagors, was it ever contended, that by the Forman mortgage any water lot was covered unless it was the small ballast heap lot; the argument, therefore, that the clause in the mortgage commencing \"also all and singular the water lots and docks in front of the said lots,\" &c., is to be read as part of the previous sentence cannot be entertained, and the result is that the effect to be given to this sentence can only be to cover the brick store which formerly belonged to Clarke and Archibald mentioned in the Forman mortgage, which together with the mortgagors' estate in the lots nos. 5 and 6, is all that the mortgage can cover of the property of Charles Dickson Archibald in which the appellant is interested.\nIt seems to me to be scarcely necessary to refer to the argument addressed to us founded upon the position in which the words\nsubject to a lease of part of the said premises to Thomas Dickson Archibald and Blowers Archibald\nappear in the conveyance of the 26th July,. 1859, from Charles Dickson Archibald to Charles William Archibald, for the language affords really no foundation for the argument; the language is that the lots known as lots nos. 5 and 6 were as to part thereof subject to a lease to Thomas Dickson Archibald and Blowers Archibald. How that lease was executed, whether by deed or by parol, and for what term is not stated; the lease by the indenture of the 20th July, 1859, plainly is not such a lease as is spoken of in this sentence, for that lease does not affect, or purport to affect, any part of the lots nos. 5 and 6, but is expressly confined to a water lot in front of lot no. 6, situate on the south side of the road, which by the evidence is shown to separate the shore lot no. 6 from the water lot in front thereof; in short, it is the water lot as granted by the letters patent of the 27th December, 1847, and includes the so-called ballast heap lot. The evidence also shows that the lots nos. 5 and 6, or so much thereof as was the property of Charles Dickson Archibald, was then in the occupation of Thomas Dickson Archibald and Blowers Archibald, and such occupation may have been by lease, by deed or by parol; or which perhaps is more probable, as the deed was prepared by the grantor himself, and as the deed conveys also\nall those wharf and water lots in front of the said lots 2, 5 and 6, as the same are delineated and described in the grant thereof to the said Charles Dickson Archibald, together with all and singular the stores, warehouses, buildings, &c., to the said water lots belonging.\nThe words \"subject to a lease of part of the said premises,\" should have been (and would have been if the lease had been prepared by a professional man), inserted at the close of this description of the water lots in which case they would accurately apply to the lease of the 20th July, 1859, but placed as they are they plainly cannot, and as the mortgagors' argument can only rest upon the words as they are used, and as so used they do not support their contention, which is that the appellant as deriving title from Charles Dickson Archibald is estopped by this language in the deed from Charles Dickson Archibald to Charles William Archibald from contesting as against these mortgagors that the so-called ballast heap lot is not covered by their mortgage, there is, as I have said, no foundation in my opinion for this contention.\nThe decree, in my opinion, should be foreclosure and sale only of the estate which Charles Dickson Archibald, at the time of the execution of the mortgage of September, 1849, had in the shore lots nos. 5 and 6, and in the brick store which had theretofore belonged to Clarke and Archibald, with all such directions as may be necessary to determine the identity of this building, for the realization only of the sum of $8,000, with interest thereon at 6 per cent per annum from the 5th November, 1885, each party to pay their own costs of this appeal.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Borden, Ritchie, Parker & Chisholm.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Ross, Sedgewick & Mackay.\n[1] 1 Can.

The contract between the parties was made by correspondence, telegrams and letters, and after the wheat was delivered from an elevator into a steamer of the defendant company, and the steamer had sailed, a document called a bill of lading, though not signed by the master or any one for him, was handed by an agent of the company to the elevator company, who were agents of plaintiff under the contract. This bill of lading varied the original agreement for carriage by changing the rate of freight and providing that defendant company should only be liable as carriers over its own line, and for the rest of the transit should be merely forwarders of the wheat. It was afterwards sent to plaintiff who without reading it, attached to it a draft which he had negotiated with a bank.\nAt the trial plaintiff obtained a verdict, which was sustained by the Divisional Court and the court of Appeal.\nOsler Q.C. and Lister Q.C. for the appellants.\nLaidlaw Q.C. and Kappele for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the majority of the court was delivered by:\nKING J.\u2014This is an action to recover damages for the non-delivery of a lot of wheat on a contract of carriage, and the principal questions raised are as to what was the contract, and whether the confusion with inferior wheat which took place was in the course of the carriage. Upon the first of these points, the question was whether there was a through contract from Duluth, in the State of Minnesota, to Montreal or points west, in the option of the shipper, or whether, as contended by the appellant, the contract was merely from Duluth to Sarnia. All the judges before whom the matter has come, with exception of Mr. Justice Burton, are of opinion that there was a through contract.\nIn October, 1891, the plaintiff, a dealer in wheat, residing at Brandon, Manitoba, was sending forward to the Ontario markets for sale a lot of wheat, and it was on its way to Duluth by the Northern Pacific Railroad. From there he proposed sending it by water to Sarnia (or Point Edward, the terminus of the Grand Trunk Railway there) for orders, and began a correspondence with defendants, a Canadian company, with head office at Sarnia, owning a line of freighting steamers running between Duluth and other grain ports on the west shore of Lake Superior, and Sarnia or Point Edward. The parties had had no previous dealings. The correspondence resulted in the shipment of the grain, and the contract is to be found in this correspondence, or in certain shipping papers, or in both together.\nIn Hussey v. Horne Payne[1] it was held that where a court has to find a contract in a correspondence, and not in one particular note or memorandum formally signed, the whole of that which has passed between the parties must be taken into consideration. Accordingly in that case, although the first two letters of a correspondence seemed to constitute a complete contract, it was adjudged that upon the whole of what had passed in letters and conversation no concluded and complete contract had been established. We are therefore to consider everything separately and together and draw a conclusion upon the whole transaction.\nOn 20th October plaintiff telegraphed from Brandon to the agent of the company at Sarnia: Quote freight from eight to ten thousand bushels wheat Duluth to Point Edward for orders. Shipment inside of three weeks.\nSo far this was a bare inquiry for a rate.\nThe defendants, who had an agreement with the Grand Trunk Railway Company relating to through rates, but which, so far as appears, was not known to plaintiff, replied the same day by telegraph:\nCannot quote local rate Sarnia for orders. Rate to Guelph and points west eight cents, east of Guelph to Montreal (not export) nine cents. Reply if accepted.\nThis is something more than an answer to an inquiry. It is a proposal of carriage to which plaintiff\u2019s assent is sought. Freight is the price of, or remuneration for, safe carriage and delivery, and the natural meaning of defendants\u2019 proposition is a proposal of carriage from Duluth to Guelph, and points west of it, for eight cents, and to east of Guelph, as far as Montreal, for nine cents, in the option of the shipper of course.\nTo this plaintiff replied on the same day:\nAccept your offer for freight eight to ten thousand, writing.\nThe letter so referred to is not in evidence, but presumably it merely confirmed the telegram as in ordinary course.\nUpon the next day defendants wrote:\nRe your telegram yesterday regarding a shipment of eight to ten thousand bushels from Duluth within three weeks, I note your acceptance of our rates. We could bring this lot by the SS. U. Empire in Duluth about the 29th or 30th. We would prefer the amount to be ten thousand bushels. Please let us know if you would have it ready so that we can arrange definitely by that steamer * * *\nOn the 23rd they telegraphed:\nEmpire thirtieth might not have room your ten thousand wheat Duluth, would take Monarch about 4th November,\ni.e. would take the wheat by Monarch about date named. To which plaintiff telegraphed on the 26th:\nFourth will suit. (Can you take another eight thousand fifteenth); will make both lots ten if possible.\nOn same day defendants replied by telegraph:\nYour telegram to-day. Will keep space for ten thousand Monarch fourth (and for ten thousand Monarch about 14th. Rates for latter nine cents, Toronto west-east to Montreal ten cents, not export.) Cannot take eight thousand lots, see letter.\nThe letter was as follows:\nReferring to your telegram to-day relative to wheat shipments, would say that we cannot take lots of eight thousand bushels. We must load our steamers, and can only do so by having the holds full. The spaces in Monarch are 10,000, 11,000, 10,000 12,000 and 6,000 bushels * * We will therefore expect you to make the lot via Monarch about 4th, 10,000 bushels. We could take 10,000 bushels in Monarch about 14th November, at nine cents per bushel to Toronto and west, and ten cents east of Toronto to Montreal, not for export. Please say if these will be satisfactory, so that we can book them definitely.\nNo further correspondence took place respecting the first shipment. I draw attention to defendants\u2019 attempted variation of the terms respecting the quantity of the first shipment, merely to say that the circumstance has not been treated by either party as having any bearing upon the questions in this case. In point of fact the shipment approximated closely to ten thousand bushels, falling short of that quantity by only about three hundred bushels.\nFollowing upon this correspondence, the wheat was shipped at Duluth on board the Monarch on the 10th November, through the Lake Superior Elevator Company, who had the storage of it, and a document called a freight contract, signed by Hurdon, the Duluth agent of defendants, was afterwards handed to the elevator company, but the precise time when this was done does not appear. It was, however, dated on the 11th November, and the master states in his evidence that the vessel sailed from Duluth on the 10th November. This docu- ment is in the body of it referred to as a bill of lading, but it is not signed by the master, or by any one as his agent, or on his behalf.\nAnother paper, dated 10th November, was handed by Hurdon to the purser of the ship. This is in form a bill of lading, but differs from the freight contract and is not signed at all.\nDeferring for the present a consideration of these documents, let us consider separately the effect of that which (apart from the bare receipt of the goods) was, at the time of the commencement of the voyage, the only evidence of any agreement for carriage at all.\nUpon the correspondence taken by itself is it doubtful that there was a contract for carriage? Suppose that plaintiff had failed to supply cargo, or that defendants had declined to receive it, is there any doubt that an action would have lain in the one case by the defendants, and in the other by plaintiff? Then, if a contract, is it doubtful that what was contemplated was the carriage (by some carrier at least) to a point to be designated by the shipper, not farther east than Montreal, at a certain single rate? Such contract, as being made in this country, and to be performed upon a British vessel and on Canadian railways, is to be governed by the law of this country, under which a carrier accepting goods directed to a destination beyond its ordinary terminus assumes, in the absence of stipulation to the contrary, an obligation to transport them to the ultimate and designated destination. In point of reason, an executory contract should be interpreted in light of such principle of law. Prim\u00e2 facie all that is to be done on the one side is the consideration for all that is to be done on the other. Here there was an agreement for a single payment of freight covering the whole transit, and no suggestion of an understanding that, as to one part of the journey, there was to be a contract of carriage, and as to the rest of it an agreement to forward by connecting carriers upon contracts of carriage to be entered into with them by defendants as agents for the shipper. Such an agreement is often made, but it requires apt words to raise it.\nIt does not follow from this that, in addition to common law and statutory limitations, such usual exceptions from liability as might amount to usage in the particular trade might not attach to the contract as an implied term, or that it would not be subject to implications arising from a course of business between the parties, if there had been such.\nWe are, however, now to consider as a part of the transaction the so-called freight contract, or bill of lading, given by Hurdon to the Lake Superior Elevator Co.\nThis expressed that the goods had been received on board to be transported by Lake to Sarnia, Ont. (dangers of navigation, fire, explosion and collision excepted) to order Imperial Bank of Canada, Point Edward for orders, and (inter alia) contained the following clauses:\nCancelled by new bill of lading issued for cars as per back.\nRates from Duluth to Toronto and points west nine cents. East Toronto to Montreal, 100 lbs., ten cents per bushel.\nTo be transported by them and forwarding lines with which they connect until the said goods have reached the point named in this bill of lading, (i.e., the point east of Sarnia to which the goods might be ordered.)\n* * * * * * * *\nIt is further stipulated and agreed that in case of any loss, detriment or damage done to or sustained by any of the property herein receipted for during such transportation, whereby any legal liability or responsibility shall or may be incurred, that company alone shall be held answerable therefor in whose actual custody the same may be at the time of the happening of such loss, detriment or damage, and that the carrier so liable shall have the full benefit of any insurance that may have been effected upon or on account of said goods. The contract is executed and accomplished, and the liability of the company, limited as a common carrier thereunder, terminates, on the arrival of the goods or property at the station or depots of delivery (and the companies will be liable as warehousemen only thereafter), and unless removed by the consignee from the station or depots of delivery within twenty-four hours of their said arrival, they may be removed and stored by the company at the owner\u2019s expense and risk.\nNotice.\u2014In accepting this bill of lading the shipper or the agent of the property carried expressly accepts and agrees to all its stipulations, exceptions and conditions.\nUpon this instrument the defendants would be carriers from Duluth to Sarnia, and forwarders beyond, their obligation being to carry to Sarnia and there deliver (if directed) to the connecting carrier upon a contract to be made by them as plaintiff\u2019s agent with such connecting carrier, but involving, beyond Sarnia, no obligation as carriers.\nA bill of lading is ordinarily both a receipt and a contract. In certain cases it operates only as a receipt. Such is the case where there is a charter party. A charter party is a formal instrument containing usual terms of a contract of carriage, and where it exists it is not to be supposed that there is an intention to supersede it by the bill of lading. In some cases both are to be construed together.\nBut, where there is only an informal contract by correspondence, the formal bill of lading, when given, would ordinarily be treated as containing the concluded contract unless an intention to the contrary appears.\nAnd if in the case before us the bill of lading had been regular it would be difficult to resist the conclusion that, upon the whole transaction, the completed and concluded contract was to be looked for in it. But the circumstances of this case interpose a difficulty.\nIn Bostwick v. Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Co.[2] the plaintiff had made a verbal contract to transport cotton by \u2018\u2018all rail\u201d from Cincinnati to New York, at \u201call rail rates.\u201d Under this agreement he delivered the cotton at the company\u2019s depot and its transportation was immediately commenced. One or two days afterwards the company\u2019s agent sent to the plaintiff a bill of lading which, by its terms, reserved to the company the right to forward in part by water. When the cotton reached Baltimore it was shipped on steamer to New York, and a portion was lost on the passage. It was held that:\nAfter the verbal agreement had been consummated and rights had accrued under it, the mere receipt of the bill of lading, inadvertently omitting to examine its printed conditions, was not sufficient to conclude the plaintiff from showing what the actual agreement was under which the goods had been shipped.\nIt is contended that the Lake Superior Elevator Co., being plaintiff\u2019s agent for shipment at Duluth, he was bound by the formal contract, on the terms of which alone the defendants consented to receive the goods. And this might indeed be so if the bill of lading had been a record of such terms; but a so-called bill of lading, or other like instrument, tendered after the vessel has sailed, is not such a record, and the shipping agent\u2019s authority is limited to what is usual, and he has ordinarily no authority to bind his principal by receipt of a bill of lading after the vessel has sailed.\nIt is clear that if, by the tender of a bill of lading before the sailing of the vessel, it appeared that the defendant had refused to carry except upon the terms of it, the plaintiff would be put to other remedies than that resorted to in this action. But in this case there is nothing to show that defendants, prior to the sailing of the vessel, signified any refusal to receive the goods and carry them according to the terms of the prior correspondence.\nNext, as to the action of the plaintiff. It is clear that he expected that a bill of lading would be given, and we find him writing, on the 14th, that it had not been received. It did not reach him until after the vessel reached Sarnia, and he says that when received he simply attached it to a draft negotiated with a bank at Brandon, without reading it. He was not cross-examined as to this, and the fact that the mistake in the terminal points and the higher rate of freight were not noticed appears to corroborate his evidence. It is further to be borne in mind that plaintiff was not aware of the irregularity attending the giving and receiving of the document. When a party to a transaction receives a customary document under circumstances which, by the ordinary usages of business would ordinarily lead him to infer that it forms a record of the contract, he cannot very well, in ordinary circumstances, escape from its binding operation (in the absence of fraud or mistake) merely upon the ground that he did not read it.\nBut the like conclusion does not follow where it is sought to vary terms of a prior mutual assent by a formal document given out of the usual course of business. In such case there is wanting the presumption that usually attends transactions in ordinary course of business, and the party against whom it is set up may prove want of actual assent. The proper conclusion then, upon the whole, is that the wheat was shipped upon the terms agreed upon in the correspondence that had taken place.\nThis conclusion is not affected by what took place respecting the change from Point Edward to Port Huron. The defendants were to carry to Point Edward for orders, and without plaintiff\u2019s consent they could not deviate from the specified route. So far as plaintiff is affected by it was a mere substitution of one point for orders for another, and there was in it no taking delivery by him. Then, as to the action of Plewes & Co. in getting fresh shipping papers from the Grand Trunk Railway Co., the goods being subject to plaintiff\u2019s orders directions for their continued transit were necessary, and upon the theory of a through contract by defendants the Grand Trunk Railway Co. were defendants\u2019 agents for completing the transportation.\nThe action of Plewes was as consistent with a through contract as with that contained in defendants\u2019 freight contract, for under the latter all duty of defendants would not cease with the discharge of the goods at Point Edward, or Port Huron. They would still be bound, as forwarders, to deliver to the next connecting carrier, and to make, on plaintiff\u2019s behalf, a contract of carriage with such carrier. Moore v. Harris[3].\nBut it is by no means clear that defendants are not liable for the mixing of the wheat even upon the contract they rely upon. The goods were to be carried to Point Edward \u201cfor orders.\u201d These words import a further duty on defendants\u2019 part after the arrival at Sarnia, i.e. to hold the goods a reasonable time at Point Edward for orders, and upon receiving such orders to deliver them according to the stipulations of the freight contract to the connecting carrier upon a contract of carriage on plaintiff\u2019s behalf. The course of the grain business is to discharge into elevators in such case. The mere discharge did not necessarily effect delivery. The agreement in evidence between the defendants, the Railway Company and the Elevator Company, seems to treat the latter company as agents for the defendants and the railroad in the handling and storage of wheat in course of transportation by them as connecting lines. There is also evidence that Mr. Beatty, the manager of the defendant company, interfered in the delivery of this cargo of grain. Mr. Johnston, the secretary treasurer of the Elevator Company, says that he was told by Mr. Beatty that if there was a shortage in any lot of wheat the order should be filled out of like grade of wheat from any other lot. This is not denied. As warehousemen defendants would not be responsible for the safety of the wheat, but they would be liable for want of care in delivery.\nNext, as to the place where the mixing took place. It is clearly proved by several witnesses that the Elevator Company, at Port Huron, treated the plaintiff\u2019s wheat and the Crowe wheat as one lot.\nJohnston, the witness already referred to, says that \u201cfor some cause between the purser and my foreman, it was considered as one grade of wheat, and it was so treated,\u201d and we know that the mischief was caused by the mixing of the \u2018\u2018no grade\u201d and \u201crejected\u201d Crowe wheat with the high grade wheat belonging to plaintiff. The attempt to trace the mixing to the delivery from the Lake Superior Elevator Co. at Duluth, while receiving colour from one of the accounts in evidence, afforded at best a very partial and inadequate explanation of the proved facts and was rightly deemed to have failed by the learned judges who have very fully and conclusively dealt with the case.\nIt was further argued, as affecting the amount of the damages, that the wheat was not, in point of fact, Manitoba no. 2 hard.\nBut, apart entirely from the evidence as to Mr. Goldie\u2019s contract for a lot of this wheat, and assuming that he might have rejected it even in its original condition as not within his contract, there is evidence that a car load that had not appreciably suffered by the admixture of the Crowe wheat was sold to the Tavistock Milling Company at the like price of $1.03 and was accepted by them without objection. This corroborates the testimony of the government inspector and others that upon the market it was equal to no. 2 hard by reason of the bulk of it being such, and of the quantity of no. 3 hard in it being off-set by the presence of a quantity of no. 1 hard.\nThe result is that the appeal should be dismissed.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014I dissent. I would allow this appeal upon the grounds taken by Mr. Justice Burton in the Court of Appeal. There was no through contract between these parties. A mere quotation of rates cannot constitute one, and whatever mixing of this wheat happened took place when it was not under the appellant\u2019s control.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Lister, Cowan & Mackenzie.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Laidlaw, Kappele & Bicknell.\n[1] 4 App. Cas. 311.\n[2] 45 N.Y. 712.\n[3] 45 L.J.P.C. 55.\n"}

The Queen Insurance Co. (3 App. Cas 1090), distinguished.\nAPPEAL from the decision of the Superior Court sitting in review at Montreal ([1]), affirming the judgment in the Superior Court ([2]), which condemned the defendant to pay the amount of the license fee imposed on manufacturers and traders under the statutes 55 & 56 Vic. c. 10 amended by 56 Vic. c. 15.\nThe action was brought by the plaintiff as collector of provincial revenue for the district of Montreal, to recover the license fee or tax imposed by the statutes upon the defendant as a merchant carrying on business by wholesale and retail within the limits of the city of Montreal. Defendant resisted the recovery on the grounds 1. That the acts were ultra vires, being a regulation of trade and commerce; 2. That the license fee or tax imposed was an indirect tax; and 3. That admitting the tax to be within the competence of the provincial legislature, it had not been levied or apportioned in a legal or constitutional manner.\nThe preamble of the Act recites the extent of the funded and floating debt of the province and of the estimated expenditure and the insufficiency of the present revenue to meet the increased expenditure and additional burdens put on the province, and the expediency and necessity of levying new taxes to meet such debts and obligations, and the statute then proceeds to impose the taxes. The tax now specially questioned is the double license fee provided by section 826c which enacts that every trader doing business in Montreal by wholesale or by wholesale and retail, shall, if his stock in trade exceeds in value $500, be obliged to take out in each year a license from the collector of provincial revenue, for which he shall pay $100; and section 826c which provides that in certain cases double license fees shall become due and be exacted and the person in default shall, in addition to any other recourse against him, be liable to a penalty of $100, and in default of payment to imprisonment for one month. Among the cases specified is that of any person or firm bound to take out a license failing to do so or carrying on trade or business, or selling by wholesale or retail, any goods, wares or merchandise of any kind without having a license.\nThe defendant admitted that he was a person of the class specified, and based his defence entirely upon the constitutional objections taken. Geoffrion, Q.C. and Leet for appellant. The tax is unconstitutional because:\n1. It is an indirect tax. 2. It is a regulation of trade and commerce. 3. It affects to license and control subjects outside the category of licenses a province may issue. 4 If, in its incidence, it is direct it has not been legally apportioned.\nThe legislature intended to make the carrying on of business impossible without a license, to pass a license Act governed by principles and rules of law relating to license Acts and license fees, and coming within subsec. 9, of sec. 92 of the British North America Act, and the courts must interpret the Act according to such intention.\nThe levy is not \"taxation\" within the legal meaning of the term and within the meaning of the term as used in the British North America Act and the legislature, in endeavouring to levy a license fee, violated an imperative principle necessary to direct taxation under subsec. 2. Severn v. The Queen ([3]); Cooley on Taxation ([4]); Blackwell on Tax Titles ([5]).\nA levy, in order to meet the requirements of taxation, must be apportioned over the whole taxing district at a uniform rate. Cooley on Taxation ([6]). See Jonas v. Gilbert ([7]), remarks by Ritchie C.J. at p. 365.\nThe essential elements necessary to distinguish this impost from arbitrary levies are wanting. The remarks of the judges below would indicate that the power for such a levy lies not so much in the fact that it conforms to the legal definition of a tax as because of the sovereign power of the legislature. The powers of the Imperial Parliament are not restricted by a written constitution imposed by a superior power, and consequently Mr. Justice Jett\u00e9's quotations as to absolute sovereignty cannot apply. The only English authority really applicable are the remarks of Sir Barnes Peacock in Hodge v. The Queen ([8]).\nThe legislature can simply levy a tax. It cannot confiscate. It cannot arbitrarily select one city or one municipality and collect from it the whole revenue of the province, nor can it levy from the inhabitants of one municipality at a diff\u00e8rent rate from another. It cannot select a few individuals to bear the tax.\nThe principle that the legislature cannot discriminate is laid down in Attorney General v. Toronto ([9]).\nWhile the rate of apportionment is entirely within the discretion of the legislature, yet if the rate is not uniform and equal but the reverse the courts should interfere to prevent the violation of the necessary principle of equality, making it not a tax but an arbitrary levy. Blackwell on Tax Titles ([10]); Cooley on Taxation ([11]).\nCasgrain Q.C. Attorney General of Quebec and Martin for the respondent.\nThe tax is of the same nature as that imposed by 45 Vic. ch. 22 (Q), on commercial corporations, which was held to be within the authority of the local legislature. Lambe v. Bank of Toronto ([12]).\nThe tax in question is a direct tax. Burroughs on Taxation, 146; Jevons Pol. Economy (1878) p. 127; Say, Economie Politique; Merlin ([13]). Lord Selborne laid down the same doctrine in Attorney General v. Reed ([14]).\nAs to the opinion expressed in Severn v. The Queen ([15]), that a brewer's license fee under 37 Vic. c. 22 (O.), was an indirect tax see the remarks in their Lordships' judgment in the Privy Council in the case of the commercial corporations ([16]). The present acts are not prohibitive in their effect.\nThe true character of the tax is not to be determined. by the use of the word \"license.\" The Quebec Legislature made use of the same word in the Act 39 Vic, c. 7, \u201cAn Act to compel assurers to take out a license,\" but in Attorney General v. The Queen Insurance Com-party ([17]), the Privy Council refused to regard it as a license act or the price payable as the price of a license but took it to be a mere stamp act and the price payable as the price of a stamp, and that this was indirect taxation and ultra vires. Looking at the act in question and the true character of the so-called licenses we submit that the Quebec Legislature imposed here a direct tax just as 45 Vic. c. 22 imposed a direct tax upon commercial corporations.\nAs to interference with the regulation of trade and commerce the remarks of their Lordships in Bank of Toronto v. Lambe (1) show that contention to have been too wide when urged by the banks and commercial corporations. It must necessarily follow that the contention has no more force in this case than it had in the cases just referred to.\nAs to the application of principles laid down by decisions under the constitution of the \"United States of America, the Privy Council expressed the opinion in The Bank of Toronto v. Lambe (1), that it is quite impossible to argue from the one case to the other.\nIt was said that the legislature might crush a bank out of existence and so nullify the power to erect banks, and it is now suggested that the power to regulate trade and commerce may be nullified by crushing traders out of existence under heavy taxation. The Judicial Committee said as to that ([18]):\n\u201cWhen the Imperial Parliament conferred wide powers of local self-government on great colonies, such, as Quebec it did not intend to limit them on the speculation that they would be used in an injurious manner. They were trusted with the great power of making laws for property and civil rights, and may well be trusted to low taxes\"\nIt is said that even supposing the tax is not illegal on other grounds it has not been equally or fairly apportioned over the territory taxed.\nUnder our system Parliament has absolute sovereignty, and its acts are not subject to be questioned by the courts when within the competence of the legislature. See Cooley on Taxation ([19]); Potter's Dwarris on Statutes ([20]); Sedgewick on Statutory & Commercial Law 182; Hodge v. The Queen ([21]).\nIn the commercial corporations cases it was urged that the tax imposed upon them was unjust and inequitable hut the courts refused to take this-ground into consideration at all. Bank of Toronto & Lambe (1).\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014This judgment is in my opinion free from error. If I was at liberty to do so, I might hold according to the opinion I expressed in Seven v. The Queen ([22]), that a license of this kind came within the words \"other licenses\" in subsec. 9, sec. 92 British North America Act, but I am precluded from doing this by the judgment of this court in that case. I am, however, of opinion that this is the case of a direct tax and is governed by the decision of the Privy Council in the Bank of Toronto v. Lambe ([23]) and that it is not an indirect tax within Attorney General v. Queen insurance Go. ([24]). I quite agree with the courts below in the definition which they give of a direct tax. In order that a tax may be indirect it must appear clearly that it was one not to be ultimately borne by the person by whom it is to be paid in the first instance. I cannot say that a tax upon a man's business is one which must necessarily be borne by the persons who make purchases from him.\nThis distinction between a direct and an indirect tax depending on the incidence of the tax is well pointed out by Professor Sidgwick in his work on Political Economy ([25]), where he says :\nWe have now to note a new element of imperfection and uncertainty in the equalization of taxation due to the fact that we can only partially succeed in making the burden of either direct or indirect taxes fall where we desire; the burden is liable to be transferred to other persons when it is intended to remain where it is first imposed, and on the other hand when it is intended to be transferred the process of transference is liable to be tardy and incomplete. Indeed this process is often so complicated and obscure that it is a problem of considerable intricacy and difficulty to ascertain where the burden of a tax actually rests; and it is not even a simple matter to state accurately the general principle for determining the incidence of a tax supposing all the facts to be known.\nAnd in a note he adds:\nThe common classification of taxes as direct and indirect appears to me liable to mislead the student by ignoring the complexity and difficulty of the problem of determining the incidence of taxation.\nIf this tax was imposed without the device of a license it would be precisely identical with that in question in The Bank of Toronto v. Lambe (1) and I cannot see that the circumstance that the persons affected by the tax are, for convenience of the government in collecting it, required to take out a license can make any difference. It is a direct tax to all intents and purposes, and within the powers expressly conferred upon the legislature.\nThe objection of want of uniformity which was so strongly pressed is no legal objection. Granting that the legislatures have the power of imposing such taxes it is for them to say how it is to be distributed.\nWe have not in the British North America Act any such provision as that contained in the constitution of the United States, which requires that all taxes, excises and imposts shall be uniform throughout the United States ([26]).\nThe cases cited in support of this contention were principally American authorities which had reference to this express constitutional provision requiring uniformity.\nThe appeal must be dismissed with costs.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014The contention of the appellant based on the ground that this tax has not been legally apportioned, and is null for want of uniformity and equality, is, in my opinion, untenable. Whatever political economists and other writers may say on this-subject I know of no law in the Dominion that in any way puss any restriction, limitation or regulation of that kind on the powers of the federal or provincial authorities in relation to taxation within their respective spheres.\nIn the United States a provision on the subject is to be found in the federal constitution but there is no similar enactment in the British North America Act.\nThe appellant's other contention that this tax involves a regulation of trade and commerce, and is- therefore ultra vires is also untenable. A similar point was urged in Citizens Ins. Co. v. Parsons ([27]) and in Bank of Toronto v. Lambe ([28]), and declared unfounded. The reasoning of their Lordships of the Privy Council upon that point in those cases applies here. In fact, if this is a direct tax, cadit questio, this statute is intra vires; the fact that it might involve in a certain degree a regulation of trade and commerce cannot deprive the provincial legislature of the right to raise a revenue by means of direct taxation, or impair such right in any way.\nThe cases of Almy v. The State of California ([29]); Lin Sing v. Washburn ([30]); Brown v. Maryland ([31]); and Leloup v. The Port of Mobile ([32]) cited by the appellant, do not support his contention. He here again seems not to have given sufficient attention to the differences between the British North America Act and the United States constitution on the subject. Is this a direct tax? is therefore the first question that presents itself in this case, and if the question is answered affirmatively there is an end of the appellant's case.\nThe cases of Reg. v. Taylor ([33]); Severn v. The Queen ([34]); Attorney General v. The Queen Ins. Co. ([35]); Attorney General v. Reed ([36]); Bank of Toronto v. Lambe (2) though not directly in point, contain all that can be said, and almost all the authorities and writers that can be cited, on this question. It would be, however, useless for me, in the view I take of the present case, and fettered by authority as I deem myself to be, to enter into a renewed consideration of the different aspects of the question in relation to the British North America Act. I mean, of course, as a question of law, not as one of statesmanship or political economy. Assuming that licenses, generally speaking, constitute indirect taxation, a proposition that in law I would now very much doubt as applicable to the British North America Act, I hold that though the Quebec legislature has resorted to a system of licenses as a means to raise the tax in question yet this statute is not to be taken as a license Act.\nIt is evident, by its terms, that it contains no prohibition whatever as to manufacture or trade. Therefore no license, no permit (lices licere) is necessary in the province as a condition precedent to legally manufacture or legally trade and all contracts entered into by the manufacturer or trader in the course of his business are perfectly lawful and enforceable at law ([37]). The Liquor License Acts, on the contrary, as did also the Act under consideration in Severn v. The Queen ([38]) absolutely prohibit the selling of any liquor without having first obtained a license to do so Under that class of statutes every time a sale without license is made the penalty is incurred; each sale is a distinct offence, and is altogether unlawful. Under the statute now under consideration the double license fee is exigible only once a year, and the sale or manufacture without a license is not unlawful in the sense that a sale of liquor without a license is under a prohibitory law. This is it seems to me as direct a tax as the tax under consideration in the Bank of Toronto case which by the Privy Council has been declared to constitute direct taxation In fact it is nothing else but an extension to private individuals of that statute which applied only to corporations. Now, if this tax was a direct one when imposed upon commercial corporations, is it the less direct when imposed upon private individuals? And can the form of collecting the tax alter its nature? We have the high authority of the Privy Council in Attorney General v. Tue Queen Insurance Co. ([39]) for the proposition that it does not. And in the same sense Mr. Justice Clifford, delivering the judgment of the United States Supreme Court in Scholey v. Rew ([40]), in answering negatively the argument, that the tax in question in that case was a tax on land because the act creating it made it a lien on the land, said : \" Nor is the tax in question affected in the least by the fact that the tax or duty is made a lien upon the land, as the lien is merely an appropriate regulation to secure the collection of the exaction.\"\nIn my opinion the license in question here is likewise merely an appropriate regulation to secure the collection of a direct tax.\nI would dismiss the appeal. If the question was res integra I would be inclined to think that the words \" direct taxation \" in subsec. 2 of sec. 92 of the British North America Act were not intended to give to the provinces the very large powers of taxation that are claimed by the respondent here, and which the judgments of the courts below concede them, either directly or inferentially. However, in view of the decision of the Privy Council, I have to refrain from giving my own opinion on the question submitted.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014It is sufficient, in my opinion, in this case to say that the Act of the Province of Quebec, 55 & 56 Vic. ch. 10 as an Act for the purpose of imposing d direct taxation within the province for provincial purposes \" is upon the authority of the judgments of their Lordships of the Privy Council in Bank of Toronto v. Lambe ([41]), intra vires of the provincial legislature. Upon this ground I think the Act is maintainable, and that the appeal should. therefore be dismissed with costs. As to the contention of the appellant on the one side that the Act was ultra vires of any jurisdiction conferred by item 9 of sec. 92, and that of the respondent on the other hand that the Act was intra vires of that item and that the authority of Severn v. The Queen ([42]), was so shaken by the judgment of this court in Moison v. Lambe ([43]) that it should no longer be followed, I decline to express any opinion, for the reason already given, as to whether this case is or is not governed by Severn v. The Queen, (1) or whether that case was well or ill decided. It certainly has not been judicially overruled, and until it shall be it is, I presume, binding upon this court, and it is not necessary for the decision of the present case to brino* it within Severn v. The Queen (1) and as to its-being shaken by Molson v. Lambe (2), a perusal of the report of that case will show that the only question raised and submitted to the court in that case was as to the right of a party to proceedings in an inferior jurisdiction, by the law of the province of Quebec to prohibit the judge of the inferior jurisdiction from proceeding to judgment upon issues joined in the matter before him; and the judgment of the court was that as the matter in which the issues were joined was within the jurisdiction of the Superior Court proceedings in prohibition could not be instituted according to the law of the province of Quebec to prevent the judge proceeding to judgment in the case, and that if he should render an erroneous judgment in the matter it could be reviewed upon a certiorari.\nSEDGEWICK and KING JJ. concurred.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant : Maclaren, Leet & Smith.\nSolicitors for the respondent : Beaudin & Foster.\n[1] Q.R. 5 S.C. 355.\n[2] Q.R. 5 S.C. 47.\n[3] 2 Can.

Act s. 109.\nIn 1850 the late province of Canada entered into treaties with the Indians of the Lake Superior and Lake Huron districts, by which the Indian lands were surrendered to the Government of the province in consideration of a certain sum paid down and an annuity to the tribes, with a provision that \"should all the territory thereby ceded by the Indians at any future period produce such an amount as will enable the government of this province, without incurring loss, to increase the annuity hereby secured to them, then, and in that case, the same shall be augmented from time to time.\"\nBy the B.N.A. Act the Dominion of Canada assumed the debts and liabilities of the province of Canada, and sec. 109 of that Act provided that all lands, &c., belonged to the several provinces in which the same were situate \"subject to any trust existing in respect thereof, and to any interest other than that of the province in the same.\"\nThe lands so surrendered are situate in the province of Ontario and have for some years produced an amount sufficient for the payment of an increased annuity to the Indians. The Dominion Government has paid the annuities since 1867 (from 1874 at the increased amount) and claims to be reimbursed therefor.\nHeld, reversing the said award, Gwynne and King JJ. dissenting, that the provision in the treaties as to increased annuities had not the effect of burdening the lands with a \"trust in respect thereof\" or \"an interest other than that of the province in the same,\" within the meaning of said sec. 109, and therefore Ontario held the lands free from any trust or interest, and was not solely liable for repayment to the Dominion of the increased annuities, but only liable jointly with Quebec as representing the province of Canada.\nAppeal from an award of the arbitrators appointed to adjust the accounts between the Dominion of Canada and the provinces of Ontario and Quebec respectively.\nThe circumstances under which this appeal came before the court were the following:\nPrior to and in the year 1850 the Ojibeway Indians inhabited large tracts of land on the eastern and northern shores of Lake Huron, and on the northern shore of Lake Superior, which tracts of land were at that time within the boundaries of the then province of Canada, but since the year 1867 are within the province of Ontario. At the date first above mentioned, 1850, the administration of Indian affairs within the province of Canada was in the hands of Her Majesty the Queen, and the management of the business with the said Indians was conducted by officers and agents appointed by the Government of Great Britain.\nIn the said year 1850 the Honourable William Benjamin Robinson was duly authorized by Her Majesty, represented by the Government of the province of Canada, to negotiate and enter into agreements with the above named Indians for the extinguishment of their title to, and to obtain cessions of, portions of the tracts of land occupied and inhabited by them, for the purpose of opening up the said lands for settlement, and developing the mineral resources of the same, and on the 9th day of September. 1850, an agreement was entered into between the said Hon. W. B. Robinson on behalf of the Queen and the Ojibeway Indians of the Lake Huron district, which agreement is in the words and figures following: \"This agreement made and entered into this ninth day of September, in the year of Our Lord one thousand eight hundred and fifty, at Sault Ste. Marie, in the province of Canada, between the Honourable William Benjamin Robinson of the one part, on behalf of Her Majesty the Queen, and (naming them) principal men of the Ojibeway Indians, inhabiting and claiming the eastern and northern shores of lake Huron, from Penetan-guishene to Sault Ste. Marie, and thence to Batchewanaung Bay, on the northern shore of Lake Superior, together with the islands in the said lakes opposite to the shores thereof, and inland to the height of land which separates the territory covered by the charter of the Honourable Hudson Bay Company from Canada; as well as all unconceded lands within the limits of Canada west to which they have any just claim on the other part, witnesseth:\"\n\"That for and in consideration of the sum of two thousand pounds of good and lawful money of Upper Canada, to them in hand paid, and for the further perpetual annuity of six hundred pounds of like money, the same to be paid and delivered to the said chiefs and their tribes at a convenient season of each year, of which due notice will be given at such places as may be appointed for that purpose, they, the said chiefs and principal men, on behalf of their respective tribes or bands, do hereby fully, freely and voluntarily surrender, cede, grant and convey unto Her Majesty, her heirs and successors forever, all their right, title and interest to and in the whole of the territory above described, save and except the reservations set forth in the schedule hereunto annexed, which reservations shall be held and occupied by the said chiefs and their tribes in common, for their own use and benefit; and should the said chiefs and their respective tribes at any time desire to dispose of any part of such reservations, or of any mineral or other valuable productions thereon, the same will be sold or leased at their request by the Superintendent-General of Indian Affairs for the time being, or other officer having authority so to do, for their sole interest and to the best advantage; and the said William Benjamin Robinson of the first part, on behalf of Her Majesty and the Government of this province, hereby promises and agrees to make, or cause to be made, the payments as above mentioned; and further to allow the said chiefs and their tribes the full and free privilege to hunt over the territory now ceded by them, and to fish in the waters thereof, as they nave hitherto been in the habit of doing, saving and excepting such portions of the said territory as may from time to time be sold or leased to individuals, or companies of individuals, and occupied by them with the consent of the provincial Government.\"\n\"The parties of the second part further promise and agree that they will not sell, lease or otherwise dispose of any portion of their reservations without the consent of the Superintendent-General of Indian Affairs, or other officer of like authority, being first had and obtained. Nor will they at any time hinder or prevent persons from exploring or searching for minerals or other valuable productions in any part of the territory hereby ceded to Her Majesty as before mentioned. The parties of the second part also agree, that in case the government of this province should before the date of this agreement have sold, or bargained to sell, any mining locations or other property on the portions of the territory hereby reserved for their use, then and in that case such sale, or promise of sale, shall be perfected by the government if the parties claiming it shall have fulfilled all the conditions upon which such locations were made, and the amount accruing therefrom shall be paid to the tribe to whom the reservation belongs.\" \"The said William Benjamin Robinson on behalf of Her Majesty, who desires to deal liberally and justly with all her subjects, further promises and agrees that should the territory hereby ceded by the parties of the second part at any future period produce such an amount as will enable the government of this province, without incurring loss, to increase the annuity hereby secured to them, then, and in that case, the same shall be augmented from time to time, provided that the amount paid to each individual shall not exceed the sum of one pound provincial currency in any one year, or such further sum as Her Majesty may be graciously pleased to order; and provided further, that the number of Indians entitled to the benefit of this treaty shall amount to two-thirds of their present numbers (which is twelve hundred and forty) to entitle them to claim the full benefit thereof, and should their numbers at any future period not amount to two-thirds of twelve hundred and forty the annuity shall be diminished in proportion to their actual numbers.\"\nA similar treaty was entered into with the Lake Superior Indians in which the annuity to be paid was \u00a3600 and the number in the tribe was stated to be fourteen hundred and twenty-two.\nOn the union of the provinces in 1867 the Dominion became liable for the debts of the several provinces as provided in sections 111, 112 and 142 of the British North America Act, which are as follows:\n\"111. Canada shall be liable for the debts and liabilities of each province existing at the union.\n\"112. Ontario and Quebec conjointly shall be liable to Canada for the amount (if any) by which the debt of the province of Canada exceeds at the union sixty-two million five hundred thousand dollars, and shall be charged with interest at the rate of five per centum per annum thereon.\" \"142. The division and adjustment of the debts, credits, liabilities, properties and assets of Upper Canada and Lower Canada shall be referred to the arbitrament of three arbitrators, one chosen by the government of Ontario, one by the government of Quebec, and one by the government of Canada; and the selection of the arbitrators shall not be made until the parliament of Canada and the legislatures of Ontario and Quebec have met; and the arbitrator chosen by the government of Canada shall not be a resident either in Ontario or in Quebec.\"\nIn accordance with the last named section arbitrators were chosen, and on the third day of September, 1870, two of them, namely, Hon. John Hamilton Gray and Hon. D. L. MacPherson, gave their award, paragraphs 1 and 13 of which are as follows:\n\"I. That the amount by which the debt of the late province of Canada exceeded on the thirtieth day of June, one thousand eight hundred and sixty-seven, sixty-two millions five hundred thousand dollars, shall be and is hereby divided between and apportioned to, and shall be borne by, the said provinces of Ontario and Quebec respectively, in the following proportions, that is to say\u2014the said province of Ontario shall assume and pay such a proportion of the said amount as the sum of nine millions eight hundred and eight thousand seven hundred and twenty-eight dollars and two cents bears to the sum of eighteen millions five hundred and eighty-seven thousand five hundred and twenty dollars and fifty-seven cents; and the said province of Quebec shall assume and pay such a proportion of the said amount as the sum of eight millions seven hundred and seventy-eight thousand and seven hundred and ninety-two dollars and fifty-five cents bears to the sum of eighteen millions five hundred and eighty-seven thousand five hundred and twenty dollars and fifty-seven cents.\"\n\"XIII. That all the lands in either of the said provinces of Ontario and Quebec respectively, surrendered by the Indians in consideration of annuities to them granted, which said annuities are included in the debt of the late province of Canada, shall be the absolute property of the province in which the said lands are respectively situate, free from any further claim upon, or charge to the said province in which they are so situate by the other of the said provinces.\"\nIn 1891 the Parliament of Canada passed the Act 5 & 55 Vic. ch. 6, which contained the following provisions:\n\"An Act respecting the settlement of accounts between the Dominion of Canada and the provinces of Ontario and Quebec, and between the said provinces.\"\n[Assented to July 10th, 1891.]\n\"Whereas certain accounts have arisen or may hereafter arise in the settlement of the accounts between the Dominion of Canada and the Provinces of Ontario and Quebec both jointly and severally, and between the two provinces, concerning which no agreement has hitherto been arrived at; and whereas it is advisable that all such questions of account should be eferred to arbitration: Therefore Her Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate and House of Commons of Canada, enacts as follows:\"\n\"1. For the final and conclusive determination of such accounts, the Governor General in Council may unite with the Governments of the Provinces of Ontario and Quebec in the appointment of three arbitrators, to whom shall be referred such questions as the Governor General and the Lieutenant-Governors of the said provinces shall agree to submit.\" \"2. The arbitrators shall consist of three judges, one to be appointed by the Governor General in Council and one by each of the said Provincial Governments, and all three shall be approved of by each Government.\"\n\"3. The arbitrators shall not assume to decide any disputed constitutional question, but if any are raised they will note and report them with their award but without delaying the proceedings.\"\n\"4. Any two of the arbitrators shall have power to make an award.\"\n\"5. The arbitrators, or any two of them, shall have power to make one or more awards, and to do so from time to time.\"\n\"6. The arbitrators shall not be bound to decide according to the strict rules of law or evidence, but may decide upon equitable principles, and when they do proceed on their view of a disputed question of law the award shall set forth the same at the instance of either or any party. Any award made under this Act shall be, in so far as it relates to disputed questions of law, subject to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada and thence to the Judicial Committee of Her Majesty's Privy Council, in case their Lordships are pleased to allow such appeal.\"\n\"7. In case of an appeal on a question of law being-successful the matter shall go back to the arbitrators for the purpose of making such changes in the award as may be necessary or an appellate court shall make any other direction as to the necessary changes.\"\n\"8. The appointment of the said arbitrators by Order in Council and their award in writing shall be binding on Canada, save in case of appeal on questions of law, in which case the final decision thereon shall be binding on Canada.\"\n\"9. In case of a vacancy by death or otherwise among the arbitrators, the same shall be filled in the same manner as the appointment was first made, any such appointment to be approved of by the other two Governments.\"\nIn the same year the legislature of Ontario passed an Act 54 Vic. ch. 2, and the legislature of Quebec passed 54 Vic. ch. 4, each of which was identical in terms with the above Dominion statute.\nIn accordance with the provisions of the said statutes the Hon. John A. Boyd, Chancellor of Ontario; the Hon. Sir Louis Napoleon Casault, Chief Justice of the Superior Court of Quebec; and the Hon. George W. Burbidge, Judge of the Exchequer Court of Canada, were appointed arbitrators and the counsel for the three governments entered into an agreement of submission which provided that certain matters should be referred to said arbitrators including:\n\"1. All questions relating to or incident to the accounts between the Dominion and the Provinces of Ontario and Quebec, and to accounts between the two Provinces of Ontario and Quebec.\"\n\"2. The accounts are understood to include the following particulars\":\n\"(d) The claims made by the Dominion Government on behalf of Indians, and payments made by the Government to Indians, to form part of the reference.\"\n\"(e) The arbitrators to apportion the liability of Ontario and Quebec as to any claim allowed the Dominion Government, and to apportion between Ontario and Quebec any amount found to be payable by the said Government.\"\nThe arbitrators made and published an award in respect of the claim of the Dominion for re-payment of the sums paid to the Indians under the above mentioned treaties, which award with the reasons given by the several arbitrators for the conclusion reached therein is as follows: \"AWARD ON INDIAN ROBINSON TREATIES, HURON AND SUPERIOR.\n13th February, 1895.\n\"To all to whom these presents shall come:\n\"The Honourable John Alexander Boyd, of the city of Toronto, and province of Ontario, Chancellor of the said province; the Honourable Sir Louis Napoleon Casault, of the city of Quebec, in the province of Quebec, Chief Justice of the Superior Court of the said' province of Quebec; and the Honourable George Wheelock Burbidge, of the city of Ottawa, in the said province (of Ontario), Judge of the Exchequer Court of Canada,\u2014Send greeting.\"\n\"Whereas it was in and by the Act of the Parliament of Canada, 54 & 55 Victoria, chapter 6, and in and by an Act of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario, 54 Victoria, chapter 2, and in and by an Act of the Legislature of Quebec, 54 Victoria, chapter 4, among other things provided that for the final and conclusive determination of certain questions and accounts which had arisen or which might arise in the settlement of accounts between the Dominion of Canada and the provinces of Ontario and Quebec, both jointly and severally, and between the two provinces, concerning which no agreement had theretofore been arrived at, the Governor General in Council might unite with the Governments of the provinces of Ontario and Quebec in the appointment of three arbitrators, being judges, to whom should be referred such questions as the Governor General and Lieutenant-Governors of the provinces should agree to submit;\"\n\"And whereas we, the undersigned John Alexander Boyd, Sir Louis Napoleon Casault, and George Wheelock Burbidge, have been duly appointed under the said Acts and have taken upon ourselves the burdens thereof;\" \"And whereas it was provided in and by the said Acts that such arbitrators, or any two of them, should have power to make one or more awards, and to do so from time to time;\"\n\"And whereas certain questions respecting a claim made by the Dominion of Canada against the provinces of Ontario and Quebec in respect of Indian claims arising out of the Robinson treaties, and respecting a certain other claim made by the Dominion of Canada against the province of Ontario for certain immigration expenditure, and a certain other claim made by the province of Ontario against the Dominion of Canada in the first instance, and by notice to the province of Quebec against that province, for the recovery of a balance of the Upper Canada Municipalities' Fund, have been submitted to such arbitrators, and they have heard the parties thereto;\"\n\"Now, therefore, the said arbitrators exercising their authority to make a separate award at this time respecting the said matters, do award, order and adjudge in and upon the premises as follows, that is to say:\"\n\"I. In respect of the claim made by the Dominion of Canada against the provinces of Ontario and Quebec in reference to the Indian claims arising under the Robinson treaties:\"\n\"1. That if in any year since the treaties in question were entered into the territory thereby ceded produced an amount which would have enabled the government, without incurring loss, to pay the increased annuities thereby secured to the Indian tribes mentioned therein, then such tribes were entitled to such increase not exceeding $4 for each individual.\"\n\"2. That the total amount of annuities to be paid under each treaty is, in such case, to be ascertained by reference to the number of Indians from time to time belonging to the tribes entitled to the benefit of the treaties. That is, that in case of an increase in the number of Indians beyond the numbers named in such treaties, the annuities, if the revenues derived from the ceded territory permitted, without incurring loss, were to be equal to a sum that would provide $4 for each Indian of the tribes entitled.\"\n\"3 That any excess of revenue in any given year may not be used to give the increased annuity in a former year in which an increased annuity could not have been paid without loss, but that any such excess or balance of revenue over expenditure in hand at the commencement of any given year should be carried forward into the account of that year.\"\n\"4. That any liability to pay the increased annuity in any year before the union was a debt or liability which devolved upon Canada under the 111th section of the British North America Act, 1867, and that this is one of the matters to be taken into account in ascertaining the excess of debt for which Ontario and Quebec are conjointly liable to Canada under the 112th section of the Act; and that Ontario and Quebec have not, in respect of any such liability, been discharged by reason of the capitalization of the fixed annuities, or because of anything in the Act of 1873, 36 Vic. c. 30.\"\n\"5. That interest is not recoverable upon any arrears of such annuities.\"\n\"6. That the ceded territory mentioned became the property of Ontario under the 109th section of The British North America Act, 1867, subject to a trust to pay the increased annuities on the happening, after the union, of the event on which such payment depended, and to the interest of the Indians therein to be so paid. That the ultimate burden of making provision for the payment of the increased annuities in question in such an event falls upon the province of Ontario; and that this burden has not been in any way affected or discharged.\"\n\"7. That interest is not recoverable on the arrears of such annuities accruing after the union, and not paid by the Dominion to the tribes of Indians entitled.\"\n\"8. That in respect to the matters hereinbefore dealt with the arbitrators have proceeded upon their view of disputed questions of law.\"\n\"9. That as respects the increased annuities which have been paid by the Dominion to the Indians since the union, any payments properly made are to be charged against the province of Ontario in the province of Ontario account as of the date of payment by the Dominion to the Indians, and so fall within and be affected by our previous ruling as to interest on that account.\"\n\"That Mr. Chancellor Boyd dissents from so much of the proposition contained in this paragraph as relates to the date at which such payment should be charged.\"\n\"II. With respect to the claim made by the Dominion of Canada against the province of Ontario for certain immigration expenditure:\"\n\"1. That the Government of Canada recover against the province of Ontario the amount claimed for the year 1878, but that in reference to the claim made in respect of the years 1879 and 1880 the province of Ontario be discharged, and that this award is without prejudice to any question as to whether or not the province has paid more than was actually due in any year.\"\n\"III. With respect to the claim made by the province of Ontario against the Dominion of Canada, and by notice against the province of Quebec, for the recovery of a balance on the Upper Canada Municipalities' Fund:\" \"1. That the province do recover against the Dominion $15,732.76, parcel of the sum of $21,488.74 claimed, which said sum of $15,732.76 is to be credited to the province of Ontario in the province of Ontario account as of the date of the 1st of July, 1872; and, that as to the balance of the said claim, amounting to $5,755.98, the Dominion be discharged, and that the province of Quebec be discharged in respect of the whole claim.\"\n\"In witness whereof we, the said John Alexander Boyd, Sir Louis Napoleon Casault and George Wheelock Burbidge, have hereunto set our hands and seals this thirteenth day of February, A.D. 1895.\"\nJ.

A. Boyd,\nL. N. Casault,\nGeo. W. Burbidge.\n\"Dated at Quebec,\nthis 26th day of March, 1895.\"\nThe Honourable Mr. Chancellor Boyd's Reasons for Award of February 13th, 1895, Delivered 14th February, 1895.\n\"I. This broad question as to the obligation of Ontario with respect to the Indians of the \"Robinson treaties\" may fairly and properly be dealt with as if the provisions of the Treaty and the sections of The British North America Act relating to lands were placed in juxtaposition.\n\"Then arises the inquiry: Does any interest in respect of these Indians attach to the lands belonging to Ontario under the 109th section of British North America Act?\"\n\"The course of construction applicable both to constitutional Act and Indian treaty is not that a literal and strict meaning be given to the words, but that they shall be construed liberally and comprehensively so as to further the reasonable scope of the provisions. This benignant construction obtains with added force in the construction of a treaty wherein the rules of international rather than of municipal law are to be regarded.\" \"Now in these transactions with the aborigines from the earliest colonial times in North America the Government has assumed the status of the Indian tribes to be that of distinct political communities. When the dealing has been by the Crown for the cession of territory over which some legal possessory right by the tribes in actual occupation has always been recognized, then the form of the transactions has been that of a treaty. Superadded to this, it is to be taken into account that the Indians relatively to the whites are in a state of dependency or pupilage, and that the nearest legal analogy as to the relationship between their tribes and the Government is that of guardian and ward.\"\n\"Hence arises the doctrines well established in American jurisprudence, and dating from the era of British colonization, that treaty stipulations are to be carried out with the utmost plentitude of good faith and with even generous interpretation in favour of these public wards of the nation.\"\n\"I cite the language of Mr. Justice McLean, in Worcester v. Slate of Georgia[1]: 'The language used in treaties with the Indians should never be construed to their prejudice. If words be made use of which are susceptible of a more extended meaning than their plain import, as connected with the tenor of the treaty, they should be considered as used only in the latter sense. * * * How the words of the treaty were understood by this unlettered people, rather than their critical meaning, should form the rule of construction.'\n\"This language is quoted and approved of by Mr. Justice Mathews, giving the opinion of the court in Choctaw Nation v. United States[2], and he continues thus: The recognized relation between the parties to this controversy is that between a superior and an inferior, whereby the latter is placed under the care and control of the former, and which, while it authorizes the adoption on the part of the United States of such policy as their own public interest may dictate, recognizes on the other hand such an interpretation of their acts and promises as justice and reason demand in all cases where power is exerted by the strong over those to whom they owe care and protection. The parties are not on an equal footing, and that inequality is to be made good by the superior justice which looks only to the substance of the right, without regard to technical rules framed under a system of municipal jurisdiction formulating the rights and obligations of private persons equally subject to the same laws.'\"\n\"'The rules to be applied are those which govern public treaties, which even in the case of controversies between nations equally independent are not to be read as rigidly as documents between private persons governed by a system of technical law, but in the light of that larger sense which constitutes the spirit of the Law of Nations.'\"\n\"On the face of the treaty of 1850 are found indicia of generous intentions contemplated and liberal dealings promised. Fixed annuities are given, as to which no question now arises. Then comes the provision for the augmentation of the annuities, 'should the territory ceded at any future period produce such an amount as will enable the government, without incurring loss, to increase the annuity;' That is to say, if the rents, issues and profits (whether from sales, leases, mining royalties, timber licenses or other sources of revenue derived from the surrendered land) shall yield a surplus after payment of all outlay in connection with the development and improvement of the territory, then that surplus shall go to augment the annuities from time to time. True, the mere words used do not say that the increased annuity is to be paid out of the proceeds of the land, but that is the plain and reasonable implication. In a dealing between guardian and ward, if the guardian took all the ward's property and undertook to maintain him, besides the general remedy equity would affix a trust to that effect upon the property so taken. Here the Indians would seem to have a right to an accounting even on the words of the treaty, so as to ascertain whether the event had arisen upon which the annuities were to be augmented. If upon such accounting a proper surplus appeared natural equity would impose a charge upon that surplus for the benefit of the Indians. That surplus would be in truth in the eye of equity the primary fund for the payment of the augmentations. The legislature (that includes the government) appears to treat even the fixed annuities as charges on the properties surrendered, and this though the payments are to be punctually made before any of the lands may have been realized. This no doubt is a proper fiscal arrangement (12 Vic. c. 200, s. 3). Even as to the fixed annuities, it would seem more obviously right where the annuities, as in the case of the augmentation, were only to be paid when a surplus arises out of the administration of the lands.\"\n\"In this latter case it would be not only a matter of finance and ordinary book-keeping, but also a conclusion of proper administration, that the revenue for the payment of the augmented annuities should be derived from the surplus outcome of the lands, and should be regarded as a charge upon that revenue, and so earmarked as applicable under the 'Robinson Treaties.'\"\n\"This charge upon the proceeds of the lands which between individuals would have been looked for (especially where the weaker party was granting his property to the stronger) is here not expressed, because the undertaking of the Crown to make the payments afforded ample security, but nevertheless the real nature of the transaction involves the existence of an interest in the Indians in and upon the proceeds of the territory surrendered.\"\n\"The term, 'interest' used in the statute is of large enough import to include this latent charge, as put by Mr Justice Kay In re Thomas[3], an interest in the proceeds of land sold is 'an interest in land in contradistinction to an estate in land.'\"\n\"The making of a treaty usually implies that the nation will by its municipal laws do all that is necessary to carry the provisions of the treaty into effect. (Per Anderson, B., in Reg. v. Serva[4]. If the parts of this treaty were thus extended, one proper term would be to charge the augmentations of the annuities upon the surplus revenues of the territory after the deduction of all proper outlays.\"\n\"By analogy to the equitable doctrine laid down in Waring v. Ward[5], it appears to me that there is an implied obligation to pay the increased annuities out of the proceeds of the lands which passes with the lands as a burden to be borne by Ontario.\"\n\"II. I think the treaty provides for an increase in the number of Indians who shall share in the augmented annuities as individuals, and that the increase is not to go to the Indians as a tribe but to the several members per capita at the time of payment. This is applying the liberal construction to the language used, so as to give the greatest possible benefit to the party least able to protect their own interests. The provision as to diminution of the annuity has reference only to the fixed sums, and does not impair the meaning given to the language used as to the augmentations. It is likely that the treaty was shaped with reference to the then prevalent idea that the tribes were dying out, but the intent of the treaty was to assist the Indians to change their state in bringing them a step nearer to civilization. If, however, the tribes increase in number the only limit of future payment is when they become entirely civilized so as to cease to be Indians.\"\n\"III. It is not desirable to define with minuteness who are Indians entitled to share, in advance of any particular case which arises for decision. It would appear from the despatch (a letter of Mr. Robinson, the Commissioner), which accompanies the treaty that half-breeds were then embraced in and numbered with the tribe in the approximate totals given. The recognition of these half-breeds as members of Indian tribes by the government appears to be manifested in contemporaneous and subsequent statutes.\"\n\"When the statute of Canada (13 & 14 Vic. ch. 74, passed 10th August, 1850), permitted none but Indians and those who may be intermarried with Indians to reside upon Indian lands (unless under special license from the government officer), and the act altogether seems to contemplate as Indians those of pure or mixed blood and those intermarried with and living among Indians (no distinction being made to sex). Then coming down to 1857, the statute of that year (20 Vic. ch. 26), gives a definition of Indians as meaning persons of Indian blood or intermarried with Indians, who shall be acknowledged as members of Indian bands, residing upon un-surrendered lands, or upon lands specially reserved for tribal use in common, and who shall themselves reside upon such lands; that is, one of other blood married to one of Indian blood, acknowledged as a member of the tribe and living on the tribal land with the tribe (whether man or woman) is accounted a member of that tribe. And the descendants of such marriage would be Indians as long as the tribal relation and residence lasted.\"\n\"This appears to be a more comprehensive category than would be the case if the matter rested on common law or on international law, for in such case, the maxim parlus sequitur patrem, governs cases as to Indians. (See judgment of Parker J., in Ex parte Reynolds[6]. \"There is the observation also to be made that the government of Canada, before 1867, had always power to regulate the inhabitancy of Indian lands by excluding all whites therefrom, and their marriage and residency on the part of white people must have been with the sanction of the government.\"\n\"I would therefore favour generally the application of the rule so as to include among Indians those of other blood who are not only married to Indians, but were adopted and acknowledged by the tribe as members, and as such lived in tribal relation with the other members at their common place of residence. If all these conditions did not exist (as to the males anyway) I should say the person of other blood and his descendants was and were not included in those entitled under the treaties.\"\n\"IV. A similar difficulty arises as to the definition of what outlay should be taken into account before the right to increased annuities arises. All expenses connected with the survey and administration of the lands and the keeping of the accounts and all outlays going to develop and advantage the territory so as to induce settlement and sale would appear to be properly charged against the income from their lands, but it is better to deal with disputed items as they arise specifically than now to attempt to exhaust all details by way of anticipation.\" \"V. In case it appears that surplus revenues existed sufficient to pay increased annuities and that there has been paid by the Dominion Government pursuant to the suggestion of Attorney-General Mowat made in 1873, these payments should be recouped to the Dominion as of this date and without interest.\"\n\"The nature of annuities is such as not to carry interest and the offer of the Attorney-General then to submit the matter in dispute as to liability to judicial tribunal should preclude the Dominion from getting interest during the period of delay from then till now.\" The Honourable Sir Louis Napoleon Casault:\n\"I would like to say one word about the interest, and about the responsibility of the provinces for the annuities subsequent to confederation. I have had occasion to consider the question before now, a good many years ago, and was firmly of the opinion that for all annuities, and even the capitalization subsequent to confederation, that it should be borne by the province of Ontario. I have had no occasion to change my mind\u2014far from it\u2014and I am glad to say that my two brother arbitrators are to-day of the same opinion. But there is a distinction to be drawn between the annuities payable after confederation, and those which became due before confederation. Of course, those which became due before confederation were due by the province of Canada to the Indians, and formed the debt of the province of Canada, and for those, if any there be, they should be paid both by Quebec and Ontario, in the proportion held by the first arbitration.\"\n\"As to interest, we have come to the conclusion, which was not adopted by the learned Chancellor, that the interest should be paid upon a balance of about $900,000 and $500,000, say $1,500,000 by Ontario, and by Quebec upon $625,000, if the balance against each province amounted to these amounts, and if by the final settlement of the accounts the balance was made less the interest should be for the less amount. I think this is nothing but a sequence of what we have decided. Of course, it should go with interest if the final settlement of the accounts diminishes the amount for which we have said that the Dominion was entitled to interest as against the province of Ontario, and if not, of course there would be no interest.\"\nTHE HONOURABLE MR. JUSTICE BURBIDGE:\n\"The case was presented to us by counsel with such completeness and lucidity of argument, and the learned Chancellor has, in the opinion that he has just delivered, and to which we have all listened with so great interest, dealt so fully with the principal issues involved, that I shall content myself with stating, as briefly and with as little discussion as possible, the conclusions to which I have come.\"\n\"I am of opinion, and as to that I do not know that there is any controversy between the parties, that if in any year since the two treaties in question were entered into the territory thereby ceded produced an amount which would have enabled the government of the province of Canada, or its successor, without incurring loss, to pay the increased annuities thereby secured to the Indian tribes mentioned therein, then such tribes were entitled to such increase, not exceeding four dollars for each individual. So much they were entitled to as a matter of law and right. Any increase beyond that would have been a matter of grace.\"\n\"I am further of opinion that the total amount of annuity to be paid under each treaty is in such a case to be ascertained by reference to the number of Indians from time to time belonging to the tribes entitled to the benefit of the treaty; that is, that in case of an increase in the number of Indians beyond the number of 1,240 named in one treaty, and 1,422 in the other, the annuity, if the funds permitted, was to be equal to a sum that would provide four dollars for each Indian of the tribes entitled. The only difficulty I have had on this point arises from the provision for the diminution of the annuity in case the number of those entitled fell below two-thirds of the numbers mentioned. In that case they were not to have 'the full benefit' of the treaty, and the annuity should be diminished in proportion to the actual members. If this provision, however, be taken to have reference only to the fixed annuities, which at the moment were for all parties the more important matter, the difficulty disappears. That clause probably was intended to operate in reduction in the case provided for of the perpetual and fixed annuities that were payable quite apart from any consideration of the amount of the revenues to be derived from the ceded territory, leaving the other provision as to increase to depend upon the excess of such revenues over the charges referable to the opening up and administration of such territory. That, on the whole, it seems to me, must have been the intention of the parties.\"\n\"Then as to 'the individuals' who in case the increase can be made without loss are to be reckoned in ascertaining the amount of the annuity, it is clear of course that they are to be Indians belonging to the tribes or bands entitled, and no one should be counted who was not by law or well-established custom a bon\u00e2 fide Indian of the tribe or band.\"\n\"I agree with what was said by Mr. Robinson of the danger of attempting at present an abstract definition of the word \"Indian.\" With reference to the period before the union I do not see that there can be any difficulty. Whatever government is now liable to pay or make good any amounts that were payable but not paid before the union, is so liable as the successor or successors of the old province of Canada, the government of which appears to have kept a record or list of the names of the Indians entitled to share in the fixed annuities. Generally speaking the 'individuals' whose names appear on such lists would be those to be taken into account in computing any increased annuity that should have been paid. The onus of showing that the names of any individuals entitled to be reckoned were improperly omitted from such lists should now be on the Indians, or those who act for them, and in like manner no names should, I think, be struck off, except for good reason shown by those whose interest it is to keep the numbers down.\"\n\"With reference to the period after confederation, neither Ontario nor Quebec would be in any way affected or precluded by the action of the Parliament or Government of Canada, or of any of its officers, either in prescribing a definition of who are Indians or in adding to the lists the name of any 'individual' as an Indian of a tribe or band entitled to the benefit of either treaty. The burden of showing that the names of any Indians so added since the union to such lists were rightly added, would be, it seems to me, on the Government of Canada.\"\n\"I should be equally unwilling to attempt a definition of the expenses and charges for the opening up, settlement and administration of the ceded territory that should be taken into account in determining whether or not the annuities could be increased 'without incurring loss.' In a general way they must, I think, be fairly referable to the administration of the particular territory and not of the class of expenditures that are incurred by governments for the general advantage of the whole country. During the argument certain expenditures by the Government of Canada since the union were mentioned; but on the whole they did not appear to me to be such as should be taken account of. If, however, there should happen to be any expenditure directly made or incurred by the Government of the Dominion for the purpose of the opening up of, and enhancing the value of, the particular territory in question, I am not at present prepared to say that it should not be taken into account.\"\n\"Then as to the question raised by Mr. Robinson as to whether or not any excess of revenue in any year might not be used to give the increased annuity in a former year in which an increased annuity could not have been paid without loss, I see no reason to change the view I expressed at the hearing, that that could not be done. If in any year the condition prescribed by the treaties did not happen the Indians have in respect of that year no claim. Of course any such excess or balance of revenue over expenditure in hand at the commencement of any given year should be taken into the accounts of that year. But if in any year the increased annuity could not be paid without loss after taking any such existing excess or balance into account, then there was as to that year no liability to pay any increased annuity.\"\n\"I think there can be no doubt that any liability to pay the increased annuity in any year before the union was a debt or liability which devolved upon Canada since the 111th section of the British North America Act, 1867.\"\n\"I am also of opinion that this is one of the matters to be taken into account in ascertaining the excess of debt for which Ontario and Quebec are conjointly liable to Canada under the 112th section of the Act.\"\n\"I do not think that Ontario and Quebec have, in respect of any such liability, been discharged by reason of the capitalization of the fixed annuities, or because of anything in the Act of 1873 (36 Vic. ch. 30). The matter was never considered or taken any account of in such capitalization or in any of the proceedings leading up to the award of Sept. 3rd, 1870, or in the award itself.\"\n\"With respect to the Act of 1873, its effect, so far as it is necessary now to consider it, was to substitute the sum of $73,006,088.84 for the sum of $62,500,000.00 in the 112th section of the British North America Act, 1807, the result being that Ontario and Quebec became and remained conjointly liable to Canada for any excess of debt over the former instead of the latter sum. That is the clear construction of the Act itself, and it is one that has been acted upon without question by all parties since the Act of 1873 was passed. The contention for a different construction is now raised for the first time. It is now said that the Act of 1873 was conclusive of the amount of the debt with which the old province of Canada entered the union. If so, the province of Canada account was closed in 1873, and the negotiations between the parties that have occurred since the agreement of 1888 (Exhibit Z, Report of Conference, 1888, p. 4), the settlement of particular items of that account coming in or ascertaining between the years 1873 and 1888 (id. pp. 19 to 22), and our awards in respect to that account and interest thereon all go for nothing. The question is not, it seems to me, open to fair debate.\"\n\"With reference to the question of interest on any increased annuities that may be now ascertained to have been payable prior to the union to the Indians under the treaties in question, it is obviously necessary to distinguish between the rights of the Indians to interest, and the question of interest as between the Dominion and the provinces of Ontario and Quebec as the successors in liability to the old province of Canada. The latter question has been concluded by the agreement of 1888, and our award following that agreement. The question as to whether or not interest should be computed on any arrears of such annuities is another matter depending upon the right in law or equity of the Indians to interest as against the Crown, and it seems to me that they have no case either at law or in equity. I regret that I cannot see my way to a different conclusion. But I have no doubt that the debts and liabilities for which Canada became liable under the 111th section of the British North America Act are legal debts and liabilities, and that the excess of debt for which, under the 112th section, Ontario and Quebec became conjointly liable to the Dominion, cannot, without the conjoint consent of Ontario and Quebec, be increased by any debt or liability not enforceable in law or equity.\"\n\"If there is to be any consideration of any claim of the Indians to interest on any arrears of annuities payable before the union in recognition of any moral obligation or as a matter of good conscience, it is for Ontario and Quebec to consider the matter and admit or deny the claim as they see fit. The Dominion can collect from them only what they legally owe, and cannot by discharging moral obligations make Ontario and Quebec liable; and there is, if I may express an opinion on that point, obviously no obligation, legal or moral, on the Dominion to do more than collect for the Indians from Ontario and Quebec whatever amount of arrears the province of Canada owed to them, and to pay it over to the tribes entitled.\"\n\"Unless Ontario and Quebec will consent that in computing the amount of arrears due to the Indians at the union, such arrears shall be computed with interest, they must, it seems to me, be made up without interest.\"\n\"With reference to the period subsequent to the union, the case presented by the Dominion for the tribes of Indians interested in the treaties in question is, that the ceded territory became the property of Ontario under the 109th section of the British North America Act, 1867, subject to a trust to pay the increased annuities on the happening after the union of the event on which such payment depended, and to the interest of the Indians therein. The other question as to whether or not Ontario and Quebec are conjointly liable under the 112th section of the Act to the Dominion for such increased annuities with or without a right on the part of Quebec to be indemnified by Ontario against the same, is not now raised. That question is reserved to come up in some future proceeding or not, as the Dominion may think proper.\"\n\"Now, looking to the particular matter, my mind lends a ready assent to Mr. Robinson's argument that it is equitable that this burden should fall upon Ontario. Ontario has the advantages resulting from the ownership of the lands, and it should bear the burden. I agree to that; considered as a matter by itself it is highly inequitable that any part of the burden should fall upon Quebec, and even in a greater degree inequitable that Nova Scotia or New Brunswick or any of the provinces that came into the union since 1867 should be called upon as a part of the Dominion to contribute anything towards making good to the tribes entitled the increased annuities payable to them under the treaties mentioned; and were it not for the consideration to which I am about to refer I should for myself have little or no hesitation in joining in making an award upon the 'equitable principles' mentioned in the sixth section of the Acts under which we are sitting. But the union of the provinces was a large matter involving many issues and considerations of great moment, and the compact to which expression was given in the Act by which the union was consummated is one which should, I think, be guarded and maintained with great watchfulness and care. What one might think to be fair and equitable with respect to a particular matter dealt with in the Act, abstracted from other provisions therein, might in conjunction with such provisions be in fact and reality unfair and inequitable. So it seems to me that the only safe way is to adhere strictly to the compact or treaty that was made by the province that entered into the union; and that the highest fairness and equity will be found in giving to each the advantages, and imposing upon each the burdens, it has bargained for. The case is one in which we ought, I think, to proceed upon our view of 'a disputed question of law,' and I am better satisfied to follow that course as it will save to the party against whom any award is made a right of appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada, and thence to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council [54 & 55 Vict. (D.), c. 6, s. 6].\"\n\"Now with reference to the question of law in dispute, it seems to me clear that in a narrow and strict sense the Indians for whom this claim is made by the Dominion had at the union no interest in the lands constituting the ceded territory, other than the right or privilege of hunting thereon or fishing in the waters thereof so long as such lands were ungranted. These Indians were no doubt interested in such lands in the sense that it would be to them an advantage to have them managed with a prudence and forethought that would at the earliest possible time and for the longest time possible give them the increased annuities for which the treaties made provision. But the very object of the surrender was to give the Crown a free hand in the settlement and administration of the land and to divest the Indians of any title thereto or interest therein. And so too, looking to the parties to the treaties in question, the Crown on the one side and the several tribes of Indians on the other, it is possible that the Crown did not, after the surrender, hold the ceded territory on any trust that would be enforceable in law. But in a broader sense, and I agree fully with the learned Chancellor in thinking that the treaties in question and the British North America Act should be construed in a large and liberal way, it seems to me that the Indians, in entering into such treaties, reposed a confidence in the Crown that it would manage the ceded lands fairly for the advantage of all concerned, and so as to raise there out, if that were fairly possible, the moneys to pay the increased annuities, and that there was a corresponding duty resting on the. Crown to do so. In that sense the lands were at the union, it seems to me, subject to a trust or interest existing in respect of the same. It is objected that it was not the lands constituting the ceded territory, but the proceeds of the lands, that were impressed, if at all, with any such trust, or in which the Indians had any such interest, and it is 'lands' and not 'proceeds of lands,' that are mentioned in the 109th section of the British North America Act, 1867. But that objection does not, it seems to me, present any great difficulty in view of the facts of the case. These lands were, before the surrender, and have since been vested in the Crown. There was no change of title at the union. The Crown continued to hold them. Before the union the beneficial interest in such lands and the right to take and appropriate the revenues arising therefrom was vested in the province of Canada, and by the 109th section of the British North America Act, 1867, that right passed to the province of Ontario. The lands themselves did not pass in the sense that the title thereto was transferred. What passed was the right to administer and take the proceeds, the revenues arising from such lands. This is clear, I think, from two passages of the judgment of the Judicial Committee, delivered by Lord Watson in the St. Catharines Milling and Lumber Company v. The Queen[7], cited by Mr. Justice King in Farwell v. The Queen[8], and from what the same learned Lord said in delivering their Lordships' judgment in the 'Precious Metals' Case,' the Attorney-General of British Columbia v. The Attorney-General of Canada[9].\"\n\"In the former case, referring to the effect of the Imperial statute, 3 & 4 Vic. c. 35, Lord Watson said:\u2014.\n\"'There was no transfer to the province of any legal estate in the Crown lands which continued to be vested in the Sovereign, but all moneys realized by sales, or in any other matter, became the property of the province. In other words, all beneficial interest in such lands within the provincial boundaries belonging to the Queen, and either producing or capable of producing revenue, passed to the province, the title still remaining in the Crown.'\"\n\"And then with reference to the distribution of property under the British North America Act, 1867:\n\"'It must always be kept in view that, whenever public land with its incidents is described as 'the property of' or as 'belonging to' the Dominion or province, these expressions merely import that the right to its beneficial use, or to its proceeds, has been appropriated to the Dominion or the province, (as the case may be), and is subject to the control of its legislature, the land itself being vested in the Crown.'\"\n\"The following are extracts from the judgment in 'The Precious Metals' Case.':\u2014\n\"'The title to the public lands of British Columbia has all along been, and still is, vested in the Crown; but the right to administer and to dispose of these lands to settlers, together with all royal and territorial revenues arising therefrom, has been transferred to the province before its admission into the federal union. Leaving the precious metals out of view for the present, it seems clear that the only \u2018conveyance' contemplated was a transfer to the Dominion of the provincial right to manage and settle the lands, and to appropriate their revenues. It was neither intended that the lands should be taken out of the province, nor that the Dominion Government should occupy the position of a freeholder within the province.'\"\n\"'In British Columbia the right to public lands, and the right to precious metals in all provincial lands, whether public or private, still rest upon titles as distinct as if the Crown had never parted with its beneficial interests; and the Crown assigned these beneficial interests to the Government of the province, in order that they might be appropriated to the same state purposes to which they would have been applicable if they had remained in the possession of the Crown. Although the provincial Government has now the disposal of all revenues derived from prerogative rights connected with land or minerals in British Columbia, these revenues differ in legal quality from the ordinary territorial revenues of the Crown. It therefore appears to their Lordships that a conveyance by the province for 'public lands,' which is, in substance, an assignment of its rights to appropriate the territoral revenues arising from such lands, does not imply any transfer of its interest in revenues arising from the prerogative rights of the Crown.'\"\n\"That view of what lands mean when vested in the Crown in the right of or for the use or benefit of the Dominion or of a province relieves us, I think, of any difficulty that might otherwise arise in respect to any distinction between a trust or interest in such lands and in the proceeds of or revenues arising out of such lands.\"\n\"I think the ultimate burden of making provision for the payment of the increased annuities in question falls upon the province of Ontario, and that that burden has not, as against the Dominion or these Indians, been in any way affected or discharged. I express no opinion as to the effect of the award of 1870 on the respective rights of Ontario and Quebec. That question would arise in a case presented by the Dominion against the two provinces under the 112th section of the British North America Act, but does not arise here.\"\n\"With reference to interest on arrears of annuities accruing due after the union and not paid to those entitled, it seems to me that they stood in the same position as those that accrued before the union and that interest should not be computed without consent of Ontario. But as to the increased annuities paid by the Dominion to the Indians in 1874 and since, the Dominion should, I think, have interest on any amounts so properly disbursed, if our award as to interest on the province accounts permits thereof. The payments were made after notice and after certain negotiations between the Dominion and Ontario, in which, without determining on whom the burden should ultimately fall, it was admitted the Indians were entitled. The question, then, is not one of interest on unpaid annuities, but of interest on moneys paid by the Dominion in respect of a legal liability, for which it is entitled to indemnity against Ontario\"\n\"I think any such moneys so properly paid should be charged against the province in the province of Ontario account as of the date of payment by the Dominion to the Indians, and so fall within and be affected by any previous ruling as to interest on that account.\"\nThe province of Ontario appealed from said award to the Supreme Court of Canada.\n\u00c6milius Irving Q.C, S. H. Blake Q.C. and J. M. Clark appeared for the appellant, the Province of Ontario.\nChristopher Robinson Q.C. and W. D. Hogg Q.C., for the respondent, the Dominion of Canada.\nD. Girouard Q.C. and Hon. J.S. Hall Q.C, for the respondent, the Province of Quebec.\nIrving Q.C. With your Lordships' permission, my learned friends Mr. Blake and Mr. Clark appear on behalf of Ontario; I am also in the case but I shall not address the court. My learned friend Mr. Blake will lead.\nBlake Q.C. Ontario claims that there was no trust in respect to these lands; that no trust could have been declared in regard to them; that any trust would have absolutely defeated what the parties were endeavouring to arrange, which was that the lands were to be placed in the possession of Canada, so that they might deal absolutely with them. If there was to be any trust in favour of the lands it would have absolutely defeated what the province of Canada was desirous of carrying out. For what the province of Canada wanted to do was at once either absolutely to give away or absolutely to sell, or absolutely to deal with, these lands. If there had been any trust, or if there had been any interest retained in favour of the Indians, then the province would have been utterly unable to do what it desired to carry out. The arrangement was one to do away with any right, to do away with any interest, to do away with anything that in any possible way might check the freest dealing with this property. The Indians, of course, are perfectly satisfied, because, instead of the illusory charge which they had of fishing and shooting, they get absolutely as much of the land as they felt they could possibly deal with. They retain\u2014and it is specified in the treaty as all that they do retain\u2014the right to fish and shoot on all the other lands until the Government chooses to sell them; but the moment it gives them away, or sells them, or leases them, that ends it. They take a certain sum of money down, and they take the promise of the Government, which embraces the honour of the Crown, which embraces all, it may be, that might come from the lands, which embraces all the revenues of the Government. They take that promise and set absolutely free all these lands; and if these lands are not set absolutely free from any trust and from any interest, then the whole object of the treaty is utterly and entirely defeated.\nTrusts or charges, or anything of that kind, would be out of the question because it binds or touches the land; the very object of what was being entered into is utterly defeated, because the person that takes the land must take it with the trust or with the charge, and the land is not land absolutely free to be dealt with, as was the intention of those parties. I think that that should be emphasized, because while both the learned Chancellor and Mr. Justice Burbidge say that, taking this as an ordinary instrument, and construing it as an ordinary instrument, construing it so as to 'further the reasonable scope of the provisions, they are able to stretch it in such a way as to create upon the land that which did not exist. Now, my Lords, you will find that the learned Chancellor says:\n\"The course of construction applicable both to the constitutional Act and Indian treaty is not that a literal and strict meaning is to be given the words, but that they shall be construed liberally and comprehensively, so as to further the reasonable scope of the provisions.\" I have no objections whatever to the reasonable scope of the provisions being followed out; but is not the true scope here that the lands are not to be charged? Is not the true scope of the provision that the Government is to take the lands freed from any interest or charge?\nIt is only by the one solitary means that Ontario can be made responsible and that is by holding that they have taken the lands subject to a trust and holding the lands under the trust must discharge it; and in discharging it, must pay these annuities. Ontario alone did not enter into this bargain; Ontario was not known then. There was no contract with Ontario; it was a contract with the provinces composed of Upper and Lower Canada, and the only way that Ontario can be made responsible is, not by carrying out the reasonable scope of the instrument, but by freely and entirely negativing what is its scope, altering it entirely, altering it entirely to the detriment of Ontario, altering it entirely not to the betterment of the Indians. And this has not been stretched in order to help the Indian, because the Indian knows perfectly well that he has got the whole of the Dominion behind his back in this payment. But what I do submit is that here the true scope is that the lands are not chargeable. The true scope is that there is to be a personal payment by the Crown to the Indians; and if there is to be any such enlargement must not the enlargement be according to the scope of the instrument, and not to defeat the instrument? If you turn round now and say there is to be a trust\u2014and it is admitted that that is an enlargement\u2014why, my Lords, it is an enlargement that defeats the instrument and does not carry it out.\nThen again, it is said that there is an implied obligation to pay them out of the revenue from the lands. I submit not; no implied obligation to pay them out of this at all; a distinct bargain made for certain benefits on the one side and certain benefits on the other; that there will be, in case I make well out of my bargain, a certain additional sum or an augmentation in your favour.\nSo, I say there was no charge, no right, no interest, and one of my strong arguments is the language that has been used by these two learned judges, showing that the language, taken as it usually is taken, does not warrant it, and showing that the very object that was had in view would be utterly defeated if the language was so broad. But then they say \"because these are Indians, you are to deal liberally with them,\" forgetting, my Lords, that it does not give the Indians one cent more or one cent less. The Indians are not dissatisfied with their paymaster; and, forgetting that, they are making this change in this bargain\u2014for virtually it is a change\u2014not in favour of those that they say are entitled to consideration, but in order to charge the one province as against the other.\nI went through the cases that have been referred to, but I did not find that there was anything whatever in them which negatived the position taken by the province of Ontario here.\nThe case well known to his Lordship, the Chief Justice of the court, of the Canada Central Railway v. The Queen, in which his Lordship gave judgment in the first instance[10], was referred to. Well, my Lords, I gladly take the conclusion of his Lordship, Chancellor Sprague, there, at page 314, where it was urged there should be, even in an Act of Parliament, an extension or the like. He says: \"I am in doubt whether the consequences were appreciated by the legislature, but our duty is to interpret it, and that is our only function.\" And then your Lordships will find at pages 326 and 328 of that judgment, a citation of cases in regard to the construction of Acts of Parliament. In that case of the Central Railway Company there was the express statement\u2014and your Lordships will find that at page 275\u2014that the company was to be entitled to a grant of land. I am simply referring to the cases cited, and referring to the fact that there is nothing in those cases which would warrant what the learned arbitrators have done. By section 18 of the Act there certain lands were set apart, and at page 289 it is said that it is taken for granted that, as between individuals, the right to that specific land existed. The only question was the making a selection out of four million acres of lands that were granted; and the court came to the conclusion that if there was a sale of 5 acres out of 100 that the party might make a selection of it. But there was the most absolute trust as declared by the Act of Parliament in favour of the Railway Company that was presenting the petition. And in Booth v. McIntyre[11], another case cited, it was held that the company had the power untrammelled by any restrictions to enter upon the lands of the Crown, and that that was not taken away but reserved by section 109 of the British North America Act. But there the right existed; it was plain and specific; no question about it.\nThen there was a case in Maclean's Reports, as to the treaties with Indians and the tribes and others, and I do not find anything there. On the contrary it was held that the distinction was not authorized by the constitution; that is, to deal in treaties with Indians in different ways from other treaties. They are treaties within the meaning of the constitution, and as such should be laws of the land. Mr. Hallock, whose book was also referred to, says that they are to receive a fair and liberal interpretation, according to the intention of the contracting parties. That is all that is to be kept in view, according to the intention of the contracting parties\u2014which I say would be utterly defeated by the interpretation put here\u2014and be construed in good faith. Their intention is to be governed by the same rules which we apply to the determination of contracts. That is the third edition of Hallock's International Law, 296. Whitton says they are to be construed in the same way; and Story also, vol. 2, page 44.\nI submit, therefore, my Lords, that the true conclusion in respect to this matter was that Ontario is not individually liable for the payment of this amount; that nothing has transpired to place upon Ontario any additional responsibility; and that this is a debt either of the old province of Canada in the augmentation of it, as well as in the original amount; and that it must either be discharged by that province, or else discharged by the Dominion of Canada.\nClark follows for the appellant. In the present appeal before your Lordships, and in the argument before the learned arbitrators, the whole question was as to whether there was a sole liability of the province of Ontario for payment of these annuities subsequent to confederation; the other question was not raised. Ontario asked before the arbitrators that the whole matter should be settled at once, but the Dominion reserved their right to make a claim afterwards against the province of Canada under section 112, if the present claim failed; but your Lordships will see that that matter is not adjudicated upon at all in the award, and was purposely left out by the arbitrators, and that matter, namely, the liability of the old province of Canada, as to whether the Dominion was liable under section 111, and had any right over against the province of Canada under section 112\u2014that is against Ontario and Quebec jointly\u2014is entirely left in abeyance, and is not the subject of the present appeal.\nThen the whole question now before your Lordships is as to the construction of these treaties and of section 109, of course taken in connection with section 111, and so on, so far as they throw light on section 109.\nFirst, I would like to call your Lordships' attention to the suggestion made in the factum of the Dominion and in the judgment of the learned Chancellor, namely, that all the meaning of these sections could be obtained by construing the British North America Act, or at least the sections in question, as if the treaties, which are the subject of the present bill, had been incorporated in them by way of preamble.\nIf we consider it in that way, we hare first the treaties in question mentioned in the case, and of which my learned friend read sufficient to illustrate the present argument. Then we have the treaties declaring that the Indians surrender, and so on, using the largest possible words of grant, all their right, title and interest\u2014using the very words of the British North America Act\u2014in the lands in question, and give up all their right, title and interest in the land.\nAnd what I submit is that the only interest that the Indians expressed on the face of the treaty\u2014I shall deal afterwards, if necessary, with the question of the implication\u2014refers to the reservations mentioned in the treaty, which are not in question, and to the rights to shoot, and so on, given to the Indians under the words of the treaty.\nI submit that the previous arbitrators, in 1870, having dealt with the matter there should not now be an award which is in direct conflict with the previous award, especially when your Lordships bear in mind that there was an appeal from the previous award to the Privy Council, and that the Privy Council confirmed the award so far as the objections then taken. In the special case which is referred to in paragraph 6 of the judgment of the Privy Council, (your Lordships will find that special case printed in the Ontario Sessional Papers of 1878, number 42) your Lordships will see that this identical section, 109, is made part of the case. So that if there was anything in the award of 1870 which was in conflict with section 109, then that was the objection appearing on the special case before the Privy Council, and is, I submit, concluded in favour of Ontario by the judgment of the Privy Council, that so far as any objection was made to the award in the special case the award is valid.\nBefore the learned arbitrators, and in the factum of the Dominion, they argue in favour of the principle that Ontario getting the benefit of the lands should bear the burden of these annuities, and in support of that contention they rely, apparently, on the direction of the Privy Council in St. Catharines Milling Company v. The Queen[12]; but all the decisions of all the courts are collected in the 4th volume of Cartwright, the cases under the British North America Act at page 107 and subsequent pages, commencing with the decision in the Privy Council. Now, your Lordships will see from the whole of the reports, and from the way in which the matter was discussed in the Supreme Court[13], that originally it was a matter entirely between the Attorney-General for Ontario and the St. Catharines Milling and Lumber Company. That was decided in that way by the Chancellor of Ontario, the Court of Appeal for Ontario, and this court. And it was only on the application for leave to appeal to the Privy Council that the question of the right of the Dominion came in at all; and the Dominion was allowed, on a special order made in that case, to intervene, and it is pointed out in the citation in the factum that the whole of the question in regard to the effect of that treaty then in question in 1873, was to be decided on the appeal to the Privy Council; and at page 60 of that case, in the judgment, Lord Watson says that, seeing that Ontario gets the benefit of the land there in question, that Ontario must recoup the Dominion the money payments which are there referred to; but what I point out to your Lordships is that the circumstances in that case were entirely distinct from the present case, and that that case can have no application to the decision here. Your Lordships will observe that the treaty there in question, being the North-west Angle Treaty, no. 3, was made in 1873, subsequent to confederation, so that the position was that at the time that treaty was made in 1873, Ontario took those lands, as was held in all the courts, subject to the burden of the Indian interest, whatever that interest may be.\nThere is a case in 31 Common Pleas which construes the word interest, and I submit the considerations there are entirely in favour of Ontario, and that only the class of matters which are referred to are intended to be covered by the words \"trust and interest\" in section 109.\nRobinson Q.C. for the Dominion of Canada. There are two or three considerations, which may be put very shortly, which it seems to us is almost conclusive in favour of the constructions which the arbitrators have adopted. In the first place, as I understand, those principles which apply, and which my learned friends seek to apply, with reference to the legal authorities, as to the existence or non-existence of a vendor's lien, and different cases of that kind, and as to the existence or non-existence of a trust, are not relevant to the issue; there is no vendor's lien here; the Dominion is not seeking to retain a vendor's lien; it is a transaction sui generis; you cannot find any transaction like it. The reason of it is this: this land undoubtedly, in the hands of the old province of Canada and before confederation, was certainly land in which the Indians had an interest. It was land subject to a trust for their benefit.\nWhat would have been the position of things before confederation? Canada would have had to pay this debt out of the proceeds of this land. Well, now, does not Ontario, getting this land, hold it from Canada just as Canada held it? What is the difference? The Crown held it before for the benefit of the old province of Canada. There has been no sale and no transfer of title, as we all know. The Crown hold it now for the benefit of the province of Ontario. Why should the Crown hold it for the benefit of the province of Ontario in any different way or different position or free from any claims which attached to it while they held it for the province of Canada? I hold land for A. and hold it for A., with this interest which B. has in it, namely, to get the proceeds from it over and above a certain sum; I make an arrangement instead of holding it for A. I shall hold it for C.; why should I not hold it for C. under the same conditions as I hold it for A? Why should the interest in the land be changed by reason of a difference to the cestui qui trust? Because that is what it means. We submit the whole arrangement shows that plainly.\nNow, then, let us consider for a moment clause 13 of the award of 1870. Let us see how things stood before that arbitration. Confederation had taken place; the division of assets between Ontario and Quebec had to be made by this arbitration; by confederation the lands in each province went to that province subject to the interest or trust of either people under section 109; but it was thought desirable that this question of Indian annuities should be dealt with by the arbitrators of 1870, and it was brought before them, and what did they say? I suppose they looked at section 109, and they said:\nThis land has become the property of the province. Now, if this land is subject to any annuity or to any claim to be paid out of the proceeds of the land, it must be quite understood that the province that gets the land is not to have any claim on the other provinces for it.\nNow, let us see if this is not borne out by the very words of that award. I have not quite apprehended the force or foundation of my learned friend's argument that that award is against us:\n\"That all the lands in either of the said provinces of Ontario and Quebec respectively, surrendered by the Indians in consideration of annuities to them granted, which said annuities are included in the debt of the late province of Canada, shall be the absolute property of the province in which the said lands are respectively situate, free from any further claim upon, or charge to, the said province in which they are so situate, by the other of the said provinces.\nHow does that affect the claim which is made here by the Dominion against one of the provinces? How has it any bearing upon it? I think that what they said is: \"You Ontario, get these lands; you will have to pay the annuities. Now, you must recollect you will have no claim against Quebec or any of the other provinces for it.\"\nThe arbitrators have put this case on those grounds, which I submit are unanswerable. In the first place there is a trust or interest. Ontario has got the fund out of which is to come the proceeds or funds which have to pay the annuities. The payment of the annuities is conditional on the person holding the lands enabling the payment of those increased annuities. It could not be dealt with by the arbitrators of 1869, because you cannot tell from time to time what the proceeds will be. The case stands in a very peculiar position. Ontario has the lands and is administering the lands, and Ontario is the only person who can tell what the proceeds are. The proceeds depend upon the management of those lands and the receipts of Ontario from these lands. The arbitrators have based their finding on the equitable principle laid down in Waring v. Ward[14], that principle which is to be found in Broom's Maxims, page 634, 6th edition.\nWe say, these lands passing to Ontario were taken by Ontario subject to the interest of the Indians in them; that that is the fair meaning of the statute, as it would be if you would put the treaty and the statute in juxtaposition; and that that is the reasonable and fair construction of the statute, looking at the constitution as a constitution, and looking at the treaty as a treaty; because, looking at it on all principles of equity and justice, it should be interpreted that way; and we say, therefore, the judgment should be affirmed.\nHogg Q.C. follows. There is one question I wish to draw your Lordships' attention to, and that is with reference to clause 13 of the award of 1870; that clause deals with the rights only of the provinces; the arbitration was for the purpose of the distribution and division of assets and liabilities as between the provinces, as between Ontario and Quebec, or Upper and Lower Canada, and for the purpose of freeing one from the other It has the effect of freeing absolutely the one province from any claim the other province may have with reference to a charge such as the one at present, but it has no other effect. It does not affect the right of the Indians to say that they have a claim, nor of the Dominion on behalf of the Indians that this claim should be presented. In other words, if the clause 13 has the effect which my learned friends for Ontario have said, then if there is an interest of the Indians in those lands under the 109th section of the British North America Act, then that clause of the award is ultra vires the powers of the arbitrators of 1869.\nThere is just one other point, my Lords, that I had intended to draw your Lordships' attention to; that was with reference to the statement made by my learned friends from Ontario, as to the difference which exists between the treaty referred to in the St. Catharines Milling case, and the present treaty. My learned friend made the statement that the St. Catharines Milling case established the character of the interest which the Indians had in lands in this country; that is, that the interest there defined was the only interest which the Indians had in the lands. That is quite true with reference to the treaty in that case; for a fixed annuity under that treaty the Indians surrendered all their interest, whatever it might be. In the present treaties there was a fixed annuity, but there was a contingent annuity, or an annuity based upon the lands being of sufficient value or sufficient produced from those lands to pay a further annuity; and while the whole interest of the Indians in the lands in the North-west Angle Treaty was disposed of for a fixed annuity, the whole interest in the Robinson Treaty was not disposed of, because they retained an interest in the results or produce of the lands for the augmented annuity; and therefore at the time these lands came into the province of Ontario at confederation there was still this outstanding interest which the Indians Had, and that is the interest which the learned arbitrators have defined in their judgments as an interest under the 109th section of the British North America Act.\nGirouard Q.C. for the respondent, the province of Quebec.\n(The learned counsel after pointing out that no suggestion was ever made until 1884 that Quebec should be liable for these payments, proceeded as follows):\nNow, it seems to me, that in order to fully understand this case it will be proper to give a little history of the Indians on this continent, and to consider the purpose of these Robinson Treaties. On the one side Her Majesty, Queen Victoria, represented by the Hon. William Robinson, Commissioner of Crown Lands, and on the other side certain tribes of Indians called in the treaty Nation Indians of Lake Huron, and Ojibeways of Lake Superior. I would like to go back to the very beginning, and show the history of the Indians at the present time, to show they are not to be considered as individuals, to show their rights are not mere rights of subjects of Her Majesty. I shall show that these Indians have some greater rights than British subjects. When the Spanish, English and Dutch took possession of this northern America what did they do? They immediately put themselves into relations with what they called the Indian nation, not only one Indian nation but several of them. The English sought the friendship of what was called then the Confederacy of the Five Nations located at the south of lake Ontario, between Niagara and somewhere, the line of the province of Quebec and the province of Ontario to-day; and the French sought the friendship of the other Indian nations which were inhabiting the northern portion of the St. Lawrence as far as Sault Ste. Marie. It was admitted that these Indian nations formed distinct political communities in the country. Treaties were made with them, not only as far as the line was concerned, but also as far as peace and war were concerned. In 1698 came the end of that long war which commenced in 1667. In the month of September, 1698, there was a large gathering of all the Indian nations inhabiting the whole of this northern continent for the purpose of concluding the peace with the French King, represented by the colonial authorities in Canada. Then later on we find that the French King made some provisions for the maintenance of these Indians. The cession of Canada took place in 1763, and then you find a different policy pursued by the English Government. The French Government took possession of all the lands of the province of Quebec as their own. They did not purchase anything from the Indians, but in some cases reservations followed; but it was a sale, it was a gift or donation from the King of France for the benefit of these Indians. The mission of Oka of Two Mountains is one; Caughnawaga is another; the mission of St. Fran\u00e7ois du Lac is another; and another one will be at Quebec, at Lorette. There is a great difference between the wording of these Indian treaties made at the time with the French and those made with the English. Let us take one which has been the subject of contention before the court of justice in order to understand the scope of these treaties which the French King made for the Indians. I take the concession of Sault St. Louis, for the benefit of the Iroquois which was made in the year 1680 to the Jesuit Fathers:\n\"Our dearest and well-beloved, the Religious Order of the Society of Jesus, residing in our Dominion of New France, have caused it to be most humbly represented to us that the lands of the Prairie de la Magdelaine which were heretofore granted to them, being too damp for the purpose of sowing and providing for the sustenance of the Indians who have thereon settled, and that it is feared they might leave if we were not pleased to give them the land called the Le Sault, containing two leagues in width from a point opposite the St. Louis Rapids, going up along the lake by an equal depth, with two islands, islets and shoals, which are in front and adjoining the lands of the said Prairie of La Magdelaine, which would allow them not only to receive the said Iroquois, but even to increase their number, and to spread by that means the knowledge of Faith and of Gospel.\"\nAnd then the grant proceeds to say that the title to the land is given to the Jesuit Fathers \"on condition that the said land called the Sault, shall belong to us free and clear, as it then may be, without any claim on us.\" And then there is a provision in the grant that the French people shall not reside on this reservation.\nAbout the time of the cession to Great Britain the Jesuit Fathers undertook to sell to some white men pieces of that reservation. The Indians complained. There was a regular law-suit; and the decision was that although the title in the land was in the name of the Jesuit Fathers, still it was subject to a trust, and that trust was that it should be for the sole use of these Iroquois Indians. The word \"trust\" is not used in that grant or cession. It is not said that the Jesuit Fathers shall hold the land in trust for the Indians. It is a gift, a donation, to the Jesuit leathers, without using the word \"trust,\" but the trust can be construed just the same. It is a constructive trust from the very wording of the grant, which says that it shall be:\n\"To allow the Jesuit Fathers not only to receive the said Iroquois, but even to increase their numbers, and to spread by that means the knowledge of Faith and of the Gospel,\" and so on.\nThat decision will be found in the last volume of what is called Indian treaties and surrenders, published by the Dominion Parliament in 1891. The decision was rendered by General Gage, and I think it should have careful scrutiny and examination. He says that:\n\"At the surrender of this country, all things had been well arranged to maintain the said Indians in possession of their lands at Sault St. Louis, but that now the Jesuit Fathers, their missionaries, were granting continually to the French the lands forming part of the territory of Sault St. Louis, which, however, they believed belonged to them, by a title of grant given them by his most Christian Majesty.\"\nThen he says:\n\"We are of opinion that the grant of the lands of Sault St. Louis was made to the Jesuit Fathers with the sole intention of settling there Iroquois and other Indians, and that all the soil could produce was intended for their profit and advantage.\"\nI mention this case in order to show how liberally a treaty of this kind must be construed. It must be construed especially in favour of the Indian. Now let us take the policy of the British Government since the cession. After the revolutionary war, the Iroquois, who had been always friendly to the English, desired to cross the St. Lawrence and be located somewhere about the Peninsula of Niagara; and you find that about the end of the last century, treaties and surrenders were made by the British Government with the different Indian nations. All those treaties will be found in the volume which I had in my hand a moment ago. I have taken the trouble to compare all those treaties from say about the first cession\u20141785 I think is the date of the first one\u2014to about the year 1856, and I find only about two kinds of treaties. First there is an absolute surrender for a fixed sum without any trust; for a sum say of a thousand pounds; such a treaty surrenders all titles, rights, and interests in certain tracts of lands, and there is no reservation of any kind whatever. That is what I call a surrender absolute. I may say that most surrenders are absolute. And then you find also surrenders which are not absolute. I forgot to mention that all the land of Upper Canada, after the cession to Great Britain by France, was held by the Indians, with the exception of a few pieces at Cataraqui, at Niagara, and all along Windsor and Sault Ste. Marie. All that piece of land was still inhabited by the Indians, and it was therefore necessary for Great Britain, pursuing the policy they had followed in the United States, to extinguish what was known as the Indian title.\nIn twenty of these surrenders the word \"trust\" is to be found; in ten of them it is not to be found; the wording is the same, the only difference being that the word \"trust\" is not to be found in the treaty. Instead of reading \"upon the trust and with the intent,\" it is \"that His Majesty, his heirs and successors may out of the proceeds of the profits of the said lands and premises, arising from the sale or leasing or such other disposition of the lands or any part thereof as to His Majesty, his heirs or successors, may seem meet, make provision for the maintenance and religious instruction of the Indians.\"\nThe trust is provided for; the trust is created; the trust is stipulated, undoubtedly, just as in a case where the word \"trust\" is used. The treaty is worded in the same way, except the word \"trust\" is not there. Well, I do not think a court of justice ought to make any distinction because in a deed the word \"sell,\" for instance, is used if it is a deed of sale, or the word \"trust\" is used if it is a deed in trust. But is the character different? Is the nature of it different, or the whole text of it, so that we may see whether, from the wording, you can make up or construe a trust? I say the wording is just the same, with the exception of the word trust.\nThen, in the next place, supposing you come to the conclusion that because the word \"trust\" is used in some of these surrenders\u2014including the surrenders by those Lake Huron and Lake Superior Indians\u2014that there is no trust in those ten cases, but there is a trust in the other twenty cases, in what a state of confusion would the lands held for the benefit of the Indians be. You will have some subject to a trust, and some not subject to a trust. I say that with reference to all the lands which have been bought subject to a trust, whether the word \"trust\" is used in the deed or not used in the deed, but from the context of it we can infer a trust, that is, a promise on the part of Her Majesty that something should be done for the benefit of these Indians in the future\u2014that then there is a trust. And I say more than that. I say that is the interpretation that has been given by all the authorities in this country from the end of the last century to the present time.\nNow, my Lords, I intend to quote the statute to show that it was the intention of the late legislature that lands subject to the payment of annuities, lands subject to increased annuities, were construed as lands held in trust, and that these annuities formed a charge upon the land. I quote in the first place from the statute which has been already quoted, but I think it is very important that the special attention of the court should be called to it, that is 12 Victoria, chapter 200, commonly known as the Public Schools Lands Act, or Consolidated Statutes of Canada ch. 26. The statute proceeds to set apart acres of land for the purpose of education, but at the very end of the clause it says: \"But before any appropriation of the moneys arising from the sales of such lands shall be made, all charges thereon for the management or sale thereof, and all Indian annuities charged upon such lands or moneys, shall be first paid.\"\nMy learned friends say these school lands were located in a place where no Indian annuities were due; but it puts it still more strongly, it seems to me. But supposing it is the case\u2014which I do not believe\u2014it shows the intention of Parliament that it should not be possible that school lands should be set apart to destroy Indian annuities. The Indian annuities shall continue to be the first charge upon the lands. In the face of that interpretation given to it by our own Parliament, the late province of Canada, represented by Quebec and Ontario to-day, the very parties to this arbitration, are we going to be told that the Parliament of the late province of Canada did not intend to make a charge upon their land when their statute says so. If one treaty could be quoted where it says that for the said annuity the said lands shall be charged, I would understand it; but no such treaty can be found. There are two kinds of surrenders; one is absolute, on consideration of such money paid down, and the other one is subject to future annuities, or increased annuities. There is never a case where it states the lands shall remain charged, or a lien shall exist. But I say that when you find that declaration of the late Parliament of the province of Canada contained in the statute of 1849, it shows the intention of the parties then; that is to say, the late province of Canada, represented by Ontario and Quebec\u2014the very parties to-day contending for a different interpretation\u2014we find their declaration that Indian annuities which all stand upon the same footing, are a charge upon the lands which were surrendered. Now, I have only one more word to say. My learned friends representing Ontario hold that the arbitrators of 1870 did, in fact, deal with this question; but I submit they did not; I submit that they had no power to do it; and they did not do it. The only thing they said was that \"all the lands in either of the said provinces of Ontario or Quebec respectively, surrendered by the Indians in consideration of annuities to them granted which said annuities are included in the debt of the late province of Canada, shall be the absolute property of the province in which the said lands are respectively situate, free from any further claim upon, or charge to the said province, in which they are so situate, by the other of the said provinces.\"\nI say in the first place that this exception made in favour of Ontario is only as to a claim the province of Quebec may have in this matter. Quebec claims nothing. Who claims it? The Indian. They may claim in their own name, or they may claim in the name of the Dominion; and even if these first arbitrators had in view to remove any claim of the Indian, they had no power to do so. If the Indians had a trust upon these lands under section 109, it was not in the power of the first arbitrators to set aside that section 109 of the Constitution, and the Privy Council has been very careful in deciding the special case which was submitted to them, to declare that the award was valid only as far certain points of form were concerned.\n\"The Lords of the Committee, in obedience to Your Majesty's said Order of Reference, have taken the said Special Case into consideration, and having heard counsel for the province of Ontario, and likewise for the province of Quebec, their Lordships do this day humbly advise Your Majesty that under the circumstances stated in the Special Case (to which circumstances all their answers must be taken to refer):\n\"1. John Hamilton Gray had not become disqualified to act as an arbitrator.\n\"2. That after hearing before the three arbitrators two of them could legally render a decision or award, and could do so in the absence of the third, absenting himself under the circumstances stated.\n\"3. That after the subsequent ex parte hearing before two arbitrators, in the absence of the third then two of them could legally render a decision.\n\"4. That the arbitrators appointed by Quebec had not the right to resign, and the Government of Quebec had not the right to accept his resignation and to revoke his appointment, and such resignation and revocation were not effectual and valid.\n\"5. That after one of the arbitrators had so affected to resign, and his resignation had been so accepted, and his authority had been so affected to be revoked, the remaining two could legally proceed to hear the case and make a final award.\n\"6. That so far as regards any objection made to the award in the Special Case, the award of the 3rd of September, 1870, is valid (save as affected by the Dominion Act therein set forth).\"\nThe Dominion Act is the British North America Act. Nothing is plainer than this decision of the Privy Council:\n\"Her Majesty, having taken the said report into consideration, was pleased, by and with the advice of Her Privy Council, to approve thereof and to order, as it is hereby ordered, that the said recommendations and advice of the Lords of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council be adopted, and that the same be punctually observed, obeyed and carried into execution as the decision of Her Majesty upon this Special Case. Whereof the Governer General of the Dominion of Canada, the Lieutenant-Governor or Commander in Chief of the same for the time being, and all other persons whom it may concern, are to take notice and govern themselves accordingly.\"\nI forgot, when dealing with the legal status of the Indians, taken as nations and not as individuals, to say that the Jaws passed by these Indian nations had been recognized by the courts of our own country as binding upon themselves. Take the case of marriage; take Connolly v. Woolwich[15], which says that the marriage of a white man to an Indian, according to their own laws, was a valid marriage; and they have certain rules and laws of succession, certain rules and laws concerning the property, which was especially reserved for their own use. I forgot to mention that, as another illustration of the proposition I laid down at the beginning, that those Indians, as nations, must not be looked upon as a big corporation or company; but must be looked upon as a nation, having a political economy in the country.\nHall Q.C. followed. I would like to say one or two words with reference to section 109; and I would like your Lordships to bear in mind that in dealing with this question under the British North America Act, and in dealing with the question you have to deal with now, you are dealing, so to speak, with the three crowns. It is not a dealing between three individuals, or between the Crown and anyone particular individual; and we are dealing with the British North America Act, which Mr. Girouard still says ought to be considered, not as a strict statute, but more as a compact and agreement between the various parties; and this section 109 is not only to be considered with reference to the interests of this particular claim, but with whatever interest there may have been with other parties with reference to existing lands they may have held prior to the union.\nI do not think adding the words \"subject to any trust,\" &c., destroys the intent which the parties had; and while that clause does refer to the various other provinces, it has more of a particular bearing between Ontario and Quebec. And what was the condition of affairs there? The Crown, if I may use the expression, of the old province of Canada, held all these lands in Ontario and Quebec, and of course they held these lands without any mortgage or hypothec being put upon them in the sense that they could not give a good title; and they had to be apportioned as between Ontario and Quebec in some manner or form; therefore, under section 109, the general rule is laid down\u2014the lands in Ontario will go to Ontario, and the lands in Quebec will go to Quebec; and you in Ontario will take care of all the liability and all the obligations the Crown is under in respect to those lands, and we will not be troubled by any person who may have any claim or petition of right; and we in Quebec take these lands, not by a deed, not as a third party getting a deed in writing purporting to give us a title to lands under a deed; but we just take them by way of apportionment; they are still Crown lands; and instead of belonging to the Crown of Canada, if I may use that expression, they go to the Crown in Quebec; and the Crown in Quebec takes those lands and has to abide by all the conditions, liabilities, and anything of that kind there may be attached to those lands.\nIn construing this clause, section 109, in reference to that, the words \"trust\" and \"interest\" are not to be taken in their ordinary strict sense, or even in a municipal sense; but they must be taken in the broad sense made in the treaty with the Indians at that time. The Crown dealing with the Indians, as they had done for a number of years, clearly recognizing, as far as the Indians are concerned, whether it was right or wrong, or legal or illegal, clearly leading the Indians to believe they had some rights or title in the land. Now, having dealt with them in that way, have not the Indians got this interest in the lands? Have not they a right in the proceeds of the lands? Have not they a right to come in and protect themselves? And now we say, the lands having gone over to Ontario in that way, and being in the Crown, as it were, all the time, they must take them subject to the trust existing in the Crown. We think under the terms of the Robinson Treaty there is clearly a trust there that out of the proceeds of the lands the increased annuity must be paid; and it is out of those proceeds alone that the trust must be paid, and it could not be charged against the Consolidated Revenue Fund without some legislation. It is only a trust in respect to those, and no more; and it is only the party who has the administration of the lands, and who has the proceeds who can be reached in order that these increased annuities may be paid; and we say that is the province of Ontario.\nBlake Q.C. in reply.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014This is an appeal from a portion of an award made on the 13th February, 1895, by the Hon. John A. Boyd, Chancellor of Ontario; the Hon. Sir Louis Napoleon Casault, Chief Justice of the Superior Court of the province of Quebec; and the Hon. George Wheelock Burbidge, Judge of the Exchequer Court of Canada, arbitrators appointed pursuant to three identical statutes passed respectively by the Parliament of the Dominion and the Legislatures of Ontario and Quebec, providing that for the final and conclusive determination of certain questions and accounts, which had arisen or which might arise in the settlement of accounts between the Dominion of Canada and the provinces of Ontario and Quebec, both jointly and severally, and between the two provinces, concerning which no agreement had theretofore been arrived at, the Governor General in Council might unite with the governments of the provinces of Ontario and Quebec, in the appointment of three arbitrators, being judges, to whom should be referred such questions as the Governor and the Lieutenant-Governors of the provinces should agree to submit.\nThe sixth and seventh sections of these identical statutes were as follows:\n6. The arbitrators shall not be bound to decide according to the strict rules of law or evidence, but may decide upon equitable principles, and when they do proceed on their view of a disputed question of law, the award shall set forth the same at the instance of either or any party. Any award made under this Act shall be, in so far as it relates to disputed questions of law, subject to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada and thence to the Judicial Committee of Her Majesty's Privy Council, in case their Lordships are pleased to allow such appeal.\n7. In case of an appeal on a question of law being successful, the matter shall go back to the arbitrators for the purpose of making such changes in the award as may be necessary, or an appellate court shall make any other direction as to the necessary changes.\nBy a document signed by counsel for the Dominion and the two provinces respectively, dated the 10th of April, 1893, and entitled \"first agreement of submission,\" after reciting the statutes before referred to, and the appointment thereunder of the arbitrators before named, certain questions were agreed to be referred, including all questions relating to or incident to the accounts between the Dominion and the provinces of Ontario and Quebec, and certain particulars were then specified, which it was agreed should be understood as included in this general submission, one of which specifications was as follows:\u2014 The claims made by the Dominion Government on behalf of Indians, and payments made by the Government to Indians, to form part of the reference.\nThis agreement of submission was adopted by the three governments of the Dominion, Ontario and Quebec, by Orders in Council of the Governor General and the Lieutenant-Governors in Council, made respectively on the 13th of April and the 15th of April, 1893. The appeal now before us is from a portion of the award made by the arbitrators under this submission, disposing of the claim of the Dominion Government in respect of certain payments made to the Indians mentioned in the treaties hereafter referred to, and also of claims to further payments set up by the Dominion Government on their behalf.\nOn the 7th September, 1850, the Hon. William B. Robinson, acting as a commissioner on behalf of the Crown, obtained from the Ojibeway Indians of the Lake Superior district a surrender in favour of the Crown of certain Indian territory, situate within the limits of the late province of Canada, as described in a treaty entered into on that day between Mr. Robinson, on behalf of the Crown, and the chiefs and principal men of the Ojibeway Indians, inhabiting part of the northern shore of Lake Superior. And on the 9th day of September, 1850, the same Commissioner obtained a like surrender of certain other lands, by the Ojibeway Indians inhabiting and claiming certain portions of the eastern and northern shores of Lake Huron, represented by their chiefs and principal men, and which lands were described in a treaty entered into on the last mentioned day.\nThe surrender under the Lake Superior Treaty was in consideration of the sum of two thousand pounds paid down, and a perpetual annuity of five hundred pounds. The consideration for the Lake Huron surrender was the sum of two thousand pounds paid down, and a perpetual annuity of six hundred pounds.\nThe Lake Huron Treaty contained the following clause, viz.:\nThe said William Benjamin Robinson on behalf of Her Majesty, who desires to deal liberally and justly with all her subjects, farther promises and agrees that should all the territory hereby ceded by the parties of the second part, at any future period produce such an amount as will enable the Government of this province, without incurring loss, to increase the annuity hereby secured to them, then, and in that case, the same shall be augmented from time to time, provided that the amount paid to each individual shall not exceed the sum of one pound provincial currency in any one year, or such further sum as Her Majesty may be graciously pleased to order, and provided further that the number of Indians entitled to the benefit of this treaty shall amount to two-thirds of their present number, which is fourteen hundred and twenty-two, to entitle them to claim the full benefit thereof. And should they not at any future period amount to two-thirds of fourteen hundred and twenty-two, then the said annuity shall be diminished in proportion to their actual numbers.\nThe Lake Superior Treaty contained a clause in the same words, with the exception of the statement of the number of Indians which in the latter treaty was stated as being 1240.\nIt is under the provision for the payment in a certain event of increased annuities that the question now presented for the decision of this court has arisen.\nBy the British North America Act provision was made for the disposition of the public lands which, on the 1st of July, 1867, the date of confederation, were the property of the province of Canada which became extinct by that Act. Provision was also made for the assumption by the Dominion of the debts and liabilities of the province of Canada, and for the payment by the new provinces of Ontario and Quebec of interest on any excess of that debt of $62,500,000, and for the deduction of that interest from the half-yearly subsidies payable to those provinces. Further, provision was made for a division and adjustment by arbitration of the debts, credits, liabilities, properties and assets of Upper and Lower Canada. The sections of the British North America Act material to be considered are sections 109 to 113 inclusive, and section 142. These sections are as follows:\n109. All lands, mines, minerals and royalties belonging to the several provinces of Canada, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick at the union, and all sums then due or payable for such lands, mines, minerals, or royalties, shall belong to the several provinces of Ontario, Quebec, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, in which the same are situate or arise, subject to any trusts existing in respect thereof, and to any interest other than that of the province in the same.\n110. All assets connected with such portions of the public debt of each province as are assumed by that province shall belong to that province.\n111. Canada shall be liable for the debts and liabilities of each province existing at the union.\n112. Ontario and Quebec conjointly shall be liable to Canada for the amount (if any) by which the debt of the province of Canada exceeds at the union, $62,500,000, and shall be charged with interest at the rate of five per centum per annum thereon.\n113. The assets enumerated in the fourth schedule to this Act, belonging at the union to the province of Canada, shall be the property of Ontario and Quebec conjointly.\n142. The division and adjustment of the debts, credits, liabilities, properties and assets of Upper Canada and Lower Canada shall be referred to the arbitrament of three arbitrators, one chosen by the Government of Ontario, one by the Government of Quebec, and one by the Government of Canada; and the selection of the arbitrators shall not be made until the Parliament of Canada and the Legislatures of Ontario and Quebec have met; and the arbitrator chosen by the Government of Canada shall not be a resident either in Ontario or in Quebec.\nBy an Act of the Dominion Parliament (36 Vict. ch. 30) passed on the 23rd May, 1873, the amount of debt to be absolutely assumed by the Dominion was increased from the sum of $62,500,000 as fixed by the 112th section of the Confederation Act, to $73,006,088.84 and thereafter interest was only to be deducted against the provinces of Ontario and Quebec on any excess of debt over the last mentioned sum. I refer to this statute, not because I think it has any bearing on the questions now before us for decision, but because it is an alteration of the terms imposed by the British North America Act. The effect of this Act (36 Vict. ch. 30) has already been considered by this court on a former appeal from the same arbitrators[16].\nAt the date of the Robinson Treaties in 1850 the management of Indian affairs was not in the hands of the provincial government, those affairs having been administered by the Governor General as representing the Imperial Government until some time in or after the year 1854, when it was handed over to the province.\nThe province of Canada, however, paid the fixed annuities, amounting in the aggregate to $4,400, every year up to the date of confederation, and since confederation up to the present time the Dominion Government have paid the same amount. The question raised by this appeal is confined to the increased annuities. What is claimed by the Dominion is that the difference between the fixed annuities, which, distributed amongst the Indians, amounted to $1.60 per head, and the increased annuities of $4 per head stipulated for by the clause in the treaties before set forth from 1851 to 1867, and which have never been paid to the Indians, should be paid by the province of Canada with interest to 31st December, 1892, amounting in all to $325,440; and that the province of Ontario should pay to the Indians the sum of $95,200, being the amount of the increased annuities from the date of confederation in 1867, up to the year 1873, with interest added to the 31st December, 1892. Further, it is claimed by the Dominion that as the Dominion Government has from 1874 to 1892, inclusive, paid the increased annuities to the Indians, it should be reimbursed the amount so paid by the province of Ontario, the sum thus claimed for increased annuities paid by the Dominion since 1874 amounting, with interest to 31st December, 1892, to $389,106.80.\nIn 1874 the province of Ontario admitted that from the year 1851, up to 1892, the surrendered territory produced an income sufficient to enable the government to pay the increased annuities without incurring loss, and that the Indians are of right, under the treaties, entitled to the payment of the arrears. This has not been disputed by the province of Quebec and I regard it as a fact conceded on all hands.\nAs regards this debt or liability up to 1867, it was clearly one of the late province of Canada which must be considered as having been assumed by the Dominion under section 111 of the British North America Act, forming part of the general debt with any excess of which over the sum of $73,006,088.84, Ontario and Quebec were to be charged and were to pay interest an as provided for by section 116 of the British North America Act. This is, however, subject to a claim not of the Dominion but of the province of Quebec, to throw the whole of this debt or liability existing at confederation on the province of Ontario. The contention of the Dominion, however, is that there was in respect of these annuities, payable subsequent to 1867, a, charge in favour of the Indians upon the surrendered lands, or a trust of the rents, profits and proceeds thereof in their favour, and that when these lands became vested, under the 109th section of the Union Act of 1867, in the province of Ontario, that province took them cum oner\u00ea subject to the trust or charge in favour the Indians. Ontario insists that there is no trust or charge created by the treaties, and that the liability to pay the increased amount of the annuities since confederation was, at the date of the British North America Act, a debt, or at least a liability, of the province of Canada which is to be dealt with under sections 111, 112 and 116 just as the annuities up to the date of confederation are to be dealt with. Further, it is contended by Ontario that the whole question is res judicata, having, as it is said, been disposed of by the 13th clause of an award made on the 3rd September, 1870, by arbitrators appointed under the 142nd section of the British North America Act. Under that provision three arbitrators were appointed in 1870, two of whom made the award already referred to, the third\u2014the arbitrator for Quebec\u2014the Hon. Charles Day, having resigned his office and retired from the arbitration. Two questions having arisen as to the validity of this award of 1870, one as to whether the award made by a majority of the arbitrators was valid, and the other as to the qualification of Mr. John Hamilton Gray, one of the arbitrators who made the award, these questions were referred to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council who pronounced in favor of the legality of the award, and their report was accordingly confirmed by an order of Her Majesty in Council on the 26th March, 1878. The merits of the award of 1870 were not, so far as I can find, in any way before the Privy Council, the reference to them being confined to the two points mentioned. By the first clause of the award the arbitrators of 1870 fixed the proportions in which Ontario and Quebec respectively were to contribute to the excess of debt of the province of Canada assumed by the Dominion, over the amount fixed by the statute.\nThe 13th clause of the award of the 3rd of September, 1870, is as follows: That all the lands in either of the said provinces of Ontario and Quebec respectively, surrendered by the Indians in consideration of annuities to them granted, which said annuities are included in the debt of the late province of Canada, shall be the absolute property of the province in which the said lands are respectively situate, free from any further claim upon or charge to the said province in which they are so situate, by the other of the said provinces.\nThis award has now stood for twenty-five years, its legality never having been disputed except as before mentioned.\nThis adjudication Ontario now sets up as a final disposition of the same question as that raised before the present arbitrators and now under appeal.\nBy their separate award of the 13th February, 1895, a portion of which is now under appeal, the present arbitrators found and awarded as follows:\nIn respect of the claim made by the Dominion of Canada against the provinces of Ontario and Quebec in reference to the Indian claims arising under the Robinson Treaties.\n1. That if in any year since the treaties in question were entered into, the territory thereby ceded produced an amount which would have enabled the Government, without incurring loss, to pay the increased annuities thereby secured to the Indian tribes mentioned therein, then such tribes were entitled to such increase not exceeding $4 for each individual.\n2. That the total amount of annuities to be paid under each treaty is, in such case, to be ascertained by reference to the number of Indians from time to time belonging to the tribes entitled to the benefit of the treaties. That is, that in case of an increase in the number of Indians beyond the numbers named in such treaties, the annuities, if the revenues derived from the ceded territory permitted, without; incurring loss, were to be equal to a sum that would provide $4 for each Indian of the tribes entitled.\n3. That any excess of revenue in any given year may not be used to give the increased annuity to a former year, in which an increased annuity could not have been paid without loss, but that any such excess or balance of revenue over expenditure in hand at the commencement of any given year should be carried forward into the account of that year.\n4. That any liability to pay the increased annuity in any year before the union was a debt or liability which devolved upon Canada under the 111th section of the British North America Act, 1867, and that this is one of the matters to be taken into account in ascertaining the excess of debt for which Ontario and Quebec are conjointly liable to Canada under the 112th section of the Act; and that Ontario and Quebec have not, in respect of any such liability, been discharged by reason of the capitalization of the fixed annuities, or because of anything in the Act of 1873 (36 Vic. ch. 30).\n5. That interest is not recoverable upon any arrears of such annuities.\n6. That the ceded territory mentioned became the property of Ontario under the 109th section of the British North America Act, 1867, subject to a trust to pay the increased annuities on the happening, after the union, of the event on which such payment depended, and to the interest of the Indians therein to be so paid. That the ultimate burden of making provision for the payment of the increased annuities in question in such an event falls upon the province of Ontario; and that this burden has not been in any way affected or discharged.\n7. That interest is not recoverable on the arrears of such annuities accruing after the union, and not paid by the Dominion to the tribes of Indians entitled.\n8. That in respect to the matters hereinbefore dealt with, the arbitrators have proceeded upon their view of disputed questions of law.\n9. That as respects the increased annuities which have been paid by the Dominion to the Indians since the union, any payments properly made are to be charged against the province of Ontario in the province of Ontario account as of the date of payment by the Dominion to the Indians, and so fall within and be affected by our previous ruling as to interest on that account.\nThe province of Ontario on the 4th of March, 1895, gave the following notice of appeal from the award:\nNotice of appeal and limitation of contention of appeal.\nTake notice that under the provisions of the statutes above mentioned the province of Ontario intends to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada from the award of the arbitrators herein bearing date the 13th day of February, 1895, but delivered and published on the 14th day of February, 1895.\nAnd further, take notice that Ontario will, on the hearing of such appeal, limit its contentions and except only to so much of the said award as determines and decides, as stated and formulated in paragraph 6 of the award, as follows:\nThat the ceded territory mentioned become the property of Ontario under the 109th section of the British North America Act, 1867, subject to a trust to pay the increased annuities on the happening, after the union, of the event on which such payment depended and to the interest of the Indians therein to be so paid. That the ultimate burden of making provision for the payment of the increased annuities in such event falls upon the province of Ontario; and that this burden has not been in any way affected or discharged.\nAnd also as formulated in paragraph 9 of the award, as follows:\nThat as respects the increased annuities that have been paid by the Dominion to the Indians since the union, any payments properly made are to be charged against the province of Ontario in the province of Ontario account, as of the dates of payment by the Dominion to the Indians.\nOntario will urge among other grounds for appeal against the matters assumed to be decided by paragraphs 6 and 9 of the award above set forth that the said matters are decisions of the learned arbitrators upon disputed constitutional questions, the same being raised and relied upon in the respective cases of Ontario and Quebec filed of record before the learned arbitrators, and which questions were renewed and pressed at the argument before the learned arbitrators, whereby Ontario disputed that any liability in respect of the said matters accrued or could accrue to Ontario except jointly with Quebec; and that the decision of the learned arbitrators in the premises are not final.\nSubsequently to this notice of appeal the arbitrators made the following order:\nIn the matter of the arbitration between the Dominion of Canada, the province of Ontario and the province of Quebec, pursuant to statute of Canada, 54 & 55 V. c. 6, statute of Ontario, 54 V. c. 2, and statute of Quebec, 54 V. c. 4.\nOn motion of counsel for the province of Ontario, and on hearing what was alleged as well by counsel for the province of Ontario as by counsel for the Dominion of Canada, and the province of Quebec, we, the undersigned arbitrators, do, with reference to a certain award and decision dated on the thirteenth and published by us on the fourteenth day of February, eighteen hundred and ninety-five, certify and declare that, in respect of the question of the liability of the province of Ontario for the increased annuities which have been paid by the Dominion to the Indians since the union, as in such award is mentioned, the arbitrators proceeded upon their view of a disputed question of law, but that in respect of the question of interest on such increased annuities so paid, which question was dealt with in the ninth paragraph of the first part of such award, by determining the time when such annuities should be charged against the province of Ontario in the province of Ontario account, the majority of the arbitrators did not proceed upon their view of a disputed question of law.\nJ. A. BOYD.\nL. N. CASAULT.\nGEO. W. BURBIDGE.\nDated at Quebec, this 26th day of March, 1895. No appeal was lodged by the province of Quebec.\nI now proceed to consider the questions thus presented by the appeal.\nIn the first place nothing in the clause of the treaties providing for the augmentation of the annuities in the event specified indicates that the undertaking to make these increased payments was to constitute them a charge or lien upon the surrendered lands. There is nothing shewing that either the original annuities of six hundred pounds and five hundred pounds per annum, or one dollar and sixty cents per head of the respective bands of Indians, were to be paid out of the proceeds of the lands or out of any particular fund, nor that in the event of a right to the increased amount arising it should be paid out of any particular fund; all that is specified is that in the event of the augmentations being payable without loss they were to be paid. This does not mean that the increase was to be paid out of the proceeds of the lands, but has reference only to the event in which the increase was to become payable. There is, therefore, no ground for saying that there was any express charge, lien or trust. Then, if there is any charge it can only be on the principle of the equitable lien of an ordinary vendor of real property, and from analogy to the rules of courts of equity applicable to such liens. I think this argument entirely inadmissible. At the date of these surrenders, in 1850, the Indians were under the protection of the Imperial Government, and their affairs were administered by the Governor General, not through the responsible ministers of the province, but directly as representing the Crown. Not until 1854 was the management of Indian affairs transferred to the provincial governments. The Indians had therefore the highest security which could be given for the payment of the augmentations, the assurance and covenant of the Imperial Government There was, therefore, no reason for giving or implying any other. Then, as these lands were acquired by the Crown with a view to settlement, for developing mineral deposits, and for the purpose of applying the timber to purposes of utility, it would have been in the highest degree inconvenient that the power of dealing freely with them for these purposes should be fettered with any latent lien or trust. Again, even if we are to apply strictly the rules applicable between ordinary vendors and purchasers, numerous authorities show that this would not be a proper case for the implication of a lien. I refer to the cases cited in the Ontario factum as showing this conclusively[17].\nFurther, as against the Crown or Government, implications of this kind are not to be made. The Indian bands had as security the pledge of the Imperial Government whose commissioner and delegate, through the appointment of the Governor General, Mr. Robinson was, and they had the security of a charge on the consolidated fund of the province of Canada for the government of that province, which government, though the surrender was not made to it directly, obtained the benefit of it, the lands so soon as surrendered coming under the act of parliament by which the territorial and casual revenues had before the date of the surrender been transferred to the province, and the original annuities were therefore always paid out of the consolidated fund and not out of a specific fund provided from the revenue derived from the lands themselves. There, was therefore, no necessity that this security should be supplemented by any charge or lien not expressed in the treaties themselves. An argument against the province of Ontario is attempted to be deduced from the decision of the Privy Council in the case of The St. Catharines Milling Co. v. The Queen[18]. In that case there was an Indian surrender to the Crown represented by the Dominion Government, made in 1873, subsequent to confederation. The Privy Council held that this surrender enured to the benefit of the province of Ontario, and so holding it also decided that Ontario was bound to pay the consideration for which the Indians ceded their rights in the lands. I see no analogy between that case and the present. In the case before us no one doubts that the province of Canada, which acquired the lands, was originally bound to pay the consideration. In the case before the Privy Council the question was, as it were, between two departments of the government of the Crown, and the most obvious principles of justice required that the government which got the lands should pay for them. Here the lands were originally acquired by the province of Canada which was to pay for them, and the present question only arises on a severance of that government into two separate provinces and a consequential partition of its assets and liabilities.\nThe statute which gives jurisdiction to this court to entertain this appeal in the section I have already quoted from provides that an appeal shall be only in respect of points decided by the arbitrators in which they shall indicate that their award has proceeded on disputed questions of law. In the 8th paragraph of the award it is stated that in the decision under appeal the arbitrators did so proceed. This of course limits this court to purely legal considerations in adjudicating on the matter in controversy, and it excludes all such equitable considerations as to what might be fair and reasonable outside the construction of the British North America Act, and the legal interpretation of the treaties, and I have so endeavoured to deal with the case. The question before us is, therefore, purely a question of law arising upon the construction of the treaties and the British North America Act.\nThe result is that the liability incurred by the Crown and the province of Canada to pay the increased annuities was, at the date of confederation, a general debt or liability of that province within the meaning of the 111th section of the British North America Act, and as such one required by that section to be assumed primarily by the Dominion, subject to such recoupment as is provided for by the 112th and 116th sections. That it was a \"liability\" though consisting of deferred periodical payments cannot be doubted, and that it was a \"debt\" though not payable in presenti is also clear; it therefore comes within the literal meaning of the 111th section, and we are not at liberty to unravel the arrangements between the two divisions of the old province, upon which it may be assumed the provisions of the Union Act as to the apportionment of assets and liabilities was based in order to arrive at some secondary meaning contrary to the ordinary and natural import of the language of the Act.\nThen, turning to the award of 1870, I am of opinion that this point was substantially decided by the arbitrators appointed under the 142nd section of the British North America Act. I have already stated the 13th section of that award determining that lands in either Ontario or Quebec surrendered by Indians in consideration of annuities should be the absolute property of the province in which the lands might be situated, free from any charge, and that the annuities should be included in the general debt of Canada, which was to be borne in the first place by the Dominion subject to such indemnity as the statute provides, as regards any excess over the fixed amount. The burden of the indemnity was of course to be borne by the provinces in the proportions declared by the arbitrators in the first section of their award. It is true that at the time this award of 1870 was made no question had arisen regarding the payment of the augmented annuities, but this in my opinion can make no difference. There is nothing before us to show that the arbitrators of 1870 did not intend to refer to the liability to pay the increased annuities when they made their award. That liability was clearly within the terms of the 142nd section of the British North America Act, and of the reference to them, and they had power to decide questions of law as well as questions of account and matters of fact, and were the sovereign judges of all such questions. It must therefore be intended that, having before them the treaties and the act of parliament under which they acted, they decided as a question of law that the increased annuities were not charged upon the surrendered lands, and that there was no trust of these lands for the purpose of paying the annuities. I think, as I have already said in disposing of the first point, that they were right in this view of the law. But whether they were or were not right can make no difference, for the award of 1870 must be conclusive on all the parties to it. It has stood for twenty-five years unimpeached except upon the points referred to the judicial committee, and now to re-open it and disturb one of its provisions, upon which other dispositions may have depended, would not only be most unfair but would be a proceeding without any legal warrant, statutory or otherwise. The arbitrators must therefore be taken to have had in mind all the annuities, the original fixed annuities as well as those contingently provided for. They held that the lands vested absolutely, free from' any charge, and this must have included both. It is out of the question to say, as is argued in the factum of the province of Quebec, that in so deciding the arbitrators were assuming to alter the provisions of the 109th section of the British North America Act, by holding that the lands should be vested free from incumbrances, which the statute declared should be a charge. So to argue is to beg the question. Of course we are not to presume that the arbitrators intended so far to exceed their powers as to assume to repeal the statute. What they intended is clear. They meant to say, and did in terms decide, that the annuities in question, all of them, the increased as well as the original annuities, which formed the consideration for these cessions were not charged upon the surrendered lands at all but formed part of the general debts and liabilities of the former province of Canada.\nThis appeal must be allowed, and the award must be varied by substituting for the 6th paragraph thereof, the following:\nThe ceded territory mentioned became the property of Ontario under the 109th section of the British North America Act, 1867, absolutely, and free from any trust, charge or lien in respect of any of the annuities as well those presently payable as those deferred and agreed to be paid in augmentation of the original annuities upon the condition in the treaties mentioned. And further, by striking out the 7th and 9th paragraphs of the award.\nThe province of Ontario is entitled to the costs of this appeal to be paid by the Dominion.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014Concurred.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014The sole question involved in this appeal simply is which of the governments, namely, that of the Dominion of Canada, or of the provinces of Ontario and Quebec conjointly, or that of the province of Ontario alone, is chargeable with the fulfilment of obligations and liabilities to the Ojibeway Indians of Lakes Superior and Huron, if any have accrued since confederation in virtue of the terms of the treaties entered into between Her Majesty and the respective Indian nations in the year 1850 before confederation.\nBy treaty bearing date the 7th day of September, 1850, entered into between Her Majesty the Queen through the intervention of the honourable William B. Robinson acting for her, duly authorized in that behalf, of the one part, and the chiefs and principal men of the Ojibeway Indians inhabiting the north shore of Lake Superior from Batchewanaung Bay to Pigeon River at the western extremity of said lake, and inland throughout that extent to the height of land which separates the territory covered by the charter of the honourable the Hudson Bay Company from the said tract and also the islands in the said lake within the boundaries of the British possessions therein, of the other part; it was witnessed that in consideration of two thousand pounds of lawful money of Canada to them in hand paid and of the further perpetual annuity of five hundred pounds to be paid and delivered to the said chiefs and their tribes at a convenient season of each summer not later than the first day of August at the honourable the Hudson Bay Company's post of Michipicoton and Fort William they the said chiefs and principal men did freely and voluntarily surrender, cede, grant and convey unto Her Majesty, her heirs and successors for ever, all their right, title and interest in the whole of the territory above described, save and except the reservations set forth in a schedule thereunto annexed; and by a certain other treaty, bearing date the 9th day of the same month of September, between Her Majesty the Queen through the intervention of the said honourable William B. Robinson acting for her and duly authorized on that behalf of the one part, and the chiefs and principal men of the Ojibeway Indians inhabiting and claiming the eastern and northern shores of Lake Huron from Penetanguishene to Sault Ste. Marie and thence to Batchewanaung Bay on the northern shore of Lake Superior together with the islands in the said lake opposite to the shores thereof, and inland to the height of land which separates the territory covered by the charter of the honourable the Hudson Bay Company from Canada as well as all unconceded lands within the limits of Canada west to which they have any just claim, of the other part, it was witnessed that for and in consideration of two thousand pounds of lawful money of Canada to them in hand paid and of the further perpetual annuity of six hundred pounds of like money, the same to be paid and delivered to the said chiefs and their tribes at a convenient season of each year, of which due notice should be given at such places as might be appointed for that purpose, they, the said chiefs and principal men on behalf of their respective tribes did fully, freely and voluntarily surrender all their right, title and interest to and in the whole of the territory above described, save and except the reservations set forth in a schedule thereunto annexed.\nEach of the said treaties respectively contained a promise and undertaking of Her Majesty expressed in the terms following:\nThe said William Benjamin Robinson on behalf of Her Majesty, who desires to deal liberally and justly with all her subjects, further promises and agrees that in case the territory hereby ceded by the parties of the second part shall at any future period produce such an amount as will enable the government of this province, without incurring loss, to increase the annuity hereby secured to them, then, and in that case, the same shall be augmented from time to time provided that the amount paid to each individual shall not exceed the sum of one pound provincial currency in any one year or such further sum as Her Majesty may be graciously pleased to order; and provided further that the number of Indians entitled to the benefit of this treaty shall amount to two-thirds of their present numbers (such numbers in the treaty with the Lake Superior Indians being stated to be then twelve hundred and forty, and of the Lake Huron Indians in the treaty with them to be then fourteen hundred and twenty-two), to enable them to claim the full benefit thereof, and should their numbers at any future period not amount to such two-thirds (of their then numbers respectively) the amount should be diminished respectively in proportion to their actual numbers.\nThe first point presented for our consideration is the construction of the above clause which is common to both of the treaties, and in the consideration of it it is altogether beside the question to insist that the title of Her Majesty to the lands mentioned in the treaties as being surrendered by the Indians were vested in Her Majesty in right of Her Crown to the fullest extent independently of the treaties and that the execution of those instruments neither added to, nor detracted from Her Majesty's title to the ceded territories. It is not contended that Her Majesty's title to the lands was not perfect, independently of the treaties, or that Her Majesty derived title to the lands in virtue of the surrender by the Indians mentioned in the treaties; what is contended for and must not be lost sight of, is that the British sovereigns, ever since the acquisition of Canada, have been pleased to adopt the rule or practice of entering into agreements with the Indian nations or tribes in their province of Canada, for the cession or surrender by them of what such sovereigns have been pleased to designate the Indian title, by instruments similar to these now under consideration to which they have been pleased to give the designation of \"treaties\" with the Indians in possession of and claiming title to the lands expressed to be surrendered by the instruments, and further that the terms and conditions expressed in those instruments as to be performed by or on behalf of the Crown, have always been regarded as involving a trust graciously assumed by the Crown to the fulfilment of which with the Indians the faith and honour of the Crown is pledged, and which trust has always been most faithfully fulfilled as a treaty obligation of the Crown.\nNow, by the claims under consideration Her Majesty was graciously pleased to promise and agree with the Indians, the parties of the second part to the said respective treaties, that in case the territories mentioned in the said respective treaties as being thereby ceded by the respective parties thereto of the second part should at any future period produce such an amount as would enable the government of the province of Canada, without incurring loss, to increase the fixed annuities thereby secured, that then, in such case, the same should be increased from time to time to an amount not exceeding one pound provincial currency to each individual of the respective tribes or nations. Now as the payment of the increased annuity is expressly made contingent upon the fund to be realized or produced out of the territories expressed to be ceded proving to be sufficient to enable the Government of Canada to pay such increased sum without incurring loss, the plain construction of Her Majesty's promise and undertaking is that such increased sum (in the event of the fund permitting it) should be paid out of the funds so to be produced and so enabling the government to pay it without incurring loss. The fulfilment of that promise and undertaking involved a trust graciously assumed by Her Majesty affecting the fund to be produced and realized out of the territories expressed to be respectively ceded to Her Majesty. It cannot, I presume, admit of a doubt that if the province of Canada had continued, and was still in existence as it was in 1850 when the treaties were entered into, the increased sum, though first charged upon the consolidated fund of that province, must have been charged upon and paid out of the fund realized and produced out of the ceded territories, which were paid into the consolidated fund, if such proceeds enabled Her Majesty's provincial Government of Canada to pay the increased amount without incurring loss; but that government no longer being in existence, although the fund is, that same fund, in whose hands so ever it is, appears to be the sole fund which, if it be sufficient to enable the payment to be made without incurring loss, is naturally and reasonably still chargeable with the payment, unless there be some different provision of statutory obligation made in that behalf upon or since the confederation of the provinces into the Dominion of Canada.\nAt the time of the union of the provinces in 1867 there does not appear to have been any claim or inquiry made for the purpose of ascertaining whether or not sufficient funds had been produced out of the ceded territories or either of them to have enabled the Government of the late province of Canada, without incurring loss, to have paid the increased annuity or any part thereof by the said treaties agreed to be paid; but in 1873, upon the petition of the Indians, suggesting that the proceeds from the respective territories must then be sufficient to entitle them to fulfilment of the stipulations of the, treaties in that behalf, the matter was, by an order in council of the Dominion Government, made the subject of a communication with the Government of the province of Ontario, and by an order in council of that government, bearing date the 31st October, 1874, it was admitted by that government that the proceeds from the ceded territories were then sufficient to entitle the Indians to the increased sum, and while repudiating all liability of the province to be charged with the Indian annuities, it was suggested that this point as to the liability of the province should be either forthwith submitted to the Court of Chancery upon a statement of facts to be concurred in by the governments concerned, or that the Dominion Government should settle with the Indians without prejudice as to what government ought ultimately to pay the proposed increase. Upon this order in council having been communicated to the Government of the Dominion, the suggestion that that government should settle with the Indians in respect of the increased sum claimed, without prejudice to the question of liability to be determined at a future period, was adopted and accepted by the Dominion Government by an order in council of 22nd July, 1875, and accordingly thenceforth the increased annuity, as promised by treaties, has been advanced by the Dominion Government.\nNow, by three several Acts, viz., 54 Vic., ch. 4 of the legislature of the province of Quebec; 54 Vic., ch. 2 of the province of Ontario, and 54 & 55 Vic., ch. 6 of the Parliament of the Dominion of Canada, all three being in identical terms, after reciting therein respectively that certain questions had arisen, or might thereafter arise, in the settlement of the accounts between the Dominion of Canada and the provinces of Ontario and Quebec, both jointly and severally, and between the two provinces, concerning which no agreement had hitherto been arrived at, and that it was advisable that all such questions of account should be referred to arbitration, it was by the said several Acts enacted, among other things, that for the final and conclusive determination of such accounts, the governments of the respective provinces and of the Dominion might unite in the appointment of three arbitrators, to whom should be submitted such questions as the Governor General and the Lieutenant-Governors of the said provinces should agree to submit; that the arbitrators, or any two of them, should have power to make one or more awards, and to do so from time to time; that the arbitrators should not be bound to decide according to the strict rules of law or evidence, but might decide upon equitable principles, and when they did proceed on their view of a disputed question of law, the award should set forth the same at the instance of either or any party, and that any award made under the said Acts should be, in so far as it related to disputed questions of law, subject to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada and thence to the Judicial Committee of Her Majesty's Privy Council in case their Lordships were pleased to allow such appeal.\nArbitrators were duly appointed to act in the premises by and on behalf of the Governments of the Dominion of Canada and of the provinces of Ontario and Quebec respectively, under the provisions of the said respective Acts in that behalf. Thereupon an agreement was made and entered into between the said respective governments through their respective counsel acting in their behalf, and bearing date the 10th day of April, 1893, which agreement, as an agreement of submission to arbitration, they recommended for adoption by the said respective governments. By this agreement after reciting the above mentioned statutes and that arbitrators had been appointed in pursuance of the provisions thereof, and that\nit is intended by these presents to define and agree upon certain questions in difference which shall be submitted to the said arbitrators for their determination and award.\nNow, therefore, it is agreed by and between the several governments, parties hereto, that the following questions as mentioned in the order of the Governor General in Council of the twelfth day of December, eighteen hundred and ninety, be and they are hereby referred to the said arbitrators for their determination and award in accordance with the said statutes, namely:\n1. All questions relating to or incident to the accounts between the Dominion and the provinces of Ontario and Quebec, and to accounts between the two provinces of Ontario and Quebec.\n2. The accounts are understood to include the folio wing particulars:\nHere follow several particulars, including the following paragraphs, lettered \"d\" and \"e.\"\nd. The claims made by the Dominion Government on behalf of the Indians and payments made by the government to Indians to form part of the reference.\ne. The arbitrators to apportion the liability of Ontario and Quebec as to any claim allowed the Dominion Government, and to apportion between Ontario and Quebec any amount found to be payable by the said government.\nThis agreement of submission was approved and adopted by order in council of the Government of the province of Quebec, bearing date the 13 th day of April, 1893, and by orders in council of the Government of the province of Ontario and of the Dominion of Canada bearing date respectively the 15th day of April, 1893.\nThis submission referred to the award of the arbitrators, as a matter concerning which no agreement had been arrived at at the time of the passing of the said several statutes passed in the 54th and 55th years of Her Majesty's reign, and therefore as being within the province and operation of those statutes, the determination of the claim made by the Indians of Lake Huron and Lake Superior in 1873 for an increase of $2.40 per head in their number under the provisions of the above treaties of 1850. In such submission were involved two questions, namely: 1. Whether and when first the increase claimed had become due and payable; and 2, assuming it to have become due and payable within the terms of the treaties by what government and out of what fund it was to be paid. Upon the arbitration the Government of Ontario insisted, among other things, that in point of fact the lands ceded by the treaties have not produced revenues sufficient to permit of the payment of the augmentation claimed by the Indians or any part thereof; and even though the revenues so received should prove to be sufficient for that purpose, denied all liability upon the Ontario Government to pay the increase claimed or any part thereof either conjointly with Quebec, or separately.\nAs to these two questions, it was agreed by all the parties to the arbitration, with the approbation of the arbitrators, that this latter question affecting liability to pay, assuming the fund to be sufficient, should be in the first place determined, leaving the question of fact as to whether the liability had accrued and when first, and the amounts so accrued due and payable, to be subsequently entered into; accordingly, the arbitrators in the exercise of the authority vested in them by the said statutes in virtue of which they were acting to make one or more awards from time to time, in respect of these matters have in an award made by them awarded adjudged and determined:\n1. That if in any year since the treaties in question were entered into the territory thereby ceded produced an amount which would have enabled the government, without incurring loss, to pay the increased annuities thereby accrued to the Indian tribes mentioned therein, then such tribes were entitled to such increase not exceeding $4 for each individual.\n2. That the total amount of annuities to be paid under each treaty is, in such case, to be ascertained by reference to the number of Indians from time to time belonging to the tribes entitled to the benefit of the treaties. That is, that in case of an increase in the number of Indians beyond the numbers named in such treaties the annuities, if there venues derived from the ceded territory permitted without incurring loss, were to be equal to a sum that would provide $4 to each Indian of the tribes entitled.\n3. That any excess of revenue in any given year may not be used to give the increased annuity in a former year in which an increased annuity could not have been paid without loss, but that any such excess or balance of revenue over expenditure in hand at the commencement of any given year should be carried forward into the account of that year.\n4. That any liability to pay the increased annuity in any year before the union was a debt or liability which devolved upon Canada under the 111th section of the British North America Act, 1867, and this is one of the matters to be taken into account in ascertaining the excess of debt for which Ontario and Quebec are conjointly liable to Canada under the 112th section of the Act; and that Ontario and Quebec have not been in respect of any such liability discharged by reason of the capitalization of the fixed annuities or because of anything in the Act of 1873 (36 Vic. ch. 30).\n5. That interest is not recoverable upon any arrears of such annuities.\n6. That the ceded territories mentioned became the property of Ontario under the 109th section of the British North America Act 1867, subject to a trust to pay the increased annuities on the happening after the union of the event on which such payment depended, and to the interest of the Indians therein to be so paid. That the ultimate burden of making provision for the payment of the increased annuities in question in such an event falls upon the province of Ontario, and that this burden has not been in any way affected or discharged.\n7. That interest is not recoverable upon any arrears of such annuities accruing after the union and not paid by the Dominion to the tribes of Indians entitled.\n8. That in respect of the matters hereinbefore dealt with the arbitrators have proceeded upon their view of disputed questions of law.\n9. That as respects the increased annuities which have been paid by the Dominion to the Indians since the union, any payments properly made are to be charged against the province of Ontario account as of the date of payment by the Dominion to the Indians and so fall within and be affected by our previous ruling as to interest on that account.\nThis award was made on the 14th February, 1895. On the 26th day of March, 1895, an order was made and signed by all the arbitrators in the words following:\nIn the matter of the arbitration between the Dominion of Canada, the province of Ontario and the province of Quebec pursuant to statute of Canada 54 & 55 Vic. ch. 6, statute of Ontario 54 Vic. ch. 2, and statute of Quebec 54 Vic. ch. 4.\nOn motion of counsel for the province of Ontario, and upon hearing what was alleged as well by counsel for the province of Ontario as by counsel for the Dominion of Canada and the province of Quebec, we the undersigned arbitrators do with reference to a certain award and decision dated on the thirteenth and published by us on the fourteenth day of February, eighteen hundred and ninety-five, certify and declare that in respect of the liability of the province of Ontario for the increased annuities which have been paid by the Dominion to the Indians since the union as in such award is mentioned, the arbitrators proceeded upon their view of a disputed question of law; but that in respect of the question of interest upon such increased annuities so paid which question was dealt with in the ninth paragraph of the first part of such award, by determining the time when such annuities should be charged against the province of Ontario, in the province of Ontario account, the majority of the arbitrators did not proceed upon their view of a disputed question of law.\nThe matter in this order contained was thus attached to the said award and the eighth paragraph of the award above cited was inserted for the purpose of complying with the provisions of the statutes above cited in virtue of which the arbitrators were acting, namely:\n6. The arbitrators shall not be bound to decide according to the strict rules of law or evidence, but may decide upon equitable principles, and when they do proceed in their view of a disputed question of law the award shall set forth the same at the instance of either or any party. Any award made under this Act shall be, in so far as it relates to disputed questions of law, subject to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada and thence to the Judicial Committee of Her Majesty's Privy Council, in case their Lordships are pleased to allow such appeal.\nThe award does not state in terms any disputed question of law upon which the arbitrators proceeded, their dealing with which might be subjected to appeal. The question which was in dispute was simply the liability imposed by the sixth paragraph of the award upon the province of Ontario to pay all sums by way of increased annuities, if any such had accrued due and payable, by force of the stipulations in the said treaties of 1850 in the several or any of the years subsequent to the union in 1861 We were repeatedly informed by the learned counsel for the appellants, the province of Ontario, during the argument that this is the sole matter at present in appeal. No question therefore arises before us as to the liability imposed by the 4th paragraph of the award upon Ontario and Quebec conjointly in respect of any such sums by way of increased annuities if any accrued due and payable under the stipulations of the treaties between the making of them and the treaty of union in 1867. Any such sums which so had accrued due and payable prior to the union may well be held to have constituted part of the debt of the province of Canada existing at the union.\nNow, by the treaty of union, the Dominion of Canada assumed the debts and liabilities of Canada existing at the union subject to the provision and condition that Ontario and Quebec conjointly should be liable to the Dominion of Canada for the amount, if any, by which the debt of the province of Canada exceeded at the union sixty-two millions five hundred thousand dollars, and should be charged with interest at the rate of five per centum per annum thereon. The sole obligation which in substance was incurred absolutely by the Dominion in the union, was the assumption of the debt of the province of Canada existing at the union and the liability to pay such interest, if any, as the province of Canada was subject to at the union in respect of so much of the debt of that province existing at the union as exceeded the said sum of sixty-two millions five hundred thousand dollars. Now by a Dominion Act passed in 1873, 36 Vic. ch. 30, after reciting therein that the debt of the late province of Canada as then ascertained exceeded the said sum by the sum of ten millions five hundred and six thousand and eighty-eight dollars and eighty-four cents, enacted that, in the accounts between the several provinces of Canada and the Dominion the amounts payable to and chargeable against the said provinces respectively, in so far as they depend upon the amount of debt with which each province entered the union, should be calculated and allowed as if the sum fixed by the 112th section of the British North America Act, 1867, was increased from sixty-two millions five hundred' thousand dollars to seventy-three millions six thousand and eighty-eight dollars and eighty-four cents.\nThis Act is not to be construed as a statutory declaration by Parliament binding upon the Dominion Government that the total debt of the province of Canada existing at the union was the sum of $73,006,088.84, and no more, but reciting that so far as then ascertained, the debt of the province of Canada exceeded $62,500,680 by $10,506,088.84, and the true construction of the Act is that the accounts between the Dominion and the provinces of Ontario and Quebec shall be taken as if the sum of $73,006,088.84 had been inserted in the 112th section of the British North America Act, 1867, instead of the amount which was therein inserted, thus making that section for the purpose of taking said accounts read as follows: \"Ontario and Quebec conjointly shall be liable to Canada for the amount, if any, by which the debt of the province of Canada exceeds at the union $73,006,088.84, and shall be charged with interest at the rate of five per centum per annum thereon.\"\nAs the object of the Act was simply to subject the Dominion Government to a greater burden than it had assumed by the treaty of union, there can be no doubt that it was quite competent for the Dominion Parliament to pass the Act so altering the effect of the 112th section of the British North America Act. Now it is sufficiently obvious, I think, that if any debt or liability to pay to the Indians, parties to the treaties of 1850, by any augmentation in their annuities under the stipulations of those treaties, has accrued in any of the years subsequent to confederation, such cannot be held to have constituted a debt or liability of the late province of Canada, which ceased to exist upon confederation being accomplished, much less can it be said to have constituted a debt or liability of the late province of Canada existing at the union. True it is, no doubt, that the treaties in virtue of the stipulations of which such debt or liability, if any there be accrued, were entered into prior to confederation, but these treaties did not in themselves, nor did anything contained in them or either of them, constitute a debt or liability upon the late province of Canada to pay any sum of money by way of augmentation of the fixed annuities stipulated for therein respectively. By the terms of the treaties no augmentation of the fixed annuities stipulated for was to take place in any year unless, nor until, the following conditions should concur:\n1st. That the territories respectively ceded by the treaties should produce such an amount as would enable the Government of the then province of Canada, without incurring loss, to increase the annuity from time to time to an amount not exceeding one pound provincial currency in any one year, or such further sum as Her Majesty might be graciously pleased to order; and\n2nd. That the number of the Indians entitled to the benefit of the respective treaties should amount to two-thirds of their number at the time of the treaties being entered into, and mentioned in the respective treaties. If the number of Indians benefited by the respective treaties should in any year fall short of two-thirds of the number mentioned in the respective treaties, no augmentation of annuity in such year accrued. The concurrence of these conditions being necessary to entitle the Indians, parties to the respective treaties, to any augmentation in their annuities in any year, no debt or liability, nor any claim under the stipulations of the treaties could accrue save in each particular year as it should come into existence, and in which those conditions should concur. No augmentation, therefore, claimed as having accrued due in any year subsequent to confederation can by possibility be held to have constituted a debt or liability of the late province of Canada, which province ceased to exist before the accruing of such debt or liability, much less a debt or liability of that province existing at the union. And the case, therefore, is not one which in any respect falls within the 111th or 112th sections of the British North America Act, 1867. Consequently the claims of the Indians to any augmentation in their annuities in respect of the years subsequent to confederation and all liability in respect thereof must be determined and adjudicated upon, either under the provisions of some other clause in that Act or upon some principle of law and justice applicable to a point or question which, it may be, is not in express terms covered by the Act.\nNow, as has been already observed, what Her Majesty, according to the true construction of the treaties, was graciously pleased to undertake and promise was, that the augmentation of annuities which, if any, should accrue due and payable within the stipulations of the respective treaties should be paid to the Indians, parties thereto, respectively out of the proceeds of the respective territories ceded. No other fund was contemplated out of which such augmentations should be paid, and the promise did certainly not operate as imposing a personal obligation upon Her Majesty. The condition then in which the matter stood prior to confederation, was that while Her Majesty was seized in fee in right of Her Crown of the lands mentioned in the territories as ceded to Her Majesty, she held the same for the benefit of the province of Canada, to be sold and disposed of by Her Government of that province as the property of that province, and notwithstanding that letters patent of the said lands granted by the Government of Canada would pass an absolute title in fee simple to the grantees thereof, still Her Majesty's gracious undertaking and promise in the treaties as to the augmentation of the annuities constituted a trust assumed by Her Majesty in the interest of the Indians to the fulfilment of which Her Government of the province of Canada, so long as that province existed, was in conscience bound. Now by union of the British North America provinces into the Dominion of Canada, upon the completion of which the province of Canada ceased to exist, it was enacted by the 109th section of the British North America Act, 1867, that \"all lands, &c., belonging to the province of Canada at the union, and all sums then due and payable for such lands, &c., shall belong to the several provinces of Ontario, &c., in which the same are situate, or arise subject to any trust existing in respect thereof, and to any interest other than that of the province in the same.\"\nHer Majesty's undertaking and promise constituted a trust obligation existing in respect of the proceeds arising out of the ceded territories which, until the union, belonged to the late province of Canada, and in the fulfilment of such obligation the Indians', parties to the treaties, had an undoubted interest. The above clause in the British North America Act was never framed with intent to provide for the case of a trust capable of recognition in a court of law or equity, as being attached to the lands themselves so as to affect a purchaser with notice, as contended by the learned counsel for Ontario. The estate of Her Majesty in the ungranted lands of the Crown in the province never were, nor were supposed to be nor indeed could be, subject to any such trust, but the undertaking of Her Majesty in the treaties, constituting as it did a trust obligation assumed by Her Majesty in respect of the proceeds of the ceded territories, the language of the section appears to be quite appropriate to the expression in the Act of a provision, in accordance with the principles of law, equity and common sense, that the fund out of which the augmentation in the annuities were contemplated to be paid by the treaties should, after the union equally as before, provide for the payment of any augmentations which should accrue due and payable after the union. And as by the 109th section of the British North America Act the province has become entitled to that fund, Her Majesty's government of that province must take the same subject to the trust obligation in the interest of the Indians assumed by Her Majesty by the stipulations of the treaties. Her Majesty's government of the province of Ontario must in all reason and justice take the property mentioned in the section subject to the same obligation as to the payment of augmentations of the annuities, if any such accrue due after the union, as the late province of Canada would have held them if no union had taken place. This was the unanimous judgment of the arbitrators upon this point. That judgment is not at variance with any principle of law, or any statutory provision; on the contrary it is in perfect accordance with the plainest principles of justice and is not open to any sound legal objection.\nIt was argued that the question under appeal had already been concluded by a paragraph in an award between the province and the Dominion made in 1870. The clause of that award relied upon for the above purpose by the province of Ontario is as follows:\n13. That all lands in either of the said provinces of Ontario and Quebec respectively, surrendered by the Indians in consideration of annuities to them granted which said annuities are included in the debt of the late province of Canada, shall be the absolute property of the province in which the said lands are respectively situate free from any further claim upon or charge to the said provinces in which they are situate by the other of the said provinces.\nNow as to this clause in that award it is to be observed:\n1. The submission by the Government of the province of Ontario by the order in council referring the very question under consideration to the present arbitrators as a question as to which no agreement had hitherto been arrived at, seems to afford answer to the contention that the matter had been disposed of by the award of 1870.\n2. The present case is not for the determination of or adjudication upon any claim made by any of the provinces against the province of Ontario, but for the determination of and adjudication upon the single question as to where exists the liability to discharge the obligation assumed by Her Majesty in the interest of the. Indians to pay any increased annuities stipulated for by the treaties of 1850 which have accrued due and payable since the ceded territories became by the union the property of the province of Ontario.\n3. As already shown, augmentations so accruing since the union did not in point of fact form and indeed could not have formed, any part of the debt of the late province of Canada mentioned in 36 Vic. ch. 30 as then ascertained as being $73,006,088.84; the fixed annuities only as the only sums then known to exist as a debt of liability of Canada were included in that sum. 4. There seems therefore, to be no foundation whatever for the contention that the question now under consideration involves a matter concluded by the award of 1870.\nThe determination of the question by the present arbitrators is in conformity with every principle of justice and with the provisions of the 109th section of the British North America Act which seem to be indeed simply declaratory of what law and justice would have required if the clause had not been inserted in the Act, namely, that the proceeds of the ceded territories should bear the burden of discharging Her Majesty's obligation to the Indians under the stipulations of the treaties as to any augmentation of annuities, if any have accrued due under the treaties since the union, whereby the ceded territories became the property of Ontario.\nThe award, therefore, must be maintained, and the appeal dismissed with costs.\nSEDGEWICK J.\u2014It is admitted, but only for the purpose of this appeal, that the Indians in question are entitled to be paid the augmented annuities which they have been receiving since 1874. It is not, however, admitted by the appellant province that there is any liability on the part of that province to pay these annuities, and it contends that should it in any way be found liable it is only liable conjointly with the province of Quebec. The questions are, first: Do the annuities in question constitute a debt or liability under section 112 of the British North America Act? And secondly: If such liability exists, shall it be borne by Ontario and Quebec jointly or by Ontario alone? The first contention was but feebly put forward by counsel for Ontario, and I must confess that I see no ground for giving it any weight. By the scheme of the Union Act, Canada was to become liable for the debts and liabilities of the confederating provinces, in other words, she entered into an obligation to liquidate and satisfy all provincial creditors. The scheme, however, did not contemplate that the Dominion was to commence its existence with an indebtedness measured by the full extent of provincial liability. As between the Dominion and the provinces the public debt of Canada was fixed at $77,500,000; $62,500,000 being the amount absolutely assumed on behalf of Ontario and Quebec, and $8,000,000 and $7,000,000 on behalf of Nova Scotia and New Brunswick respectively, and it was provided that, should the debt of the old province of Canada exceed the $62,500,000, assumed by the Dominion, those provinces should be liable to Canada for that excess, with interest at five per cent per annum. No similar provision was made in regard to Nova Scotia or New Brunswick, inasmuch as the debts of those provinces did not amount to the sums assumed on their behalf by the Dominion. It is very clear that the Dominion entered upon its national existence with a fixed and indisputable debt. While it was under an obligation to pay all existing provincial debts or liabilities, no matter how large or how much in excess of the $77,500,000 they might eventually be found to be, it had a right to recoup itself by calling upon Ontario and Quebec to make good the difference between the actual indebtedness and the net amount which as between the provinces and itself it undertook to pay. The actual amount of that excess has never yet been definitely ascertained. By the Dominion Act of 1873, the $62,500,000 assumed by the Dominion on behalf of Ontario and Quebec was increased to $73,006,088.84, but even that increased amount does not fully represent the liabilities of the old province, and it is \u043e\u0434\u0435 of the objects of the tribunal from whose award this appeal is taken, to determine definitely the exact amount of that excess in order that there may be a complete and final adjustment of accounts between the Dominion and these provinces.\nNow, the annuities payable to Indians by virtue of pre-confederation treaties made with them, having in view the surrender of the Indian title to the Crown in any public lands, clearly constituted a liability on the part of the old province of Canada, which liability was assumed by the Dominion under the British North America Act. The argument is, that section 112, in making Ontario and Quebec liable for the excess of debt beyond the $62,500,000, does not make it liable for pre-existing liabilities which are not debts, and that the annuities in question, though they are liabilities, do not come within the meaning of that expression. As already stated, I dissent from this view. These annuities, though perhaps not debts in the strict sense of that term until they become due, are debts immediately thereafter, but whether or not, they are, in my judgment, debts within the contemplation of section 112, for which the provinces are liable. It may not have much bearing on the case, but it is proper to notice that in the award made in pursuance of section 142 of the Union Act, clause 13 expressly states that these annuities, or that portion of them which was fixed by the original treaties \"are included in the debt of the old province of Canada.\" I entertain no doubt but that this is the correct view, and that in the adjusting of the accounts between the Dominion and the old province of Canada, the annuities payable to the Indians since the 1st of July, 1867, whether these annuities are to be augmented as therein provided for, or remain as originally fixed, constitute a liability or debt which the old provinces, Whether Ontario alone, or Ontario and Quebec jointly, must assume. The other question involved in this appeal is a more difficult one. Is Ontario alone liable for these annuities, or is it conjointly liable with Quebec? The matter, as I view it, is of no significance to the Dominion. It is solely a question as between Ontario and Quebec. The case, however, is put forward by the Dominion insisting that Ontario is solely liable. I extract from its statement of claim the following:\n9. The Dominion of Canada claims that under the \"Robinson Huron Treaty\" and the \"Robinson Superior Treaty\" for the 16 years from the dates of the said treaties until the date of confederation of the provinces in 1867, and based upon the increased annuity of $4 per head, and after giving credit for the sum of $1.60 which was yearly paid to each individual Indian during the' said period, there is due and payable by the late province of Canada to the Indians aforesaid the sum of $325,440 for principal money and interest, and the Dominion asks the board to award payment of the said sum by the said province of Canada.\n10. By the British North America Act, 1867, the tracts of land which had been ceded to Her Majesty, under the said Robinson treaties, became and formed portions of the public lands of the province of Ontario.\n11. By the 111th section of that statute it is enacted that \"Canada shall be liable for the debts and liabilities of each province existing at the time of the union, and by the 109th section it is provided that \"all lands, mines, minerals and royalties belonging to the several provinces of Canada, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick at the time of the union, and all sums then due and payable for such lands, mines, minerals and royalties, shall belong to the several provinces of Ontario, Quebec, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick in which the same are situate, or arise, subject to any trusts existing in respect thereof, or to any interest other than that of the province in the same.\"\n12. The Dominion submits that at the time of confederation the lands which had been ceded by the said Indians, under the said treaties as aforesaid, came into the bands and possession of Ontario subject to the trusts contained in the said treaties and subject to \"an interest other than that of the province in the same\" within the meaning of said section 109, namely, the right of the Indians to receive and be paid the annuities under the terms and stipulations of the said treaties, and that from and after the 30th June, 1867, the province of Ontario, as the beneficial owner of the said lands, and recipient of the revenues derived therefrom, was legally liable to provide the Dominion with moneys necessary to pay the said annuities to the Indians under the said treaties. 13. By section 91 of the British North America Act, the Parliament of Canada is given legislative authority over \"Indians and lands reserved for Indians,\" and the Dominion acting under said authority has enacted laws for the government of the Indians of Canada, and has undertaken the administration of, and has since the passing of the said act administered, the affairs of the Indians throughout Canada.\n14. The Dominion submits that it was and is the duty of the province of Ontario to pay into the Dominion treasury, out of moneys received as revenues from the lauds which were ceded as aforesaid, such sums as would enable the Dominion to carry out the provisions and requirements of the said treaties; but the province of Ontario has hitherto declined to admit any liability, and has paid no sum to the Dominion for the purposes aforesaid, although often requested to do so, and although it has been admitted by the said province of Ontario that the revenues received by the said province out of the said ceded territory have been more than sufficient for many years past to have satisfied the claims of the said Indians to be paid the full increased annuities mentioned in the said treaties of $4 for each individual Indian.\n15. From the year 1867 until the year 1875, the Dominion annually paid to and distributed amongst the said Indians the annuities of $2,400 and $2,000 mentioned in the said treaties respectively, and the Dominion now claims on behalf of the Indians, for the reasons above set out, that the province of Ontario ought to pay all arrears of annuities since the 30th June, 1867, made up of the difference between the sum of \u00a71.60 and the sum of $4 for each individual Indian, which arrears of annuity with interest thereon from the 30th June, 1867, to the 31st December, 1892, amount to the sum of $95,200, and the Dominion asks the board to award payment of the said sum by the province of Ontario.\n16. Since the year 1875 the Dominion, for the reasons before mentioned, has paid in each year up to and including the year 1892, the full increased annuity of $4 to each individual Indian within the said treaties, and the Dominion now claims to recover from, and be paid by, the province of Ontario the sum so paid, which sum with interest thereon amounts to the sum of |389,106.80.\nQuebec supports the Dominion view, while Ontario contends upon this point that the case is one in which Quebec is jointly liable with her.\nThe clause of the treaty giving rise to the conflict is as follows: (the clauses are the same in both treaties).\nShould the territory hereby ceded by the parties of the second part at any future period produce such an amount as will enable the government of this province, without incurring loss, to increase the annuity hereby secured to them, then, and in that case, the same shall be augmented from time to time, provided that the amount paid to each individual shall not exceed the sum of one pound provincial currency, in any one year, or such further sum as Her Majesty may be graciously pleased to order, and provided further that the number of Indians entitled to the benefit of the treaty shall amount to two-thirds of their present number, which is fourteen hundred and twenty-two, to entitle them to claim the full benefit thereof. And should they not at any future period amount to two-thirds of fourteen hundred and twenty-two, then the said annuity shall be diminished in proportion to their actual numbers.\nAnd section 109 of the British North America Act referred to in the Dominion case is as follows:\nAll lands, mines, minerals and royalties belonging to the several provinces of Canada, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick at the time of the union and all sums then due and payable for such lands, mines, minerals and royalties shall belong to the several provinces of Ontario, Quebec, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, in which the same are situate, or arise, subject to any trusts existing in respect thereof, or to any interest other than that of the province in the same.\nNow in my view this section is material for the purposes of this case, only in so far as it transfers to Ontario the Crown lands, &c., within its territorial limits. It does not purport to deal with property or rights or interests other than those of the Crown. As far as I can at present see the section would have been equally effectual for its purpose had the words \"subject to any trusts existing in respect thereof and to any interest other than that of the province in the same\" been left out. The Dominion took those large areas known as \"Ordnance lands\" under section 108. The quantum of the interest which passed by the operation of that section was not greater, and not less, because these words were omitted. In the case of the Crown lands, Ontario took the whole of old Canada's interest\u2014in the case of the Ordnance lands the Dominion took the whole of the old provinces' interest\u2014private rights in both cases remaining undisturbed. The section is, however, material in so far as it operates as a transfer. There is a principle referred to by the learned Chancellor that where in ordinary cases a vendor sells lands charged with a mortgage or other burden in respect to which he the vendor is under a personal obligation the purchaser takes them not only subject to that burden, but subject, too, to the duty of indemnifying the vendor in respect to his obligation, and that too irrespective of contract. In other words the law imposes upon the buyer the duty of discharging the burden, and, as between him and the seller, relieves the latter from it. And this principle has been more than once recognized by this court. Williston v. Lawson[19], Fraser v. Fairbanks[20].\nThen too, there is the principle expressed in the maxim qui sentit commodum sentire debit et onus. If a person accept anything which he knows to be subject to a duty or charge it is rational to conclude that he means to take such duty or charge upon himself, and the law may very well imply a promise to perform what he has so taken upon himself[21].\nOn the whole I am of opinion that if the lands in question or the proceeds of those lands are burdened by the operation of the Indian treaties, if they have been put in pledge or hypothecated in order to render more secure the stipulated annuities, if the Indians have in them a property right whether legal or equitable capable of being enforced or adjudicated upon by petition of right or otherwise in a court of justice, then Ontario having under the Union Act taken these lands she has taken them subject to this burden, and is therefore bound to relieve Quebec therefrom.\nBut the question still remains: Do these treaties as they are called in law create a burden upon or give to the Indians an interest in the lands they purport to cede? Before minutely examining the phraseology of the contract, a few words may be necessary as to some preliminary considerations that should not be lost sight of in endeavouring to arrive at its meaning.\nA self respecting state in dealing with its citizens in matters of contract does not usually give the public property as a security for the fulfilment of its obligations. It gives its promise, it pledges the national faith, but nothing more. A person contracting with it, should he ask more, would so far manifest a distrust in either its good faith or its credit, and a state by yielding to the request would so far admit that such distrust was not wholly groundless. Not during the present century has any powerful civilized state pledged to its subjects state property (crown jewels for example), as security for a national obligation. On the other hand a state may consistently with its dignity pledge its revenues or other property when it takes upon itself the obligations of another state, or when it goes into the foreign money markets to raise money for the purposes of the nation. When in the old provinces the casual and territorial revenues of the Crown were surrendered, and in return they assumed the burdens of the civil list, as well as the other obligations of the Imperial Government previously incurred in connection with the administration of affairs of British North America, the provinces, by special act, pledged the whole of the provincial revenues as security for the performance of such obligations in the case of old Canada including in such secured imperial obligations the annuities payable to Indians under the then existing treaties. That pledge, however, was made, not to or for the benefit of the functionaries or classes mentioned, but to the Crown itself and for its security alone.\nAnother consideration has a bearing on the matter. The contest in this case is not between the Indians on the one hand and the Government on the other; it is in its last analysis a contest between Ontario and Quebec. The principle of generous construction so ably and correctly pointed out by the learned Chancellor would very properly be applicable were it a case of the former kind. Had the rights of the Indians been in question here\u2014were their claims to the increased annuity disputed\u2014did that depend upon some difficult question of construction or upon some ambiguity of language\u2014courts should make every possible intendment in their favour and to that end. They would with the consent of the Crown and of all of our governments strain to their utmost limit all ordinary rules of construction or principles of law\u2014the governing motive being that in all questions between Her Majesty and \"Her faithful Indian allies\" there must be on her part, and on the part of those who represent her, not only good faith, but more, there must be not only justice, but generosity. The wards of the nation must have the fullest benefit of every possible doubt.\nBut I do not see that where the question is solely between the two provinces these high ethical doctrines should have weight. It is one thing from motives of grace or from a sense of moral obligation to do more than justice to the Indian races. It is quite another thing in the construction of a legal instrument to give weight to these motives in favour of one province at the expense of another, especially when these races are in no way benefited thereby.\nIn my view this contract is in the present controversy to be read like any other contract as between parties who are sui juris, and dealing with each other at arms' length.\nAnother question is involved. It is in my view immaterial whether the treaties give to the Indians an interest in the ceded lands themselves or in the proceeds of those lands. The authorities, I think, clearly establish the proposition that under the Statute of Frauds and the Statutes of Mortmain, and similar statutes, an interest in the proceeds of the sales of lands is an interest in the lands themselves. Leach, Vice-Chancellor, in Attorney-General v. Hanley[22], thus expresses it:\nThat money to arise from the sale of land is an interest in land admits of no doubt.\nIn the well-known case of Jeffries v. Alexander[23], the House of Lords, although divided in opinion, so held. In that case Mr. Justice Blackburn (one of the six learned judges who gave their opinion)[24] says:\nBut the devise of land to be sold on the bequest of the mortgage money does actually give the objects of the bounty of the testator an equitable interest on the land which is to be sold, or in the mortgaged estate, and therefore is within the very words of the statute a gift of an interest in land.\nAnd so the late Master of the Bolls held in Lacey v. Hill[25]; and Mr. Justice Kay in Re Thomas. Thomas v. Howell[26]. Nor was any different rule laid down in this court in the case of Stuart v. Mott[27], as I understand that case.\nI now come to the treaty itself, and the question is as to the effect of these words:\nShould the territory hereby ceded at any future period produce such an amount as will enable the Government, without incurring loss, to increase the annuity hereby secured to them (the Indians), then, and in that case, the same shall be augmented.\nNow there is here no express creation of a charge, whether upon the lands or upon their proceeds. Are we to read into or add to this stipulation what, it is argued, it impliedly contains \"and the lands hereby ceded, or the proceeds thereof, after deducting cost of. administration, is hereby charged with the payment of such augmented annuities\"?\nIf we are, then I think the Indians have an interest and Ontario is bound to discharge it. But is that the true meaning of the contract? Was that the intention of the parties? Did the Indians, in consideration of the cession, get the personal obligation of the Crown plus an interest in the proceeds of the ceded lands to bolster it up as it were and make it more binding, or did they get that obligation only?\nLet me consider the case had this provision as to the augmented annuities been left out. In that case the Indians would have been entitled to a perpetual annuity of \u00a31,100. As to this sum there are no words from which it could possibly be implied that any property was to be pledged as security for its payment. The only security was the personal covenant of the Sovereign. The Indians do not appear to have asked\u2014the idea of implementing that covenant by further pledges never seems to have been contemplated or suggested. Then, when in the course of the negotiations the question of augmentation came up and was settled in the manner specified, was it the intention either of the Indians or the Crown that their rights to the increased annual sum should be secured not only by the Crown's covenant, but by the pledging of the property as well? Let us suppose that in the case of the fixed annuity some Sachem\u2014wise above his fellows\u2014had suggested: \"We are giving up our lands and you are giving us \u00a34,000 and our reserves, but what security have we that you will pay us to the end of time the eleven hundred pounds a year? Give us a mortgage as security.\" Would not the answer have been refusal\u2014a kindly one it may be, but an explanation that the Queen Mother did not so deal with her children\u2014that they must take her at her word or not at all? And were the same suggestion made when the other question came up, would not the same answer be given? For my part I cannot bring myself to think that it was ever within the contemplation of the parties that as security for payment the Indians were to have a charge upon the proceeds of the ceded lands.\nWhat does the word \"interest\" mean whether used in a statute or according to the common law? As I understand it, it means such a right in or to a thing capable of being possessed or enjoyed as property which can be enforced by judicial proceedings. One may be interested in a property but have no legal interest in it. If he has a legal interest he can enforce it against the property. If in the present case the lands in question are burdened with the charge the Indians have such an interest in their proceeds as will enable them to follow the moneys no matter where they are or to whom paid, they have a property right in the moneys themselves indefeasible, indestructible, which the State must acknowledge and to which the courts must give effect.\nIn the present case the Indians, I admit, are interested in these lands in the sense that the augmentation of the annuities wholly depends upon what they will sell for but not in the sense that they have any right in or to the proceeds of such sales no matter what they amount to.\nThey have no \"interest\" in these proceeds. The treaty might have made the augmentation dependent or conditional upon the happenings of any other uncertain future event, the increased or diminished population of the tribe at a given time for instance, or the going of one of their number to Rome on a certain day. But it is the event alone they are interested in. If circumstances so combine as to produce the event then the money becomes payable. I admit too that were it a matter of contention as to whether the determining event had happened it would be necessary on the part of the Indians to have an inquiry as to the amounts realized from the sale of the ceded lands; but that inquiry would be necessary not for the purpose of obtaining a declaration that the Indians were entitled to be paid therefrom but for the purpose of establishing whether the determining event had happened and the consequent liability of the Crown upon its personal covenant.\nThe question has been presented to us as a pure matter of law. I have been unable to find that as a matter of law the Indians have any charge upon or interest in the lands ceded by the treaties in question or that these lands or their proceeds are subject to any interest or trust by reason of such treaties. They have therefore become the absolute property of Ontario.\nIt was further contended that the question was settled in favour of Ontario by the operation of clause 13 of the award under the British North America Act of the 3rd of September, 1870. If clause one of that award be read with clause 13 then it seems to me that that contention is correct. I have already stated that in my view the moneys payable under the Robinson treaties whether upon the original or the augmented basis was a debt or liability of the old province of Canada at the time of the union, that the whole of that liability was assumed by Canada, she thereby becoming responsible to the Indians therefor, and that (subject to the principal question in this appeal) Ontario and Quebec conjointly are liable therefor to the Dominion as a portion of that excess of debt referred to in section 112. Now under section 142 of the British North America Act the division of the debts and liabilities of Upper Canada and Lower Canada was to be referred to the arbitration therein specified, and that arbitration was held and an award made. That award did not purport to determine the amount of such debts or liabilities. It did, however, purport to divide that amount and to fix the proportion to be borne by Ontario and Quebec respectively. Clause 1 of the award specifies that proportion, Ontario being declared liable to pay such a proportion of the excess as the sum of $9,888,7.28.02 bears to the sum of $18,587,520.57 and Quebec being declared liable to pay such a proportion as the sum of $8,778,792.55 bears to the same sum; or, approximately, Ontario is to pay five-ninths and Quebec four-ninths of the old province's liabilities. It appears to me that both provinces are still bound by this award and that this finding determines the question involved in this appeal. It is a finding that Quebec as well as Ontario is liable to recoup the Dominion on account of these Indian annuities and it determines the proportions to be borne by each.\nKING J.\u2014The question is whether Ontario alone, or jointly with Quebec, is liable to be charged in account with the Dominion with the amounts paid by the Dominion since the union in satisfaction of increased annuities payable to certain Indian tribes under the Robinson treaties of 1850.\nIt is held by the arbitrators that the amounts are chargeable against Ontario alone.\nIn the year 1850 it was deemed advisable by Her Majesty's Government to extinguish Indian rights in and over extensive districts on the shores of Lakes Huron and Superior occupied by tribes of the Ojibeways and it was in accordance with practice that the conclusions should take the form of a treaty between Her Majesty and the chiefs and principal men representing the tribes. Treaties were concluded by Mr. Robinson acting on behalf of the Queen, which in the provisions material to the present inquiry are alike.\nIt was declared (citing from the Huron treaty):\nThat for and in consideration of the sum of \u00a32,000 currency * * to them in hand paid, and for the further perpetual annuity of \u00bf\u00a3600 (\u00a3500 in the case of the Superior treaty) * * * they the said chiefs and principal men, on behalf of their respective tribes or bands, do hereby fully, freely and voluntarily surrender, cede,, grant and convey unto Her Majesty, her heirs and successors for ever, all their right, title and interest to and in the whole of the territory (saving and excepting certain reservations), and the said William Benjamin Robinson on behalf of Her Majesty and the Government of the province hereby promises and agrees to make or cause to be made the payments as above mentioned, and further to allow the said chiefs and their tribes the full and free privilege to hunt over the territory now ceded to them, and to fish in the waters thereof as they have hitherto been in the habit of doing, saving and excepting such portions of the said territory as may from time to time be sold or leased to individuals or companies of individuals, and occupied by them with the consent of the provincial government.\nThere was then this further stipulation:\nThe said William Benjamin Robinson, on behalf of Her Majesty, who desires to deal liberally and justly with all her subjects, further promises and agrees that, should the territory hereby ceded by the parties of the second part at any future period produce such an amount as will enable the government of this province without incurring loss to increase the annuity hereby secured to them, then and in that case the sum shall be augmented from to time provided that the amount paid to each individual shall not exceed the sum of one pound currency in any one year, or such further sum as Her Majesty may be graciously pleased to order, and provided further that the number of Indians entitled to the benefit of this treaty shall amount to two-thirds of their present number which is 1422 (in the Lake Superior case 1240), to entitle them to claim the full benefit thereof. And should they at any future period not amount to two-thirds then, the said annuity shall be diminished in proportion to their actual numbers.\nAt and before the passing of the British North America Act, 1867 (and at and before the making of the cession), the casual and territorial revenues from the Crown lands of Canada had been granted by the Imperial Government to the province of Canada. The effect of this was that the lands were thereafter held by the Crown in right of the province of Canada.\nThen came the union in 1867. By sec. 109 of the British North America Act, it was enacted that\nall lands, mines, minerals and royalties belonging to the several provinces of Canada, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick at the union, and all sums then due or payable for such lands, mines, minerals and royalties, shall belong to the several provinces of Ontario, Quebec, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick in which the same are situate or arise subject to any trusts existing in respect thereof, and to any interest other than that of the province in the same.\nSecs. 111 and 112 are as follows:\n111. Canada shall be liable for the debts and liabilities of each province existing at the union.\n112. Ontario and Quebec conjointly shall be liable to Canada for the amount (if any) by which the debt of the province of Canada exceeds at the union sixty-two million five hundred thousand dollars, and shall be charged with interest at the rate of 5 per cent per annum thereon.\nIn the accounts heretofore adjusted and settled the fixed annuities under the above treaties have been regarded as a portion of the debt of the province of Canada, and the provinces of Ontario and Quebec have been charged with a capital sum sufficient to yield such annuities according to the terms of the award of 1870, made under the provisions of section 114 of the British North America Act. These fixed annuities were regularly paid by the Dominion Government, as having the administration of Indian affairs. As for the augmented annuities, nothing was paid in respect of them, either by the old province of Canada or by the Dominion Government, until about the year 1874, when a claim for them was made on behalf of the tribes. The Dominion Government becoming satisfied that the increased amounts were properly payable (as seems to be the fact) paid over the same, upon an understanding with the provinces that, the question of ultimate responsibility as between the different governments should be afterwards settled.\nThe present arbitration is for the purpose of settling (amongst other questions of account and claims) \"the claims made by the Dominion Government on behalf of the Indians.\"\nUpon that portion of this claim involved in the present appeal, viz., the claim for payment of increased annuities for the period subsequent to the union, the arbitrators have found (par. 6):\nThat the ceded territory mentioned became the property of Ontario under the 109th section of the British North America Act, 1867, subject to a trust to pay the increased annuities on the happening after the union of the event on which such payment depended, and to the interest of the Indians therein to be so paid. That the ultimate burden of making provision for the payment of the increased annuities in question in such event falls upon the province of Ontario, and that this burden has not been in any way affected or discharged.\nThe arbitrators declare in their award that these conclusions proceed upon their view of disputed questions of law, the effect of which is, by the statute, to render them appealable.\nIn the reasons given by the learned Chancellor, concurred in by the other learned judges, it is held, in conformity with decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States, that treaties with the aborigines are to receive a generous interpretation in favour of them as public wards of the nation. Approaching it in this spirit, the learned Chancellor concludes that although the mere words used do not say that the increased annuity is to be paid out of the proceeds of the land, still that in his opinion, is the plain and reasonable implication.\nUpon the appeal the province of Ontario contests the position that the lands passed to it subject to any trust in respect of it, or to any interest in the Indians so far as relates to the claim in question. It is further contended that, as by section 111 the Dominion assumed the \"debts and liabilities\" of the old province of Canada, and by section 112 the provinces of Ontario and Quebec are liable over to the Dominion only for the excess of \"debt\" over $62,500,000, the effect of this is that the augmentations becoming payable after the union are to be assumed by the Dominion, under section 111, as a \"liability\" existing at the union, while they are not a \"debt\" under section 112 to be taken into account in calculating the excess of debt for which Ontario and Quebec are conjointly responsible over to the Dominion.\nIt was further claimed that if the amounts are to be charged against the provinces at all, it must be against both Ontario and Quebec jointly in the proportion fixed by the award of 1870, and not against Ontario alone.\nIn the second of the above contentions the province of Quebec joins.\nNow, first, respecting such contention, it is to be noted that, while section 111 uses both words \"debts\" and \"liabilities,\" section 112 does not use either of them, but instead, the comprehensive word \"debt\":\nOntario and Quebec conjointly shall be liable to Canada for the amount (if any) by which the debt of the province of Canada exceeds at the union the sum of $62,500,000.\nThis general word \"debt\" may very well include all forms of indebtedness, whether ascertained or unascertained, determinate or indeterminate, except so far as particular provisions of the Act impose a limitation.\nThe financial provisions of the scheme of union were manifestly a matter of arrangement between the provinces of old Canada, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick; and while, for the public creditor, the Dominion was to be the paymaster, as between the provinces. and it, the amount of provincial indebtedness which the Dominion, as representing the people of the united provinces as a whole, was to assume was definitely determined and limited by the amount of debt of the several provinces stated to be assumed by it without recourse.\nIt follows, therefore, that the ultimate liability in this case must fall either upon Ontario alone, or upon Ontario conjointly with Quebec according to the ratio fixed by the award of 1870 for the division of the debts and liabilities of the old province of Canada in excess of the sum stated by the Act of 1873.\nThen, as the main question, viz: whether the ceded lands were subject to a trust or interest as claimed. In St. Catharines Milling & Lumber Co. v. The Queen[28], it is laid down that:\nWherever public land with its incidents is described as \"the property\" of or as \"belonging to\" the Dominion or province, these expressions merely import that the right to its beneficial use or to its proceeds has been appropriated to the Dominion or the province (as the case may be) and is subject to the control of the legislature, the land itself being vested in the Crown.\nWhen therefore it is declared that upon the union the lands shall belong to the province in which they are situate, subject to any trust in respect thereof or to any interest other than that of the province in the same, the saving clause extends to trusts or interests affecting the beneficial use of the land, or its proceeds.\nThe question then is: Did the Crown, or the province of old Canada to whose rights Ontario has succeeded, hold the proceeds to be derived from the ceded lands upon any trust to pay to the Indians the augmented annuities?\nThere is no doubt that the Indians were dealt with as though they were possessed of substantial rights which at least imposed a burden upon the lands. In St. Catharines Milling Co, case already alluded to, Lord Watson said that it was not then necessary to express any opinion upon the precise quality of the Indian right, but it was sufficient to say that there has been all along vested in the Crown a substantial and paramount estate underlying the Indian title which became a plenum dominium when that title was surrendered or otherwise extinguished.\nThe consideration to the Indians for the ceding of their rights was threefold, the cash payment, the fixed annuity, and the further annuity up to a certain amount depending upon the proceeds of the lands. Although the promise on the part of the Crown to pay the augmentations is separated from that relating to the fixed annuity and the cash payment, and although it is introduced by reference to the liberal intentions of the Crown, still all that was promised by the Crown constituted the consideration for the act of cession.\nPractically it does not now, and it never did, make any difference to the Indians whether they were declared to have an interest in the proceeds of the land or not. Their assurance of payment would be equal in either case.\nNor, on the other hand, would it practically make any difference to the Crown whether or not the Indians were declared to have such interest in the proceeds. Ex hypothesis the lands were to be sold, and there could be no fetter upon the right to dispose of them.\nThe matter only came to have practical significance when it became necessary to consider the nature of the transaction in relation to the provisions of the British North America Act.\nThe question is to be solved by the light of what is expressed and by the application to it of general principles of law. The law is very considerate of the rights of a vendor of an interest in lands. It proceeds upon the principle that one who has gotten the estate of another ought not, in conscience, as between them, to be allowed to keep it and not to pay the full consideration money. This is a general principle of most systems of law. Hence the lien of the vendor, which is deemed to be based upon a natural equity.\nThis may even exist where the price, or a part of it, is payable in the way of an annuity, but in such case the circumstances may be such as to exclude the notion that the parties could have reasonably contemplated such a lien.\nHere it was manifestly contemplated that the land might be sold, and as there was to be no limit to the continuance of the annuity it would not be reasonable to suppose that there was to exist a perpetual lien.\nBut it was agreed that if the ceded territory should at any future period produce, i.e., from sales, rents, royalties, &c., such an amount as would enable the Government of the province of Canada, without incurring loss, to increase the stated annuity, then the same should be augmented from time to time to an amount not exceeding, in the whole, a payment to each individual of the sum of \u00a31 currency.\nNow this may mean merely that the revenues shall furnish a measure of increased price or be a circumstance to determine whether or not it shall be paid; or, on the other hand, it may mean that a part of the revenue shall go to the Indians by way of increased annuities in a certain event.\nWhere two interpretations of such an agreement are open, one consistent with and the other inconsistent with a provision for the security of the unpaid vendor, it would seem more appropriate to treat it as giving the more effectual security to the unpaid vendor, and more in accordance with the general principles of the law to do so.\nIt would give to the undertaking a more simple and less circuitous operation, and one more in accordance with the natural meaning of the language, to construe it as providing that the augmented annuities should be paid out of the fund, the existence of which is the condition and the reason for its payment. Take the words in which the condition is expressed:\nShould the territory produce such an amount as would enable the Government, without incurring loss, to increase the stated annuity.\nIs it not the natural meaning of this that if the territory should produce such an amount as would enable the Government out of it, and without incurring loss, to increase the stated annuity, then etc.? I am inclined to think so. Upon the whole, therefore, but not without doubt, it seems to me that there is a reasonably clear manifestation of an intention to devote a portion of the proceeds of the ceded lands in certain events to the increased annuities.\nIf this is so, it would follow that Ontario, getting the lands subject to the trust, would have to discharge the burden which before that was upon the province of Canada, now represented by the provinces of Ontario and Quebec, unless there is something in the British North America Act, or in some other binding instrument or act, to make it otherwise.\nIt is contended that the award of the arbitrators made in 1870 under the provisions of section 114 of the British North America Act has such effect. By that section it was provided that:\nThe division of the debts, credits, liabilities, properties and assets of Upper Canada and Lower Canada shall be referred to the arbitrament of three arbitrators, one chosen by the Government of Ontario, one by the Government of Quebec, and one by the Government of Canada. In accordance therewith, arbitrators were appointed, and on 3rd September, 1870, their award was made, by paragraph 1 of which it was determined that:\nThe amount by which the debt of the late province of Canada exceeded on the 30th day of June, 1867, $62,500,000, shall be and is hereby divided between, and apportioned to, and shall be borne by the said provinces of Ontario and Quebec respectively, in the following proportion\ni.e., in a certain named ratio.\nBy paragraph 13 it was determined:\nThat all the land's in either of the said provinces of Ontario and Quebec surrendered by the Indians in consideration of annuities to them granted, which said annuities are included in the debt of the late province of Canada, shall be the absolute property of the province in which the said lands are respectively situate, free from any further claim upon or charge to the said province in which they are so situate by the other of the said provinces.\nBefore that tribunal the province of Quebec had contended that the amount at which the fixed annuities had been capitalized should be charged against the province of Ontario upon grounds similar to some of those urged in the present appeal respecting the augmentation of the annuities, but the arbitrators rejected the contention and held as already stated in par. 13 of their award.\nAccordingly, the capitalized amount of the fixed annuities was finally adjusted and settled, and in respect of it Quebec had no right further to contend that it should be dealt with as a charge upon the ceded territory in Ontario, nor would the Dominion have the right so to contend inasmuch as the result of a contrary decision would be to give to Quebec in the ultimate accounting a charge or claim against Ontario in respect of it.\nBut the matter of the augmentation of annuities was not raised before the arbitrators, and if the views herein stated upon the main point are correct, it is apparent that the two things do not rest entirely upon the same foundations. The finding of the arbitrators that the claim as to the fixed annuities that was brought before them did not constitute a charge upon the lands, is therefore not conclusive as to the matters in question here. Par. 13 is to be read in the light of the contention before the arbitrators, and not as an abstract and general denial of all charges, etc., respecting the annuities, but simply as a denial of the lands being subject to the alleged' charge to which it was then claimed to be subject.\nThe result therefore, in my view is, that while the word \"debt\" in the 112th section is comprehensive enough by itself to include a liability for increased annuities becoming payable after the union, this particular liability, or part of the debt, of the late province of Canada is to be regarded as cast upon the province to which by sec. 109 the land is given subject to the burden. I think, therefore, that the appeal should be dismissed.*\n[1] 6 Peters 582. 29\n[2] 119 U, S. R. at p. 27.\n[3] 34 Ch.

Taschereau and Gwynne JJ. dissenting.\nAPPEAL from the decision of the Supreme Court of British Columbia affirming the judgment for plaintiff at the trial.\nThe facts of this case, which are fully set out in the judgments delivered on this appeal, may be briefly stated as follows :\nThe plaintiff, Wolley, having money to invest, took the advice of one of the members of defendants' firm who offered him an investment, which was described as \" gilt-edged and first-class.\" The security offered was a mortgage on farm property at some distance from Victoria, British Columbia, where the brokers carried on business. The member of the firm with whom plaintiff dealt was not personally acquainted with the borrower and knew nothing of the property, but he acted on the valuation made by two business men of Victoria who did not appear to be experts in valuing land.\nThe plaintiff lent $5,500 on this property and received only one year's interest from the borrower who proved to be a very unreliable person, and in endeavouring to realize on the security he was unable to sell it. He therefore brought an action against the brokers alleging in his statement of claim that he was induced to lend his money on the representation of one of them that the borrower was a steady, thrifty farmer and the property worth over $7,000, both of which representations were untrue. He obtained judgment in this action for the amount loaned with interest. The defendants appealed.\nRobinson Q.C. for the appellants.\nMoss Q.C. for the respondent.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE :\u2014Three questions are raised by this appeal. First, was there sufficient evidence for the consideration of the jury that the appellants were the agents of the respondent in the mortgage transaction which has given rise to this litigation ? Secondly, were the appellants, as such agents, guilty of negligence ? Thirdly, did the respondent by reason of such negligence suffer loss and to what amount ?\nIn answer to the first and tenth questions submitted to them by the learned judge, the jury have found the agency to be established. That there was sufficient evidence for the consideration of the jury on this head cannot be doubted. Mr. Snowden, the member of the appellants' firm by whom the business was managed, being examined as a witness for himself and his com- pany at the trial, upon cross-examination gave the following evidence :\nQ. Then do you think that as the agent of Mr. Wolley you were justified in advising him to make that investment ? A. Yes, I do at that time.\nQ. Why do you think so ? A. Because I considered the property fully worth it at that time.\nQ. I will put the question in this way. Do you think that as a financial agent you would be justified in advising a client to make that investment then ? A. Yes.\nQ. You do. And that would be the way upon which you would have advised Mr. Wolley if you had been acting for him, that would have been the basis upon which you would have given him the advice ? A. I would recommend him to take the loan, I did recommend him to take it.\nQ. You did recommend him to take it ? A. Yes.\nQ. How did you recommend him to take it ? A. I thought it was a good loan.\nQ. You thought it was in his interest ? A. Yes, from the valuation I thought it was a good loan.\nQ. You thought it was in his interest to take it ? A. He had the same opportunity of judging as I had.\nQ. No, but a minute ago you said you recommended him to take it. Would you have recommended him to take it if you had not thought it was in his interest ? Would you ? Do you mean to say that you would deliberately recommend him to do a thing that you thought he would make a loss on ? A. No, of course I wouldn't.\nQ. Then, if you did recommend him to do it, didn't you hold yourself out to him as acting for him and his interest ?\u2014A. I suppose I did at the time.\nQ. Of course you did.\nIn the face of this clear, unequivocal admission by Mr. Snowden, it is quite out of the question to say that the learned judge could have withdrawn the case from the jury and nonsuited the respondent.\nThere is nothing inconsistent with this admission of the existence of the relationship of principal and agents, in the fact that Hodge, the borrower, paid the appellants their commission of one per cent, for it is proved that the usual practice in carrying out loans at Victoria was, that the borrower paid the commission of the lender's agents. Again, the circumstance that the respondent paid the appellants nothing does not negative the existence of agency, for it is shown, as I have just said, that their commission was paid by the mortgagor. Moreover, the attitude of Mr. Snowden in the controversy which arose as to whether the interest should be paid annually or otherwise, was adverse to the borrower and entirely in the interest of the respondent, shewing that he was at all events acting for him, if not for him exclusively. Then, as the appellants through Snowden well knew, the respondent was relying on them alone to protect his interests, making no inquiries himself and employing no other broker or agent. All these circumstances go to show, by the admission of Mr. Snowden, that his firm were acting as the respondent's agents, and in my opinion were not only proper matters for the consideration of the jury, but entirely justify their findings as expressed in the answers to the first and tenth questions put to them by the learned judge.\nThat there was ample proof of negligence by the appellants in the performance of their duties as agents is equally clear. Mr. Snowden was content to assume that this parcel of land situate in the Delta of the Fraser River, consisting of eighty acres, with a house and barn, was worth $7,000 upon the mere production of a certificate to that effect, procured by Hodge, the borrower, signed by Messrs. Shotbolt and Baker, two gentlemen living at Victoria, one a druggist, the other a grain dealer, who are not shown to have had any experience as valuers of land, or to have been in any way competent to make the estimate they did. Satisfied with this valuation the appellants made no independent or further inquiry, but acting on it advanced the loan of $5,500. They might, in my opinion, just as well have acted on the mere bare statement of the mortgagor himself. Then the evidence shows that this property, the assessed value of which was only some $2,000, was at the time of the loan not worth more than $40 per acre, the buildings, consisting of a house and barn, being at the utmost of the value of some $1,500. Now this being, as I think, what the evidence establishes as a fair valuation, what amount would any prudent investor advance upon such a security ? The rule which the Court of Chancery has laid down as governing investments by trustees on loans on real security, is that on agricultural lands not more than two-thirds, and on buildings not more than one-half, of the actual value should be advanced. This, I think, is the proper test to ascertain what a prudent owner would have advanced in the present instance. And what a prudent owner would have advanced, and no more than that, it was the duty of the appellants in the present case to have advised the respondent to advance. Then, on the basis of the valuation I have mentioned, this property on which the appellants induced the respondent to lend $5,500, was not a good security for more than $2,900. It is plain, therefore, that there was evidence of negligence, and I should say very gross negligence, to go to the jury.\nThen, it is urged that the learned judge at the trial misdirected the jury and assumed the decision of the question of agency, as well as the fact of negligence, himself. This ground of appeal is, in my opinion, entirely unfounded. No doubt the learned judge, in his long and exhaustive charge, did strongly comment on the evidence, but that he had a perfect right to do, and I must add, considering the nature of the case and of the evidence adduced, I should have been surprised if the learned judge had not spoken foreibly, but that he either directed the jury absolutely to find for the re- spondent on these questions of fact, or in any way sought to impose his view of the evidence upon them, is a proposition to which I cannot agree. In the course of his charge the learned judge most distinctly told the jury that these questions were for them ; thus we find him saying:\nNow, if you find\u2014because I do not decide it, it is for you to decide it\u2014if you find that there was an agency, the next thing you have to find is : Were they negligent ? Now the word \" negligent \" is a harsh word. The proper term to use in a case of this kind, and it comes to the same thing, is this\u2014or the proper question to put to you, is this\u2014and you will answer it according to the evidence : Was there due skill, or were there due skill and diligence used by the defendants, if you find that they were agents for the plaintiff in making this loan ?\nUpon the heads I have already dealt with, I am therefore entirely of accord with the Divisional Court in refusing a new trial.\nThere remains, however, another objection to which Mr. Justice McCreight, dissenting from the other members of the court, thought effect should be given. The jury were not called upon to assess the damages as they must have been in an ordinary common law action for negligence under the old practice, and the judgment entered by Mr. Justice Walkem upon the findings of the jury did not pronounce for any definite sum to be recovered by way of damages, but ordered the appellants to repay to the respondent the full amount of his advance with interest at eight and a half per cent from 28th October, 1891, (the first year's interest having been paid to the respondent by the mortgagor) until judgment, and it further directed that upon payment of this sum the respondent should assign the mortgage to the appellants. I am of opinion that this was not a correct disposition of the case. The effect of this judgment would be to make the appellants not only responsible for such damages as were caused by the negligent performance of their duty as the respondent's agents, in over-valuing the mortgaged property, but also for any depreciation (if any there has been) in the actual value of the property subsequent to the loan. It is manifest that any loss in this respect should be borne by the respondent himself inasmuch as it cannot be attributed to the neglect of the appellants. All that the appellants can possibly be liable for is the loss occasioned by the over-valuation adopted and acted on by them. The damages should have been assessed in the regular way, and that not having been done, the cause must be remitted to the Supreme Court of British Columbia to have the error in this respect rectified. This was the view of Mr. Justice McCreight and I concur in his conclusion. Under the British Columbia Rule, 436, the court is empowered to direct a new trial as to part only of the matter in controversy. This rule should, I think, be acted upon in the present case. It would be open to this court, under British Columbia Rule 446, itself to assess the damages, but I think this can be more satisfactorily done by the court below, which may in its discretion either assess the damages itself, send it down for trial before another jury for that purpose only, or direct a reference to ascertain the amount the respondent was entitled to recover. The judgment should be confirmed as to the general liability of the appellants, but varied in the way I have mentioned as regards the damages. This point was not specifically taken either in the notice of motion for a new trial or in the notice of motion to discharge the judgment, though it is to be presumed that it was discussed on the argument in the court below, since Mr. Justice McCreight's judgment proceeds upon it. The appellants, having been compelled to appeal to have the judgment set right in this respect, and having succeeded in part of their contention, ought not to be ordered to pay costs, though, having failed in other respects, they are not entitled to recover any. There should, therefore, be no costs of this appeal and the cause must be remitted to the court below with the directions already indicated.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014On the question of agency, as well as on the question of negligence, there was, in my opinion, sufficient evidence to support the verdict ; and that verdict having been approved of by the learned judge who presided at the trial, and by the learned judges before whom the case was heard in banco, I do not see that we would be justified in interfering. I would dismiss the appeal.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014It must be admitted that the learned judge before whom this case was tried, in his exhaustive charge to the jury, in plain terms expressed his own opinion upon the evidence, but it must also, I think, be admitted that while he did so, he also told the jury, (a special jury of mercantile men) that they were to render their verdict upon their own opinion of the facts in evidence uninfluenced by his opinion, for that they were the judges of the facts and not he.\nMoreover, after the long discussion at the end of his charge upon the several points upon which the learned counsel for the defendants took objection to his charge, and before the questions which he submitted to the jury were submitted, it must be admitted, I think, upon the report which we have of what then took place, that the learned judge took pains to impress upon the jury that it was their duty to determine the case and to answer the questions he was about to submit to them upon their own unbiassed opinion of the evidence discarding from consideration what he had said as to his views of the evidence.\nUnder these circumstances, and inasmuch as the evidence in support of the plaintiff's contention, if believed, and that it was believed by the jury there can be no doubt, was abundantly sufficient to support the findings of the jury upon the questions submitted to them, I do not think that we should be justified in remitting the case to another trial.\nThe main point urged on behalf of the defendants at the trial was, that the defendant Snowden was employed by the borrower Hodge as his agent to effect a loan for him, and that he as Hodge's agent and only in that capacity applied to the plaintiff for the loan, and that he did not give the plaintiff any reason for thinking that he was acting as his agent in the matter, but I think this is not the correct view to take of the evidence, and that the view taken by the jury is the correct one, namely, that the defendants, of which firm Snowden was a partner, were acting in the matter as the plaintiff's agents. The evidence is that Hodge applied to a Mr. Pooley not to employ him as Hodge's agent to procure a loan for him, but as a person who acting for others, his clients, had before lent him money on mortgage asking him to lend a further sum to Hodge upon the land already held by him under a mortgage. Mr. Pooley informed Hodge that he had no money to lend, and Mr. Pooley says that he does not recollect whether he told him to go to the defendants, that they might have money to lend, but he says that he was in the habit when he had no money himself to lend, to send persons applying to him for loans to the defendants, and in point of fact it appears that Hodge did go to the defendants and saw the defendant Snowden, and told him that Mr. Pooley had sent him to the defendants and that he wanted to obtain a loan of $5,500. It is plain that Hodge's application to the defendants was as brokers who were in the habit of investing their own or their clients' money, as Mr. Pooley was, on mortgage. Snow- den then applied to the plaintiff, for whom he had on previous occasions invested money, and obtained from him a cheque payable to the order of the defendants, authorizing him to lend the money to Hodge upon the security, as it was represented by Snowden, to be a first-class or \" gilt edged security,\" upon Mr. Pooley being satisfied as to the legal sufficiency of the title ; this being done, the defendants handed the money to Mr. Pooley, who handed to Hodge what remained after paying the mortgages already on the land, a commission of 1 per cent paid to the defendants, and the costs of preparing the mortgage. Much was tried to be made of the commission of 1 per cent paid to the defendants, as being a commission paid to them by Hodge for their services as his agents, but in truth that commission was that which is paid ordinarily by every borrower to the lender's agent through whom the loan is effected, the practice being, in all such cases, to charge all expenses, including the commission of the lender's agent, to the borrower.\nI can see no ground for finding fault with the findings of the jury, and under the circumstances I do not think the parties should be put to the expense of another trial.\nAs to the amount of the judgment of the court below I can see no just ground of interference with it, except as to the amount of interest allowed. I did not understand the learned counsel for the appellants to complain of the amount if we should be of opinion that the plaintiff was entitled to recover in the action. However, it is established, I think, that the plaintiff was betrayed into advancing the money which the defendants loaned upon the security of the mortgages taken in the plaintiff's name by representations, which were untrue in point of fact, made to him by the defendant Snowden, who had no justification for making them, and since the discovery by the plaintiff of the deception so practised upon him he has repudiated the mortgage so taken as one which, under the circumstances, was never authorized by him ; his true measure of damages is therefore, in my opinion, the amount which he was so wrongfully induced by Snowden to advance, together with interest thereon at six per cent, he transferring all interest vested in him by force of the mortgage ; whatever may be the real value of the security can only with certainty be ascertained upon a sale of the premises to realize the amount purported to be secured by the mortgage. I can see no justice whatever in compelling the plaintiff to adopt any such proceedings, or in putting him to the delay and expense incident upon any proceeding for determining the real value of premises comprised in a mortgage, all interest in which he repudiates as having been imposed upon him by the false representations of the defendants.\nThe defendants, having procured the plaintiff to advance his money upon such representations, must reimburse him to the full amount of the principal advanced and six per cent interest, and must themselves look to the mortgage security for their indemnity. The wrong to be redressed was theirs, and the burthen to reinstate the plaintiff in the position in which, but for their wrong he would be, lies upon them. The judgment being varied as to the interest the appeal should, in my opinion, be dismissed with costs.\nSEDGEWICK and KING JJ. concurred in the judgment of the Chief Justice.\nAppeal dismissed with costs, but judgment varied.\nSolicitor for the appellants: Robert Cassidy.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Bodwell & Irving.\n"}

Christie (Defendant) Respondent.\n1895: May 17, 18; 1895: December 9.\nPresent: Sir Henry Strong C.J., and Taschereau, Gwynne, Sedgewick and King JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.\nAppeal\u2014Increasing damages without cross appeal\u2014Rule 61, Supreme Court Rules\u2014Special statute.\nUnder the Ontario Judicature Act, R.S.O. [1887], c. 44, ss. 47 and 48 the Court of Appeal has power to increase damages awarded to a respondent without a cross-appeal, and the Supreme Court has the like power under its rule no. 61. Taschereau J. dissenting.\nPer Strong C.J.\u2014Though the court will not usually increase such damages without a cross-appeal, yet where the original proceedings were by arbitration under a statute requiring the court, on appeal from the award, to pronounce such judgment as the arbitrators should have given, the statute is sufficient notice to an appellant of what the court may do, and a cross-appeal is not necessary.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] affirming, by an equal division of opinion, the judgment of Mr. Justice Rose[2], on an appeal from the award of arbitrators in an arbitration under the Ontario Municipal Act.\nThe respondent, Christie, claimed damages from the town corporation for injury to his property by reason of the grade of the street having been raised some six feet, and his claim was submitted to arbitration under the provisions of The Municipal Act. The arbitrators found that the property had been benefited by the change in the grade rather than injured, but considering that he was technically entitled to damages they awarded him $100 and a portion of the costs. On ap- peal to a judge from the award the damages were increased to $1,000 with full costs, the learned judge being of opinion that he could deal with the matter at large. On further appeal the judges in the Court of Appeal were equally divided in opinion as to the jurisdiction of the judge to increase the damages, and his judgment stood affirmed. The corporation then appealed to this court.\nAylesworth Q.C. and Going for appellants argued that all that could be done on appeal was to affirm or set aside the award, citing Lemoine v. The City of Montreal[3]; Paradis v. The Queen[4]; Morrison v. The Mayor of Montreal[5].\nRiddell and Gibson for the respondent referred to Charland v. The Queen[6]; Guay v. The Queen[7].\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014I have read the judgment prepared by Mr. Justice Gwynne in this case and I agree with it in all respects. I only desire to add that it is not to be considered in any respect as a departure from the rule already laid down by this court in the cases in which it was held that when there was no cross-appeal the court would not increase the damages awarded to the respondent[8].\nThe court has so held not because it has no jurisdiction in such cases to increase the damages, for the rule relating to cross-appeals leaves the right to interfere in behalf of a respondent entirely in the discretion of the court, but for the reason that it is fair to an appellant that the respondent, if he desires to object to the judgment appealed against, should formulate his objection by giving notice in order that the appellant may be apprised of what he is required to answer.\nIn the present case the appeal to the Court of Appeal of Ontario was under a statute which required the court to pronounce just such judgment as in its opinion the arbitrators ought to have awarded. The statute itself, therefore, was sufficient notice of what the court might be called upon to do, and the same reason applies in this court.\nThe appeal must be dismissed with costs, subject to the variation directed in Mr. Justice Gwynne\u2019s judgment.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014I would dismiss the appeal which should never have been taken.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014I cannot entertain a doubt that the learned judge Mr. Justice Rose before whom this case came by way of appeal from the award made by the arbitrators herein had authority and jurisdiction under the provisions of the Ontario Municipal Act of 1892, to deal with the case in the manner in which he did. This case, in my opinion, is an apt illustration of the wisdom of the legislature in making awards in matters of this nature, wherein the injured party is deprived of his remedy by action at law, appealable to the courts, for I must say I find it difficult to maintain the award of the majority of the arbitrators upon any principle of law and justice which is reconcilable with the evidence; the judgment of the learned judge upon the appeal is not in my opinion, open to any objection unless it be that which has been suggested by himself in his judgment, namely, that he does not feel at all satisfied that the amount allowed by him and to which he has increased the amount of the award is sufficient to compensate the plaintiff for the injury complained of or to put the houses into the condition in which they were before the execution by the defendants of the work which has caused to them the injury complained of. The property which has been injuriously affected by work performed by the Municipality of the town of Toronto Junction in the exercise of their powers consists of two brick houses having together a frontage of about thirty-six feet erected upon a small town plot of about forty feet in width and one hundred feet in depth. The predecessor of the plaintiff in title purchased in the year 1889 the town plot before it had any building erected upon it. The lot was for the most part situate in low land. It does not appear to have had and indeed could not have had any value except as a building site. Accordingly, immediately upon acquiring it the plaintiff\u2019s predecessor in title, in order to make it valuable, resolved to erect upon it two small but substantial brick houses having good cellars, and fitted so as to be heated by a hot air furnace, but before doing so, as the lot abutted upon two streets which would be likely at some time to be raised above the level of the land as it then was, he, as shown by the evidence and found as a fact by the learned judge, communicated with the corporation officials and endeavoured to ascertain the grade to which the streets upon which his lot abutted would be raised, but was unable to obtain any information further than that the streets would probably be raised two feet. He could obtain no levels from the corporation; all that he could obtain was that the corporation engineer surveyed the lot for him, for the purpose no doubt of defining its limits along the street so as to prevent the buildings proposed to be erected encroaching upon the streets. In order to be, as he conceived, upon the safe side he erected the houses along the limits of the streets as so defined so as to allow four feet instead of two for the eleva- tion to which the grade of the streets could be raised without causing any damage to the houses and so that the first floor of the houses was upwards of six feet above the natural level of the ground as it then was. The houses were finished in the summer or autumn of 1890, and as so finished were supplied with good and sufficient drainage, and the corporation has ever since enjoyed the benefit of the increased taxation to which the property became subjected, as property having dwelling houses erected thereon. Now, some time after the completion of the houses, and while they were occupied by tenants at the rent of about $10 each per month, and in the year 1891, the corporation proceeded to raise the grades of the streets, and while such work was in progress, being advised that a by-law should be passed, the municipal council of the corporation upon 5th of August, 1891, passed a by-law numbered 219, whereby it was enacted\nthat the plans and profiles of Dundas Street, Weston Road south, Annette Street, Ontario Street and Union Street, as prepared by the town engineer, and deposited in his office, be approved and adopted, and that the said streets be graded in accordance with said plans and profiles under the direction of the town engineer, who is authorized to carry out said work.\nThe streets upon which the town plot under consideration abutted were the above named Annette and Union Streets. After the passing of this by-law and thereunder those two streets were elevated to the height of upwards of six feet above the natural level as it had been, and so that the crown of those streets was about on a level with the first floor, that is to say, with the ceilings of the cellars of the houses as they had been erected.\nHad the streets been elevated to the height of four feet only above their former natural level no damage whatever would have been caused to the houses. It is only for damage consequent upon their having been raised two feet still higher that the plaintiff complains. Now the evidence of the gentleman who was mayor of the town in 1891 seems to cast some doubt upon the bona fides of the elevation to which the streets were raised, and as to the necessity for such elevation. He says that he used to ask the council why so much earth was being put down on the streets, but never got a satisfactory explanation. He formed the opinion that private parties were getting it done for the benefit of their own lands. A gentleman, he says, who owned property in the neighbourhood seemed to have a pull on the subway earth (that is earth which the corporation in making a subway for a railway had to remove) and he says that he considered that the grade of the streets was raised so high as a good way of getting rid of the subway earth and to benefit the property of that gentleman and of others in the neighbourhood, the plaintiff\u2019s property being in point of fact the only property which was damaged thereby. But whether the streets were or were not raised to the height to which they were raised, either unnecessarily or mal\u00e2 fide, for the purpose of benefiting the property of others by damaging that of the plaintiff is immaterial for our present purpose for the Municipal Act ch. 184 R.S.O. sec. 483 expressly enacts that:\nEvery council shall make to the owners or occupiers of, or other persons interested in, real property taken or owned by the corporation in the exercise of any of its powers or injuriously affected by the exercise of its powers, due compensation for any damage necessarily resulting from the exercise of such powers beyond any advantage which the claimant may derive from the contemplated work, and any claim for such compensation, if any, not mutually agreed upon, shall be determined by arbitration under this act.\nThe effect of raising the streets upon which the houses abutted to the height to which they were raised was 1st, to deprive the houses of the drainage which they had had without providing any substitutionary mode of drainage, and 2nd, to cause all the water falling upon the streets to pour down into the cellars of the houses and to make them as the evidence abundantly shows not only unsaleable but utterly uninhabitable unless and until some effectual mode of repairing the damage done and preventing a recurrence of the nuisance should be adopted. The evidence also shows that while the drainage which the houses formerly had is cut off, and while the corporation have constructed two drains in the adjoining streets, one is not placed low enough to carry off the water from the plaintiffs houses and into the other; although situate low enough the corporation have refused permission to the plaintiff to have access. For the injury thus caused the plaintiff had to pay his tenants for injury to their property $33 and to expend the further sum of $75 in executing some temporary work to prevent in some degree the recurrence of a flood of like character into the cellars of the houses; besides the moneys so expended amounting together to $108, and the loss of tenants ever since by reason of the houses having been rendered untenantable, the plaintiff has been damnified to the extent of the amount necessary to put the houses into as good and tenantable state of repair as that in which they were before the streets were raised to the height which has caused the injury complained of.\nNow the nature and extent of the damage done consequential upon the work of the corporation and the cost of making all necessary repairs and of putting the houses into as tenantable a state of repair as they were in before that work was done are matters capable of pretty precise estimate by witnesses who are experts. Several witnesses of this description having large experience in the value of property of this description, have testified that the houses in their present condition are wholly untenantable and also unsaleable, unless at the sacrifice of fully 50 per cent of the cost of the houses, that is to the amount of about $2,000, the actual cost of the two houses having been $4,000, and two architects and builders of houses have made precise estimates in items of the amount necessary to be expended in making the houses tenantable and in preventing a recurrence of the damage. Adopting that which is the lowest and therefore most favourable to the corporation, we find that amount to be $1,673.20. Of this sum $155 covers all the items in the estimate which can fairly be attributed to damage arising, assuming any to have arisen, from any other cause than the work for which the corporation are responsible, namely the cutting off the drainage which the houses had and substituting no other in its place, and the flooding of the houses necessarily arising from the grade of the streets having been raised to the level of the ceilings of the cellars, that is to say to a height of two feet above a point at which if the grade had been fixed no damage whatever could have been caused to the plaintiff\u2019s property.\nThese items are:\n1. Repairing settlement brick and stone............................................................................\n$75 00\n2. Carpenters\u2019 work, rebuilding foundation, sheeting base of porches and steps, fitting doors, trimmings, &c., after raising..........................................................................\n50 00\n3. Repairing plastering, painting and cementing down pipes.......................................\n30 00\n$155 00\nDeducting this sum from the above $1,673.20, leaves the sum of $1,518.20 as the lowest estimate of the cost of putting the premises into that tenantable state of repair in which they were before the corporation executed the works complained of. The contention of the corporation was that there had been a settling of part of the walls of the houses, which as was contended caused at least some part of the damage done. Now, although it is true that the evidence showed that when the foundation was being built there did occur a slight settlement at one point, still the evidence showed also that it was observed at the time and that provision was made to rectify it, and that there had been no settlement whatever after the houses were completed. However, ex majori cautel\u00e2, and to avoid allowing to the plaintiff anything in respect of damage which the work of the corporation did not cause, I deduct the above sum of $155 as covering all items in the estimate for any damage which can be attributed to any other cause than the work of the corporation.\nNow, to the above sum of $1,518.20, it is but just and reasonable that $108 expended in manner above mentioned should be added, thus making $1,626.20, and as the houses which formerly were rented at $10 per month each have been rendered utterly untenantable by the damage consequential on the work of the corporation, it is but reasonable that some allowance for loss of rent should be made. Upon this point it was urged on behalf of the corporation that there has been a general fall in rents, and indeed in the value of all real property in the neighbourhood, and that the houses might have become unoccupied, or if not occupied at very reduced rents even if the streets had never been raised. It was, however, the work of the corporation which made them untenantable, in which condition, by reason of their resisting the claim of the plaintiff, they continued to be for two years up to the date of the award. Under these circumstances the corporation cannot reasonably ask that a greater reduction should be made from the amount the plaintiff would have received for rent, but for the work of the corporation, than 50 per cent of the amount formerly received. At this rate there should be added to the above sum of $1,626.20 the further sum of $240 for two years rent at $5 per month per house, making $1,866.20. Now, the arbitrators by their award have found that the premises of the plaintiff have been injuriously affected by the works of the corporation, but to the amount only of \u201c$200\u201d over and above\nany benefit and advantage to the said land and premises arising from the grading and levelling of said streets.\nHow the arbitrators arrived at this sum we have no means of determining, nor had Mr. Justice Rose save by perusal of the evidence taken on the arbitration. The award, however, in its terms seems to show that some amount, though how much we cannot even guess, for no amount whatever was suggested in the evidence, has been deducted by the arbitrators from the cost of reinstating the premises in a tenantable condition as for some benefit or advantage which it has been assumed has been conferred upon the property which has been injured by the works of the corporation. Assuming any such deduction to have been made I not only concur with Mr. Justice Rose in holding that the award is wholly irreconeilable with the evidence but am of opinion that such a deduction in the present case would be contrary to every principle of justice and is unwarranted by the statute under which the arbitration has taken place. What the statute, namely sec. 483 of the ch. 184 R.S.O., enacts is that the corporation shall pay to all owners of property injuriously affected by work done by the corporation in the exercise of its powers\u2014\ndue, that is to say full, compensation for any damage necessarily resulting from the exercise of these powers beyond any advantage which the claimant may derive from the contemplated work. Now I must say that to me it does not seem to be possible within the limits of common sense to conceive how a small property like that of the plaintiff (the whole value of which consisted in the enjoyment of the two houses as dwelling houses together with the appurtenances thereto belonging), or how the claimant himself could derive any advantage whatever in respect of such property from work the necessary results of which has been proved to be that the houses have been rendered uninhabitable and even unsaleable at any price short of a sacrifice of at least 50 per cent of their cost; and that an outlay of a sum exceeding $1,500 is necessary to reinstate them in as good and tenantable a condition as they had been in. What the statute contemplates and the utmost it authorizes is that the value of any benefit if any there be which the injured property, that is to say which the property in its injured condition, may derive from the work which causes the injury if it can be ascertained and is not wholly speculative may be deducted from the amount which, apart from the value of such benefit, would be required to afford due compensation for the injury.\nIf, for example, property be injured in such a manner that it is necessary that the injury caused should be repaired before any benefit could accrue, the statute is not open to a construction so at variance with common justice and common sense, as that the prospective speculative estimate of the value of such benefit should be deducted from the amount necessary to repair the injury and to put the property into a condition to receive such benefit. Such benefit could not be said to be derived from the work causing the injury, but from the outlay expended to repair the injury. In the present case there is no suggestion whatever in the evidence that the plaintiff\u2019s property, in the condition in which it was when injured, has derived, or could derive, any benefit from the work which has caused the injury; all that is suggested is that if the plaintiff\u2019s property had been quite different from what it was, that is, if it had been a vacant lot, it would in that case have derived some benefit from the work, the value of which benefit was so wholly speculative and unsubstantial and unreal that no attempt even was made to estimate it; but as to the plaintiff\u2019s property in the condition in which it was, being house property, the evidence is that nothing but injury resulted to it from the corporation work, which injury must continue until repaired or until due compensation, as required by the statute, shall be given therefor.\nAlthough there has been no cross-appeal instituted by the plaintiff against the judgment of Mr. Justice Rose, still the Ontario Judicature Act ch. 44 ss. 47 and 48 R.S.O. and the rule of court, no. 16, made under that Act, gave full power to the Court of Appeal for Ontario to increase the amount to which the award had been increased by Mr. Justice Rose, and so likewise has this court like power under its rule no. 61.\nIn The Queen v. Robertson[9], although there was no cross-appeal, this court gave judgment in favour of the respondent upon a point in the case which the court below had adjudged against him. This is the precedent which I think should be followed in the present case, in order to prevent what otherwise, as it appears to me, would be a complete failure of justice, and that the plaintiff may have that adequate compensation for the injury done to his property by the work of the corporation which the statute contemplated assuring to him, and to prevent this remedy by arbitration to which he is limited by the statute proving to be illusory. I am of opinion, therefore, that the award should be increased to the above sum of $1,866.20, for which sum, with interest thereon from the 19th of October, 1893, the date of the award, the plaintiff should have judgment, together with his costs, and that this variation being made the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nSEDGEWICK and KING JJ. concurred.\nAppeal dismissed with costs, and judgment varied.\nSolicitor for the appellants: Charles C.

He reported on the claim of the suppliants, recommending payment to them of a certain sum, but payment was refused, and in answer to a petition of right filed the Crown contended that there was no final certificate of the engineer, approved by the railway commissioners, as required by the Intercolonial Railway Act. The Exchequer Court judge dismissed the petition, holding that he was bound by the decision in McGreevy\u2019s case. The suppliants appealed.\nStuart Q.C. and Ferguson Q.C. for the appellants. In McGreevy v. The Queen[3] the judges were not in accord on matters of law, and the decision does not bind the court. See Stanstead Election Case[4]; Ridsdale v. Clifton[5].\nThe merits were fully discussed in the former case, and we rely on the judgment of Strong J. therein.\nHogg Q.C. for the respondent, contended that the court could not but follow McGreevy v. The Queen (1), and on the merits cited Cutter v. Powell[6]; Munro v. Butt[7].\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014For the reasons stated in my judgment in the case of The Queen v. McGreevy (1), a case which involved precisely the same questions as those which are presented by the appeal now before the court, I am of opinion that this appeal should be allowed and judgment should be entered in the Exchequer Court for the suppliants. The case of The Queen v. McGreevy[8] I do not consider a binding authority for the reason that a majority of the judges composing the court were not of accord on any proposition of law on which the decision of the appeal depended. The late Chief Justice and Mr. Justice Gwynne were of opinion that the certificate of Mr. Shanly was not the final certificate of the chief engineer. My brother Taschereau, my late brother Patterson and myself, in accord with the Exchequer judge, Mr. Justice Fournier, were of opinion that the certificate of Mr. Shanly was the final and closing certificate required by the contract. Mr. Justice Patterson, however, differing from the members of the court who in other respects agreed with him, thought that was not sufficient to entitle the suppliants to recover. Upon this latter point there was no concordance of a majority of the court. Under these conditions it is apparent that there was no agreement of a majority of the court on any distinct proposition of law. Upon authority, therefore, I consider the judgment in The Queen v. McGreevy (1) not to be a decision binding upon me, inasmuch as the judgment of the majority of the court proceeded upon no settled principle but upon different grounds.\nI am, therefore, of opinion that the appeal should be allowed and judgment entered in the Exchequer Court in favour of the suppliants.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014Whatever may have been the reasons given by each of the judges who concurred in dismissing the suppliants\u2019 claim in The Queen v. McGreevy (1), the decision in that case is that upon a certificate such as the one upon which the suppliants here rely, the Crown is not liable. By that decision we are bound, and the appeal must be dismissed. It would be a blot on the administration of justice in this country if the present appellants succeeded upon a case precisely similar to that in which McGreevy failed.\nGWYNNE J\u2014Upon the 26th day of October, 1869, two persons doing business together as contractors in partnership under the name, style and firm of J. B. Bertrand and Company, entered into a contract by deed with Her Majesty represented by the Intercolonial Railway Commissioners appointed under the Dominion statute 31 Vic. ch. 13, for the construction of a portion of the Intercolonial Railway, known as section nine of that railway, according to certain plans and specifications annexed to and made part of the said contract.\nUpon the 15th day of June, 1870, the same contractors in like manner entered into a similar contract with Her Majesty for the construction of another portion of the said railway known as section fifteen thereof. By the said respective contracts the said contractors covenanted with Her Majesty that the said section number nine should be finally and entirely completed in every particular to the satisfaction of the said commissioners and their engineer on or before the first day of July, 1871, at and for the price or sum of $354,897 to be paid as in the contract for that section was provided, being at the rate of $16,899.86 per mile of that section, and that the said section number fifteen should in like manner be finally and entirely completed to the satisfaction of the said commissioners and their engineer on or before the first day of July, 1872, for the price or sum of $363,520.59, to be paid as in the contract for that section was provided, being at the rate of $30,000 per mile on that section. The said contractors by the said respective contracts further covenanted with Her Majesty\u2014 That all the works should be executed and materials supplied in strict accordance with the plans and specifications, and to the entire satisfaction of the commissioners and their engineer, and that the commissioners should be the sole judges of the work and material, and that their decision on all questions in dispute with regard to the works or materials, or as to the meaning or interpretation of the specifications or plans, or upon points not provided for, or not sufficiently explained in the plans or specifications, should be final and binding upon all parties. By paragraph no. 3 of said respective contracts, it was covenanted that the times before mentioned for the final completion of the works embraced in the respective contracts should be of the essence of the said respective contracts, and that in default of such completion on the respective days for that purpose limited by the contracts the said contractors should forfeit all right and claim to the sum or percentage by the said respective contracts agreed to be retained by the commissioners, and also to any moneys whatever which at the time of such failure of completion as aforesaid might be due or owing to the contractors; and that the contractors should also pay to Her Majesty as liquidated damages and not by way of fine or penalty the sum of two thousand dollars for each and every week, and the proportionate fractional part of such sum for every part of a week, during which the works embraced in the said respective contracts, or any portion thereof, should remain incomplete, or for which the certificate of the engineer approved by the commissioners should be withheld, and the commissioners might deduct and retain in their hands such sums as might become due for liquidated damages from any sum of money then due or payable, or to become due and payable thereafter to the contractors. By paragraph numbered 4 in the said respective contracts it was provided that: The engineer should be at liberty at any time before the commencement or during the construction of any portion of the work to make any changes or alterations which he might deem expedient in the grades, the line of location of the railway, the width of cuttings or fillings, the dimensions or character of structures, or in any other thing connected with the works whether or not such changes increased or diminished the work to be done, or the expense of doing the same, and that the contractors should not be entitled to any allowance by reason of such changes, unless such changes consisted in alterations in the grades or the line of location, in which case the contractors should be subject to such deductions for any diminution of work, or entitled to such allowance for increased work, as the case may be, as the commissioners might deem reasonable, their decision being final in the matter.\nBy paragraph 9 of the said respective contracts it was declared that\u2014\n9. It was distinctly understood, intended and agreed that the said prices or consideration of $354,897 in the one case and of $363,520.50 in the other shall be and shall be held to be full compensation for all the works embraced in or contemplated by the said respective contracts or which might be required in virtue of any of the provisions of the same, or by law, and that the contractors should not upon any pretext whatever be entitled by reason of any change or addition made in or to such works, or in the said plans and specifications, or by reason of the exercise of any of the powers vested in the Governor in Council by the Act intituled, \u201cAn Act respecting the construction of the Intercolonial Railway,\u201d or in the commissioners or engineer by the said respective contracts, or by law, to claim or demand any further or additional sum for extra work or as damages or otherwise the contractors by the said respective contracts expressly waiving and abandoning all such claims or pretensions to all intents and purposes whatsoever except as provided in the fourth paragraph or section of the said respective contracts.\nBy the eleventh paragraph or section of the said respective contracts it was further mutually agreed upon by the parties thereto\u2014\n11. That cash payments equal to 85 per cent of the value of the work done approximately made up from the returns of progress estimates should be made monthly, on the certificate of the engineer that the work for or on account of which the sum should be certified had been duly executed, and upon approval of such certificate by the commissioners; that on the completion of the whole work to the satisfaction of the engineer a certificate to that effect should be given but that the final and closing certificate, including the 15 per cent retained should not be granted for a period of two months thereafter; and that the progress certificates should not in any respect be taken as an acceptance of the works or release of the contractors from their responsibility in respect thereof, but that they, upon the conclusion of the works, would deliver over the same in good order, according to the true intent and meaning of the contract and of the specifications annexed to and made part of the said contract.\nThe contractors proceeded with the construction of the works under these contracts, and from time to time received progress certificates from Mr. Fleming, the engineer of the commissioners, and payment thereof, but they wholly failed to complete the respective works on the days limited by the contracts for the completion thereof, namely, the section 9 on the 1st day of July, 1871, and the section 15 on the 1st day of July, 1872, and in the spring of 1873, by reason of such default continuing, the commissioners were obliged to take the completion of the said works into their own hands, and did complete the same under the terms of the contract at the cost of the Government.\nThe statement in the suppliants\u2019 petition of right in relation to this matter is thus stated by the suppliants in 23rd, 24th, 25th and 26th paragraphs of the petition of right.\n23. The said J. B. Bertrand & Co., under the aforesaid contract for section 9, had undertaken to finish and complete the same on or about the first day of July, one thousand eight hundred and seventy-one, and they did virtually complete the same on or about the month of May, 1873, and if any delay occurred in the completion of the same it is altogether attributable to the acts of the commissioners and engineers under their directions, to the alterations made in the grades and line of location, to changes in the works and to large quantities of extra and surplus work imposed upon the said J. B. Bertrand & Co. and for which they cannot be held responsible.\n24. The said J. B. Bertrand & Co. under the aforesaid contract for section 15, had undertaken to finish and complete the same on or about the 1st day of July, 1872, and they did virtually complete the same on or about the month of May, 1873, and if any delay occurred in the completion of the same it is attributable to the acts of the commissioners and the engineers under their direction\u2014to the alterations made in the grades and line of location\u2014to changes in the works and to the large quantity of extra and surplus work imposed upon the said J. B. Bertrand & Co., and for which they cannot he held responsible.\n25. That the said commissioners in the spring of the year 1873, under misapprehensions and without any reasonable cause, and at a time when a large amount of money was due to the said J. B. Bertrand & Co. for work done, assumed control of the said works upon the said sections, and without giving J. B. Bertrand & Co. any notice of their intention of so doing in writing or otherwise as required by contract, paid out money so belonging to the said J. B. Bertrand & Co. to some of the workmen on the said works, which position the said J. B. Bertrand & Co. were forcibly constrained to accept.\n26. That in consequence of this action of the commissioners the said J. B. Bertrand & Co. suffered great loss from the fact that the said commissioners, after assuming control of the works, expended unnecessarily large sums of money which would not have been expended, and which the said J. B. Bertrand were not bound to expend, and which were for works not contemplated nor included in the contracts, and it is submitted that no portion of the same can be charged in deduction of the lump sum mentioned in the contracts for sections 9 and 15.\nThe allegations in these paragraphs of the petition are thus answered in paragraph no. 24 of the statement of defence filed by Her Majesty\u2019s Attorney General.\n24. Her Majesty\u2019s Attorney General in answer to paragraphs 23,24, 25 and 26 of the said petition says that the contractors having made default in the prosecution of the work required to be done under the said contracts, the said commissioners in strict accordance with the provisions of the said contracts and with the contractors\u2019 assent, finding the men employed by the contractors on the said sections of the said railway unpaid, notwithstanding that up to that time the contractors had been paid more than they were entitled to under the contracts, and finding the work upon the said sections stopped, took the work into their own hands and proceeded to complete the same in accordance with the terms of the said contracts; and the said Attorney General denies that the default of the contractors in not proceeding with their work upon the said sections was in any wise attributable to the said commissioners or the engineer of the Government.\nNow after the completion of the work by the commissioners, and upon the first day of June, 1874, the said commissioners by force of an Act of the Dominion Parliament, 37 Vic. ch. 15, became fundi officio, and\u2019 thereupon all the powers and duties which had been vested in them became by the said Act transferred to and vested in the Minister of Public Works, and by the Act it was enacted and declared that all contracts entered into with the commissioners as such should enure to the use of Her Majesty and should be enforced and carried out under the authority of the Minister of Public Works as if they had been entered into under the authority of an Act passed in the 33rd year of Her Majesty\u2019s reign entituled an Act respecting the Public Works of Canada.\nAlthough the commissioners by this Act ceased to have control over the contracts entered into with them for the construction of the works contracted for by the above named contractors, their engineer, Mr. Fleming, continued for several years to be the engineer in charge of the Intercolonial Railway under the Minister of Public Works; and he could have given to the contractors the certificate in the above 11th paragraph of their contracts mentioned if they had by fulfilment of their contracts to his satisfaction became entitled to such certificates; but he never did give to them and indeed never could have given to them any such certificates within the terms of the contracts in that behalf for, by the default of the contractors to complete the works within the times in that behalf provided by the contracts, and the commissioners having been obliged because of such default to take the works from the contractors and to complete them themselves, the contractors by the express terms of the above third paragraph of the contracts had absolutely forfeited all claim to all sums which then remained due to them under their contracts, and all claim to have a certificate given to them by the engineer to the effect that they had completed the works in the contracts specified to his satisfaction.\nIn the month of September, 1875, all the rights, title, interest and demand of the said J. B. Bertrand & Co. against the Government of the Dominion of Canada, arising out of and connected with the construction of the said sections 9 and 15, were duly transferred to a Mr. John Ross, since deceased, whose representatives the present suppliants are. In the month of June, 1880, a Mr. Frank Shanly, C.E., was by an order in council dated the 21st June, 1880, appointed chief engineer of the Intercolonial Railway \u201cfor the purpose (as stated in the order in council) of investigating and reporting upon all unsettled claims in connection with the construction of the line.\u201d In the month of July, 1881, Mr. Shanly made a report to the government in relation to a claim of J. B. Bertrand & Co. in respect of their contracts for the said sections 9 and 15, and it is upon this report that the claim of the suppliants is wholly rested, their contention being that it constitutes the final and closing certificate of the engineer given under the provisions of, and within the meaning of, the above quoted 11th section of the contracts with the said J. B. Bertrand & Co., and that under it the suppliants as representing J. B. Bertrand & Co. are entitled to recover the amount mentioned therein as an amount due to J. B. Bertrand & Co. under their contracts. Now without saying that in 1880, when Mr. Shanly was so appointed chief engineer of the Intercolonial Railway, there may not have been contracts in existence for work upon that railway in such a position that Mr. Shanly could have given certificates as contemplated by, and provided for in, the contracts for such work, it is in my judgment quite impossible to say that his appointment \u201cfor the purpose of investigating and reporting upon all unsettled claims in connection with the construction of the line\u201d gave him, or that any order in council could give him, authority to accept as completed, and to certify as completed, by the contractors to his satisfaction works which, like those on sections 9 and 15, had seven years previously been taken from the contractors for default in fulfilment of their contracts, and had been completed by the government through the said commissioners under the direction of their engineer, Mr. Shanly\u2019s predecessor, who alone was the person who could have certified that the contractors had completed the works contracted for, if they had completed them, to his satisfaction as provided by the contracts. The language, of the order in council appointing Mr. Shanly plainly, in my opinion, indicates that in a case like the present Mr. Shanly could do no more than investigate and report to the Government any circumstances attending the default of Messrs. J. B. Bertrand & Co. in fulfilment of their contracts, which might appear to warrant the Government, notwithstanding the forfeiture by the contractors of all right to any payment under their contracts, in entertaining favourably and ex gratia any claim preferred on behalf of the contractors, altogether apart from the contracts, and this, in my opinion, is precisely what Mr. Shanly\u2019s report in relation to J. B. Bertrand & Co.\u2019s contracts does, and nothing more\nHe reports, first, that in May, 1873, neither of the sections was completed, and that the commissioners then took the works into their own hands and finished them. He then proceeds to say that he could find nothing to warrant, in a strict legal point of view, a departure from the terms of the contracts, which provide for all contingencies arising out of the increase or decrease of quantities shown in the bill of works and schedule of prices upon which the contracts were based; that it did not appear that the quantities were increased in the aggregate, but on the contrary they were decreased.\nHe thus reports to the government that the commissioners were justified in taking the works off the contractors\u2019 hands and in completing them themselves. Now, in this state of facts, the contracts provided in the above third paragraph thereof, that the contractors should forfeit all moneys whatsoever which at the time of their failure of completion of the works as provided in the contracts should be due or owing to them. The facts as above reported also showed that nothing was claimed by or on behalf of the contractors under the 4th paragraph of the contracts, and that being so, the 9th paragraph of the contracts expressly provided that upon no pretext whatsoever should the contractors be entitled to claim or demand any sum in excess of the respective above mentioned contract lump sums, for extra work or as damages or otherwise howsoever,\nthe contractors hereby expressly waiving and abandoning all such claims or pretensions to all intents and purposes whatsoever except as provided in the fourth section of the contracts.\nHaving thus reported and shown that the contractors had no claim under the terms of their contracts, Mr. Shanly in his report proceeded to recommend an allowance in excess of the lump sums agreed upon in the contracts to be made, namely, of $104,587 on section 9, and of $127,600 on section 15. Of the lump sum or contract price agreed upon for section 9, namely, $354,897, he reported that the contractors, when the work was taken off their hands in May, 1873, had been paid $346,658, leaving only a balance of $8,239 of the contract price for completion of that work, and as to section 15 he reported that the contractors had been paid the sum of $372,130, or the sum of $8,610 in excess of the contract price agreed upon for that section, and adding the $8,239 to the $104,587, making $112,816, he recommended that this sum should be allowed by the government on section 9, and deducting the above $8,610 from the $127,\u00b0 600 recommended in excess of the contract price of section 15, making the sum of $118,990, he recommended should be allowed on section 15. These sums he recommended should be allowed, not as being due under the contracts for his report clearly shows they were not, but because the evidence furnished to him disclosed great difficulties and cost incurred by the contractors in carrying out the heaviest portions of the work, and he closes his report by saying that he thought the increased amounts he recommended would be equitable to the contractors and to the Government; that he thought that if the Government should adopt his recommendations the contractors would have a, reasonable profit and that the Government would have full value for its money.\nI confess that I am utterly unable to understand how these sums so recommended can be claimed to be sums recoverable under the terms of the contracts or how Mr. Shanly\u2019s report can be claimed to be a certificate within the meaning of the 11th paragraph of the contracts.\nThe appeal must in my opinion be dismissed with costs.\nAs it was argued that in a case of McGreevy v. The Queen[9] where a similar question arose there was not a concurrence of a majority of the court in the reasons upon which the judgment in that case was founded and that it therefore should be considered an open question I have thought it best, without entering into any question as to the correctness of that argument, to state anew my views in this case irrespective of the judgment in that case, the court being now differently constitute\nSEDGEWICK J.\u2014I am of opinion that in this case it is our duty to follow the decision* of this court in McGreevy v. The Queen (1). I am also of opinion that although Mr. Shanly was an engineer capable of giving the certificate required by the statute yet the documents relied on as such certificate did not come up to the requirements of the Act. It was. not, nor was it intended to be such a certificate. KING J.\u2014I am of opinion that in this case we should follow the decision of the court in McGreevy v. The Queen[10].\nAppeal dismissed with costs.*\nSolicitors for the appellants: Pentland & Stuart.\nSolicitors for the respondent: O\u2019Connor & Hogg.\n[1] 4 Ex. C.R. 390.\n[2] 18 Can.

Sec. 33 of this statute (ch. 30 of 1893) amended sec. 119 of the \" Municipal Act, 1892,\" so as to read as follows:\n\" No by-law to which the assent of the electors is necessary before the final passing thereof, shall be valid or of any effect unless the vote polled in favour thereof be that of a majority of the persons who shall vote upon such by-law.\nThis amendment changed the former statute by substituting the words \" a majority \" instead of the words \" at least three-fifths \" which were struck out of the clause previously in force. The 104th section of the \" Municipal Act, 1892,\" was amended by adding a new subsection conferring the powers granted by this section and its subsections upon the municipal councils of the cities of Vancouver and New Westminster, notwithstanding anything in the special Acts relating to said cities inconsistent with or repugnant to the provisions of the said sub-sections.\nThe 4th section of the \" Municipal Act, 1892,\" limits its application to the City of Vancouver, as follows : \" This Act shall be construed as applying to the cities of New Westminster and of Vancouver only so far as it is not repugnant to or inconsistent with their Acts of incorporation, or any amendments thereto, or any Acts or proclamations applicable to either of them, but nothing contained in this section shall be construed into restricting or modifying the power of the Executive Council or the Legislative Assembly with reference to those municipalities or the Acts relating to them,\" &c., &c.\nThe appellants contended that the by-law required only a majority vote and that the \" Municipal Act, 1892,\" as amended in 1893, overruled the provisions as to a three-fifths vote contained in sub-section 8, of sec. 127 of the \" Vancouver Incorporation Act \" as amended by sec. 7 of ch. 63 of 1893.\nMcCarthy Q.C. for the appellant.\nRobinson Q C. for the respondent.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014I agree with the judgment prepared by Mr. Justice Sedgewick in this case.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014I would dismiss this appeal. Mr. Justice McCreight's reasoning in the court below seems to me unanswerable. GWYNNE J.\u2014I am of opinion that this appeal must be dismissed for the reasons stated in the judgment of Mr. Justice McCreight. The language of the legislature in respect of the matter under consideration is certainly very equivocal, but the true solution of the ambiguity created by that language is to hold that the action of the city of Vancouver as to the obtaining the assent of the ratepayers to by-laws is governed by sec. 7 of ch. 63 of the Acts of 1893 of the province, and that therefore the assent of the majority of three-fifths of the votes thereon is necessary to the validity of the by-law in question.\nSEDGEWICK J.\u2014This is a proceeding instituted in the Supreme Court of British Columbia to quash a certain by-law, by which the mayor of the city of Vancouver was authorized to raise a certain sum of money for the purpose of constructing and operating a system of electric light. The ground upon which it was sought to have the by-law declared invalid was, that it had not received the assent of three-fifths, but only of a majority, of the ratepayers of the city. Mr. Justice Drake, before whom the matter first came, refused to quash. Upon appeal to the Divisional Court his judgment was reversed, and it is from that judgment this appeal is taken.\nThe city of Vancouver was incorporated by the Vancouver Incorporation Act, 1886. Subsection 8 of section 127 of that Act enacted, in reference to proceedings for the purpose of giving effect to money by-laws of the city, that :\nUpon receiving the returns for the several wards the city clerk shall add up the names, and if it shall appear from such returns that the total number of votes cast for such by-law be a majority of the votes polled, the city clerk shall forthwith declare such by-law carried ; otherwise he will declare the by-law lost. By an Act passed in 1893 this section was amended by substituting for the words \" a majority \" the words \" three-fifths.\" It would follow, therefore, that if there is no other statute law upon the subject the judgment of the court appealed from is right, and that the by-law should be quashed inasmuch as it did not receive three-fifths of the votes polled in its favour when it was submitted to the ratepayers of Vancouver. Now, upon what additional statutes is based the contention that the by-law in question only required a majority of the votes polled ? The Municipal Act of 1892, which is a general Municipal Act applying to the city of Vancouver as well as to other cities and townships indiscriminately, by section 104 gave municipal councils power to make by-laws for the constructing and operating of works for supplying the municipality with electric light. Section 119 provided that the by-law, in order to be valid, should receive the votes of three-fifths of the persons who voted upon it, and it was by virtue of the general provisions of this Act that the city of Vancouver purported to enact the by-law in question. Now, in 1893, section 119, just cited, was amended by substituting for the words \" three-fifths \" the words \" a majority,\" so that this somewhat unusual event, unexampled in the history of legislation, occurred. Prior to 1893 a by-law in Vancouver, enacted for electric light purposes, required the assent of a majority of the voters, whereas a similar by-law elsewhere in the province required the assent of three-fifths of the voters, and that, upon the passing of the two Acts of 1893, in Vancouver the assent of three-fifths was necessary, whereas elsewhere in the province only a majority was necessary.\nThe contention of the appellants is that the Act of 1893, amending the general Municipal Act, controls and in effect absolutely nullifies the Vancouver Act, relying on section 21of the Municipal Act, 1892, Amendment Act, 1893 :\nThe powers granted by this section 104, and its subsections, are hereby conferred upon the municipal councils of the cities of Vancouver and New Westminster, and the said section and its subsections shall apply to the said cities, notwithstanding anything in the special Acts relating to the said cities which may be inconsistent with, or repugnant to, the provisions of the said subsections.\nThe two Acts of 1893, above referred to, ch. 30 and ch. 63, were both passed at the same time, the 12th April of that year, and the sole question to be considered is whether the section just quoted must be read as in effect repealing section 7 of chapter 63. In my view every effort must be made to prevent such a result, and I think in the present case that effort was successfully made in the Divisional Court, before which this appeal was heard. Now, it is clear from the Amending Act of 1893, in relation to Vancouver, that it was passed at the instance and upon the petition of the municipality itself. The City Council had apparently, in specific terms, requested the legislature to enact that, in order to the validity of the money by\u2014law, it should receive the assent of three-fifths of the voters interested as theretofore. The legislature had apparently acceded to the request of the city, and had, in the exact terms of their request, enacted the amending statute. Is that amending statute to have no effect because, in a general Act passed in the same session, made applicable throughout the province, there was an express provision that by-laws of that character should require the assent of only a majority of the voters. I cannot hold that such an intent can be imputed to the legislature. The principle contained in the maxim generalia specialibus non derogant, forcibly applies here. A general later statute (and a fortiori a statute passed at the same time), does not abrogate an earlier special one by mere implication ; the law does not allow an interpretation that would have the effect of revoking or altering, by the construction of general words, any particular statute where the words may have their proper operation without it. As Maxwell says[1] :\nHaving already given its attention to the particular subject, and provided for it, the legislature is reasonably presumed not to intend to alter that special provision by a subsequent general enactment, unless that intention is manifested in explicit language, or there be something which shows that the attention of the legislature had been turned to the special Act, and that the general one was intended to embrace the special cases within the previous one, or something in the nature of the general one making it unlikely that an exception was intended as regards the special Act. The general statute is read as silently excluding from its operation the cases which have been provided for by the special one.\nRoberts v. Bury Commissioners [2] ; Thorpe v. Adams[3]. For this reason I am of opinion that the by-law in question, not having been carried as required by the specific provisions of the Vancouver charter, as amended by the Act of 1893, is invalid, and that the judgment of the court appealed from must be sustained.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nKING J. concurred.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant : A.

S. N. S. 5 ser. c. 104, s. 12 s.s. 7; orders 24 and 70 rule 2; order 35 rule 38.\nA judgment of a foreign court having the force of res judicata in the foreign country has the like force in Canada.\nUnless prevented by rules of pleading a foreign judgment can be made available to bar a domestic action begun before such judgment was obtained. The Delta (1 P. D. 393) distinguished. The combined effect of orders 24 and 70 rule 2, and s. 12, s.s. 7 of c. 104 R. S. N. S. 5 ser. will permit this to be done in Nova Scotia.\nThe provision of R. S. N. S. 5 ser. c. 104, order 35, rule 38, that evidence of a judgment recovered in a foreign country shall not be conclusive, in an action on such judgment in Nova Scotia, of its correctness, but that the defendant may defend such suit as fully as if brought for the original cause of action, cannot be invoked in favour of the defendant in Nova Scotia who has brought an unsuccessful action in a foreign court against the plaintiff.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, affirming the judgment of the plaintiff at the trial.\nThe action was brought by Hansen for damages occasioned by a collision between his ship \u201cThe Rolf\u201d and defendants\u2019 barque \u201cThe Emilie L. Boyd.\u201d Prior to the commencement of this action the defendants had taken proceedings against \u201cThe Rolf\u201d in the District Court of the United States for the Eastern District of New York, which resulted in a decision that \u201cThe Boyd\u201d was solely in fault for the collision, and this decision was affirmed by the United States Circuit Court of Appeal, the court of final resort in such cases. The present action was begun before judgment was given by the District Court, and the defendants pleaded thereto that the collision was solely due to the negligence of those in charge of \u201cThe Rolf.\u201d The plaintiff did not reply to this plea until the action in New York was concluded, when he set up the judgment therein as a conclusive answer. On the trial, before Mr. Justice Townshend, plaintiff had judgment, the learned judge holding that defendants were estopped by the foreign judgment from contesting the question as to whose negligence caused the collision, although he was of opinion, upon the evidence, that \u201cThe Rolf\u201d was toblame. The judgment of the trial judge was affirmed by the full court, and the defendants then appealed to this court.\nBorden Q.C. for the appellants. Under the authorities there is a distinction both between a foreign and domestic judgment and between a foreign and domestic lis pendens as to the effect on subsequent proceedings. Westlake on Private International Law[1].\nA foreign lis pendens gives no right to a party to have the second action stayed. Westlake on Private International Law[2]; McHenry v. Lewis[3]; Peruaian Guano Co. v. Bockwoldt[4]; Marsden on Collisions[5].\nIn Nova Scotia a foreign judgment is not an estoppel. R.S N.S. 5 ser. ch. 104. Order 35, Rule 38 of Judicature Act Rules.\nPlaintiff was bound to elect whether he would rely on estoppel or on the merits. Bigelow on Estoppel[6]; Scarf v. Jardine[7]. New combe Q.C. and Drysdale for the respondent. A judgment as a plea is a bar, and as evidence conclusive between the parties. Duchess of Kingston\u2019s Case[8], per DeGrey C.J.; and Lord Westbury applied this remark of Chief Justice DeGrey to a foreign judgment in Hunter v. Stewart[9].\nThe foreign judgment is conclusive though obtained after the institution of the domestic action. Marble v. Keyes[10]; Memphis &c. Railroad Co. v. Grayson[11]; Schuler v. Israel[12].\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by:\nKING J\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia in favour of the plaintiff, the present respondent.\nThe action was brought for damages occasioned by a collision on the high seas between respondent\u2019s ship \u201cRolf,\u201d and the appellants\u2019 barque \u201cEmilie C. Boyd,\u201d which resulted in the total loss of \u201cThe Boyd\u201d and in considerable damage to \u201cThe Rolf.\u201d\nThe appellants are domiciled in the province of Nova Scotia and the respondent in Norway. Prior to the commencement of this action the defendants in it began proceedings in the District Court of the United States for the Eastern District of New York, against \u201cThe Rolf\u201d in respect of the collision. The vessel was arrested and afterwards released on bail, the owner of \u201cThe Rolf\u201d appearing and defending the action. The libel charged generally that the collision was not due to any fault or negligence on the part of the owners of \u201cThe Boyd,\u201d or of those in charge of her, but was wholly due to the negligence of those in charge of \u201cThe Rolf\u201d specifying various negligent acts and omissions. To this the owner of \u201cThe Rolf\u201d replied, admitting the jurisdiction of the court, but denying that the collision was due to the fault or negligence of those in charge of \u201cThe Rolf,\u201d and charging that it was wholly due to the fault or negligence of those in charge of The Boyd.\u201d\nThe cause came on for trial before Benedict J., and on the 5th August, 1891, it was adjudged and decreed that the collision was due solely to the fault of those navigating \u201cThe Boyd,\u201d and that the libel should be dismissed with costs. This judgment was, on the 5th March, 1892, affirmed on appeal by the United States Circuit Court of Appeal, the court of final resort.\nPrior to the judgment of the District Court a statement of claim had been delivered by the owner of \u201cThe Rolf,\u201d and a statement of defence and also a counter claim had been filed by the owners of \u201cThe Boyd,\u201d but nothing further was done until the conclusion of the action in New York when the defendant in that action, and the plaintiff in this, filed a reply and answer to the statement of defence and counter-claim respectively setting up the foreign judgment as a conclusive answer. Upon trial before Mr. Justice Townshend the defendants were held to be precluded from again contesting the question of their negligence and judgment was rendered against them, although the learned judge expressed the opinion that, if free to do so, he should have arrived at a different conclusion upon the merits,, This judgment was affirmed by the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, Mr. Justice Weatherbe dissenting.\nIt is now established in English law that a judgment of a foreign court of competent jurisdiction having the force of res judicata in the foreign country has the like force in England. Bank of Australasia v. Nias[13]; Bank of Australasia v. Harding[14]; De Cosse Brissac v. Rathbone[15]; Godard v. Gray[16]. Before the conclusive character of foreign judgments in proceedings actively brought for the enforcement of their obligations was definitely settled, it was established that a judgment for the defendant in the foreign court was a conclusive bar to any attempt to re-open the matter in the English courts.\nThe exceptio rei judicatae under such circumstances, says Story[17], is entitled to universal conclusiveness and respect. This distinction has been very frequently recognized as having a just foundation in international justice * * We think it clear upon principle that if a person selected, as plaintiff, the tribunal of a foreign country as the one in which he would sue, he could not afterwards say that the judgment of that tribunal was not binding upon him. Schibsby v. Westenholz[18].\nNext, as to the extent to which the judgment concludes. Judgments in rem are conclusive against all the world, not only as to the rem itself but also as to the ground on which the tribunal professes to decide, or may be presumed to have decided. As to what constitutes proceedings in rem see Castrique v. Imrie[19]. Judgments in personam bind parties and privies, and. generally speaking, are conclusive at least upon the material issues tendered by the plaintiff\u2019s complaint.\nThe doctrine of estoppel by a former judgment between the same parties is one of the most beneficial principles of our jurisprudence, and has been less affected by legislation than almost any other.\nPer Miller J. in Aurora City v. West[20].\nThe very object of instituting courts of justice is that litigation should be decided, and decided finally. That has been felt by all jurists.\nPer Willes J. in Great Northern Railroad Co v. Mossop[21].\nIn the present case the appellants, as the plaintiffs in the District Court of the United States, distinctly tendered the material issue that \u201cThe Rolf\u201d was solely,. and \u201cThe Boyd\u201d not at all, to blame. Issue was joined upon this, and it was decided against the then plaintiffs.\nIn the present action they raise the precise issue again by their statement of defence and counter-claim. The evidence is that by the law of New York the decision upon the issue in the first action is deemed res judicata in the second. Its effect, therefore, would be to preclude defendants from again agitating the matter.\nThis conclusion, however, is as yet premature, for the defendants have several contentions remaining.\nFirst, that as the foreign judgment was obtained after the present action was begun it has not the force of res judicata. The Delta[22] is cited in support. One of the grounds of decision in that case was that the foreign judgments not having been given on the merits of the case, but on matters of form only, they could not be set up as a bar to a decision on the merits. It was also expressed to be doubtful whether the evidence showed that the judgments would have the force of res judicata in the foreign countries.\nIn these circumstances, although the principal ground of the judgment was expressed to be that at the time of action brought there was no res judicata but only a lis alibi pendens, there was no foundation for the application at all.\nThe case was one of collision between \u201cThe Delta\u201d and \u201cThe Foscolo.\u201d An action and a cross action were first begun in the foreign country. Afterwards an action, and a cross action were brought in England. Subsequent to the bringing of the English action by \u201cThe Foscolo\u201d against \u201cThe Delta,\u201d judgment was rendered ill both the foreign actions against \u201cThe Foscolo,\u201d in the one suit for want of appearance, and in the other for want of prosecution. Then \u201cThe Delta\u201d sought to set up these judgments as conclusive against \u201cThe Foscolo\u201d in the English actions.\nAssuming that the foreign judgments had been on the merits, and had the force of res judicata abroad, the reasons of the learned judge are as follows:\nIf the owners of \u201cThe Delta\u201d had wished to escape from having two suits against them for the same matter brought to a hearing they should have put the owners of \u201cThe Foscolo\u201d to their election, compelling them to abandon one or the other of the suits.\nThat is a rule of procedure entirely inapplicable in the case before us, where there are not two suits against the respondent and therefore no case for election at all.\nThe next reason is as follows:\nAs regards the suit against \u201cThe Foscolo\u201d (i.e. the English cross suit) that was brought by the owners of \u201cThe Delta\u201d while the foreign lis was pending; they cannot be heard therefore to object that that lis is a bar to a decision on the merits in this suit.\nAs a matter of fact the cross suit brought in England by \u201cThe Delta\u201d against \u201cThe Foscolo\u201d was not brought until after the judgments were obtained in the foreign suits; (see p. 403 near foot). It was, as to the cross action, a case, therefore, of waiver of the foreign judgment and of suing on the original cause of action.\nApart from technical rules of pleading there would not seem to be satisfactory reason, upon principle, for declining to give effect to a foreign judgment merely because it was obtained after the beginning of the action in which it is sought to be made available. The considerations of justice and public policy which dictate the rule of res judicata as applied to foreign judgments operate to prevent the defeat of the rule by technical considerations. Why should a plaintiff in a foreign action, by commencing fresh proceedings in another country on the eve of judgment rendered, become entitled to litigate the matter anew? Again, a person in the position of respondent, by discontinuing his suit and beginning again, may avail himself of the effect of the foreign judgment. It would result merely in a question of costs. No substantial objection therefore can be said to lie against the bringing forward of a defence based upon a judgment recovered after action brought.\nIn the United States courts it is held that when a matter is once adjudicated it is conclusively determined as between the parties and privies, and this determination is binding as an estoppel in all other actions whether commenced before or after the action in which the adjudication was made. Finley v. Hanbest[23]; Schuler v. Israel[24]. If the judgment is conclusive in its character in an action to be begun to-morrow, it ought to be possible, upon appropriate terms, to make it available in an action for the identical matter begun yesterday.\nIt is said that the rules of pleading do not admit of this being done, but I agree with the learned judges forming the majority of the Nova Scotia Court that the combined effect of orders 24 and 70 rule 2, and sec. 12, subsec. 7 of ch. 104 R.S.N.S., is sufficient to enable the essential rights of the parties to be brought in course of adjudication.\nIt is, however, further urged for the appellant, that by virtue of the provisions of ch. 104, order 35, rule 38 of R.S. N.S., the foreign judgment in this case cannot be relied upon as an estoppel.\nThe enactment is as follows: \u2014\nThe record or other evidence of a judgment recovered in any other province or country against any person domiciled in Nova Scotia, shall not be conclusive evidence in any action brought on such judgment in any court of this province of the correctness of such judgment, but the defendant may controvert all or any of the facts on which such judgment is founded, or the cause of action in the suit in which such judgment was given, and may raise the same defence in such suit on such judgment as he could have done as fully as if such suit had been brought for the original cause of action.\nThis is an enactment available only by persons domiciled in Nova Scotia. It is intended as a weapon of defence, and not of offence. It is not lightly to be supposed that the legislature, while leaving the foreign subject to be proceeded against in Nova Scotia upon the judgment obtained abroad by the person of Nova Scotia domicile, intended that the latter should be protected against the consequences of his own unsuccessful incursions into the foreign field. The closing words of the clause seem to show that nothing of this kind was intended. The domiciled defendant in the Nova Scotia action is to be free to open up the foreign judgment sought to be enforced against him \u201cas fully as if such suit (in Nova Scotia) had been brought for the original cause of action.\u201d The defendant in the foreign suit cannot be said to have had an original cause of action in the proceedings abroad.\nI therefore think the Act cannot be invoked for the appellant.\nFurther, it appears to me that the judgment should be sustained upon the merits. The reasons of the District Court of the United States seem satisfactory to my mind.\nThe result is that the appeal should be dismissed.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Borden, Ritchie, Parker & Chisholm.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Drysdale & McInnes.\n[1] 3 ed. p. 354.\n[2] 3 ed. pp. 357-8.\n[3] 22 Ch.

Cun\u00e9gonde from a judgment of the Superior Court on a petition to quash a by-law of the city.\nThe proceedings in this case were taken by the respondents who presented a petition to the Superior Court, under sec. 310 of the charter of the city of Ste. Cun\u00e9gonde, asking to have a by-law of the city annulled so far as it affected the petitioners. The Superior Court granted the prayer of the petition and the corporation took an appeal to the Court of Queen's Bench which appeal was quashed by the court which held that sec. 439 of the Town Corporations Act (40 Vie. ch. 29, R.S. Q. art. 4614) not having been excluded from the charter of the city must be read as forming a part of it and such section prohibited an appeal from any judgment of the Superior Court respecting municipal matters. The corporation then appealed to this court.\nCharbonneau for the respondent moved to have the appeal quashed.\nThere being no judgment of the. Court of Queen's Bench, the court of final resort in the province, on the merits of the case no appeal lies to this court. R.S.C. ch. 135 sec. 24 (g). Danjou v Marquis ([1]).\nThis case is not similar to Webster v The City of Sherbrooke ([2]), where the proceedings were to quash the by-law in toto but comes rather within Bell Telephone Go. v. The City of Quebec ([3]), and City of Sherbrooke v. Mc Manamy ([4]).\nTinder the statute law of Quebec the Court of Queen's Bench clearly had no jurisdiction to entertain an appeal.\nBe\u00efque Q.C., for the appellant, contra. The Court of Queen's Bench should have heard the appeal. The provisions of the charter of Ste. Cun\u00e9gonde cannot be controlled by a general municipal act except by express words. Rolfe v. The Corporation of Stoke ([5]).\nWe cannot be deprived of our appeal because the court of final resort wrongfully held that it was without jurisdiction. In Danjou v. Marcuis (1) the case never went to the Court of Queen's Bench.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by:\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE:\u2014the respondents, who are -municipal electors of the City of Ste. Cun\u00e9gonde, by a Petition to the Superior Court ask to have annulled by-law 73 passed by the City Council in regard to the imposition taxes for the construction of a certain drain so far as it affects the petitioners and their properties.\nThis petition was presented pursuant to article 310 of the city's special Act of incorporation (53 Vic. ch. 70) which is as follows:\nAny municipal elector may, in his own name, by a petition presented to the Superior Court, demand and obtain, on the ground of illegality the annulment of any by-law, resolution, assessment roll or apportionment; but the right of demanding such annulment is prescribed by two months from the date of the passing or completion of such by-law. resolution, assessment roll, or apportionment in the terms of article 8; and after that delay every such by-law, resolution, assessment roll or apportionment shall be considered valid and binding for all purposes whatsoever, provided the subject matter thereof be within the competence of the corporation.\nThe Superior Court (Doherty J.) annulled the bylaw upon certain grounds which, in view of the way in which the matter comes before this court, it is unnecessary to specify.\nThe City of Ste. Cun\u00e9gonde then appealed to the Court of Queen's Bench and that court, holding that it had no jurisdiction to entertain the appeal, quashed it with costs. The consid\u00e9rants of the judgment of the court are as follows:\nConsidering that the procedure in this cause was commenced by, petition to the Superior Court under the special provision of section 310 of the charter of the said City of Ste. Cun\u00e9gonde, 53 Vie. ch. 70 (Que.).\nAnd considering that section 439 of the Town Corporations Act, 40 Vic. ch. 29 which is applicable to the said special Act of incorporation of the said City of Ste. Cun\u00e9gonde, expressly prohibits any appeal from a judgment of a judge of the Superior Court in procedure taken under said Act.\nThe appellants thereupon a. applied to the registrar in chambers for leave to give security in appeal under section 46 of the Supreme and Exchequer Courts Act, which application was granted, the registrar being of opinion that the nature of the proceeding was similar to the one taken in Webster v Sherbrooke ([6]) and not to be distinguished from it, the petition in that case having been filed under sec. 4389 R. S. P. Q. which is identical in words with the first part of sec. 310 of the Act of incorporation of the appellants, and that therefore so far as the mere right of appealing to the Supreme Court was concerned, the case came within sec. 24 (g) of ch. 135 R. S. C.\nSec 4389 R.S.P. Q is as follows;\nAny municipal elector may, in his own name, by a petition presented. to the Superior Court or to one of the Judges thereof demand and obtain, on the ground of illegality, the annulment of any by-law of the Council, with costs against the corporation.\nBut the respondents have now moved to quash the appeal 1st because the appeal will not lie under sec. 24 (g) of the Supreme and Exchequer Courts Act, and 2nd because the Court of Queen's Bench was correct in holding that it had no jurisdiction, and that therefore no appeal would lie to this court, inasmuch as all appeals from the province of Quebec must, with the exception only of certain appeals from the Court of Review specially provided for, come to this court from the Court of Queen's Bench, and be appeals in which that court at least entertained jurisdiction and not in which, upon good and valid grounds, it has declined jurisdiction.\nI think the motion should be granted upon this second ground which was one with which the registrar very properly did not deal.\nThe question to be decided is : Was the Court of Queen's Bench right in holding article 439 of 40 Vic. ch. 29 applicable to the special .Act of incorporation of the appellants? That article is as follows;\nNo appeal shall lie under the provisions of this Act from any judgment rendered by any judge of the Superior Court, respecting municipal matters.\nSection 1 of that Act provides as follows:\nThe provisions of this Act shall apply to every town, corporation or municipality which shall hereafter be established by the legislature of this province, and they shall constitute part of the special Act relative to such town so as to form with it one and the same Act unless they be expressly modified or excepted.\nAnd section 441 says:\nThis Act may apply to city corporations which shall in future be incorporated; and in such case the word town\" shall be replaced by the word \"city\" every time that the meaning of this Act, thus applied, shall require it.\nThese provisions were re-enacted in the Revised. Statutes of the province of Quebec as follows:\nArt. 4178. The provisions of this chapter apply to every Town Corporation or municipality, established by the legislature of this province, and unless expressly modified or excepted they constitute part of its charter\nThe provisions thereof may also be applied to city corporations; and in such case the word \"town\" shall be replaced by the word u city,\" whenever the meaning of this chapter, thus rendered applicable shall require it.\n4179. For any of the provisions of this chapter not to be incorporated in the charter, it must be expressly declared that such provisions specifying them by their numbers shall not form part thereof.\nArt. 4614 (the article respecting appeals) is as follows:\nNo appeal lies under the provisions of this chapter from any judgment respecting municipal matters rendered by any judge of the Superior Court.\nMr. Justice Hall, in delivering the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench says:\nSection 439 of that Act (The Town Corporations Act 4614 R.S.P.Q.) not having been excluded from the Ste. Cun\u00e9gonde charter is therefore to be read as forming a part of it. The procedure in this case viz. the petition to the Superior Court by municipal electors, is nota common law procedure commenced by an ordinary writ of summons, but is peculiar to the special charter to the city, and must be governed therefore by the clause of the same charter which formally and unequivocally prohibits a right of appeal from a judgment of the Superior Court rendered in a procedure thus commenced.\nThis I adopt as a correct statement of the law applicable to the case. As has been correctly contended by the counsel for the respondents, inasmuch as under the Supreme and Exchequer Courts Act and amendments thereof, no appeals can be brought to the Supreme Court from any court in the province other than the Court of Queen's Bench, with the exception of appeals from the Court of Review in certain cases which do not include the present, and as the appeal in the present case did not lie to the Court of Queen's Bench and that court properly refused to entertain \"jurisdiction therein, it follows that no appeal will lie to this court.\nThat the provincial legislature may limit appeals to the Court of Appeal of the province must be admitted, although the effect of so doing may be take away in such cases a further appeal to the Supreme Court. And if called upon to express any opinion on the point, I should say that it is not to be regretted that a limit should be placed on appeals in municipal matters of the kind in question here.\nThe motion to quash is granted with costs.\nAppeal quashed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant : Adam & Plourde.\nSolicitor for the respondents : N.

Sec. had no power to bind the Crown by his signature to such a document; and that a subsequent vote of the legislature of a sum of money for printing \"liste des terres de la-Couronne,\" etc., was not a ratification of the agreement with D. the Government not being obliged to expend the money though authorized to do so and the vote containing no reference to the contract with D. nor to the said letter of credit Held also that a bank cannot deal in such securities as the said letter of credit which is dependent on the vote of the legislature and therefore not a negotiable instrument within the Bills of Exchange Act of 1890 or The Bank Act R.S.C. ch. 120 secs. 45 and 60.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada (appeal side), confirming a judgment of the Superior Court, District of Quebec, by which the appellant's petition of right was dismissed.\nThe facts appear fully in the judgment of Mr. Justice Girouard, the questions to be decided being shortly, whether the Provincial Secretary had power to bind the province by the letter to Dussault, set out in the above head-note, and if not, whether the subsequent vote of the amount by the legislature ratified his action in such a manner as to make the payment of the money obligatory upon the Government. Incidentally the questions were raised as to whether the \"Letter of Credit\" was a negotiable instrument, and if it could be accepted as a security under the provisions of the Bills of Exchange Act of 1890 and \"The Bank Act.\"\nLangelier Q.C. and Mackay for the appellant. The plaintiffs claim is not founded on the letter of credit alone but on the contract contained in it coupled with the vote of the legislature to pay for the work.\nThe Crown has had the benefit of Dassault's work, and is liable even if the contract entered into by the provincial secretary was not authorized.\nAfter the legislature had ratified the contract made by the provincial secretary and the money was voted, Dassault had a vested right in such money and the plaintiff, as his assignee, is in the same position.\nTo say that this right is to be denied for want of an order in council is to put the lieutenant-governor m council above the legislature.\nCasgrain Q.C., Attorney-General for Quebec, and Darveau Q.C. for the respondent. A member of the executive council cannot bind the Crown by a mere undertaking that money will be voted to pay for work \" to be done. R. S. Q., art. 707, provides for the powers and duties of the provincial secretary and shows that this letter of credit, so-called, was a nullity.\nThen if the letter was a nullity it could not be ratified or confirmed. Art. 1214 C.C.; Dal. ([1]) Aubry & Ran ([2]); Brice on Ultra Vires ([3]); Banque Jacques-Carlier v. La Banque d'Epargne ([4]).\nWhatever value the letter might have had the plaintiff has no locus slanti to enforce it. It was not a negotiable instrument, and the indorsement to the bank had no effect. The Bank Act of 1890 ([5]) specifies what securities can be transferred to a bank and this letter is not negotiable under that section\nEven if it could have been ratified the legislature was not in possession of all the facts without which there could be no acquiescence or ratification.\nThe vote of the legislature authorized the government to expend the money, but did not oblige them to do so. Hereford Railway Co. v. The Queen ([6]).\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014I concur in the judgment prepared by Mr. Justice Girouard in this case.\nTASCHEREAU J. I also concur in the opinion of Mr, Justice Girouard.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014There exists, in my opinion, no ground whatever upon which this appeal can be maintained. The letter of Mr. Langelier of the 14th January, 1891, to Mr. Dussault, constituted no contract between Mr. Dussault and the provincial government so neither did Mr. Langelier's letter of the 24th January, 1891. This letter contained a promise which, inasmuch as it does not appear to have been made by, or by the authority of, the provincial government had no obligation or effect, further than as the promise of Mr. Langelier himself to the effect that if the Provencal legislature should, in the estimates of 1891-2, vote the sum of $6,000 for printing the list of Crown lands granted since 1763 up to the 31st December, 1890, of which work the letter adds,\nje vous ai confi\u00e9 l'impression dans une lettre en date du 14 Janvier 1891,\nsuch sum should be paid to Mr. Dussault immediately after the session. This letter also contained the words following :\nCette somme de six mille piastres sera pay\u00e9e au porteur de Ta pr\u00e9sente lettre rev\u00eatue de votre endossement.\nDussault indorsed this letter in manner following :\nPav\u00e9 au Porteur.\nJOSEPH DUSSAULT.\nand handed it to the bank, the now appellants. Now the provincial government, not having been bound by anything contained in these letters, could not, and indeed it is admitted that Dassault did not, by the above indorsement thereon vest in the bank any claim enforceable in law against the provincial government in virtue of the so-called letter of credit, and that was conceded by the appellant. However, by an Act of the legislature of the province of Quebec passed upon the 24th day of June, 1892, that legislature granted to Her Majesty, in the supply bill of that year, the sum of $ 9.872.65 in the terms following:\nFor various works of Canadian authors collection de monnaies et m\u00e9dailles; account for printing liste des terres de la couronne depuis 1763 jusqu'au 31 Dec. 1890, and other accounts for sundry expenditure.\nAnd now it is contended that the effect of this vote was to make the letter of the 24th. January 1891 a contract binding upon the Government of the province of Quebec although that letter by itself had. no such effect and to vest in Dussault an absolute right to demand and recover from the Government the said sum of $6,000, and further that as the bank upon the 30th day of June, 1892, six days after the close of the session, caused an authorized notarial protest and signification of the transfer by Dussault to the bank of the said letter of the 24th January, 1891 by indorsement thereon to be served upon the Government, the bank thereby became entitled to demand and recover from the Government the said sum of $6000 \u00b0 in short that we must assume that by this vote the legislature contemplated imposing upon the Provincial Government an obligation which had never been incurred by the Government and so in effect to relieve the Govern-ment of the \"province from its constitutional responsibility for the application of so much of the $9,872.65 as related to the purpose of printing the list mentioned in the item which contained the grant. If the legislature had entertained any such singular, if not unconstitutional, intention they should have expressed themselves in language clear and express beyond all controversy; from the language which they have used no such intention can be inferred\u00bb The plain and natural construction of the item containing the grant of the $9,872.88, is that this sum is granted to Her Majesty to be expended for the purposes named in the grant at the discretion of the Provincial Government but subject to the ordinary control of Parliament over the manner in which all moneys granted to the Crown for specific purposes shall he expended, and did not divest the Government of its duty to see to the proper application of the moneys, or impose upon the Government a contract it had never entered into nor authorized.\nThe appeal must be dismissed with costs. SEDGEWICK and KING JJ. concurred.\nGIROUARD J. The appellants, by their petition of right, claim from the province of Quebec the sum of $6000 and interest from the 29th June, 1892, being the amount due on a certain letter, commonly styled a letter of credit, signed by the honourable Charles Langrlier, provincial secretary, payable to Joseph Dussault or order, and indorsed by Dussault to the appellants.\nIt appears that on the 29th December, 1890, the legislative assembly of Quebec passed the following resolution:\nThat there be laid before this House an alphabetical index of the concessions of land made by the Crown since 1763 as far as December 1st, 1890, county by county and township by township.\nOn the 14th of January, 1891, the provincial secretary wrote the following letter to Joseph Dussault, printer, of Quebec :\nBureau du Secr\u00e9taire de la Province de Qu\u00e9bec.\nCABINET DU MINISTRE,\nQUEBEC, 14 Janvier 1891.\nMonsieur JOSEPH DUSSAULT, Qu\u00e9bec.\nMONSIEUR A la derni\u00e8re session l'Assembl\u00e9e L\u00e9gislative a vot\u00e9 une adresse demandant la production d'une \"Liste comt\u00e9 par comt\u00e9, canton par canton de toutes les terres de la Couronne conc\u00e9d\u00e9es depuis 1763, jasqu'au 31 d\u00e9cembre 1890.\nPlusieurs personnes, notamment des registrateurs, ayant d\u00e9ja demand\u00e9 la publication de ce document, j'ai d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de la faire imprimer et je vous en confie par la pr\u00e9sente l'impression, dans les deux langues, et cela aux prix et conditions actuellement en force pour les contrats d'impression de la legislature.\nLa copie vous sera fournie par M. le d\u00e9put\u00e9-r\u00e9gistraire dont vous devrez suivre les directions quant \u00e0 la confection de l'ouvrage, au format du volume et au nombre d'exemplaires \u00e0 tirer, en fran\u00e7ais et en anglais.\nJ'ai l'honneur d'\u00eatre Monsieur,\nVotre ob\u00e9issant serviteur,\nCHS.

LANGELIER,\nSecr\u00e9taire de la province.\nThis letter of credit as well as the contract were made without the authority of an order in council\nAn appropriation was voted by the Legislature of Quebec at the session held in 1892 which will be found as item 15 schedule A of the statutes of the province of Quebec, 55 & 56 Vic. ch. 1, in the following words:\n15. For various works of Canadian authors collection des monnaies et m\u00e9dailles, account for printing liste des terres de la Couronne conc\u00e9d\u00e9es depuis 1763 jusqu'au 31 d\u00e9cembre 1890 and other documents for sundry expenditure, $9,872.65.\nFrom the evidence of Mr. Verret, provincial auditor, it appears that the amount of the \"letter of credit \" was included in the sum of $9872655 but this information was not communicated to the House nor was the contract with Dussault or the letter of credit made known.\nThe appellants fyled their petition of right on the 21st April 1893, alleging that the letter of credit had been transferred to them to enable Dassault to commence the work of printing. The action is based upon the letter of credit only and not upon the transfer of moneys that might become due under the contract; in fact such an action could not the taken as the work was only about half done when the petition of right was fyled and not even commenced when the letter of credit was signed.\nThe respondents met this action by what may be termed a g\u00e8neral denegation, coupled with a general G averment that all these transactions and dealings were ultra vires and illegal.\nThe action was dismissed by the Superior Court (Andrews J.), and his judgment was confirmed by the Court of Appeal on the 3rd May 1895, Blanchet J. dissenting. \"We have not before us the remarks of the learned judges who formed the majority, of the Court of Appeal and we must assume that they agreed in the reasons given by the learned judge of the Superior Court. Mr. Justice Blauchet has sent the notes of his dissent.\nMr. Justice Andrews had no hesitation in declaring that no power exists in a member of the executive to bind the province by his signature to a document such as that claimed on by the appellants, and such is also the opinion of Mr. Justice Blanchet; in fact this point was conceded by counsel for the appellant at the bar of this court. The order of the Assembly in 1890 was only to the effect that the alphabetical index \"should be laid before the House. No authority was ever given to print the same, and it does not appear that the index ever was laid before the House. With regard to the printing of old papers, manuscripts and archives, art. 718 R.S.Q. entrusts the lieutenant-governor In council with the printing of the same, in whole or in part. Therefore the alphabetical index in question could not have been printed upon the mere order of a minister.\nMr Justice Blanchet and the appellants relied upon the appropriation by the legislature as a sufficient ratification. Mr. Justice Andrews entertains a different view, which, was affirmed on appeal. He says; \u2014\nThe question therefore arises:. Is this a ratification of\" the issue of the letter of credit sued on and of a character such as to make of document obligatory on the province and giving rise to a right of action in favour of the bank, as holding it? I do not think so. It certainly put it in the power of the executive to pay the amount, but . it did not force them to do so. Mr. Todd, vol. 2, page 43, says :\n\"A vote in Committee of Supply is in the nature of a maximum. It is not imperative on the Government to spend the whole or any part of the amount granted hut it is a matter of discretion,\"\nIt is very hard to understand how a ratification can result from the vote of the Assembly worded as it is, viz:\nListe des terres de la Couronne conc\u00e9d\u00e9es depuis 1763 jusqu'au 31 d\u00e9cembre, 1890, and other documents.\nNo reference is made to the contract with Dassault not to the letter of credit, and it is a well settled \"jurisprudence that acquiescence and ratification must be founded on the full knowledge of the facts. La Banque Jacques-Cartier v. La Banque d'Epargne ([7]); Dalloz ([8]); Art. 1214 C.C.\nThe appellants have relied upon the opinion of Chief Justice Lacoste in The (Queen v. Waterfous Engine Wotus Co. (2) * but the learned Chief Justice was also of the opinion that the minister had no power to bind the Crown by a contract similar to the one in question in this cause without an order in council and he merely dissented in view of the fact proved in the case that the work had been done delivered and accepted by the Government. His remarks, therefore, do not apply to the present case. It will be time to examine whether Dussault or the appellants as his transferees are entitled to anything at all from the\n(3) 0. R. 3 Q. B 223. Government for work and labour when a proper suit has been brought therefore. The present action is for money lent by a bank upon an alleged guarantee of the province, and I have no hesitation in saying that the province is not liable.\nFinally it seems to me that the bank could not deal in such securities as the one sued upon in the present g instance. The letter of credit is conditional viz : it is dependent upon the vote of the legislature, and therefore it cannot be held to be a negotiable instrument either within the Bills of Exchange Act of 1890, or within the Bank Act then in force, E. S. C ch. 120 ss. 45,60. Banks dealing with Governments, or in Government securities, should carefully examine not only the powers of the persons acting on their behalf but also the paper offered by them, and if they fail to do so it is at their risk and peril. They have only themselves to blame if ultimately they are without a legal remedy especially m a case like the present where the transaction on its face is stamped with illegality. The only recourse left to them is a political one, but it is hardly necessary to say that that is beyond the province of a court of justice.\nFor these reasons I am of opinion that the appeal should be dismissed with costs, and the judgment appealed from affirmed.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant : P.

The Court of Review gave effect to this contention and ordered the boundaries to be placed according to it, in which judgment both parties acquiesced and another surveyor was appointed to execute it. He reported that he had placed the boundaries as directed by the Court of Review but that his measurements showed that the line indicated was not in the line of the old fence and his report was refected by the Superior Court. The Court of Review, however, held that the report of the first surveyor, having been homologated by the court, was final as to the location of the fence and that the judgment had been properly executed The Court of Queen's Bench reversed this judgment set aside the last report and ordered the surveyor to place the boundaries in the true line of the old fence.\nMeld reversing the decision of the Court of Queen's Bench, that the judgment of the Court of Review in which the parties acquiesced was chose judge between them not only that the division line between the properties must be located on the line of the old fence but that such line was one starting at the \"point indicated in the plan and report of the first surveyor.

(Defendants) Respondents.\n1895: May 20; 1895: December 9.\nPresent: Sir Henry Strong C.J., and Taschereau, Gwynne, Sedgewick and King JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.\nConstruction of statute\u201455 V. c. 26, ss. 2 and 4 (O.)\u2014Chattel mortgage\u2014Agreement not to register\u2014Void mortgage\u2014Possession by creditor.\nBy the act relating to chattel mortgages (R.S.O. [1887] c. 125), a mortgage not registered within five days after execution is \u201cvoid as against creditors,\u201d and by 55 V. c. 26, s. 2 (O.) that expression is extended to simple contract creditors of the mortgagor or bargainor suing on behalf of themselves and other creditors, and to any assignee for the general benefit of creditors within the meaning of the act respecting assignments and preferences\u201d (R.S.O. [1887] c. 124). By sec. 4 of 55 V. c. 26 a mortgage so void shall not, by subsequent possession by the mortgagee of the things mortgaged, be made valid \u201cas against persons who became creditors * * before such taking of possession.\u201d\nHeld, reversing the decision of the Court of Appeal, that under this legislation a mortgage so void is void as against all creditors, those becoming such after the mortgagee has taken possession as well as before, and not merely as against those having executions in the sheriff\u2019s hands at the time possession is taken, simple contract creditors who have commenced proceedings to set it aside and an assignee appointed before the mortgage was given; that the words \u201csuing on behalf of themselves and other creditors,\u201d in the amending act, only indicate the nature of proceedings necessary to set the mortgage aside, and that the same will enure to the benefit of the general body of creditors; and that such mortgage will not be made valid by subsequent taking of possession.\nHeld, per Strong C.J., that where a mortgage is given in pursuance of an agreement that there shall be neither registration nor immediate possession such mortgage is, on grounds of public policy, void ab initio. APPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] reversing the judgment for plaintiffs at the trial.\nOn October 10th, 1893, one Davis executed a mortgage of all his stock in trade and other personal property to the defendants, McMaster & Co., one of the terms of which mortgage was that if Davis should pay fifty dollars per week to defendants on account of his indebtedness it would not be registered and upon failure of Davis to make such payment at any time defendants could take immediate possession. The mortgagor having made default defendants took possession, on Nov. 7th, 1893, of the property mortgaged and on Nov. 13th, Davis made an assignment under the Ontario Act to the plaintiff Clarkson for the benefit of all his creditors.\nA writ was issued by the assignee and by a simple contract creditor of the insolvent on behalf of all the creditors against McMaster & Co. to have the mortgage set aside. On the trial before Mr. Justice MacMahon judgment was given for the plaintiffs, the trial judge holding that the mortgage was given in good faith, but that it was void for want of registration. The Court of Appeal reversed this judgment holding that under 55 Vic. ch. 26, which amended the Act relating to chattel mortgages, R.S.O. [1887] ch. 125, the mortgage could only be void as against execution creditors or simple contract creditors who had commenced proceedings to set it aside, or an assignee in the same position, and that the plaintiffs in this case did not come within the statute. The plaintiffs appealed from that decision.\nS.H. Blake Q.C. for the appellants. Under 55 Vic. ch. 26 s. 4, if a mortgage is void for want of registra- tion the taking of possession by the mortgagee is of no avail.\nThe obvious intention of this amending Act was to make the mortgage void against all simple contract creditors as well as those having execution.\nThe agreement not to register the mortgage was a fraud on the creditors; Jones v. Kinney[2]; Ex parte Fisher[3]; Clarkson v. Sterling[4]; and such agreement, in connection with the other facts of the case, shows that a fraudulent preference was intended.\nThompson Q.C. for the respondents. The finding of the trial judge that the mortgage was given in good faith should not be disturbed. Grasett v. Carter[5].\nPrior to 55 Vic. ch. 26 a mortgage not registered was void as against execution creditors only. Parkes v. St. George[6].\nThe plaintiffs other than the assignee have no locus standi to impeach the transaction after the assignment; R.S.O. (1887) ch. 124, sec. 7, subsec. 1; nor after the mortgaged goods are sold; Ross v. Dunn[7]; Gillard v. Bollert[8]; Meriden Britannia Co. v. Braden[9].\nThe assignee, not having been appointed until after the mortgagee took possession, is not within the provisions of sec. 2 of 55 Vic. ch. 26.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014In the view which I take of this case it is not necessary that I should express any positive opinion as to the validity and bona fides of the mortgage so far as it is impeached upon the grounds of the mortgagor\u2019s insolvency and as a fraudulent preference, and therefore I refrain from doing so. I may say, however, that upon facts disclosed by the evidence, which are undisputed, and which are therefore open for consideration by an appellate court, I should entertain grave doubts as to the validity of the transaction as against the creditors of the mortgagor, apart altogether from the non-delivery of possession, the want of registration, and the express agreement not to register the mortgage, questions which I propose to consider.\nUnder the statute law regulating chattel mortgages in the province of Ontario, applicable to the mortgage now in question, I am of opinion that the appellants were entitled to attack the transaction, thus differing from the majority of the Court of Appeal, and agreeing in the conclusion of the learned Chief Justice of Ontario.\nThe general Act relating to mortgages of chattels[10] was amended and extended by Ontario statute 55 Vic. c. 26. By the second section of that act it was enacted as follows:\nIn the application of the said act, and of this act extending and amending the same, the words \u201cvoid as against creditors\u201d in said act shall extend to simple contract creditors of the mortgagor or bargainor suing on behalf of themselves and other creditors, and to any assignee for the general benefit of creditors within the meaning of the Act respecting Assignments and Preferences by Insolvent Persons, and amendments thereto, as well as to creditors having executions against the goods and chattels of the mortgagor or bargainor in the hands of the sheriff or other officer.\nAnd section 4 of the same act provides:\nA mortgage or sale declared by said act to be void as against creditors and subsequent purchasers or mortgagees shall not, by the subsequent taking of possession of the things mortgaged or sold by or on behalf of the mortgagee or bargainee, be thereby made valid as against persons who became creditors, or purchasers, or mortgagees, before such taking of possession.\nThese enactments were undoubtedly intended by the legislature to obviate the construction which the courts had put upon the provisions embodied in the chapter 125 of the Revised Statutes of Ontario. Section 1 of that act provides that:\nEvery mortgage of goods and chattels, not accompanied by immediate delivery, &c., shall within five days from the execution thereof be registered, &c.\nAnd section 4 of the same act provides that:\nIn case such mortgage or conveyance and affidavits are not registered as hereinbefore provided, the mortgage or conveyance shall be absolutely null and void as against creditors of the mortgagor, and against subsequent purchasers or mortgagees in good faith for valuable consideration.\nThe mortgage now in question was not registered within the prescribed time, nor was there any immediate delivery of the mortgaged goods. A line of decisions in the courts of the province had, previously to the passing of the Act of 1892, established that in the construction of the first section of the Chattel Mortgage Act just set forth, the word \u201ccreditors\u201d was to be construed as meaning \u201cjudgment creditors,\u201d and the words \u201cnull and void\u201d as meaning \u201cvoidable.\u201d It was also held that the mortgagee might at any time validate a mortgage invalid for want of possession or registration by taking possession of the mortgaged property. If it were necessary now to determine whether this construction was or was not correct I am compelled to say, with great respect for the opinions referred to, that I should find great difficulty in agreeing with these decisions. First, I see no reason why the word \u201ccreditors\u201d should be restricted to a particular class of creditors, viz., judgment creditors. Why should the same word receive a different construction in this Act from that which it has received as used in the statute of the 13th Elizabeth? I see no reason for any such distinction. It is true that equitable execution as consequential on the avoidance of a transaction under the 13th Elizabeth could not, under the old system of separate jurisdictions for law and equity, have been obtained by any but judgment creditors[11], but the deed was nevertheless held to be void as against simple contract creditors. In Reese River Mining Co. v. Atwell[12], it was held by Lord Romilly M.R. that simple contract creditors were entitled to a decree declaring a deed void under the Statute of Elizabeth, though not having obtained a judgment at law they could not have had equitable execution, and, as is pointed out in May on Fraudulent Conveyances (2 ed. p. 528), this was only carrying out what is said in the judgment of Lord Hardwicke in Higgins v. York Buildings Co.[13], where occurs the following passage:\nI do not know in the case of fraudulent conveyances that this court has ever done anything more than remove fraudulent conveyances out of the way* * * nor any instance of a decree for sale, but equity follows the law and leaves them to their remedy by elegit without interfering one way or the other.\nAnd that an instrument fraudulent under the statute was void against all creditors, was also demonstrated by the well established practice of courts of equity in administering assets, which was not to require a judgment at law, but to treat deeds fraudulent under the statute as void against all creditors, and to deal with the property purported to be conveyed by such instruments as assets for the payment of simple contract as well as all other creditors. Then, there are reasons which, in my opinion, require a liberal construction of the word \u201ccreditors,\u201d derived from the manifest policy of the Chattel Mortgage Act. Registration or possession were required manifestly for the protection, not only of actual creditors, but of those who might become creditors, relying on the visible possession of property by their debtor, and the absence from the appropriate registry of any charge upon that property; and this for the protection of those who had not had the opportunity of recovering judgment, creditors payment of whose claims might be deferred, or who had not had time to get judgment.\nAgain, I am not impressed with the soundness of the construction which reads the terms \u201cabsolutely null and void\u201d as \u201cvoidable.\u201d So to cut down the words of the Act is, I venture to say, in direct conflict with the manifest policy of the legislature, and is not justified by the consideration that creditors could not have the mortgaged chattels applied in payment of their debts until they had recovered judgment. The rule requiring a judgment at law to entitle a party to equitable execution is to be ascribed to the reluctance of the equity courts in former times to entertain legal questions; such questions were always sent to a court of law to be determined. The creditor\u2019s right to recover his debt was a purely legal question, and therefore he had to establish it by a judgment at law. This, however, by no means involved the necessity of saying that a deed was not void under the Statute of Elizabeth as against simple contract creditors. The authorities I have already referred to show that this proposition must be correct. Then, for these reasons, deduced from the Statute of Elizabeth and the decisions on that Act, and on the policy which led to the legislation embodied in the Chattel Mortgage Act, I should have thought the word \u201ccreditors\u201d in the latter act ought to be construed as embracing all creditors. It follows from this that there was no sound reason for cutting down the expression \u201cabsolutely null and void\u201d to \u201cvoidable.\u201d\nLastly, if a chattel mortgage not registered within the limited time, and where no possession had been taken, was absolutely null and void at the expiration of five days as against all creditors, I am unable to see how such a void security could be revived by the creditor simply taking possession of the goods. In the case of Barker v. Leeson[14], the learned Chancellor of Ontario delivered a judgment which, in my opinion, contains, not only a correct construction of the statute, but also a sound exposition of the policy of the law and the intent of the legislature in enacting it.\nThe Act of 1892 was, however, passed by way of altering and amending the law as established by the authorities referred to, and it impliedly recognizes the construction thus placed upon the first statute as being, at the time of the passing of the later act, the existing law. I do not, therefore, intend to decide this case upon my own view as to the proper interpretation of the original act, but assuming that the previous decisions are binding authorities, I propose to place the decision of this appeal entirely upon the amending Act 55 Vic. ch. 26, thus following the course of the learned Chief Justice of Ontario, who did not conceive himself in any way precluded by the state of the authorities from so doing. And doing this I come to the same conclusion as the learned Chief Justice.\nThe second section of the Act announces that it is the intention of the legislature thereby \u201cto extend and amend\u201d the existing law. How any extending or amending effect can be attributed to the act consistently with the judgment now under appeal I am unable to see. Nothing can be more explicit and distinct than the declaration of the legislature, that mortgages in relation to which the requirements of the original act have not been complied with shall be void as against simple contract creditors. I do not construe this declaration as in any way fettered with any condition as to the form of suit; all I understand to have been meant by the words \u201csuing on behalf of them- selves and other creditors,\u201d was just this, that the mortgage, being void as to all, any action which might be brought to obtain the benefit of the nullity enacted by the statute should be on behalf of all creditors, so that all, and not merely those suing, might obtain the benefit of the Act. Then, applying this in the present case, this mortgage became absolutely null and void at the expiration of the five days allowed for registration. Then, the same second section provides that this avoidance shall enure to the benefit, not only of creditors who may sue on behalf of themselves and others, but also to the benefit of all creditors suing by their representative the statutory assignee for the benefit of creditors, who undoubtedly represents the creditors just as much as does in England an assignee in bankruptcy; and we constantly find cases reported in which such last mentioned assignees maintain actions to set aside deeds executed before their appointment. That being so, this mortgage being thus absolutely void under the Act of 1892, when the term for registration had elapsed, whatever the law may have been before, the assignee was entitled to maintain this action so soon as the assignment to him was completed, and I should be prepared so to hold even if there was not now a single creditor whose debt existed at the date of the mortgage, but only creditors whose debts had been contracted subsequently, for I think in construing these Acts (the Revised Statutes and the amending Act together) we ought not to restrict the avoidance of the mortgage to actual creditors at its date, but to extend its benefits to subsequent creditors, and that not only for the reasons stated in the judgment of the Chancellor before referred to, but on the very words of the fourth section of 55 Vic. ch. 26. This fourth section, in my opinion, very clearly indicates that creditors subsequent to the mortgage were intended to be included, for it expressly provides that taking possession under a mortgage void as against creditors shall not validate it against creditors who became such before taking possession.\nThen, did the subsequent taking possession validate this mortgage if it was, at the time possession was taken, absolutely \u201cnull and void\u201d? If the foregoing reasons and conclusions are correct this may be answered in the very words of section four itself, which says in so many words that a mortgage declared to be void as against creditors and subsequent purchasers or mortgagees shall not, by the subsequent taking of possession of the things mortgaged, be thereby made valid as against persons who became creditors before such taking of possession. Creditors now represented by the assignee became creditors before the taking of possession, and, therefore, upon the express words of the Act which require no construing, since what is already plain and explicit does not bear interpretation, the possession did not set up this mortgage against the assignee nor against the creditors suing conjointly with him.\nLastly, I am of opinion that this mortgage ought to be avoided on a ground altogether distinct from that before considered. Not only was there a non-compliance with the conditions of the Act in respect of registration and taking possession, but there was a distinct agreement between the mortgagor and mortgagee that there should be neither registration nor immediate possession; in other words, that a transaction which the law required should be open and notorious, to be made so either by registering the mortgage or taking possession of the goods, should be concealed from subsequent creditors, purchasers and mortgagees. This mortgage was therefore given in pursuance of an agreement to contravene the statute and was, therefore, on grounds of public policy void ab initio. Whether the mortgagor was, or was not, insolvent at the date of the mortgage, this agreement, in my opinion, constituted what has been called a fraud upon the statute, and this upon the authority of the cases of Jones v. Kinney[15], Ex parte Fisher[16], and Clarkson v. Sterling[17], cited in the appellant\u2019s factum, in itself constitutes a distinct ground for holding the mortgage to have been a nullity as against creditors from the beginning and therefore void as against such persons even before the expiration of the term allowed for registration had expired.\nI have seen the case of Morris v. Morris[18], but I find nothing in that authority to alter the opinion I had previously formed. The statute there under consideration differed in important respects from that which applies to the present case.\nThe appeal must be allowed with costs in this court and in the Court of Appeal, and the judgment of Mr. Justice MacMahon must be restored.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014I concur in the judgment of Mr. Justice Gwynne.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014Prior to the amendment of ch. 125 R.S.O. by sec. 2 of ch. 26 of 55 Vic., it had been held by the courts in Ontario that the words \u201ccreditors of the mortgagor\u201d in sec. 1 of the said ch. 125, meant only \u201cexecution creditors,\u201d and that if a chattel mortgage not accompanied by immediate possession of the chattels mortgaged should not be registered as required by the statute, and the mortgagee should take possession of the chattels mentioned in the mortgage at any time before there should be a creditor of the mortgagor in existence having an execution, he should hold the chattels under the mortgage, notwithstanding that it had not been registered as required by the statute, and I cannot entertain a doubt that the amendment made by 55 Vic. ch. 26, sec. 2, was for the express purpose of remedying the effect of this construction which had been put upon the statute by the courts, and that the effect of such amendment was to provide that the words \u201ccreditors of the mortgagor\u201d in ch. 125, should no longer be construed as applying only to \u201cexecution creditors,\u201d but to all simple creditors as well, the words \u201csuing upon behalf of themselves and other creditors\u201d being inserted merely as indicating the proceeding in which the mortgage not registered as required by the statute should be adjudged to be fraudulent and void as against simple contract creditors. Then the 4th sec. of 55 Vic. ch. 26, enacts that a mortgage void by the act as against creditors, that is to say, against all creditors of the mortgagor, including simple contract creditors as well as execution creditors, shall not be made valid as against persons becoming creditors, whether by simple contract or execution, after the execution of the mortgage, but before the taking possession by the mortgagee of the chattels mortgaged; thus legislatively overruling wholly in the future the construction which the courts had put upon ch. 125. To confine sec. 4 to execution creditors only would be inconsistent both with the letter and with the spirit of the enactment, which was to place simple contract creditors upon the same footing as execution creditors.\nIn the present case, it appears to be clear that the intention of the parties to the mortgage was to endeavour to evade the provision of the Chattel Mortgage Act as to registration, for it was expressly agreed that the mortgage was not to be registered unless nor until default should be made by the mortgagor in payment of some one of the instalments mentioned in the mortgage. Such an agreement, whatever may have been the actual intent of the parties, was calculated, if it should be sustained, to defraud creditors who might sell to the mortgagor goods upon credit upon the faith that there was no mortgage in existence, none being registered, and thus would be effected the very thing which the statute was intended to prevent, namely, a transaction which should have the effect of defrauding other persons being or becoming creditors of the mortgagor upon the faith that his property was not mortgaged. Upon the 10th of October, 1893, the mortgage was executed subject to the above agreement as to non-registration. On the 7th November, 1893, the mortgagee took possession of the chattels mentioned in the mortgage, which by reason of its non-registration was, by the statute 55 Vic. ch. 26, declared to be void as against all persons who were then creditors of the mortgagor within the meaning of the statute, that is to say, whether by simple contract or by having execution. On the 10th November, 1893, the mortgagor made an assignment for the benefit of all his creditors to the appellant, who thereby represented all the creditors and who is entitled to all the relief which such creditors would, in the absence of such assignment, have been entitled to in a suit instituted by any one on behalf of himself and the other creditors. The act as amended by 55 Vic. ch. 26 in effect enacts that a mortgage of chattels not accompanied by immediate delivery shall, within five days from the execution thereof, be registered, &c., and that in case it be not so registered it shall be absolutely void as against all creditors of the mortgagor, including simple contract creditors, and against any assignee for the benefit of creditors within the meaning of the act respecting assignments and preferences by insolvent persons, and the amendments thereto. That the plaintiff is such an assignee cannot, I think, admit of a doubt. It is impossible, in my opinion, to construe the act as amended as applying only to an assignee in existence prior to the mortgagee taking possession, without defeating what appears to have been the plain intent of the statute 55 Vic. ch. 26, namely, to make an unregistered mortgage fraudulent and void as against all creditors of the mortgagor in existence at the time of the mortgagee taking possession of the chattels mortgaged, whether the remedy should be sought by an assignee for the benefit of all the creditors whenever made such assignee, or by any of the creditors suing on behalf of all. The appeal must, in my opinion, be allowed with costs, and judgment be ordered to be entered for the plaintiff in the court below with costs.\nSEDGEWICK and KING JJ. were also of opinion that the appeal should be allowed and the judgment of MacMahon J. restored.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Teetzel, Harrison & McBrayne.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Thompson, Henderson & Bell.\n[1] 22 Ont.
