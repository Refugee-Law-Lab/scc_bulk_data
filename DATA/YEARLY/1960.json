Boland, [1960] S.C.R. 203\nDate: 1960-01-26\nThe Globe and Mail Limited (Defendant) Appellant;\nand\nJohn Boland (Plaintiff) Respondent.\n1959: December 9, 10, 11; 1960: January 26.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.\nLibel and Slander\u2014Newspaper\u2014Editorial during election campaign on fitness of candidate\u2014Defence of qualified privilege not available\u2014Fair comment\u2014Rights and duties of newspapers.\nThe plaintiff, a candidate in a federal election, sued the defendant newspaper for libel in connection with an editorial published by the defendant. The defence of qualified privilege was pleaded. The trial judge dismissed the action on the ground that the publication was made on an occasion of qualified privilege and there was no evidence of malice. The Court of Appeal ordered a new trial on the ground that there was evidence of malice to go to the jury, but did not affirm or reject the view of the trial judge on the question of qualified privilege. The defendant appealed to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nThe defence of qualified privilege, based on the plea that the newspaper had a duty to inform the public and the public had an interest in receiving information relevant to the question of the candidate\u2019s fitness for office, is not open to a newspaper which has published defamatory statements about the candidate. To hold otherwise would be not only contrary to the great weight of authority in England and in this country but harmful to that \u201ccommon convenience and welfare of society\u201d which is the underlying principle on which the rules as to qualified privilege are founded.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1], ordering a new trial in an action for libel. Appeal dismissed.\nC.F.H. Carson, Q.C., C.H. Walker, Q.C. and J.B.S. Southey, for the defendant, appellant.\nJ. Boland, Q.C., in person.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nCARTWRIGHT J.:\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario1 allowing the plaintiff\u2019s appeal from the judgment of Spence J. The action is for damages for libel. At the conclusion of the plaintiff\u2019s case counsel for the defendant stated that he did not intend to call evidence and moved for a dismissal of the action. The learned trial judge held that the words complained of were published on an occasion of qualified privilege and that there was no evidence of malice to go to the jury and accordingly dismissed the action.\nThe Court of Appeal, in a unanimous judgment delivered by Lebel J.A., allowed the appeal and directed a new trial on the ground that there was evidence upon which the jury might find express malice. As I read his reasons, the learned justice of Appeal neither affirms nor rejects the view of the learned trial judge that it was established that the words were published on an occasion of qualified privilege. In my opinion the order made by the Court of Appeal was right but as there is to be a new trial I think it desirable to say something as to the appellant\u2019s plea of qualified privilege.\nThe respondent was a candidate for election in Parkdale riding in the general election held in Canada on June 10, 1957.\nThe words complained of appeared on May 27, 1957, as an editorial in all issues of the Globe and Mail, a daily newspaper published by the appellant. They read as follows:\nSHABBY TACTICS\nOne of the less creditable episodes of the election campaign occurred on Thursday evening in Parkdale constituency, in Toronto, when Mr. John Boland, self-styled independent Conservative candidate, introduced an issue which does not exist in this election. McCarthy-style, he put forward an ex-Communist in an attempt to show the Liberals are \u201cSoft on Communism\u201d. The results were far from edifying.\nThe reason for this disgusting performance was undoubtedly to mislead the so-called New Canadian vote in that riding, in the hope that their anti-Communist fears might be translated into an anti-Liberal anti-Conservative prejudice. An election won by such tactics would be a degradation to the whole democratic system of Government in Canada. Let us have no more of that sort of thing, this time or ever.\nIn the statement of claim it is alleged that the defendant falsely and maliciously published this editorial of and concerning the plaintiff and that in its plain and ordinary meaning it is defamatory of him. In paras. 6 to 15 inclusive a number of innuendoes are alleged.\nIn the statement of defence publication is admitted. The defences pleaded are, (i) that the words complained of in their natural and ordinary meaning are no libel, (ii) that the said words do not bear and were not understood to bear and are incapable of bearing or being understood to bear the meanings alleged in paras. 6 to 15 of the statement of claim, (iii) a plea of qualified privilege, and (iv) the defence of fair comment, pleaded in the form of the \u201crolled-up\u201d plea.\nThe plea of qualified privilege is set out in paras. 3 and 4 of the statement of defence which read as follows:\n3. The Defendant says that the words complained of were published in the following circumstances\u2014\nDuring the campaign preceding the Federal Elections of June 10, 1957, the Plaintiff, as a Candidate for election, was seeking the support of the electors in Parkdale Riding in the City of Toronto, as an Independent Conservative Candidate. The Plaintiff, as part of his campaign, introduced the issue that the Liberal Government was employing pro-Communists in the Department of External Affairs and was soft on Communism. This issue was further developed at a Public Meeting held at Parkdale Collegiate Auditorium on 23rd May, 1957, when one, Pat Walsh, addressed the meeting in the interest of the Plaintiff. The raising of this issue by the Plaintiff was the subject of discussion and comment in the Public Press.\n4. By reason of such circumstances it was the duty of the Defendant to publish and in the interests of the Public to receive communications and comments with respect to the Candidature of the Plaintiff and by reason of this the said words were published under such circumstances and upon such occasion as to render them privileged.\nThe rule as to the burden of proof where a defence of qualified privilege is set up is accurately stated in Gatley on Libel and Slander, 4th ed., p. 282, as follows:\nWhere a defence of qualified privilege is set up, it is for the defendant to allege and prove all such facts and circumstances as are necessary to bring the words complained of within the privilege, unless such facts are admitted before or at the trial of the action. Whether the facts and circumstances proved or admitted are or are not such as to render the occasion privileged is a question of law for the judge to decide.\nThe learned trial judge found that the facts alleged in para. 3 of the statement of defence were proved and, for the purposes of this appeal, I will assume the correctness of that finding. He then went on to hold as a matter of law that these facts established the existence of an occasion of qualified privilege. The learned judge based this conclusion primarily on the decisions of Mackay J., as he then was, the trial judge in Dennison et al. v. Sanderson et al. reported in appeal at[2], and of Kelly J., the trial judge in Drew v. Toronto Star Ltd., reported in appeal at[3]. In the view of the learned trial judge in neither of these cases did the Court of Appeal disapprove of the statements made by the learned judges presiding at the trials to the effect that statements made in a newspaper during an election campaign as to the fitness, or otherwise, for office of candidates offering themselves for election were made on occasions of qualified privilege. The learned trial judge continued:\nTherefore in my view we have two judges of this Court who have found that the publication of comment in newspapers as to candidates for election to public office, and made during the course of an election campaign, are uttered on occasions of qualified privilege and the opinion of neither one of those has been disturbed on appeal. Apart from the authority I would be much inclined to come to the same opinion. Surely no section of the public has a clearer duty to publish, for the information and guidance of the public, political news and comment, even critical comment, during a Federal Election in Canada than the great Metropolitan daily newspaper such as the Defendant. Just as certainly the public, every citizen in Canada, has a legitimate and vital interest in receiving such publications. At this point I do not intend to deal with either the bona fides of the publication or with the alleged over extension of the publication thereof, to both of which I shall refer later, but only with the question of whether the occasion was one of qualified privilege. I have come to the conclusion that a Federal Election in Canada is an occasion upon which a newspaper has a public duty to comment on the candidates, their campaigns and their platforms or policies, and Canadian citizens have an honest and very real interest in receiving their comments, and that therefore this is an occasion of qualified privilege.\nWith respect, I am of opinion that this is an erroneous statement of the law. It is directly opposed to the unanimous judgment of this Court in Douglas v. Tucker[4], particularly at pp. 287 and 288 (which does not appear to have been brought to the attention of the learned judge) and to Buncombe v. Daniell[5], which was approved and followed in Douglas v. Tucker.\nAn attempt was made to distinguish the case at bar from Duncombe v. Daniell and Douglas v. Tucker on the ground that in each of those two cases the libel referred to the private life rather than the conduct in public affairs of the plaintiff; but the judgments in both of those cases proceeded on the basis that the defamatory statement made about the candidate would, if true, have been relevant to the question of his fitness for office and was such as the electors had an interest in hearing. In my opinion there is nothing in this suggested distinction which renders the principle of Douglas v. Tucker inapplicable to the case at bar.\nWith respect it appears to me that, in the passage from his reasons quoted above, the learned trial judge has confused the right which the publisher of a newspaper has, in common with all Her Majesty\u2019s subjects, to report truthfully and comment fairly upon matters of public interest with a duty of the sort which gives rise to an occasion of qualified privilege. It is well to bear in mind the following passage from the judgment of Lord Shaw in Arnold v. The King Emperor[6], quoted by Lebel J.A.:\nThe freedom of the journalist is an ordinary part of the freedom of the subject, and to whatever lengths the subject in general may go, so also may the journalist, but apart from statute law, his privilege is no other and no higher. The responsibilities which attach to his power in the dissemination of printed matter may, and in the case of a conscientious journalist do, make him more careful; but the range of his assertions, his criticisms, or his comments, is as wide as, and no wider than, that of any other subject. No privilege attaches to his position.\nTo hold that during a federal election campaign in Canada any defamatory statement published in the press relating to a candidate\u2019s fitness for office is to be taken as published on an occasion of qualified privilege would be, in my opinion, not only contrary to the great weight of authority in England and in this country but harmful to that \u201ccommon convenience and welfare of society\u201d which Baron Parke described as the underlying principle on which the rules as to qualified privilege are founded. See Toogood v. Spyring[7]. It would mean that every man who offers himself as a candidate must be prepared to risk the loss of his reputation without redress unless he be able to prove affirmatively that those who defamed him were actuated by express malice. I would like to adopt the following sentence from the judgment of the Court in Post Publishing Co. v. Hallam[8]:\nWe think that not only is such a sacrifice not required of every one who consents to become a candidate for office, but that to sanction such a doctrine would do the public more harm than good.\nand the following expression of opinion by the learned author of Gatley (op. cit) at page 254:\nIt is, however, submitted that so wide an extension of the privilege would do the public more harm than good. It would tend to deter sensitive and honourable men from seeking public positions of trust and responsibility, and leave them open to others who have no respect for their reputation. The passages just quoted recall the words of Cockburn C.J. in Campbell v. Spottiswoode[9]:\nIt is said that it is for the interests of society that the public conduct of men should be criticised without any other limit than that the writer should have an honest belief that what he writes is true. But it seems to me that the public have an equal interest in the maintenance of the public character of public men; and public affairs could not be conducted by men of honour with a view to the welfare of the country, if we were to sanction attacks upon them, destructive of their honour and character, and made without any foundation.\nThe interest of the public and that of the publishers of newspapers will be sufficiently safeguarded by the availability of the defence of fair comment in appropriate circumstances.\nAs, in my opinion, it is settled by authority binding upon us that the facts pleaded by the appellant even if established would not render privileged the occasion on which the editorial complained of was published, I do not find it necessary to consider those parts of the reasons of the learned trial judge and of the Court of Appeal which discuss the question whether there was evidence of express malice.\nAt the new trial, in view of the state of the pleadings it should be taken that, as a matter of law, the defence of qualified privilege is not open to the defendant.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the defendant, appellant: MacDonald & MacIntosh, Toronto.\nSolicitor for the plaintiff, respondent: C.I.

Disputes arose between the parties and the plaintiff commenced arbitration proceedings. The defendant\u2019s motion to set aside the arbitrators\u2019 award on the grounds that it was bad on its face and that the arbitrators had exceeded their jurisdiction, was dismissed after the time for bringing the motion had been extended pursuant to s. 30 of The Arbitration Act. The Court of Appeal set aside the award and dismissed the plaintiff\u2019s cross-appeal in which he had contended that the defendant had accepted a benefit under the award and was thereby precluded from applying to have it set aside. The plaintiff appealed to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed; but the order of the trial judge extending the time to make the motion to set aside the award should be restored.\nThe order of the Court of Appeal, affirming the order made by the trial judge to extend under s. 30 of the Act the time for applying to set aside the award was a discretionary order within s. 44 of the Supreme Court Act. No appeal lay from that order unless leave be given by this Court under s. 41, and under the circumstances of this case leave would not be given.\nThere was no acceptance by the defendant of any benefit under the award or acquiescence in it so as to preclude it from applying for an extension of time, or from applying to set aside the award itself.\nThere was error of law appearing upon the face of the award. The authorities make a clear distinction between a case where disputes are referred to an arbitrator in the decision of which a question of law becomes material from the case in which a specific question of law has been referred to him for decision. In the first case, the Court can interfere if and when any error of law appears on the face of the award but in the latter case no such interference is possible upon the ground that it so appears that the decision upon the question of law is an erroneous one. In the case at bar, the pleadings indicate that no specific question of law was submitted to the arbitrators. APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1], setting aside an arbitration award. Appeal dismissed.\nF.P. Varcoe, Q.C., for the plaintiff, appellant.\nJ.J. Robinette, Q.C., for the defendant, respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE:\u2014This is an appeal by Faubert and Watts against the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario1 allowing with costs an appeal by Temagami Mining Co. Limited from an order of Landreville J., dismissing without costs Faubert and Watts\u2019 cross-appeal, setting aside the order appealed from and also an award of a Board of Arbitration, dated April 1, 1958. The costs of the application to Landreville J. were also directed to be paid by Faubert and Watts. The latter will be referred to as the Contractor and Temagami Mining Co. Limited as the Company.\nOn October 9, 1956, these parties entered into a written agreement (the construction contract) whereby the Contractor agreed to\n(a) construct a mining access road (hereinafter called the \u201croad\u201d), as hereinafter provided, from a point on Highway No. 11 approximately four (4) miles south of the Village of Temagami, westerly a distance of approximately twelve (12) miles to Sulphide Point on Lake Temagami along the route indicated on the plan hereto annexed as Schedule \u201cA\u201d, subject to slight variation therefrom to secure better grades; and\n(b) provide all the materials and complete the road including all bridges and culverts as follows and as in this agreement provided:\u2014\n(i) the road will be built to the specifications prescribed for mining access roads which include a road bed of gravel twenty-eight feet (28\u2032) wide and at least one foot (1\u2032) thick over base, of a grade of not more than seven percent (7%) and curves of not more than ten degrees (10\u00b0);\n(ii) construction will be of the standard which may be required by the District Engineer of the Department of Highways at North Bay;\n(iii) construction to commence immediately and proceed continuously, subject to weather conditions, and to be completed to the satisfaction of the company\u2019s engineers, Geophysical Engineering & Surveys Limited. The Company agreed to:\u2014\n(a) pay the Contractor in lawful money of Canada for the materials and services aforesaid at the rate of Ten Thousand Dollars ($10,000.00) per mile plus Two Dollars ($2) per cubic yard of necessary rock cut and One Dollar ($1) per lineal foot of necessary corduroy, exclusive of bridges and culverts for which payment will be made at cost of labour and materials plus ten percent (10%) and\n(b) make payments on account thereof upon the certificate of the Engineers as set out.\n\u201cThe General Conditions of the Contract\u201d which were annexed to the agreement and were to be read into and form part thereof contained Art. XII the relevant parts of which provided:\nIn the case of any dispute between the Company, or the Engineers on its behalf, and the Contractor during the progress of the work, or afterwards, or after the determination or breach of the contract as to any matter arising thereunder, either party hereto shall be entitled to give to the other notice of such dispute and to demand arbitration thereof.\nSuch notice and demand being given, each party shall at once appoint-an arbitrator and these shall jointly select the third. The decision of any two of three arbitrators shall be final and binding upon the parties who covenant that their disputes shall be so decided by arbitration alone and not by recourse to any court by way of action at Law. However, if within a reasonable time the two arbitrators appointed by the parties do not agree upon a third or a party who has been notified of a dispute fails to appoint an arbitrator, then a third arbitrator or an arbitrator to represent the party in default or both such arbitrators may, upon simple petition of the party not in default, be appointed by a Judge of the Supreme Court of the Province of Ontario.\nThe original construction agreement was amended by another between the same parties, dated June 4, 1957, clause (a) of which reads:\n(a) Notwithstanding any other provision in the Construction Contract to the contrary, from and after the 4th day of June, 1957, the Company will pay the Contractor in lawful money of Canada, Three Dollars ($3) per cubic yard of necessary rock cut and Fifty-five Cents ($.55) per cubic yard for gravel fill hauled to and used for the construction of said road (exclusive of such material hauled for surfacing the mining access road to a uniform depth of one foot). Payment for said fill shall be based on pit measurements and the Contractor shall advise the Company, from time to time, of its intention to remove gravel fill from a pit which it shall designate and shall enable the employees or nominees of the Company to properly survey said pit both before and after any such gravel is removed therefrom by the Contractor. In the event the Contractor fails to enable the Company to perform any such survey or surveys, the Company shall be under no obligation to pay for gravel removed from the pit since the time a survey of the pit was last made by the Company. Notwithstanding any other provision to the contrary, the Company shall not pay the Contractor for hauling gravel fill which is used in the construction of any part of said road from 0 + 0 to 264 + 00 on the grid laid out.\nPrior to the agreement of October 9, 1956, the Contractor had entered into one dated September 13, 1956, with Geophysical Engineering & Surveys, Ltd., for the clearing of all trees, brush and other vegetation and the removal of all merchantable timber, windfalls and other fallen timber, fallen branches and other surface Utter, on a location corresponding to that of the mining access road referred to in the agreement of October 9, 1956. As appears from clause (b) (iii) of this last mentioned agreement set out above, Geophysical Engineering & Surveys, Ltd. were the Company\u2019s engineers.\nDisputes having arisen between the Contractor and the Company the former commenced arbitration proceedings in pursuance of Art. XII of the General Conditions. The procedure before the Board of Arbitration and what it did will be referred to later but it is first necessary to dispose of two points upon which we did not require to hear counsel for the respondent. The award dated April 1, 1958, was, according to the Contractor\u2019s factum, published and delivered to the solicitors for each party on April 2, 1958. According to the same factum, on May 15, 1958, the solicitors for the Contractor served a notice of motion asking for leave to enforce the said award, and on May 16, 1958, they were served with a notice of motion on behalf of the Company asking for an order extending the time for bringing a motion to set aside the award and for an order setting it aside on the grounds therein set forth. On May 20, 1958, the Company\u2019s motion was adjourned by consent and it was that motion which was heard by Landreville J. on June 16 and 17, 1958. That learned judge extended the time for bringing the motion pursuant to s. 30 of The Arbitration Act, R.S.O. 1950, c. 20:\n30. (1) Unless by leave of the Court or a Judge, an application to set aside an award, otherwise than by way of appeal, shall not be made after six weeks from the publication of the award.\n(2) Such leave may be granted before or after the expiration of the six weeks. This was one of the matters as to which the Contractor cross-appealed to the Court of Appeal without success.\nMr.Varcoe agreed that Laidlaw J.A., with whom the other members of the Court of Appeal concurred, was correct in stating that he accepted the statement of counsel for the Company that the latter had made a mistake as to the date of publication of the award and the circumstances under which it became necessary to ask for an extension of time to set aside the award, but that Laidlaw J.A. was mistaken in stating that counsel for the Contractor therefore confined the cross-appeal to the submission \u201cthat a person who has accepted a benefit under an award is thereby precluded from applying to have it set aside\u201d. He did indeed make this latter submission before this Court but also contended that the Court can exercise its judicial discretion to extend the time for moving to set aside an award only if it can be shown that the applicant held a bona fide intention to move while the right to do so existed, that there were special circumstances which prevented him from so doing and that justice requires that leave be given. So far as that point is concerned we are all of opinion that no matter what the effect of the authorities to which counsel referred may be, the order of the Court of Appeal, affirming in that respect the order of the judge of first instance, was a discretionary order within s. 44 of the Supreme Court Act and that, therefore, no appeal lay unless leave be given by this Court under s. 41 and that under the circumstances leave would not be given.\nThe second point in the cross-appeal by the Contractor which was decided adversely to it by the Court of Appeal is as to the alleged approbation of the award. As to that we agree with Laidlaw J.A., speaking for the Court of Appeal, that while certain saleable timber left on the site of the work after the termination of the construction contract was found by the Board to be the property of the Company and while the Company transferred its right in the timber to one Roy Pacey in return for his clearing it from the right of way, there was a separate contract between the Contractor and the engineers for the clearing of the right of way. Any question as to the ownership of this timber arose under this separate contract and was in no way connected with or dependent upon the terms of the construction contract, and there was no acceptance by the Company of any benefit under the award or acquiescence in it so as to preclude it from applying for an extension of time, or from applying to set aside the award itself.\nThe members of the Board of Arbitration were duly chosen; what might be called pleadings were then delivered,\u2014\u201dpoints of claim\u201d by the Contractor, \u201cpoints of defence and counter\u2011claim\u201d by the Company and \u201cpoints of reply and defence to counter-claim\u201d by the Contractor. In view of the award made by the Board it is important to note that after referring to the construction contract of October 9, 1956, para. 7 of the claim alleged that at the request of one Davidson, for and on behalf of the Company, the Contractor agreed to construct a road substantially different from that contemplated by the contract, the benefit of which had been accepted by the Company, and that \u201cIt was an implied term of the said agreement that the Defendant Company would pay to the Plaintiffs a reasonable remuneration on a quantum meruit basis for the construction of the said road. The said term is to be implied from the said request and the said acceptance by the Defendant Company. The Plaintiffs say that a reasonable remuneration for the construction of the said road would be the cost of construction incurred by the Plaintiffs plus ten per cent profit\u201d. These allegations were denied by para. 8 of the defence including a specific denial that there were implied terms of any agreement between the parties. Denial was also made that the Company had accepted as substantially complete the work done by the Contractor under the original construction contract and the Company maintained that the amending agreement of June 4, 1957, was entered into at the request of the Contractor for its financial benefit. Claims were also advanced by the Contractor as set out in the reasons of Laidlaw J.A. for damages under various heads.\nThe Board made this finding:\u2014\u201cWe further find that the only means to settle the deeply involved dispute is to pay the Contractor the cost of the work, plus a percentage for profit\u201d, and then awarded the contractor the cost of the work plus ten per cent. \u201capplied to the total cost of the work after deducting therefrom the amount of equipment rentals\u201d. The Board also found that the contract was wrongfully terminated by the Company and therefore in addition to the cost of the work, plus ten per cent., awarded the Contractor $10,100 \u201cas liquidated damages\u201d.\nI find it unnecessary to refer to any of the other findings of the Board of Arbitration. It appears to me to be quite clear that there is error of law appearing upon the face of the award. The Board did not proceed to arbitrate the matters that were in dispute under the construction contracts but imposed their own view of what should be done and gave what they considered was a proper sum on a quantum meruit basis and furthermore allowed a large sum by way of \u201cliquidated damages\u201d. The authorities are all mentioned in the 16th ed. of Russell on Arbitration but reference might be made particularly to the judgment of the House of Lords in Absalom Ltd. v. Great Western (London) Garden Village Society Ltd.[2] Lord Russell with the concurrence of Lord Buckmaster and Lord Tomlin, at p. 607, points out that the authorities make a clear distinction between a case where disputes are referred to an arbitrator in the decision of which a question of law becomes material from the case in which a specific question of law has been referred to him for decision. In the first, the Court can interfere if and when any error of law appears on the face of the award but in the latter case no such interference is possible upon the ground that it so appears that the decision upon the question of law is an erroneous one. Lord Warrington of Clyffe and Lord Wright came to a like conclusion for similar reasons. I read the relevant parts of the pleadings as indicating that no specific question of law was submitted by the parties to the Board and therefore I do not investigate the problem that would arise if this were not so as did LeBel J.A. with the concurrence of McGillivray J.A.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs. The formal judgment of the Court of Appeal set aside the order of Landreville J., but, as the latter extended the time within which the motion to set aside the award might be made, it would appear to be preferable if the affirmance of that part of the order of the judge of first instance were made clear in the judgment of this Court to be issued.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the plaintiff, appellant: Varcoe, Duncan & Associates, Toronto.\nSolicitors for the defendant, respondent: Lang, Michener & Cranston, Toronto.\n[1] (1959), 17 D.L.R.

Casselman (Defendant) Respondent.\n1959: May 22, 25; 1960: 1960: January 26.\nPresent: Kerwin C.J. and Taschereau, Locke, Cartwright, Fauteux, Martland and Judson JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR MANITOBA.\nPromissory note\u2014Conditional sale contract\u2014Transaction through agent\u2014 Transaction made in Saskatchewan and action brought in Manitoba\u2014 Endorsee of note with knowledge of want of consideration\u2014Whether the Limitation of Civil Rights Act, R.S.S. 1953, c. 95, applicable\u2014 Whether procedural and not applicable to Manitoba action.\nThe defendant C purchased a tractor-trailer from a dealer in Saskatchewan, but wished to make D appear to be the owner. Consequently, D went through the form of purchasing the equipment and made a down-payment with moneys supplied by C. In the conditional sale agreement, the dealer reserved title and D signed a promissory note for the unpaid balance. The agreement was assigned and the note endorsed to the plaintiff finance company, which knew who was the real owner. Subsequently D transferred the equipment to C, and this transfer agreement was concurred in by the plaintiff and the dealer. C then purported to give a promissory note for the unpaid balance to D. This note was endorsed by D to the dealer and then to the plaintiff, which sued upon it in Manitoba. The transfer agreement provided that this last mentioned note was collateral only to the original sale agreement and the note already held by the plaintiff. The trial judge maintained the action because s. 18 of The Limitation of Civil Rights Act was found to be ultra vires. The Court of Appeal dismissed the action. The plaintiff appealed to this Court and abandoned any argument against the validity of the legislation.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed. Per Kerwin C.J. and Taschereau, Cartwright, Fauteux, Martland and Judson JJ.: The submission that the Act was not applicable because the vendor had no lien for \"all or part of the purchase price\", failed. D was not the vendor to C but merely a nominee or agent of C executing formal documents for the purpose of putting the paper title in the person who was, from the beginning and to the knowledge of the plaintiff and the dealer, the real purchaser and equitable owner. There was, therefore, a reservation of a lien for all or part of the purchase price when the property was sold to D. The note given for that transaction was not enforceable under the Act because no debt existed to the knowledge of the payee and endorsee. The note given in the second transaction by the principal C to the agent D was in no higher position. Since there was a lien reserved there was no right of personal recovery under s. 18(1). The plaintiff held the note and sued upon it, knowing that it was given without consideration and without the existence of any personal obligation to pay.\nThe sections of the Bills of Exchange Act having to do with the rights of a holder in due course or the rights of a holder for value against an accommodation party, had no application.\nThe second submission to the effect that s. 18 was a procedural rule of the Courts of Saskatchewan and therefore inapplicable in an action brought in Manitoba, also failed. The section was in no way concerned with procedural rules for the enforcement of a right. It was concerned with substantive law.\nIt was unnecessary to deal with the validity of the statute since counsel for the plaintiff had abandonned any argument against it on constitutional grounds.\nPer Locke J.: There was no consideration for the giving of the note, to the knowledge of the plaintiff who sued qua endorsee. The promise to pay, signed by D as the nominee of C, was, to the knowledge of the plaintiff, unenforceable by virtue of s. 18 of the Act, the rights of the promissee, in case of default, being limited to repossession. The note sued upon, being given as collateral security only for a non-existent debt, to the knowledge of all parties to the action, was thus without consideration and unenforceable at the suit of the plaintiff.\nIn the absence of consideration, the question as to whether s. 18 of The Limitation of Civil Rights Act was in conflict with the sections of the Bills of Exchange Act, dealing with the rights of holders for value or holders in due course, did not arise in this case.\nSince the rights of a holder in due course or a holder for value to whom a note had been endorsed after maturity without knowledge of the lack of consideration, did not arise in this case, there was no necessity to pass on the question of the validity of s. 18 of the Act.\nAPPEAL from a judgment to the Court of Appeal for Manitoba1, reversing a judgment of Monnin J. Appeal dismissed.\nJ. L. McDougall, Q.C., for the plaintiff, appellant.\nH. B. Monk, Q.C. and G. A. Higenbottom, for the defendant, respondent. L. A. Chalmers, for the Attorney General of Canada.\nW. G. Doherty, for the Attorney-General of Saskatchewan.\nThe judgment of Kerwin C.J. and of Taschereau, Cartwright, Fauteux, Martland and Judson JJ. was delivered by\nJudson J.:\u2014The appellant, Traders Finance Corporation Limited, sued the respondent, I. G. Casselman, as maker of a promissory note, which had been given in connection with the purchase of a tractor-trailer. The purchase was made in the Province of Saskatchewan, delivery of the property was taken there and all arrangements in connection with the transaction were made in that province. The proper law of these transactions is that of the Province of Saskatchewan but the action was brought in the Province of Manitoba and the main defence pleaded, and the only one that I propose to consider in these reasons, was based upon s. 18 of the Saskatchewan legislation known as the Limitation of Civil Rights Act. This section provides that \"When an article, the selling price whereof exceeds $100, is hereafter sold, and the vendor, after delivery, has a lien thereon for all or part of the purchase price, the vendor's right to recover the unpaid purchase money shall be restricted to his lien upon the article sold, \u2026.\" This defence failed at the trial because of the conclusion of the learned trial judge that the legislation was beyond the provincial power and an infringement of the exclusive jurisdiction of Parliament under s. 91(18) of the British North America Act in so far as it purported to affect the liabilities of parties to bills of exchange and promissory notes. The Court of Appeal2 reversed this conclusion, Adamson C.J.M. dissenting. On appeal to this Court, counsel for the plaintiff-appellant abandoned any argument against the legislation on constitutional grounds. It is, therefore, unnecessary to deal with the point further and I confine my reasons to a consideration of the only two grounds that were urged against the application of the legislation to the facts of this case. The first was that the legislation did not apply because of the peculiar form which the transaction took in this case, where the vendor according to the documents executed had no lien on the property for \"all or part of the purchase price.\" The second was that this legislation should be characterized as procedural and, in consequence, held to be inapplicable to an action brought on the note in the courts of the Province of Manitoba. I will deal with these submissions in turn.\nThe first submission makes it necessary to examine in some detail the form and substance of the transaction. The respondent Casselman wished to purchase a tractor-trailer from Transport Equipment Company Limited, a dealer carrying on business in the City of Regina. His intention was to incorporate a company which would own this vehicle and to have this company lease it to a transport company, Delarue Bros. Limited, which was engaged in the long distance haulage business between Regina and Toronto. Because the licensing regulations of the Province of Ontario did not permit operators to use leased equipment, to procure this licence it was decided to make Delarue Bros. Limited appear to be the owner. Therefore, Casselman caused Delarue Bros. Limited to go through the form of purchasing this equipment from the dealer with a substantial down-payment supplied by him. The usual conditional sale agreement was signed whereby the dealer reserved title. Attached to the agreement was the usual promissory note for the unpaid balance, which Delarue Bros. Limited signed. The agreement was then assigned and the note endorsed by the dealer to the appellant Finance company. All these transactions took place on September 30, 1952 and there is no doubt on the evidence that the Finance company knew that Delarue Bros. Limited was not the real purchaser and that Casselman Carriers Limited or Casselman personally was supposed to be in the background.\nAs the ostensible owner, Delarue Bros. Limited obtained a licence from the Province of Ontario and was then ready to transfer the equipment to the real owner and take a lease back. The transfer was made on October 14, 1952 by an agreement between Delarue Bros. Limited and Casselman Carriers Limited, concurred in by the Finance company and the dealer. Casselman Carriers Limited purported to give a new promissory note for the unpaid balance to Delarue Bros. Limited, the apparent original purchaser. This is the note sued upon and it was endorsed by Delarue Bros. Limited to the dealer, and then to the Finance company.\nThe transfer agreement provides that it is not to disturb or affect in any way the security held by the Finance company on the equipment and that the new promissory note signed by Casselman Carriers Limited \"shall not constitute payment of the Conditional Sale Contract and\/or the promissory note given by the original Purchaser to the Dealer and now held by the Corporation (Traders Finance) and shall be collateral only to the said original Conditional Sale Agreement and the promissory note already held by the Corporation.\"\nThe new note was signed in this form: \"Casselman Carriers Ltd. I. G. Casselman\". The company, however, had not at that time been incorporated and both Courts have held that in the absence of other defences, a note so signed would have involved Casselman in personal liability. In this Court, counsel for Casselman did not question this finding and confined his argument to the other defences.\nIt is at once apparent that when Delarue Bros. Limited transferred this property to Casselman there was no reservation of title. Delarue Bros. Limited transferred all its right, title and interest, which was, of course, subject to the reservation of the legal title contained in the conditional sale agreement when Delarue became the apparent purchaser. If Delarue Bros. Limited had been an actual vendor of this equipment to Casselman the transaction would not be within s. 18 above mentioned because the vendor, in the words of the legislation, would, after delivery of the property, have no lien thereon for all or part of the purchase price. But Delarue Bros. Limited was not the vendor of this equipment to Casselman but merely a nominee or agent of Casselman executing formal documents for the purpose of putting the paper title in the person who was, from the beginning and to the knowledge of the Finance company and the dealer, the real purchaser and equitable owner. There was, therefore, a reservation of a lien for all or part of the purchase price when the property was sold to the known agent for Casselman. The note given for that transaction was not enforceable under the statute because no debt existed to the knowledge of the payee and endorsee and the note given in the second transaction by the principal Casselman to the agent Delarue Bros. Limited and ultimately endorsed to the appellant Finance company is in no higher position. In spite of the form, this transaction was one between the dealer and Casselman through the intervention of an agent. It was done in two stages instead of one. There was a lien reserved and therefore there is no right of personal recovery. I have reached this conclusion on a consideration solely of s. 18(1). I do not regard the transaction as involving an agreement to make the provisions of the Act inapplicable and consequently null and void under s. 28. There was in fact no such agreement, either express or implied, for the form of the transaction was dictated solely by the determination to evade the licensing regulations of the Province of Ontario.\nOn this branch of the case, I therefore conclude that there was no debt between Casselman and Delarue Bros. Limited or between Casselman and the dealer because by the terms of the statute there could be no personal obligation to pay the unpaid balance in a transaction of this kind. The Finance company holds this note and sues upon it, knowing that it was given without consideration and without the existence of any personal obligation to pay. There is no suggestion here that Traders Finance was a holder in due course or a holder for value with Casselman as an accommodation maker. The sections of the Bills of Exchange Act having to do with the rights of a holder in due course or the rights of a holder for value against an accommodation party have no application and the action on the note fails unless it can be successfully argued that the legislation is a procedural rule of the Courts of Saskatchewan and inapplicable in an action brought in Manitoba.\nThe appellant, in my opinion, has set itself an impossible task in seeking to have this legislation characterized as procedural. The section takes away a personal right of action for the balance of the unpaid purchase price if a lien is reserved. It is in no way concerned with procedural rules for the enforcement of a right. Therefore, the fact that there is no equivalent legislation in the Province of Manitoba does not help the appellant. This was undoubtedly a Saskatchewan cause of action, without a single element which might connect it with the Province of Manitoba. Even in the absence of persuasive authority it is difficult to see how the Manitoba Court could have done other than characterize the matter as one of substantive law. While it is true that the Manitoba Court must characterize this legislation by its own tests of what is procedure and what is substantive law and is not bound by what another jurisdiction may have done, there is no problem of conflicting characterization here because the Manitoba Court took the same view as that of the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal in Canadian Acceptance Corporation Limited v. Matte3, where this very section was characterized as a matter of substantive law and not procedure. In that case the conditions were in reverse. The plaintiff sued on a Manitoba contract in the Courts of Saskatchewan. This statute was pleaded as a defence on the ground that it was a procedural rule of the forum. The judgment of the Court of Appeal was that the matter was one of substantive law and not of procedure and that this Saskatchewan legislation had no application to the Manitoba contract under litigation. I agree with this conclusion.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs. There should be no costs to or against the Attorney General of Canada or the Attorney-General for Saskatchewan.\nLocke J.:\u2014In my opinion the ground upon which this appeal should be dismissed is that, as it was found by Mr. Justice Coyne in the Court of Appeal4, there was no consideration for the giving of the note, to the knowledge of the appellant who sues qua endorsee.\nIt was, no doubt, by reason of the fact that this defence was not clearly pleaded in the statement of defence and presumably not argued before Monnin J. that the question was not dealt with by him. While not raised expressly in the notice of appeal to the Court of Appeal, I judge that it was argued there, though the reasons delivered by Tritschler J.A. do not mention the matter. The defence appears to me to be sufficiently raised by paras. 11 and 12 of the statement of defence.\nI also agree with Coyne J.A. that, in the absence of consideration, the question as to whether subs. (1) and (4) of s. 18 of the Limitation of Civil Rights Act of Saskatchewan, R.S.S. 1953, c. 95, are in conflict with the sections of the Bills of Exchange Act, dealing with the rights of holders for value or holders in due course, does not arise in the circumstances of the present case. That the Province may validly restrict the rights of the vendor under the conditioned sale agreement in the manner described in the section is not questioned.\nThe evidence, in my opinion, supports the finding that the manager of the appellant company was aware at the time that, in entering into the agreement to purchase the equipment dated September 30, 1952, and in signing the promissory note bearing that date in which Transport Equipment Co. Ltd. was named as the payee, Delarue Brothers Ltd. acted simply as the nominee of Casselman, for the purposes explained in the evidence.\nThe conditional sale contract and the promissory note were assigned and endorsed respectively to the appellant and it was upon this security that the moneys were advanced by it to pay the purchase price of the equipment, apparently at or about the above mentioned date.\nThe undated transfer agreement, found by the learned trial judge to have been executed on October 14, 1952, was made with the consent of the appellant, and it was on that date that the promissory note sued upon was given by Casselman to Delarue Brothers Ltd. and negotiated by endorsement to the appellant.\nWhile the conditional sale contract on the face of it obligated Delarue Brothers Ltd. to pay to the vendor by instalments the balance of the purchase price amounting to $20,391.35, the promise to pay was, to the knowledge of the appellant, unenforceable by virtue of the provisions of s. 18, the rights of the promisee, except in certain respects with which we are not concerned, being limited in case of default to repossessing the machinery. The transfer agreement referring to the note then given by Casselman, so far as it needs to be considered, reads:\nThe Dealer and Purchaser further agree that the new promissory note drawn by the Sub-Purchaser (Casselman) payable to the Purchaser (Delarue Brothers Ltd.) and by the Purchaser and the Dealer endorsed to the Corporation shall not constitute payment of the Conditional Sale Contract and\/or the promissory note given by the original Purchaser to the Dealer and now held by the Corporation and shall be collateral only to the said original Conditional Sale Agreement and the promissory note already held by the Corporation.\nThe note sued upon, being given as collateral security only for a non-existent debt, to the knowledge of all of the parties to the action, was thus without consideration and unenforceable at the suit of the appellant.\nWhile upon the argument before us counsel for the appellant stated that he did not contend that subs. (1) and (4) of s. 18 of the Limitation of Civil Bights Act were ultra vires and did not seek to support the judgment in the appellant's favour given at the trial on that ground, we would not, in my opinion, be relieved of our duty to deal with that question if the rights of a holder in due course or a holder for value to whom the note had been endorsed after maturity without knowledge of the lack of consideration were involved. The learned trial judge and the learned Chief Justice of Manitoba have both expressed the opinion that these portions of the section, in so far as they affect the rights of the holder of a negotiable instrument, are ultra vires the Province, while Coyne and Tritschler JJ.A., who constituted the majority in the Court of Appeal, have expressed the contrary opinion.\nIt is well that it be made clear that no such questions arise in this action. There is nothing in the reasons for judgment delivered in this Court in the case of Attorney-General for Alberta and Winstanley v. Atlas Lumber Co. Ltd.5, which as between the original parties to the note affects the rights of the promissor to rely upon either the lack or a failure of consideration by way of defence.\nI would dismiss this appeal with costs. I would make no order as to the costs of the Attorney General of Canada or of the Attorney-General of Saskatchewan.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.

Toronto Transit Commission, [1960] S.C.R. 251\nDate: 1960-01-26\nEva Kauffman (Plaintiff) Appellant;\nand\nToronto Transit Commission (Defendant) Respondent.\n1959: December 3, 4; 1960: January 26.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.\nNegligence\u2014Passenger injured on escalator\u2014Persons preceding victim scuffling and falling back on victim\u2014Whether duty to provide attendant\u2014Whether negligence in having metal-clad hand rail instead of rubber type\u2014Absence of causality.\nThe plaintiff, who was going up an escalator of the defendant, was preceded by a man and two youths ahead of the man. The two youths started pushing each other and fell on the man. All three fell on the plaintiff who was knocked down and carried up the escalator. The jury found negligence on the part of the defendant in that it (1) had installed an untested hand rail and (2) had failed to supply supervision. This verdict was set aside by the Court of Appeal on the grounds of absence of causality and of a duty to provide attendants. The plaintiff appealed to this Court.\nHeld (Cartwright J. dissenting): The appeal should be dismissed.\nPer Kerwin C.J. and Judson J.: While the obligation upon carriers of persons is to use all due, proper and reasonable care and the care required is of a very high degree, such carriers are not insurers of the safety of these persons. On the first ground of negligence, the defendant has met the required standard of care to carry safely as far as reasonable care and forethought can attain that end. The fact that the hand rail used was round, corrugated and metal-clad, while the type in use in escalators in some other cities was oval in shape and made of black rubber, did not contribute to the accident. That hand rail was installed after a thorough investigation.\nAs to the second ground of negligence, the defendant did not owe the plaintiff a duty to supply supervision. What occurred was not a danger, usual or unusual, which the defendant knew or ought to have known. Moreover, the jury\u2019s finding was not justified by the evidence. Per Locke and Martland JJ.: There was no evidence in this case upon which a jury might be asked to find that there was a legal duty to preserve order among the passengers so that other passengers might not be injured. Construing the first finding of the jury as saying that the type of hand rail used was inadequate compared to a rubber type, it was apparent from the evidence that the nature of the grip upon the hand rail had nothing whatever to do with the accident.\nConstruing the jury\u2019s finding of lack of supervision as meaning a failure to have an attendant in the immediate vicinity of the escalator who could instantly stop it, the case of the plaintiff was not assisted. It could not be said that a reasonable person would contemplate injury to persons such as occurred in this case, or that the defendant was under a duty of maintaining an attendant at the foot of the escalator to avoid the consequences of disorderly conduct on the part of those using it.\nPer Cartwright J., dissenting: The second answer of the jury should be construed as a finding that the defendant ought to have maintained such a system of supervision that the escalator could and would be promptly stopped in an emergency. There was evidence that some of the injuries would have been avoided if the escalator had been stopped promptly. There was a considerable body of evidence that in the case of many escalators, including some in several large stores in the city, there are employees in close proximity who are shown how to stop the escalator and instructed to stop it at once if an emergency arises. The jury was entitled to be guided by that evidence and to fix the standard of care accordingly.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1], reversing a jury\u2019s finding on negligence. Appeal dismissed, Cartwright J. dissenting.\nJ.J. Robinette, Q.C., and I.W. Outerbridge, for the plaintiff, appellant.\nHon. R.L. Kellock, Q.C., and D.J. Wright, for the defendant, respondent.\nThe judgment of Kerwin C.J. and of Judson J. was delivered by\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE:\u2014This is an appeal against a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario1 allowing an appeal from the judgment of McLennan J. after the verdict of a jury and dismissing the action of the appellant, Eva Kauffman. About midnight on February 11, 1955, she and a companion, as paying passengers, alighted from a northbound subway train at the St. Clair Avenue station, all of which was part of the transportation system operated by the respondent, Toronto Transit Commission, in the City of Toronto. Together with a number of other people they made their way to an escalator upon which the appellant stepped first, followed by her companion. Immediately in front of the appellant was a man and in front of him two young men. The latter began scuffling and fell against the man who, as a result, was knocked back upon the appellant. Either these three or at least two of them rested upon the appellant and from the evidence it is undoubted that a great part of the severe injuries she sustained was as a result of her being in that position.\nIn the action brought by the appellant against the respondent the statement of claim alleged negligence on the part of the respondent as follows:\n(a) It failed to provide an attendant who could stop the escalator, or in the alternative if an attendant was provided he failed to stop the escalator when he knew or ought to have known the Plaintiff had fallen.\n(b) In designing the escalator it failed to take into consideration the danger inherent in its use, namely, that it would be subject to large crowds attempting to ride it at the same time and what might be expected to happen if someone above lost his balance and fell against those below.\n(c) It failed to design a handrail adequate for the purpose, especially in the event passengers were jostled by those above.\n(d) It failed to provide adequate supervision of its passengers to prevent them jostling each other while on the escalator.\n(e) The ascent of the escalator was too steep and the speed too fast.\n(f) It failed to erect signs showing the location of the emergency buttons so that those in the vicinity of the escalator could stop it readily.\nThe questions put to the jury and their answers are as follows:\n1. Q: Was there any negligence on the part of the defendant which caused or contributed to the accident? Answer \u201cYes\u201d or \u201cNo\u201d.\nA: Yes.\n2. Q: If your answer to Question 1, is \u201cYes, of what did such negligence consist?\u201d Answer fully.\nA: That the defendant, in acquiring an escalator of radical departure in handrail design, did not sufficiently test or cause to be tested by qualified experts, the co-efficient of friction and contour of the Peelle Motor Stair handrail. That the defendant failed to supply supervision.\n3. Q: Irrespective of how you answer the other questions, at what amount do you assess the total damages of the Plaintiff?\nA: $35,000.00.\nThe allegation contained in (e) of the statement of claim was withdrawn at the trial and that in (f) must be taken to be negatived by the findings of the jury. As the amount claimed in the statement of claim was $25,000, judgment was entered for that sum. No question as to the amount of damages was raised in the Court of Appeal or in this Court.\nThe Court of Appeal was unanimous in setting aside the judgment. As to the first finding of negligence, the Court was of opinion that there was no evidence to justify a finding that the type of handrail in use at the St. Clair Avenue station was a contributing cause of the appellant\u2019s accident, and, as to the second ground, that it was not supported by the evidence and in any event was not part of the duty owing by the respondent to the appellant.\nI take it that the respondent was a carrier of the appellant for hire but even on that assumption the appeal in my opinion fails. Construing the first finding of negligence, as did the Court of Appeal, in a manner most favourable to the appellant, I agree that the attack by her upon the handrail was with reference to its design. In the type of escalator upon which the accident occurred, known as the Peelle escalator, the handrail was round, corrugated and metal clad, while the type of handrail in use in escalators in some other cities was oval in shape and made of black rubber. Accepting the proposition that a person could secure with his hand a more secure grip upon the oval rubber rail than on the circular metal rail, evidence was given that accidents had been caused in other places because the hands of riders could not be disengaged as easily from the rubber rail as from the metal one at the point where the rail enters the newel post. Although it appears that a considerable saving was effected by the adoption of the Peelle escalator, that action was taken after a thorough investigation by the respondent and its advisers. The statement in the Privy Council in Vancouver General Hospital v. McDaniel[2], followed and applied in MacLeod v. Roe[3], that \u201ca defendant charged with negligence can clear his feet if he shows that he acted in accord with general and approved practice\u201d applies to an action by a passenger against the carrier. It should be pointed out, however, that the statement of Lord Dunedin in Morton v. Dixon[4], referred to in the reasons for judgment of the Court of Appeal and which, as pointed out in those reasons, was quoted and applied by Lord Normand in Paris v. Stepney Borough Council[5], must be read and applied with care. That statement is:\nWhere the negligence of the employer consists of what I may call a fault of omission, I think it is absolutely necessary that the proof of that fault of omission should be one of two kinds, either\u2014to shew that the thing which he did not do was a thing which was commonly done by other persons in like circumstances, or\u2014to shew that it was a thing which was so obviously wanted that it would be folly in anyone to neglect to provide it.\nThe decision of the House of Lords in Morris v. West Hartlepool Steam Navigation Co, Ltd.[6], and particularly the remarks of Lord Cohen at p. 578 \u201cthat the use of the word \u2018folly\u2019 may lead to misconception of what the law is if it is read in the sense of \u2018ridiculous\u2019\u201d, indicate the futility of attaching too much importance to the words of an expression used in a judgment rather than to the reasons underlying it.\nWhile the obligation upon carriers of persons is to use all due, proper and reasonable care and the care required is of a very high degree, Readhead v. Midland Railway Co.[7], such carriers are not insurers of the safety of the persons whom they carry. The law is correctly set forth in Halsbury, 3rd ed., vol. 4, p. 174, para. 445, that they do not warrant the soundness or sufficiency of their vehicles, but their undertaking is to take all due care and to carry safely as far as reasonable care and forethought can attain that end. Here the respondent has met that standard of care so far as the first ground of negligence found by the jury is concerned.\nAs to the second ground of negligence found by the jury, I agree with the Court of Appeal that such a finding is not justified by the evidence. Furthermore I find it impossible to say that the respondent owed the appellant the duty of supplying supervision. In view of the charge of the trial judge it may be taken that the jury meant by their second finding that in view of the fact that the respondent was using the Peelle installation at the St. Clair Avenue station, where crowds might be expected, someone on its behalf should have been on duty at all times to stop the escalator if some unexpected event, like that in question, occurred. To place such a duty upon the respondent is unjustified. What occurred was not a danger, usual or unusual, which the respondent knew or ought to have known.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs, if demanded.\nThe judgment of Locke and Martland JJ. was delivered by\nLOCKE J.:\u2014The direct cause of the fall sustained by the appellant, as is made clear by the evidence, was the wrongful and grossly negligent conduct of two young men named Peters and Auchincloss who were standing ahead of the appellant and who commenced to wrestle on the escalator while it was ascending. In wrestling with each other they apparently fell backward against a third young man described by the appellant as a large man, and he in turn against and upon the appellant. From the scant description in the evidence of these three men whose combined weight was suddenly and without warning projected against the appellant, it may properly be inferred that their weight aggregated not less than 450 lbs.\nIn an attempt to engage the liability of the transit commission for the wrongful acts of these two men, one of the counts of negligence asserted in the statement of claim was that the respondent had \u201cfailed to provide adequate supervision of its passengers to prevent them jostling each other when on the escalator.\u201d It was apparently in respect of this head of negligence that the second answer of the jury was made, since it read:\nThe defendant failed to supply supervision.\nThe basis of this allegation would appear to be that a carrier of passengers for reward who invites them to use its premises for passing from one of its conveyances to another is under a legal duty to preserve order among them so that other passengers will not be injured. There is no evidence in the present matter upon which a jury might be asked to find that, in the circumstances, any such duty rested upon the respondent. There is nothing to suggest that these two men whose wrongful act resulted in the appellant being thrown backward on the escalator had theretofore been guilty of any rowdy or disorderly conduct which would suggest that any injury to other passengers might be reasonably apprehended. While the names of these young men were obtained they were not called by either side as witnesses at the trial and they were not made parties to the action.\nThe liability, if there is such, must be based upon the other grounds and can be supported, if at all, only by the answer made by the jury to the second question which reads:\nThe defendant, in acquiring an escalator of radical departure in handrail design did not sufficiently test or cause to be tested by a qualified expert the co-efficient of friction and contour of the Peelle Motorstair handrail.\nThe jury apparently adopted the expression \u201cco-efficient of friction\u201d from evidence given by some of the experts in the course of the hearing. This refers in its context to the adhesive qualities of the material of which the handrail was made and a great deal of time was taken up at the trial in demonstrating what appears to require no demonstration, that a handrail having a rubber covering is more easily gripped and has greater adhesive qualities than one with a surface of metal. According to some of the witnesses, the difference is slight but, in the view I take of the matter, the point is of no moment.\nThe language of a jury in explaining the reasons for its verdict ought not to be construed too narrowly: Pronek v. Winnipeg, Selkirk and Lake Winnipeg Railway Company[8]. Adopting this view, the answer, giving it the most favourable interpretation from the standpoint of the appellant, may be construed as a finding that the handrail of the Peelle escalator was inadequate for the purpose for which it was intended, in that it was more difficult to grip firmly than the handrail used by the Otis-Fenson Elevator Company and the Westinghouse Company, which were at the time the largest suppliers of such equipment in Canada and the United States.\nThe appellant is a lady of some sixty years of age and, on the evening of the accident in company with a Mrs. Mathewson, entered the escalator en route from a station of the underground to a street car in the street above, to complete her journey home. She was wearing woollen gloves and says that she gripped the handrail with her right hand as the escalator moved up and that, when it was about one-third way to the top, she heard the noise of a scuffle ahead of her and was immediately thereafter knocked backwards. The person whom she described as the large man fell on top of her and the two young men on top of him.\nIt is perfectly apparent from the evidence that the nature of the grip upon the handrail had nothing whatever to do with the accident. It is impossible to suggest seriously that when the weight of three men amounting to approximately 450 lbs. was projected suddenly from above against this elderly lady she would not have fallen backwards, whatever the nature of the grip upon the handrail. There is no evidence in this record to suggest otherwise, as is pointed out by Mr. Justice Morden. The case appears to have been presented to the jury as if it were a contest as to whether a passenger upon the escalator would not have a firmer grip upon a handrail covered with rubber than upon the metal handrail of the Peelle escalator, without considering whether in the circumstances described in the evidence it would have made the slightest difference. It is obvious that it would not have.\nUnless the nature of the covering of the handrail either caused or contributed to the accident, the material of which it was made is in the present matter of no moment. These considerations are sufficient to dispose of this appeal in so far as it involves the issue of liability for the appellant\u2019s fall backwards upon the escalator, since the respondent is not liable for the wrongful act of Peters and Auchincloss.\nThere is some evidence in this record upon which a jury might properly find that, in addition to the injuries sustained by the appellant when she fell backwards and the three men fell upon her, further injury was occasioned thereafter by reason of the fact that the escalator was not stopped. Though the respondent is not liable for any injuries caused by the fall itself, it might have been contended that a duty rested upon it to instantly stop the escalator when the fall occurred. Thus, to the extent that the injuries were increased during this interval, it might be said that the respondent was liable.\nThis aspect of the matter was not put to the jury as a distinct issue, the appellant\u2019s position throughout having been that the respondent was liable for the fall itself by reason of the insufficiency of the handrail. Sub-para. (a) of para. (4) of the statement of claim, which contained the counts of negligence, alleged that the respondent had \u201cfailed to provide an attendant who could stop the escalator, or in the alternative if an attendant was provided he failed to stop the escalator when he knew or ought to have known the plaintiff had fallen.\u201d\nThere was evidence that, in a booth or compartment occupied by a ticket collector some 80 feet distant from the foot of the escalator, there was a button which would enable the collector to bring the escalator to a stop immediately.\nThe ticket collector had died before the trial and his evidence had not been taken de bene esse. This count of negligence was explained to the jury in the judge\u2019s charge but nothing was said as to the extent of the liability of the respondent for the appellant\u2019s injuries if it was not liable, for such that resulted from the fall itself and the falling of the three men on top of her, and the learned trial judge was not asked to instruct the jury upon this aspect of the matter.\nAs I have pointed out, one of the counts of negligence alleged in terms the negligence to be a failure to provide adequate supervision, and it is only in this count that the word \u201csupervision\u201d appeared. Accordingly, the answer finding a failure to supply supervision should, in my opinion, be held to refer to the alleged failure to supply adequate supervision of the passengers. If there had been any doubt upon the matter, the jury might have been asked when they returned to clarify this answer but no such request was made on behalf of the appellant and a motion for judgment was made upon the findings as they were made. In the judgment of the Court of Appeal, however, Morden J.A. has treated the matter as if the answer referred to the count made in sub-para, (a) of para. 4 above quoted. If the matter be thus considered, it is to be noted that the ticket collector was an attendant who could stop the escalator by using the button in the ticket booth and there is no finding of negligence on the part of the ticket collector for failing to do so. Both the specific charges in sub-para. (a) are accordingly negatived unless the finding of lack of supervision be construed as meaning a failure to have an attendant in the immediate vicinity of the escalator who could instantly stop it if an accident such as this occurred.\nI would not so construe the finding but, if this is to be taken as its meaning, the case of the appellant is not, in my opinion, assisted.\nThe evidence given on behalf of the respondent at the trial shows that the Peelle escalator was chosen for use in the subways in Toronto on the advice of Charles DeLeuw, a consulting engineer of very wide experience in such matters, and of W.H. Patterson, the chief engineer of the respondent, who investigated the various available escalators before it was decided to install the escalators in question. Escalators of the same kind and employing the same type of handrail had been theretofore installed in the New York bus terminal in considerable numbers and had been found satisfactory, and there is nothing in the evidence to suggest that from a mechanical standpoint the escalator in question had not worked perfectly since its installation and was not operating properly on the night in question. I find nothing in this evidence, therefore, to suggest that, due to any apprehension of anything going wrong mechanically, there was any ground for imposing upon the transit commission any obligation to have an attendant at the place in question other than the collector who had the means at hand to stop the operation instantly. It cannot be said, in my opinion, that a reasonable person would contemplate injury to persons using the escalator such as occurred in the present matter, or that the respondent was under a duty of maintaining an attendant at the foot of the escalator to avoid the consequences of disorderly conduct on the part of those using it. In Glasgow Corporation v. Muir[9], Lord Macmillan said in part:\nThe standard of foresight of the reasonable man is, in one sense, an impersonal test. It eliminates the personal equation and is independent of the idiosyncrasies of the particular person whose conduct is in question\u2026 The reasonable man is presumed to be free both from over-apprehension and from over-confidence, but there is a sense in which the standard of care of the reasonable man involves in its application a subjective element. It is still left to the judge to decide what, in the circumstances of the particular case, the reasonable man would have had in contemplation, and what, accordingly, the party sought to be made liable ought to have foreseen.\nIn my opinion this appeal fails and should be dismissed with costs if they are demanded.\nCARTWRIGHT J. (dissenting):\u2014The facts out of which this appeal arises are stated in the reasons of other members of the Court and in those of Morden J.A., who delivered the unanimous judgment of the Court of Appeal[10].\nIn approaching the question whether the jury\u2019s verdict was rightly set aside it is necessary to bear in mind certain well settled principles, which are sufficiently stated in the following three quotations:\nIn Jamieson v. Harris[11], Nesbitt J., speaking for the majority of the Court, said:\nWe fully recognize the principle that if the verdict could fairly be supported upon any evidence upon which reasonable men might come to a conclusion in its favour that it should not be set aside because the appellate court did not agree with the conclusions reached. We also fully agree that answers by a jury to questions should be given the fullest possible effect, and, if it is possible to support the same by any reasonable construction, they should be supported.\nIn C.N.R. v. Muller[12], Duff C.J.C., speaking for the majority of the Court, said:\nWe premise that it is not the function of this Court, as it was not the duty of the Court of Appeal to review the findings of fact at which the jury arrived. Those findings are conclusive unless they are so wholly unreasonable as to show that the jury could not have been acting judicially. In construing the findings, moreover, one must not apply a too rigorous critical method; if, on a fair interpretation of them, they can be supported upon a reasonable view of the evidence adduced, effect should be given to them. In Sigurdson v. B.C. Electric Railway Co. Ltd.[13], Lord Tucker, delivering the reasons of the Judicial Committee, said:\nBefore turning to examine the summing-up in the light of these criticisms it may be well to observe that the issues involved in this and J. other similar cases turn upon questions of fact and that when a jury is the tribunal of fact to which those issues are committed their findings\u2014subject to questions of misdirection or misreception of evidence\u2014cannot be set aside unless they are of such a nature that having regard to the evidence no reasonable men could have arrived thereat. It is not for an appellate court however much it may differ from the conclusions reached by the jury to substitute its own findings for those of the jury.\nI, of course, do not suggest that these principles were absent from the minds of the learned Justices of Appeal. It was by virtue of their application that, in dealing with the jury\u2019s second finding of negligence, Morden J.A. said:\nThe second ground of negligence found by the jury was that \u201cthe defendant failed to supply supervision\u201d. Counsel for the appellant made a vigorous attack upon this finding. He submitted that if it meant the defendant should have provided attendants whose duty it would be to prevent passengers jostling (as pleaded in paragraph 4(d)) then it was not a good finding in law. The respondent\u2019s counsel submitted that the jury meant the failure of the defendant to have an attendant immediately beside the escalator whose duty it would have been to stop the escalator at the time the riders fell. (Paragraph 4(a)). There was evidence that the plaintiff suffered the greater part of her injuries after her fall and as she was being carried up the escalator lying under the bodies of two or three persons. For the purpose of this appeal, I am prepared to construe liberally this finding of the jury and accept the interpretation the respondent\u2019s counsel places on it.\nIn my view, read in the light of the evidence and of the full and careful charge of the learned trial judge, this answer of the jury should be construed as a finding that the defendant ought to have maintained such a system of supervision of its escalator that it could and would be promptly stopped if an emergency arose calling for such action.\nThe question then is whether, so construed, the answer of the jury supports the verdict.\nI agree with the view implicit in the passage from the reasons of Morden J.A., quoted above, that there was evidence upon which it was open to the jury to find that the greater part of the appellant\u2019s injuries would have been avoided if the escalator had been stopped with reasonable promptitude after her fall. The mechanical means provided for stopping the escalator consisted of a red button at the top and a similar one at the bottom of the escalator and a third in a collector\u2019s \u201ccage\u201d situated some 75 or 80 feet from the bottom of the escalator and from which it was said the employee stationed (there would have a view of the escalator. The employee who was on duty in this \u201ccage\u201d at the time of the accident died prior to the trial and his evidence had not been taken de bene esse. It is undisputed that the escalator was not stopped at any time. When the appellant was knocked down she was about one third of the way up the escalator. The time taken to carry a passenger from the bottom to the top was about twenty seconds.\nIt is clear that when the three men ahead of her and the appellant herself fell there must have been a visible state of emergency; it is also clear that there were screams from the appellant and her friend; but nothing was done by anyone to stop the escalator. No explanation was forthcoming as to why the employee in the \u201ccage\u201d did nothing. If an explanation was required the onus of furnishing it rested upon the respondent whose employee he was and in whose knowledge the explanation, if any, must have lain.\nIn these circumstances it was, I think, open to the jury to find that the respondent was on the horns of a dilemma; either it had not instructed its employee to stop the escalator at once if an emergency arose or if it had given adequate instructions its employee had disregarded them.\nThere was evidence that some escalators in this country and in the United States are operated without attendants, but there was also a considerable body of evidence that others have properly instructed attendants stationed by them. Notably, it was shown that in several large stores in the city of Toronto there are either attendants stationed at the escalators or clerks, in much closer proximity thereto than was the employee of the respondent in this case, who are shown how to stop the escalator and instructed to stop it at once if an emergency arises. The following passage from Phipson on Evidence, 9th ed., p. 116, was cited with approval in this Court in Fagnan v. Ure et al.[14]:\nOn questions involving negligence, reasonableness, and other qualities of conduct, when the criterion to be adopted is not clear, the acts or precautions proper to be taken under the circumstances, and even the general practice of the community, or in some cases of the particular individuals, are admissible as affording a measure by which the conduct in question may be gauged. Such evidence does not, of course, bind the jury as a fixed legal standard; it is merely one, amongst other circumstances, by which they may be guided,\nas was also the following statement of Holmes J. in Texas and Pacific Railway Company v. Behymer[15]:\nWhat usually is done may be evidence of what ought to be done, but what ought to be done is fixed by a standard of reasonable prudence, whether it usually is complied with or not.\nThe duty owed by the respondent to the appellant was, as is pointed out in the reasons of the Chief Justice, to use all due, proper and reasonable care, and the care required is of a very high degree. It is of a higher degree, in my opinion, than that owed to their customers by those storekeepers who were shown in the evidence to have taken the precautions I have described above.\nIn a case such as this where the precautions to be taken are not prescribed by statute \u201cthe standard of duty must be fixed by the verdict of a jury\u201d, to use the words of Lord Wright in Lochgelly Iron and Coal Co. v. M\u2019Mullan[16].\nIn my view, the learned trial judge could not properly have withdrawn this issue from the jury; there was evidence, notably that of the established practice in other Toronto buildings, to support their findings.\nIn McCannell v. McLean[17], Duff C.J.C., in delivering the judgment of the Court, said:\nThere being some evidence for the jury, that is to say, the evidence being of such a character that the trial judge could not properly have withdrawn the issue from the jury, the question whether, in such circumstances, a jury, considering the evidence as a whole, could not reasonably arrive at a given finding may be, it is obvious, a question of not a little nicety; and the power vested in the court of appeal to set aside a verdict as against the weight of evidence in that sense is one which ought to be exercised with caution; it belongs, moreover, to a class of questions in the determination of which judges will naturally differ, and, as everyone knows, such differences of opinion do frequently appear.\nIn this case I have the misfortune to differ from the opinion of the learned Justices of Appeal and that of other members of this Court. I do not think it can be affirmed that no jury acting reasonably could have found as they did on the second ground. I do not find it necessary to consider the other ground on which they based their verdict.\nI would allow the appeal and restore the judgment at the trial with costs throughout.\nAppeal dismissed with costs if demanded, CARTWRIGHT J. dissenting.\nSolicitors for the plaintiff, appellant: Haines, Thomson, Rogers, Howie & Freeman, Toronto.\nSolicitor for the defendant, respondent: J.W.H.

He drove one truck and hired drivers to operate the others. The firm which for years had engaged his services entered into a closed shop agreement with the defendant, a trade union within the definition of that expression in the Labour Relations Act. The plaintiff agreed to hire only union members, but refused to join the union himself, presumably because he could not lawfully do so. The union threatened to put his truck off the job and to picket the firm. Finally, the firm discontinued doing business with him. The trial judge maintained the action for damages and granted an injunction restraining the union from interfering with the plaintiff in the operation of his business. This judgment was affirmed by the Court of Appeal. The union appealed to this Court and contended that it was not a legal entity which could be found liable in tort, and that the evidence did not disclose a cause of action.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nPer Curiam: The plaintiff, being a trade union certified as a bargaining agent under the Labour Relations Act, was a legal entity which could be made liable in name for damages either for breach of a provision of the Act or under the common law. The granting by the Legislature, of rights, powers and immunities to trade unions was quite inconsistent with the idea that it was not intended that they should be constituted legal entities exercising these powers and enjoying these immunities as such. Taff Vale Railway v. Amalgamated Society of Railway Servants, [1901] A.C. 426, applied; Orchard v. Tunney, [1957] S.C.R. 436; Society Brand Clothes v. Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America, [1931] S.C.R. 321; International Ladies Garment Workers Union v. Rothman, [1941] S.C.R. 388, distinguished.\nThe evidence disclosed a cause of action. By threatening to picket the jobs, instead of resorting to the grievance procedure in the agreement, the union was in breach both of the terms of the agreement and of s. 21 of the Labour Relations Act. This resulted in the injurious termination of the plaintiff's arrangement with the firm. The plaintiff was asserting a common law cause of action and to ascertain whether the means employed were illegal inquiry could be made both at common law and of the statute law.\nPer Kerwin C.J. and Cartwright J.: Assuming, without deciding, that the wrongful act committed by the union was \"in connection with a trade or labour dispute\", s. 2 of the Trade-unions Act did not assist the union in the circumstances of this case. The issue as to whether the Act had been authorized by the union was not raised either on the pleadings or in the evidence.\nThe argument that the union did not intend to ignore the grievance procedure in the agreement, failed on the facts.\nPer Taschereau and Locke JJ.: While it was alleged before this Court that the wrongful acts were not authorized or concurred in by the union, the point was not argued. If it was intended to raise such a defence, the facts relied upon should have been pleaded.\nSection 2 of the Trade-unions Act had no bearing upon the matter. The threats were not done in connection with any trade or labour dispute within the meaning of the Act, which contemplates disputes between employers and employees. Per Martland J.: There was, in this case, no trade or labour dispute within the meaning of s. 2 of the Trade-unions Act. A difference of view between an employer and employees on the interpretation of a collective agreement, in the circumstances of this case, did not constitute \"a trade or labour dispute\" within the section.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1], affirming a judgment of Clyne J. Appeal dismissed.\nJ. L. Farris, Q.C., and V. L. Dryer, Q.C., for the defendant, appellant.\nJ. J. Robinette, Q.C., and G. Ladner, for the plaintiff, respondent.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE:\u2014I am in substantial agreement with the reasons of Locke J. on the two main questions, i.e., that the appellant is an entity which can be sued and that it committed an actionable wrong.\nAs to the first, the point is raised at p. 7 of the appellant's factum, where it is stated \"The Union is not a suable entity: (c) under the Trade Unions Act.\" This is expanded at p. 19 of the factum where s. 2 of the Trade-unions Act, R.S.B.C. 1948, c. 342, is set out in para. (1) of (c), and at p. 20 the following appears:\n(2) It is submitted that this section does not make a trade union a legal entity. It bears no resemblance to the trade union legislation that was before the Courts in the Taff Vale Case, 1901 A.C. 426.\n(3) It is further submitted that section 2 of The Trade Unions Act prohibits the imposition of liability in this case, because there is no evidence that the members of the appellant union or its governing body authorized or concurred in any wrongful act.\nThe point was not considered in the Courts below and certainly it is not mentioned in any of the reasons for judgment, but, for the reasons given by Cartwright J., I am of opinion that the point fails. Like him, I am assuming that the wrongful act committed by the appellant was \"in connection with any \u2026 trade or labour dispute\", but I am expressing no opinion as to whether or not that is so.\nOn the second point as to whether it should be found that the appellant did not intend to ignore the \"grievance procedure\" referred to in cl. 16 of the Collective Agreement between the appellant and City Construction Company, Limited, I agree with Cartwright J. that the argument fails on the facts.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nThe judgment of Taschereau and Locke JJ. was delivered by\nLOCKE J.:\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Appeal of British Columbia[2] which dismissed the appeal of the present appellant, the defendant in the action, from a judgment of Clyne J. By that judgment the respondent recovered general damages in the sum of $2,500, special damages for loss of profit for a named period, and was granted an injunction restraining the appellant from interfering with the plaintiff, his agents or servants or any of them, in the operation of his business by endeavouring to induce or coerce the plaintiff to join the defendant union or from negotiating or dealing with any person, firm or corporation in any way to induce or coerce the plaintiff to join the said union.\nFor some years prior to the month of September 1956 the respondent was the owner and operator of a contracting and trucking business in Vancouver and at the time in question owned a tractor and four trucks. He had for years supplied trucks to the City Construction Co. Ltd., a company carrying on its business in British Columbia, together with drivers employed by him, and a truck which he himself operated, these vehicles being used by the construction company in connection with their operations, in consideration of an agreed payment to the respondent. In this arrangement the position of the respondent was that of an independent contractor and the truck drivers employed by him acted as his servants and were paid by him. There was no written contract between the parties but the evidence shows that the services rendered were satisfactory to the construction company and would have been continued for an indefinite period of time but for the events complained of. The appellant is a trade union, as that expression is defined in the Labour Relations Act, 1954 (B.C.), c. 17, s. 1. Local no. 213, the appellant in these proceedings, is an organization forming part of an international union which has its headquarters in the United States.\nOn September 28, 1955, the appellant had entered into an agreement as to wages and working conditions with the City Construction Co. Ltd. as the bargaining agent of the truck drivers employed by that company and which covered all construction work undertaken by it in the province. While no evidence was given upon the point, it appears to have been assumed throughout that the union had been certified as the bargaining agent of these employees under the provisions of the Labour Relations Act and was, accordingly, empowered to contract in writing on their behalf in regard to their working conditions, rates of pay and other matters commonly forming part of a collective agreement.\nClause 10 of this agreement read:\nWhen Truck Drivers are required, competent Union men, members of Local No. 213, shall be hired. When competent Local No. 213 Union men are not available, then the employer may obtain Truck Drivers elsewhere, it being understood that they shall join the Union within thirty (30) days or be replaced by competent Union tradesmen when available. It is the prerogative of the employer to hire and discharge employees. It shall not be the duty of the employer to induce non-members to join the Union.\nClause 16, which dealt with what was described as grievance procedure, provided in part that, if during the term of the agreement any dispute should arise as to the carrying out of its terms or its interpretation, each party should appoint three persons to be members of a committee to examine the difficulty in an endeavour to find a solution. If this failed the clause provided that an arbitration board should be constituted and its decision should be final.\nThe facts, as found by the learned trial judge, are as follows:\u2014During the summer of 1956 one Carbonneau, a business agent of the union, called at the premises of the City Construction Co. Ltd. to make certain that the truck drivers employed belonged to the union. There he saw Therien and told him that he must join the union as well as the other drivers of his trucks. Therien, presumably having in mind the provisions of the Labour Relations Act, refused to join the union but agreed that he would employ union drivers for his other trucks and thereafter did so. Carbonneau admitted that in June 1956 he knew that Therien was himself an employer of labour: nevertheless, he told Therien that if he did not join the union they would \"placard\" the company and have his truck put off the job. Thereafter Carbonneau and another union representative had several conversations with the despatcher of the construction company and told him that if the company continued to use Therien's truck they would \"placard\" the various places where the company was doing work. Smith referred the matter to the general manager of the company, C. W. Bridge, and Carbonneau told the latter that Therien must not only employ the union drivers but must be a member of the union himself and that if Therien continued to drive a truck the company's job would be placarded. The learned trial judge found that by this term the union officials meant, and were understood to mean, that they would, by means of a picket line carrying placards, take such steps as would have the effect of interfering with and obstructing the operations of the company and of making it appear to the public and other labour unions that the company had broken its contract with the defendant union, or was indulging in unfair labour practices.\nIn consequence of these threats, Bridge wrote to the respondent informing him that the construction company would no longer be able to hire the truck driven by himself after that date. The letter read in part:\nas we have been threatened with picket lines, etc., should you be seen operating on any of our jobs, even though you own your own vehicle and employ Union personnel on your other trucks, I find it necessary to refrain from hiring you as several of our jobs have completion dates and must be finished without interference from Union disputes.\nThe respondent continued for a few days longer supplying trucks, including the one driven by himself, to the Construction Company, but on September 24, 1956, he was finally told that the company could no longer do business with him. Subsection (1) of s. 4 of the Labour Relations Act reads in part:\nNo employer or employers' organization, and no person acting on behalf of an employer or employers' organization, shall participate in or interfere with the formation or administration of a trade-union or contribute financial or other support to it.\nSection 6 of the Act reads:\nNo trade-union, employers' organization, or person shall use coercion or intimidation of any kind that could reasonably have the effect of compelling or inducing any person to become or refrain from becoming, or to continue or to cease to be, a member of a trade-union.\nIn Morrison v. Yellow Cab Co. Ltd.[3], Clyne J. had held that an employer in a position similar to that of the present respondent was precluded by subs. (1) of s. 4 from becoming a member of a trade-union in the province, a conclusion with which I respectfully agree. Notwithstanding the provisions of the section, the secretary-treasurer of the union said in evidence at the trial that, in spite of the fact that he was an employer, the union would accept him into its membership.\nThat damage to the respondent resulted from these actions cannot be disputed. By way of defence to the action the appellant says, firstly, that it is not a legal entity which may be found liable in tort, and secondly, that the evidence does not disclose a cause of action, either at common law or under the Industrial Conciliation and Arbitration Act.\nThe first of these questions is not determined in the appellant's favour by the decision of this Court in Orchard v. Tunney[4] In that case the action was originally brought against Orchard and six other members of the Executive Committee of Local Union No. 119 of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters Union. By an interlocutory order made by the Court of Appeal after the judgment at the trial, a representation order was made and the style of cause amended to indicate that these individual defendants were sued on their own behalf and on behalf of all other members of the labour union except the plaintiff. The proceedings in the matter do not indicate whether the collective agreement signed by the union with Tunney's employers had been made after the union had been certified as the bargaining agent under the provisions of the Labour Relations Act, R.S.M. 1948, c. 27, and, as the action was not brought against the union, the question as to whether it was in law an entity which might be made liable in tort was not considered, either at the trial by Williams C.J. or in the Court of Appeal or argued in this Court. There was, accordingly, no issue in this Court as to the legal status of the labour union. Accordingly, what was said by Rand J. in delivering the judgment of the majority of the Court and by me in delivering the judgment of our late brother Nolan and myself, which really merely consisted in restating what had been said earlier in this Court by Duff J. (as he then was), Anglin J. (as he then was) and Brodeur J. in Local Union v. Williams[5], cannot be taken as deciding that in Manitoba a trade union certified as bargaining agent under the Manitoba Act (which closely resembles that of British Columbia) is not an entity which may be held liable in tort. A case is only authority for what it actually decides.\nThe question as to whether a trade union certified as a bargaining agent by a statute in the terms of the Labour Relations Act of British Columbia may be made liable in an action, either in tort or contract, has not heretofore been considered by this Court.\nIn Taff Vale Railway v. Amalgamated Society of Railway Servants[6], the action was brought against a trade union registered under the Trade Union Acts of 1871 and 1876 for an injunction restraining the union, its servants and agents and others acting by their authority from watching or besetting the Great Western Railway Station at Cardiff. A motion made on behalf of the union before Farwell J. to strike out the name of that defendant on the ground that it was neither a corporation nor an individual and could not be sued in a quasi-corporate or any other capacity was dismissed.\nIt appears to me to be clear that, had it not been that the trade union was registered under the Trade Union Act, the action against it by name would not have been maintained. Provision was made by the Act of 1871 for the registration of trade unions and they were given power, inter alia, to purchase property in the names of trustees designated by them and to sell or let such property. The trustees of any registered union were empowered to bring or defend actions touching or concerning the property of the union and might be sued in any court of law or equity in respect of any real or personal property of the union. The union was also required to have a registered office and to make annual returns to the Registrar appointed under the Act yearly, and any trade union failing to comply with the provisions of the Act and every officer of the union so failing was made liable to a penalty.\nFarwell J. said that the fact that a trade union is neither a corporation nor an individual or a partnership between a number of individuals did not conclude the matter. After pointing out that the Acts legalized the usual trade union contracts, established a registry of trade unions giving to each an exclusive right to the name in which it was registered and authorized it through the medium of trustees to own a limited amount of real estate and unlimited personal estate, said in part (p. 429):\nNow, although a corporation and an individual or individuals may be the only entity known to the common law who can sue or be sued, it is competent to the Legislature to give to an association of individuals which is neither a corporation nor a partnership nor an individual a capacity for owning property and acting by agents, and such capacity in the absence of express enactment to the contrary involves the necessary correlative of liability to the extent of such property for the acts and defaults of such agents. It is beside the mark to say of such an association that it is unknown to the common law. The Legislature has legalised it, and it must be dealt with by the Courts according to the intention of the Legislature\u2026\nNow, the Legislature in giving a trade union the capacity to own property and the capacity to act by agents has, without incorporating it, given it two of the essential qualities of a corporation\u2014essential, I mean, in respect of liability for tort, for a corporation can only act by its agents, and can only be made to pay by means of its property. The principle on which corporations have been held liable in respect of wrongs committed by its servants or agents in the course of their service and for the benefit of the employer\u2014qui sentit commodum sentire debet et onus\u2014(see Mersey Docks Trustees v. Gibbs (1886) L.R. 1 H.L. 93) is as applicable to the case of a trade union as to that of a corporation\u2026. The proper rule of construction of statutes such as these is that in the absence of express contrary intention the Legislature intends that the creature of the statute shall have the same duties, and that its funds shall be subject to the same liabilities as the general law would impose on a private individual doing the same thing. It would require very clear and express words of enactment to induce me to hold that the Legislature had in fact legalised the existence of such irresponsible bodies with such wide capacity for evil. The order dismissing the motion was set aside by the Court of Appeal but restored in the House of Lords. Halsbury L.C. said that he was content to adopt the judgment of Farwell J. with which he entirely concurred and added (p. 436):\nIf the Legislature has created a thing which can own property, which can employ servants, and which can inflict injury, it must be taken, I think, to have impliedly given the power to make it suable in a Court of Law for injuries purposely done by its authority and procurement.\nLord Macnaghten, Lord Shand and Lord Brampton were agreed in adopting the judgment of Farwell J. and the reasoning upon which it proceeded. Lord Lindley, after saying that he had no doubt that, if the trade union could not be sued in its registered name, some of its members could be sued on behalf of themselves and the other members of the society and an injunction and judgment for damages could be obtained in an action so framed, said that the question in the litigation was of comparatively small importance but that the Act appeared to indicate with sufficient clearness that the registered name is one which may be used to denote the union as an unincorporated society in legal proceedings as well as for business and other purposes, and that the use of the name imposed no duty and altered no rights but was only a more convenient mode of proceeding than that which would have to be adopted if the name could not be used.\nIt was, undoubtedly, as a result of the judgment in the Taff Vale case that the Trade Disputes Act of 1906 (c. 47) which amended the Trade Union Acts of 1871 and 1876 was passed. That Act did not alter the law as declared by the House of Lords as to registered trade unions being entities which might be held liable in tort, but declared the rights of persons on behalf of trade unions to carry on what has now become to be known as peaceful picketing, and further declared that an action against a trade union or any members or officials thereof on behalf of themselves and all other members of such union in respect of any tortious act alleged to have been committed by or on behalf of the union should not be entertained by any court.\nIt was clearly, I think, in consequence of the Taff Vale decision that the Legislature of British Columbia enacted the Trade Union Act of 1902 (c. 66). This Act declared that no trade union or the trustees of any such union shall be liable for damages for any wrongful act or omission or commission in connection with any strike, lock-out or trade or labour dispute, unless the members of such union or its council or other governing body shall have authorized, or shall have been a concurring party in such wrongful act: that no such trade union nor any of its servants or agents shall be enjoined, nor its funds or any of such officers be made liable for communicating to any person facts respecting employment or hiring or in persuading or endeavouring to persuade by fair or reasonable argument any workman or person to refuse to continue or become the employee or customer of any employer of labour. Section 3 of that Act further declared that no trade union or its agents or servants shall be liable in damages for publishing information with regard to a strike or lock-out or for warning workmen or other persons against seeking employment in the locality affected by any strike, lock-out or labour trouble or from purchasing, buying or consuming products produced by the employer of labour party to such strike.\nIt will be seen that the British Columbia Act, by its reference to trade unions as such, as well as to the servants and agents of such unions restricting their liability in tort to the extent defined, recognized the fact that a trade union was an entity which might be enjoined or become liable in damages for tort.\nIt may be said in passing that there was no such statute in force in the Province of Manitoba when the cause of action arose in Orchard's case. In Cotter v. Osborne[7], the action to restrain and recover damages for the acts of certain members of a trade union in the course of a trade dispute was brought against the individuals and a representation order made by Mathers J. As in Orchard's case the question as to whether the union might have been sued or enjoined by name was not raised.\nBy the Labour Relations Act, s. 2, a trade union as defined includes a local branch of an international organization such as the appellant in the present matter. Extensive rights are given to such trade unions and certain prohibitions declared which affect them. The Act treats a trade union as an entity and as such it is prohibited, inter alia, from attempting at the employer's place of employment during working hours to persuade an employee to join or not to join a trade union, from encouraging or engaging in any activity designed to restrict or limit production or services, from using coercion or intimidation of any kind that could reasonably have the effect of compelling any person to become or refrain to become a member of a trade union and from declaring or authorizing a strike until certain defined steps have been taken. By s, 7 if there is a complaint to the Labour Relations Board that a union is doing or has done any act prohibited by ss. 4, 5 or 6, the Board may order that the default be remedied and, if it continues, the union may be prosecuted for a breach of the Act. By s, 9 all employers are required to honour a written assignment of wages by their employees to a trade union. A union claiming to have as members in good standing a majority of employees in a unit appropriate for collective bargaining is entitled to apply to the Labour Relations Board for certification as the bargaining agent of such employees and, when certified, to require the employer to bargain with it and, if agreement is reached, to enter into a written agreement with it which is signed by the union in its own name as such bargaining agent. Throughout the Act such organizations are referred to as trade unions and thus treated as legal entities.\nThe question as to whether a trade union such as the present appellant is an entity which might be proceeded against by name in proceedings under the Industrial Conciliation and Arbitration Act, 1947, (c. 44) was considered by the Court of Appeal in In re Patterson and Nanaimo Dry Cleaning and Laundry Workers Union Local No.[8]. The provisions of that statute, which was repealed by the Labour Relations Act, in so far as they affect the present consideration, appear to me indistinguishable from the latter Act. Proceedings had been taken in the Police Court against the union named, for an alleged breach of the provisions of the Act in authorizing a strike of the employees before a conciliation board had been appointed to endeavour to bring about an agreement. It was only necessary in the case to determine whether a trade union, acting as a bargaining agent, could be proceeded against under the Act, but the broader question as to whether the union had, by reason of the Provisions of the Trade Union Act and the Industrial Conciliation and Arbitration Act, been constituted an entity in law was discussed in the reasons delivered by O'Halloran and Robertson JJ.A. Both of these learned judges expressed the view that such a union was by virtue of these statutes of the province an entity distinct from its members or, as expressed by Robertson J.A., adopting what had been said by Scott L.J. in National Union of General and Municipal Workers v. Gillian[9], a perona juridica.\nIn a later case: Vancouver Machinery Depot v. United Steel Workers of America[10], the Court held that an international union which had not been actually appointed a bargaining agent under the Industrial Conciliation and Arbitration Act, 1947, was none the less a legal entity against which an action for damages might be maintained. Sidney Smith J.A., with whom Sloan C.J. and O'Halloran J.A. agreed, said in part. (p. 328):\nIt seems to me that it would lead to all sorts of anomalies if a union's legal status under the Act was conferred merely by its being chosen to represent a group of workers. The matter of the status of a union as a legal entity, either at large or limited in purpose, depends upon the recognition and definition by the legislature of its capacity.\nWere it not for the provisions of the Trade-unions Act and the Industrial Relations Act if the union was simply and unincorporated association of workmen, it would not, in my opinion, be an entity which might be sued by name, and what was said by Duff J. and by Anglin J. (with whom Brodeur J. agreed) in Local Union v. Williams above referred to would apply. Such an unincorporated body not being an entity known to the law would be incapable of entering into a contract: Canada Morning News Co. v. Thompson[11]. That, however, is not the present case.\nI agree with the opinions expressed by the learned judges of the Court of Appeal in the cases to which I have above referred. The granting of these rights, powers and immunities to these unincorporated associations or bodies is quite inconsistent with the idea that it was not intended that they should be constituted legal entities exercising these powers and enjoying these immunities as such. What was said by Farwell J. in the passage from the judgment in the Taff Vale case which is above quoted appears to me to be directly applicable. It is necessary for the exercise of the powers given that such unions should have officers or other agents to act in their names and on their behalf. The legislature, by giving the right to act as agent for others and to contract on their behalf, has given them two of the essential qualities of a corporation in respect of liability for tort since a corporation can only act by its agents.\nThe passage from the judgment of Blackburn J. delivering the opinion of the judges which was adopted by the House of Lords in Mersey Docks v. Gibbs[12], referred to by Farwell J. states the rule of construction that is to be applied. In the absence of anything to show a contrary intention\u2014and there is nothing here\u2014the legislature must be taken to have intended that the creature of the statute shall have the same duties and that its funds shall be subject to the same liabilities as the general law would impose on a private individual doing the same thing. Qui sentit commodum sentire debet et onus.\nIn my opinion, the appellant is a legal entity which may be made liable in name for damages either for breach of a provision of the Labour Relations Act or under the common law.\nThe decisions of this Court in Society Brand Clothes Ltd. v. Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America[13]], and International Ladies Garment Workers Union v. Rothman[14], do not conflict with this conclusion. When those actions were instituted there was no legislation in the Province of Quebec similar to the Trade Union Act of 1902 and the Labour Relations Act of British Columbia above referred to.\nThere remains the question as to whether the evidence discloses a cause of action. The appellant says that what was done by its servants was nothing more than to insist upon compliance by the City Construction Co. Ltd. with the terms of cl. 10 of the collective agreement. No doubt there was coercion exercised by Carbonneau in threatening the respondent that if he did not join the union he would have him put off the job, and it is equally clear that for Therien to join the union was legally impossible. It was not, however, this wrongful act which was the cause of the injury complained of, and if there is a cause of action it must be found elsewhere.\nIn addition to ss. 4 and 6 of the Labour Relations Act which are above quoted, ss. 21 and 22 are to be considered. Section 21 reads:\nEvery person who is bound by a collective agreement, whether entered into before or after the coming into force of this Act, shall do everything he is required to do, and shall refrain from doing anything that he is required to refrain from doing, by the provisions of the collective agreement, and failure to do so or refrain from so doing shall be an offence against this Act.\nSection 22, so far as relevant, reads:\n(1) Every collective agreement entered into after the commencement of this Act shall contain a provision for final and conclusive settlement without stoppage of work, by arbitration or otherwise, of all differences between the persons bound by the agreement concerning its interpretation, application, operation, or any alleged violation thereof.\nThe appellant and the City Construction Company Ltd., in compliance with this requirement, had provided for the settlement of disputes as to the interpretation of the agreement by cl. 16 above referred to.\nThe evidence shows that the employer wished to continue its arrangement with the respondent in his capacity as an independent contractor and that Therien rightly took the attitude that he would not join the union, presumably because the Act forbade him to do so.\nClause 3 of the contract provided that its terms should apply to all sub-contractors or sub-contracts let by the employer and it might perhaps be contended that this applied to an independent contractor supplying trucks and services such as did the respondent. The learned trial judge held that cl. 10 did not apply to an independent contractor such as the respondent who drove his own truck. The employer was apparently of this opinion and the matter was one which should have been dealt with accordingly under the grievance procedure clause of the contract. The appellant, however, without resorting to this, threatened to placard jobs upon which the employer was engaged which, as found by the learned trial judge, meant that the union would, by means of a picket line carrying placards, take such steps as would have the effect of obstructing the operations of the company and making it appear to the public and other labour unions that the company had broken its contract with the defendant union or was indulging in unfair labour practices. This conduct was a breach both of the terms of the agreement and of s. 21 of the Labour Relations Act. That the decision of the City Construction Co. Ltd. to terminate its longstanding arrangement with the respondent resulted from these wrongful acts is undoubted.\nAs it was said by Lord Dunedin in Sorrell v. Smith[15], in summarizing what had been decided in Mogul Steamship Company v. M'Gregor[16], Allen v. Flood[17] and Quinn v. Leathem[18], even though the dominating motive in a certain course of action may be the furtherance of your own business or your own interests, you are not entitled to interfere with another man's method of gaining his living by illegal means.\nI agree with Sheppard J.A. that in relying upon these sections of the Act the respondent is asserting, not a statutory cause of action, but a common law cause of action, and that to ascertain whether the means employed were illegal inquiry may be made both at common law and of the statute law.\nWhile in the concluding paragraph of the appellant's factum it is said that the action was barred by the terms of s. 2 of the Trade Unions Act, R.S.B.C. 1948, c. 342, since there is no evidence that the members of the union or its governing body authorized or concurred in the wrongful act counsel for the appellant did not argue the point before us. If it was intended to raise any such defence, the facts relied upon should have been pleaded for the reasons stated by my brother Cartwright. Since no mention is made of the matter in the reasons for judgment delivered by the trial judge and in the Court of Appeal, it is apparent that the question was not argued in either Court. Section 2 of the Act, as it appears in c. 342 of the Revised Statutes, with slight changes which do not affect the present question, reproduces that section in the statute of 1902 which I have above referred to. In my opinion, it has no bearing upon the present matter. There was here no strike or lock-out or trade or labour dispute within the meaning of those expressions in the Act. The disputes there referred to are, in my opinion, those commonly so described arising between employers and employees as to wages, working conditions, hours of employment and other like matters. The wrongful act of the business agent in bringing about by unlawful threats the severing of business relations between an employer and an independent contractor, to the detriment of the latter, was not done in connection with any such dispute.\nI would dismiss this appeal with costs.\nCARTWRIGHT J.:\u2014The facts out of which this appeal arises are stated in the reasons of my brother Locke.\nTwo main questions are raised. It is said, first, that the appellant is not an entity which can be sued and, secondly, that in any event its conduct, of which complaint is made, did not constitute an actionable wrong.\nOn both of these questions I am in substantial agreement with the reasons of my brother Locke. I wish, however, to add a few observations as to two matters.\nThe first is as to the effect of s. 2 of the Trade-unions Act, R.S.B.C. 1948, c. 342. This section reads as follows:\n2. No trade-union nor any association of workmen or employees in the Province, nor the trustees of any such trade-union or association in their representative capacity, shall be liable in damages for any wrongful act of commission or omission in connection with any strike, lockout, or trade or labour dispute, unless the members of such trade-union or association, or its council, committee, or other governing body, acting within the authority or jurisdiction given such council, committee, or other governing body by the rules, regulations, or directions of such trade-union or association, or the resolutions or directions of its members resident in the locality or a majority thereof, have authorized or have been a concurring party in such wrongful act.\nThe predecessor of this section was first enacted in 1902 by s. 2 of c. 66 of the Statutes of British Columbia for that year. The minor verbal differences between that section and the present one are of no significance. As has already been pointed out by my brother Locke, it would be surprising that a section should be passed to provide that a trade-union should not be liable in damages for a wrongful act in connection with certain matters unless certain conditions existed if it were the view of the Legislature, as the appellant contends, that a trade-union cannot be sued in tort under any circumstances. I propose, however, to examine the question whether the section affects the right of action to which, in the Courts below, the plaintiff has been found to be entitled.\nThis question is raised in the appellant's factum in the following paragraph:\nIt is further submitted that section 2 of The Trade Unions Act prohibits the imposition of liability in this case, because there is no evidence that the members of the appellant union or its governing body authorized or concurred in any wrongful act.\nThe wrongful act for which the appellant has been found liable is, by the use of illegal means, inducing the City Construction Company Limited to act in such a manner as to cause damage to the respondent.\nIn its statement of defence the appellant does not plead the Trade-unions Act, but it was not required to do so; see s. 23(7) of the Interpretation Act, R.S.B.C. 1948, c. 1:\n(7) Every Act shall, unless by express provision it is declared to be a private Act, be deemed to be a public Act, and shall be judicially noticed by all Judges, Magistrates, and others, without being specially pleaded:\nThe statement of claim contains an allegation that the wrongful act complained of was that of the appellant and that the threat which has been held to constitute the illegal means referred to above was uttered \"by or on behalf of\" the appellant. In my opinion this was a sufficient allegation that the act attributed to the union was authorized in the manner described in s. 2 of the Trade-unions Act. In cases to which the section applies, such authorization is made a condition precedent to the existence of liability on the part of the union and, on the assumption that the section is applicable in the case at bar, an averment of the performance or occurrence of the condition is implied in the statement of claim under Marginal Rule 210 (order 19, r. 14) of the Supreme Court Rules of British Columbia which reads:\n14. Any condition precedent, the performance or occurrence of which is intended to be contested, shall be distinctly specified in his pleading by the plaintiff or defendant (as the case may be); and, subject thereto, an averment of the performance or occurrence of all conditions precedent necessary for the case of the plaintiff or defendant shall be implied in his pleading.\nIf the appellant intended to contest the existence of the authorization contemplated by s. 2 of the Trade-unions Act this should have been distinctly specified in its statement of defence. Had the issue been raised on the pleadings, it would have been necessary to consider whether the onus of disproving authorization would not have rested upon the appellant as being a matter peculiarly within its knowledge; but, in my opinion, the issue was not raised. It further appears that nowhere in the evidence or in the course of the trial did the appellant suggest that what was done by its officers was not duly authorized by it. The theory of the appellant's defence was that the actions of its officers were justified or, at all events, were not unlawful. The appellant sought throughout not to repudiate the acts of its officials but to vindicate them. If this point was taken in the Courts below it would appear to have been rejected as there is no mention of it in any of the reasons delivered.\nIn his reasons the learned trial judge makes no reference to any argument based upon s. 2, but he does say:\nThe acts of the union officials were the acts of the union, and as they were wrongful the union is responsible to the plaintiff in damages.\nWhile the notice of appeal to the Court of Appeal contained 6 paragraphs and 22 sub-paragraphs, the question of authorization under s. 2 is not mentioned. However, as the point is set out in the appellant's factum I have expressed my views upon it. I am of opinion that in the circumstances of this case s. 2 of the Trade-unions Act does not assist the appellant. In dealing with this point I have assumed, without deciding, that the wrongful act committed by the appellant was \"in connection with a trade or labour dispute\", but I wish to make it clear that I am expressing no opinion as to whether or not it should be so regarded.\nThe second matter to which I wish to refer is the appellant's argument that on the evidence it should have been found that the appellant did not intend to ignore the \"grievance procedure\" provided in cl. 16 of the collective agreement between the appellant and the City Construction Company Limited. This argument fails on the facts. The learned trial judge does not refer to it expressly but it is implicit in his findings of fact that the threat made to the City Construction Company Limited was that its jobs would be placarded unless the respondent's services were dispensed with, and that it was neither said nor understood that the placarding would not take place unless and until the \"grievance\" and arbitration procedure had been resorted to and had resulted in a decision in favour of the union.\nWhile Davey J.A. did not find it necessary to express a final opinion on this point, he examined it and I find his reasons for rejecting the appellant's submission convincing and wish to adopt them, particularly the following passages:\nThe union threatened to picket the Company's jobs without having recourse to arbitration proceedings provided by clause 16 of the agreement as required by Section 22 of the Act, for final and binding settlement of all disputes concerning, inter alia, the interpretation and carrying out of the collective agreement.\n***\nThe union's remedy was not to picket but to invoke arbitration to determine whether or not the Company was observing clause 10.\nThe union's witnesses say in effect that the Company was told that picketing would only be resorted to after exhausting the grievance procedure, but the learned trial judge, understandably, has made no express finding on that qualification. In the light of the meagre information before me, I completely fail to understand that qualification, or the need at that stage of threats to picket, or to picket at all after recourse to arbitration, because there is nothing to suggest that the company would not have observed an award in favour of the union. Failure to obey the award would have exposed the company to prosecution under the Act. On the other hand, if the arbitrators took the same view of clause 10 as the learned Judge did the union's demands would collapse because it, in turn, would be bound by the award.\nAs I see it at the moment, the union's threat to picket was not justified as a measure to protect its contractual rights under the collective agreement, but on the contrary was a repudiation and violation of clause 16 of the agreement providing for a final binding settlement of disputes by arbitration.\nFor the reasons so expressed I would reject this argument of the appellant.\nI would dispose of the appeal as proposed by my brother Locke.\nMARTLAND J.:\u2014I agree with the reasons of my brother Locke and merely wish to make some observations regarding the effect of s. 2 of the Trade-unions Act, R.S.B.C. 1948, c. 342. That section, subject to some slight changes which are here immaterial, is the same as the section which first appeared in c. 258, Statutes of British Columbia, 1902, which was probably passed in consequence of the decision of the House of Lords in Taff Vale Railway v. Amalgamated Society of Railway Servants[19]. Its purpose was to limit the circumstances in which trade unions could be made liable in damages by reason of acts done in connection with a strike, lockout, or trade or labour dispute.\nIn the present case, there was no strike or lockout. Was there a trade or labour dispute? To constitute such a dispute, there must be, I think, a dispute between an employer and his employees or, perhaps, as between the employees themselves, respecting the terms or conditions of their employment. To constitute a trade or labour dispute there would have to be a dispute between City Construction Company Ltd. and its employees. A dispute between the respondent, who was not an employee, and the appellant, the certified bargaining agent of those employees, was not a trade or labour dispute.\nIn considering the question as to whether there was a trade or labour dispute as between City Construction Company Ltd. and its employees, I think it is necessary to take into consideration the relationship which had been established between them by reason of the collective agreement made on behalf of the employees by the appellant, as their bargaining agent, and the application of the provisions of the Labour Relations Act, 1954 (B.C.), c. 17, to that relationship.\nThat Act has established a method of collective bargaining between employers and employees. Once a trade union has been certified as a bargaining agent for a unit of employees the employer can be required by law to bargain collectively with that agent. In the present case, this was apparently done and a collective agreement resulted. In so far as a disagreement as to the meaning of a provision of a collective agreement is concerned, s. 22(1) of the Act provides as follows:\n22. (1) Every collective agreement entered into after the commencement of this Act shall contain a provision for final and conclusive settlement without stoppage of work, by arbitration or otherwise, of all differences between the persons bound by the agreement concerning its interpretation. application, operation, or any alleged violation thereof. The collective agreement in this case contained such a provision.\nThe effect of the collective agreement which was made pursuant to the Labour Relations Act was to govern by contract the terms and conditions of employment of the company's employees. The result is that all those matters which, at the time of the Trade-unions Act was enacted, might have become the subject of a trade or labour dispute had been provided for by contract. The only question which might arise was as to the proper interpretation of the collective agreement itself, and, even in that case, the agreement provided an obligatory arbitration procedure. I do not think that a difference of view between an employer and employees as to the interpretation of a collective agreement, in such circumstances, constitutes a \"trade or labour dispute\" within the meaning of that expression as it is used in the Trade-unions Act.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the defendant, appellant: Ellis, Dryer & McTaggart, Vancouver.\nSolicitor for the plaintiff, respondent: G.

He appealed to the County Court, and, on preliminary objection taken to the sufficienty of his grounds for appeal, the County Court judge dismissed his appeal without hearing evidence or taking any plea. It was held that the grounds did not disclose a sufficient degree of particularity to comply with s. 722(1) (a) of the Code. The Court of Appeal allowed his appeal and referred the matter back to the County Court. The Crown was granted leave to appeal to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nThe taking of a plea from the accused forms no part of the hearing of the trial de novo by way of appeal from a summary conviction pursuant to s. 727 of the Code. Compliance with s. 722 is all that is required to found jurisdiction. Consequently, the failure of the County Court judge, in this case, to take a plea did not deprive him of jurisdiction. Although an accused, after pleading guilty in the first instance, is bound by such plea in the trial de novo, nevertheless he is not debarred from changing his plea upon showing proper grounds for so doing. Thibodeau v. The Queen, [1955] S.C.R. 646, applied.\nThe allegation, made in the present case, that \"there was no legal evidence to support the conviction\" was a proper and sufficient ground of appeal to comply with s. 722 of the Code on an appeal under that section from a summary conviction.\nThe accused had a right of appeal to the Court of Appeal when the County Court judge dismissed his appeal, as he did in this case, on preliminary objections, without a trial de novo, by virtue of s. 743(1) (a).\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1], reversing a judgment of Remnant Co. Ct. J. and referring the matter back to the County Court. Appeal dismissed.\nJ. J. Urie, for the appellant.\nR. R. Maitland, for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nRITCHIE J.:\u2014In the present case the respondent, having been convicted and sentenced under Part XXIV of the Criminal Code by W. G. Harris, Esq., a Police Magistrate in and for the District of Powell River, for driving a motor vehicle whilst his ability to do so was impaired, appealed such conviction to the County Court of Vancouver on the following grounds:\n1. The said conviction was against the law and the weight of evidence.\n2. The said conviction was contrary to law.\n3. There was no legal evidence to support the said conviction. Preliminary objection having been taken to the sufficiency of these grounds, the learned County Court judge dismissed the said appeal without hearing evidence or taking any plea, holding that the said grounds did not disclose a sufficient degree of particularity to comply with the requirements of s. 722(1) (a) of the Criminal Code.\nFrom this decision the respondent gave notice seeking leave to appeal to the Court of Appeal of British Columbia, and upon such leave having been granted the appeal was duly heard and allowed and the matter was referred back to the County Court by order of the said Court of Appeal[2].\nFrom this latter order the appellant sought leave to appeal to this Court, and by order dated June 25, 1959, such leave was granted upon the following grounds:\n1. Did the Court of Appeal of British Columbia err in holding that the Notice of Appeal under section 722 of the Criminal Code of the respondent from his conviction by the magistrate to the County Court of Vancouver set out the grounds of appeal in sufficient particularity?\n2. Did the failure of the County Court to take a plea deprive it of jurisdiction?\n3. Was there a right of appeal by the respondent to the Court of Appeal when the County Court had dismissed the appeal to it on preliminary objections without a trial de novo?\nAlthough the first of these grounds was virtually abandoned by the appellant at the argument before this Court and counsel for the appellant found himself in agreement with the decision of the Court of Appeal giving a negative answer to the question raised by the second ground, this Court was nonetheless invited to express its views concerning the nature of the right of appeal for which provision is made in ss. 720 to 726 inclusive of the Criminal Code and the type of trial contemplated by the provisions of s. 727. It is, therefore, desirable to make some general observations before dealing specifically with the particular questions raised in this appeal.\nSection 720 of the Criminal Code reads in part as follows:\nExcept where otherwise provided by law.\n(a) the defendant in proceedings under this Part may appeal to the appeal court\n(i) from a conviction or order made against him, or\n(ii) against a sentence passed upon him; and (b) the informant, the Attorney General or his agent in proceedings under this Part may appeal to the appeal court\n(i) from an order dismissing an information, or\n(ii) against a sentence passed upon a defendant \u2026.\nThe Appeal Court referred to in this section means one of the Courts specified in s. 719. In the case of the Province of British Columbia this means the \"County Court of the County in which the cause of the proceedings arose\". In my opinion, the provisions of this section, unless cut down by some other provisions of the Criminal Code, accord a right of appeal to any \"defendant in proceedings under this Part [Part XXIV]\" irrespective of the nature of the plea taken in the Court of first instance and limited only by the necessity of complying with the following conditions:\n722. (1) Where an appeal is taken under section 720, the appellant shall\n(a) prepare a notice of appeal in writing setting forth\n(i) with reasonable certainty the conviction or order appealed from or the sentence appealed against, and\n(ii) the grounds of appeal; \u2026.\nAs is indicated by Fauteux J., speaking on behalf of the majority of the Court in Dennis v. The Queen[3], compliance with these provisions is not only a condition precedent to the exercise of the right of appeal under s. 720 but it is the very foundation upon which the jurisdiction of the Appeal Court must and does rest as can be seen from the opening words of s. 723 which read as follows:\n723. (1) Where an appellant has complied with section 722, the appeal court or a judge thereof shall set down the appeal for hearing at a regular or special sittings thereof and the clerk of the appeal court shall post, in a conspicuous place in his office, a notice of every appeal that has been set down for hearing and notice of the time when it will be heard.\n(2) No appeal shall be set down for hearing at a time that is less than ten days after the time when service was effected upon the respondent of the notice referred to in paragraph (b) of subsection (1) of section 722, unless the parties or their counsel or agents otherwise agree in writing.\nAs is noted by Sheppard J.A., in the course of the decision rendered by him on behalf of the Court of Appeal, it is well to appreciate the significance of the last quoted section, requiring as it does that the Appeal Court or a judge thereof \"shall set down the appeal for hearing\" upon being satisfied that s. 722 has been complied with. Such power to \"set down the appeal for hearing\" presupposes jurisdiction to hear it and in my view compliance with s. 722 is all that is required to found jurisdiction in the Appeal Court and the \"plea\" which, if it were required, would be taken at a later stage forms no part of the material upon which the jurisdiction of the Court is based.\nThe nature of the hearing of an appeal under Part XXIV of the Criminal Code is described in s. 727 and conflict of opinion has been expressed between the Courts of last resort in some of the provinces of Canada as to the effect of the following provisions of subs. (1) of that section:\n727. (1) Where an appeal has been lodged in accordance with this Part from a conviction or order made against a defendant, or from an order dismissing an information, the appeal court shall hear and determine the appeal by holding a trial de novo, and for this purpose the provisions of sections 701 to 716, insofar as they are not inconsistent with sections 720 to 732, apply, mutatis mutandis.\nThe difficulty which has given rise to much of the conflict is centered about the question of whether the words \"appeal by holding a trial de novo\" are intended to describe \"an appeal\" in the sense of a review of the proceedings and decision in the Court of first instance as in the case of an appeal to a provincial Court of Appeal from conviction for an indictable offence or whether they are more descriptive of a \"new trial\" such as that which is held pursuant to order of the Court of Appeal after a conviction has been quashed.\nAs was said by Hogg J.A. in R. v. Crawford[4], the outstanding distinction between the trial de novo contemplated by s. 727 and the new trial which may be ordered by the Court of Appeal is that in the latter case the conviction has been quashed before the new trial starts whereas in the former the conviction remains outstanding, subject, however, to being reversed by the Appeal Court on evidence called afresh or indeed on entirely new evidence. In the one case, the conviction has gone while in the other it is under review by fresh eyes in the light of fresh evidence.\nOn the other hand, the distinction between \"an appeal by holding a trial de novo\" and an appeal to the provincial Court of Appeal is that although the object of both is to determine whether the decision appealed from was right or wrong, in the latter case the question is whether it was right or wrong having regard to the evidence upon which it was based, whereas in the former the issue is to be determined without any reference, except for purposes of cross-examination, to the evidence called in the Court appealed from and upon a fresh determination based upon evidence called anew and perhaps accompanied by entirely new evidence. It is to be borne in mind, of course, that under the provisions of s. 727(2) the Appeal Court may, under the circumstances therein specified, treat the evidence of any witness in the Court below as having the same force and effect as if the witness had given evidence before the Appeal Court. This can be done by consent of both the appellant and the respondent or if a witness cannot be reasonably obtained or if the evidence is purely formal or the Court is otherwise satisfied that this procedure will not prejudice the opposite party. When this procedure is followed, the evidence so introduced is to be treated by the Court of Appeal in all respects as if it were being actually given for the first time before that Court and all objections are available to either party in the same way that they would be if the evidence was being given viv\u00e2 voce for the first time.\nA further difficulty which has given rise to some conflict is the question of whether the accused should be required to plead at a \"trial de novo\". This difficulty has been occasioned by the fact that s. 708 which in terms requires that the defendant \"shall be asked\" to plead is included in the group of sections (701 to 716) which apply to a trial de novo \"insofar as they are not inconsistent with sections 720 to 732\" (see s. 722).\nWhile this point is not directly raised in the grounds specified in this appeal, it forms such an integral part of the whole question that it is as well to consider it here.\nThere can be no trial in the strict sense of that word until issue has been joined and as issue is not joined in a criminal case until the plea is entered the meaning of \"trial\" as used in the phrase \"trial de novo\" in s. 727 would seem both logically and grammatically to indicate the proceedings after the entry of the plea. This is the meaning which was attributed to its use in the other sections of Part XXIV which were under consideration in The Queen v. Larson[5], per Abbott J., and it should, therefore, be construed as connoting \"the hearing alone\" exclusive of the plea and arraignment. A consideration of proceedings on trial by jury brings to mind the fact that the trial proper does not start until the accused is given in charge to the jury which stage is, of course, not reached until after the plea has been taken and the adoption of this more restricted meaning of the word \"trial\" has been widely accepted in our own Courts for many years. See In re Walsh[6], approved in Giroux v. The King[7], per Anglin J., and Clement v. The Queen[8]. This is also the effect of what was said by Hogg J.A. in R. v. Crawford, supra. That the same connotation of the word \"trial\" applies to its use in relation to proceedings before a magistrate in England may be seen from the decision of Lord Goddard in R. v. Craske[9], and it is also to be noted that the plea is not required when a new trial is held on appeal from a conviction of an indictable offence. See Welch v. The King[10], per Fauteux J.\nThis interpretation is borne out by a consideration of the anomaly which would be created if an accused were required to plead to a charge in respect of which he had already been convicted in the course of a proceeding taken for the purpose of bringing such conviction into question and throughout the whole of which the conviction entered upon the earlier plea remains outstanding. These considerations seem to indicate that the procedure for taking a plea which is outlined in s. 708 is indeed inconsistent with the provisions of s. 727 and, therefore, inapplicable to the hearing for which provision is made in the latter section. This does not mean that an accused who has pleaded guilty in the Court of first instance is debarred from changing his plea upon showing proper grounds for so doing. He stands before the Appeal Court in exactly the same position procedurally as he stood before the magistrate after having made his plea and he may be allowed to change that plea. See Thibodeau v. The Queen[11], per Cartwright J. at 653 and Fauteux J. at 657. As to the first ground of appeal specified in the order granting leave to appeal to this Court, counsel for the appellant stated during the argument that after more mature consideration he had concluded, with respect to this ground, that the third ground of the respondent's original notice of appeal to the County Court was a proper one, namely, \"There was no legal evidence to support the conviction\". I am in entire agreement with this conclusion as were the learned judges of the Court of Appeal of British Columbia and no further comment is necessary on this phase of the matter in this case.\nThe second ground of appeal to this Court, \"Did the failure of the County Court to take a plea deprive it of jurisdiction?\" is in somewhat the same category as the first because in this regard counsel for the appellant agrees with the conclusion reached by the learned judges of the Court of Appeal with which conclusions, as can be seen, I am also in agreement for the reasons above stated which are substantially the same as those expressed by Sheppard J.A., speaking on behalf of the majority of that Court.\nThe third ground of appeal was fully argued and involves a consideration of the meaning to be attached to the words used in s. 743(1) (a) of the Criminal Code. These words are:\n743. (1) An appeal to the court of appeal, as defined in section 581 may, with leave of that court, be taken on any ground that involves a question of law alone, against\n(a) a decision of a court in respect of an appeal under section 727\u2026.\nIt was argued on behalf of the appellant that when an Appeal Court, within the meaning of s. 719, has decided that it has no jurisdiction to hear an appeal under s. 727 because the notice of appeal required by s. 722 is inadequate, it has not, by so doing, made a decision \"in respect of an appeal under section 727\" at all, but rather one in respect of s. 722 from which there is no provision for appeal, and that the only remedy lies in a writ of mandamus. It seems to me that the time for making such a decision is the time when the appeal is to be set down for hearing as required by s. 723, and the nature of the decision to be made at this time is whether or not all formalities have been complied with so as to make it necessary to \"set down the appeal for hearing at a regular or special sittings\" of the Appeal Court. The \"hearing\" there referred to is obviously a hearing under s. 727, and the decision as to whether or not the Court will hear an appeal under that section certainly seems to me to be \"a decision of a court in respect of an appeal under section 727\". As was indicated by Fauteux J. at the hearing of this appeal, this construction is borne out by the French version of s. 743(1) (a) which reads as follows:\n743. (1) Un appel \u00e0 la cour d'appel, telle qu'elle est d\u00e9finie dans Particle 581, peut, avec la permission de cette cour, \u00eatre interjet\u00e9, pour tout motif qui comporte une question de droit seulement,\n(a) de toute d\u00e9cision d'une cour relativement \u00e0 un appel pr\u00e9vu par l'article 727\u2026.\nIn view of all the above, it will be seen that I am of opinion that the notice of appeal of the respondent from his conviction by the magistrate set out the grounds of appeal in sufficient particularity, that the failure of the County Court to take a plea did not deprive it of jurisdiction, that the respondent had a right of appeal to the Court of Appeal when the County Court dismissed his appeal on preliminary objection and that this appeal should be dismissed.\nAppeal dismissed.\nSolicitor for the appellant: G.

The accused pleaded guilty to a charge of impaired driving and was summarily convicted by a magistrate. His appeal was heard and allowed by a County Court judge notwithstanding the preliminary objections of the Crown that the notice of appeal was not sufficient. The Crown applied for leave to appeal to the Court of Appeal, which considered the merits of the case and ruled that \"the said leave and the appeal be and the same are hereby dismissed\". On the Crown's application for leave to appeal to this Court, the accused argued that the judgment of the Court of Appeal was not a \"final judgment\" within the meaning of s. 41(1) of the Supreme Court Act, since that Court had not dismissed the appeal but only the application for leave to appeal.\nHeld: The judgment of the Court of Appeal should be treated as one dismissing the appeal and leave should be granted.\nHeld further: The appeal should be allowed and the conviction restored.\nIf an accused who has pleaded guilty before a magistrate at his summary trial is able to comply with the requirements of s. 722, then his appeal by way of trial de novo under s. 727 \"shall be set down for hearing before the Appeal Court\", and when he enters the latter Court he may change his plea if he can satisfy the Appeal Court that there are valid grounds for his being permitted to do so.\nIn the present case, the grounds of appeal were not set forth in such manner as to comply with s. 722. The grounds that \"the magistrate did not apply the principle as to reasonable doubt as to the evidence\" and that the \"conviction was contrary to the evidence and to the weight of the evidence\", were irreconcilable with the accused's plea of guilty. Far from the conviction being contrary to law, it was the verdict which the law required the magistrate to enter after the plea of guilty. The setting forth of the grounds for appeal is a condition precedent to jurisdiction, and there is no right to a trial de novo under s. 727 upon grounds which are frivolous or apparently lacking in substance, as was the case here.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1], affirming a decision of Hanna Co. Ct. J. Appeal allowed.\nJ. J. Urie, for the appellant.\nK. E. Eaton, for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nRITCHIE J.:\u2014The respondent herein, having pleaded guilty, was convicted by G. W. Scott, Esq., Deputy Police Magistrate in and for the City of Vancouver, on the charge that he unlawfully drove his motor vehicle on a highway while his ability to drive was impaired and thereupon filed and served a notice of appeal to the County Court of Vancouver wherein he specified the following grounds of appeal:\n(a) That the said conviction is contrary to law in that the magistrate did not apply the principle as to reasonable doubt as to the evidence adduced at the said trial;\n(b) That the said conviction is contrary to the evidence and to the weight of the evidence.\nUpon the appeal coming on to be set down for hearing before His Honour, Judge Hanna, Judge of the County Court of Vancouver, counsel for the Crown raised the following preliminary objections:\n(a) That no grounds of appeal were in fact disclosed;\n(b) That the accused, having pleaded guilty in the court below, was bound by such plea unless the grounds of appeal set out special circumstances;\n(c) That the said grounds were not reasonable, certain, adequate or sufficient as required;\n(d) That the principle as to reasonable doubt in connection with the evidence adduced at the trial before the learned magistrate could not apply because of the plea of guilty accepted from the accused by the learned magistrate.\nNotwithstanding these objections, the learned County Court judge heard and allowed the appeal, and in due course counsel for the Attorney-General of British Columbia made application for leave to appeal to the Court of Appeal of British Columbia upon the following grounds:\n1. That the learned County Court judge was in error in permitting and accepting a plea of not guilty on the trial de novo after the respondent had pleaded guilty before the magistrate.\n2. That the learned County Court judge was in error in holding that the grounds set out in the respondent's Notice of Appeal were reasonable, certain, adequate or sufficient or were grounds of appeal at all.\nThis appeal was considered by the Court of Appeal of British Columbia[2] at the same time as two others in which kindred questions were raised and a perusal of the decisions of Sheppard J.A. and Davey J.A. clearly indicates that the merits of this case were considered by that Court, and the concluding words of Mr. Justice Sheppard's decision in relation thereto are:\nHowever, for the reasons given, the grounds of error assigned by the Crown should not succeed and the appeal should be dismissed. Some doubt and difficulty has, however, arisen as a result of the wording of the final clause of the formal order for judgment granted herein by the Court of Appeal which reads as follows:\nTHIS COURT DOTH ORDER AND ADJUDGE that the said leave to appeal and the appeal be and the same are hereby dismissed.\nUpon application being made for leave to appeal to this Court, which application was adjourned to the October sittings thereof, it was argued on behalf of the respondent that the judgment sought to be appealed from did not dismiss the appeal but rather dismissed the application for leave to appeal to the British Columbia Court of Appeal, and that as such it was not \"a final or other judgment of the highest court of final resort in a province \u2026 in which judgment can be had in the particular case sought to be appealed \u2026.\" within the meaning of s. 41(1) of the Supreme Court Act and that leave should accordingly be refused.\nIt is true that the final paragraph of the formal judgment of the Appeal Court of British Columbia quoted above is not entirely clear in that it purports to dismiss both the application for leave to appeal and the appeal itself, but if there be any doubt as to whether or not this constitutes an order dismissing the appeal then it is permissible to consider the reasons of the Court to see what was actually done, and it then becomes apparent that the appeal was heard on its merit and dismissed.\nI am of opinion that the judgment from which leave to appeal is now sought should be treated as one dismissing the Crown's appeal to the Appeal Court of British Columbia and that such leave should be granted.\nThe grounds raised by the present application are:\n1. That the Court of Appeal erred in holding that having pleaded guilty before the magistrate the accused had an appeal as of right from his conviction.\n2. That the Court of Appeal erred in holding that the Notice of Appeal to the County Court judge set forth the grounds of appeal with sufficient particularity as required by s. 722 of the Criminal Code.\nAs to the first ground, I agree with what has been said by the learned judges of the Court of Appeal to the effect that the words of s. 720 (a) of the Criminal Code \"the defendant in proceedings under this Part may appeal to the Appeal Court\" include a defendant who has pleaded \"guilty\" in the summary conviction Court, but it must be borne constantly in mind that no defendant can have his appeal set down for hearing until \"he has complied with section 722\", and this includes the preparation of a notice setting forth the grounds of appeal. As will be seen from what I have said in this Court in the case of Regina v. Dennis[3], I agree with the learned judges in other Courts (see R. v. Crawford[4] and R. v. Tennen[5]), who have held that the \"trial de novo\" for which provision is made in s. 727 is to be treated as a \"trial\" in the restricted sense of that word which does not include either arraignment or plea, but I do not agree with those who consider that this construction precludes a defendant who has pleaded guilty from asserting an appeal. In my view, if a man who has entered a guilty plea before the magistrate is able to comply with the requirements of s. 722, then his appeal \"shall be set down for bearing before the Appeal Court\" and when he enters that Court he is in exactly the same position procedurally as he was immediately after pleading \"guilty\" before the magistrate and before he had been convicted. This being so, he may change his plea if he can satisfy the Appeal Court that there are valid grounds for his being permitted to do so. See Thibodeau v. The Queen[6],\nA discussion of the question raised by the second ground follows logically from what has just been said because if the grounds of appeal are not set out in such manner as to comply with s. 722 then the appeal cannot be set down for hearing under s. 723,\nThe relevant portion of s. 722 reads as follows:\nwhere a Notice of Appeal is taken under section 720, the appellant shall\n(a) prepare a Notice of Appeal in writing setting forth\n(i) with reasonable certainty the conviction or order appealed from or the sentence appealed against; and\n(ii) the grounds of appeal; \u2026. There has been considerable conflict of judicial opinion as to the nature of \"grounds of appeal' required by this section, and in this regard Sheppard J.A., summarizing the view of the Court of Appeal in this case, has said:\nHence, while in compliance with section 722 grounds of appeal are to be given, nevertheless by reason of the nature of the review, the grounds would not appear to be required to be stated with the same particularity as in appeals in indictable offences where the Appeal Court is restricted to the record of the proceedings in the lower Court and where counsel for the respondent is entitled to know specifically the grounds on which the conviction or dismissed is attacked.\nIt is true that the grounds of appeal referred to in s. 722 (1) (a) (ii) need not be \"stated with the same particularity as in appeals in indictable offences \u2026\" but it must be remembered that the setting forth of these grounds is one of the acts required to be done as a condition precedent to the jurisdiction of the Appeal Court and although they require neither nicety of pleading nor expert draftsmanship in their prepartion it should not be possible to obtain the trial de novo for which s. 727 provides upon grounds which are frivolous or apparently lacking in substance.\nTo appeal as the respondent did in this case form a conviction founded on a plea of \"guilty\" on the grounds that the magistrate did not comply with the principle as to reasonable doubt in connection with the evidence and that the verdict was contrary to the evidence and the weight of evidence is to present the Appeal Court with a self-evident contradiction in terms.\nFar from the conviction being contrary to law, it was the verdict which the law required the magistrate to enter after the plea of \"guilty\" (see s. 708(2) ), and there is, therefore, no room for the application of the principle of reasonable doubt and it is idle for a defendant to complain that the conviction was contrary to the evidence and to the weight of evidence because the conviction was not based on evidence but on the \"guilty\" plea.\nSuch grounds are not unacceptable by reason of lack of particularity but because they are irreconcilable with the plea in the Court below which is a part of the material to be kept by the clerk of the Appeal Court with the records of that Court in accordance with the provisions of s. 726 (1). The plea of \"guilty\" entered in the summary conviction Court concluded against the respondent the issues raised by the information and after the filing of the notice of appeal in this case the Court of Appeal was faced with an outstanding plea of \"guilty\" without any reason having been put forward to support an application for its withdrawal and without any question of law having been raised to cast doubt on its effect.\nThe following observations of Sidney Smith J.A. in R. v. Sanders[7], although made with reference to the old Code, seem most pertinent to the circumstances of this case:\nOn the face of it, there would seem something anomalous in the law if it allowed an accused person, with full understanding, to plead \"guilty\" before a magistrate and then, because he found the sentence unexpectedly heavy, or had unexpected consequences, or for some other reason having nothing to do with the merits, allowed him to appeal to the county court and, without explanation, blandly plead \"not guilty,\" and thus obtain a full trial on the merits. That seems to be playing fast and loose with the administration of justice.\n(The italics are mine.)\nWith the greatest respect, it seems to me that the proceedings before the County Court judge in the present case constitute an example of the type of procedure to which this quotation applies.\nAfter an extensive argument had been presented to the County Court judge and after the proceedings had been adjourned for consideration of the questions as to whether the accused was entitled to a trial de novo after a plea of \"guilty\" and as to the validity of the grounds set forth in the notice of appeal, the following exchange is reported as having taken place in the County Court:\nThe COURT: On the objection raised by Crown counsel before the adjournment that the grounds of appeal were not disclosed in the notice of appeal, I am holding that clause 1 of the notice of appeal is sufficient statement of grounds in this particular appeal and I am not making that as a precedent. I understand the matter is before the Court of Appeal now\u2014another one\u2014but that is my present decision. I take it that plea is the same as the Court below?\nMr. DEAN (for the accused): There will be a plea of not guilty here.\nThe COURT: What was it in the Court below?\nMr. DEAN: It was a plea of guilty in the Court below. Should be another plea taken here.\nThe COURT: You will waive the reading of the information and plead not guilty? Mr. DEAN: Yes.\nThe COURT: Where is your client?\nMr. DEAN: Right here. Stand up, please.\nThe COURT: This is for impaired driving.\nMr. MACKOFF (for the Crown): May it please your honor, the Court of Appeal in a decision handed down just last week in the case of Baumer ruled that on these appeals apparently the reading of the information is a prerequisite now.\nThe COURT: Is a what?\nMr. MACKOFF: It is required to have a reading of the charge.\nThe COURT: In spite of the waive?\nMr. MACKOFF: In spite of the waive. Apparently that is a decision of the British Columbia Court of Appeal.\nThe COURT: Well, this is under the Criminal Code, is it not?\nMr. MACKOFF: Yes, your honor, section 223.\nThe COURT: He should be in the box. Read the charge.\nThe accused was accordingly arraigned and permitted to plead \"not guilty\" without any reason being given to support his change of plea. This quotation indicates that the learned County Court judge erred in determining the validity of the notice of appeal without any reference to the nature of the plea in the summary conviction Court with the result that he upheld the validity of a ground of appeal alleging that a conviction made pursuant to the mandatory provisions of s. 708(2) of the Criminal Code and without taking evidence was contrary to law in that the principle of reasonable doubt was not applied in connection with the evidence.\nFrom all the above it will be seen that I am of opinion that the Court of Appeal did not err in holding that the accused had an appeal as of right from his conviction subject to compliance with s. 722, but that I have concluded that the same Court did err in holding that the notice of appeal to the County Court judge in this case set forth \"the grounds of appeal\" as required by s. 722(1) (a) (ii) of the Criminal Code.\nI would accordingly allow the appeal and set aside the judgments of the Court of Appeal and of the County Court of Vancouver. The result is that the conviction entered by the learned magistrate is restored.\nAppeal allowed; conviction restored.\nSolicitor for the appellant: G. D. Kennedy, Victoria.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Gowling, MacTavish, Osborne & Henderson, Ottawa.\n[1] 124 C.C.C. 95, 30 C.R. 339, 28 W.W.R. 385.\n[2] 124 C.C.C. 95, 30 C.R. 339, 28 W.W.R. 385.\n[3] Ante p. 286.\n[4] [1959] O.W.N. 75, 123 C.C.C. 14.\n[5] [1959] O.R. 77, 122 C.C.C. 375.\n[6] [1955] S.C.R. 646.\n[7] (1953), 8 W.W.R. 656, 106 C.C.C. 76.\n"

The County Court judge dismissed her appeal and refused to strike out the plea of guilty on the accused\u2019s affidavit that she was only the nominal owner of the business which was under the complete control and operation of her husband. The Court of Appeal dismissed her further appeal and she appealed to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nAn accused who has pleaded guilty in a summary conviction Court has the same right to apply for leave to change such plea on his appeal by way of a trial de novo under s. 727 of the Code as he would have had in the Court below before sentence. However, the decision as to whether or not permission to withdraw the plea of guilty should be given is a matter of discretion for the tribunal, and where, as here, such discretion was exercised judicially, it should not be interfered with.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1], affirming the conviction of the Appellant. Appeal dismissed.\nE.R. Murray, for the appellant.\nG.W. Ford, Q.C., for the respondent. The judgment of the Court was delivered by\nRITCHIE J.:\u2014Two informations were laid against the appellant \u201ccarrying on business under the name and style of Majestic Lamp Company\u201d for failing to pay the sales tax imposed by Part VI of the Excise Tax Act, R.S.C., 1952, c. 100, and upon these matters coming on for hearing before S.A. Williamson, Esq., a Justice of the Peace in and for the County of York, the appellant did not appear personally but was represented by duly authorized counsel who pleaded \u201cguilty\u201d on her behalf whereupon she was duly convicted of both offences and sentenced in respect of one information to a fine of $466.93 or thirty days in jail and in respect of the other information to a fine of $746.30 or alternatively to thirty days in jail.\nIn the proceedings before the magistrate and after the pleas of \u201cguilty\u201d had been entered, the evidence of a collection officer of the Department of National Revenue was called on behalf of the Crown, in the course of which it was proved that the taxes referred to in the two informations had not been paid to date and that the appellant was the sole owner of the Majestic Lamp Company.\nIn due time the appellant filed and served one notice of appeal in respect of both offences to the County Court of the County of York upon the grounds following:\n1. The learned magistrate erred in his finding that the information disclosed an offence;\n2. The learned magistrate erred in failing to apply correctly the law and the relevant provisions of the Excise Tax Act, the Bankruptcy Act, and the Criminal Code to the facts of this case;\n3. The learned magistrate erred in finding that the accused had failed to comply with the said Act;\n4. The learned magistrate lacked jurisdiction to order the accused to pay the arrears of sales tax herein.\nUpon the appeal coming on for hearing before His Honour, Judge Shea, there was filed with the Court an affidavit of the appellant setting forth that while she was the registered owner of Majestic Lamp Company she had never at any time operated or exercised any control of the said business nor drawn any salary or profits nor taken any interest in the said business which was under the complete control and operation of her husband. In this affidavit she also stated that she had never been aware of the payment or non-payment of any sales tax until she received the summonses and that a month or two before the date of the informations her husband had informed her that the business was failing and that she was bankrupt. She stated also that her husband had advised her that the sales tax had not been paid and that she should plead \u201cguilty\u201d, and further that she never realized that she would have to pay any money or be subject to a jail sentence, believing that the money would have to be collected out of the bankrupt estate. The affidavit concludes by stating that the appellant was at all times up to and including the time of her conviction totally ignorant of the whole procedure and completely under the influence of her husband and that she had been advised that she had a good defence in law and on the merits and that she was not guilty of the offences.\nIn the course of the hearing before the learned County Court judge, there was a lengthy argument between counsel, and conflicting decisions were cited as to whether an appeal lay in this case under the provisions of ss. 720 to 727 of the Criminal Code, and in the course of these submissions counsel on behalf of the appellant made the following statement:\nThe facts they are not in dispute; the evidence was put in by the crown at the magistrate\u2019s court proceedings; we do not quarrel with that, as far as the facts go, and I do not think they are in dispute. The sole question is whether the conviction itself is bad in law.\nThe learned County Court judge, having the aforesaid affidavit before him and having heard what was said by the appellant\u2019s counsel, made the following statement:\n\u2026I do not think it will be necessary to have this plea of guilty renewed; there is no exceptional circumstance here. This woman has pleaded guilty, and then she found out that she might be called on to pay money and that is something else.\nThat is the whole point; and not only was she represented by counsel at the trial,\u2014anyway, she pleaded guilty\u2026\nI decline to strike out the plea of guilty.\nThe learned County Court judge saw no merit in the other grounds of appeal and the appeal was accordingly dismissed. The appellant appealed from this decision to the Court of Appeal for Ontario[2] upon the following grounds:\n1. The learned County Court Judge erred in holding that the Appellant was precluded from her right to appeal by reason of her having pleaded guilty before the Magistrate. 2. The learned County Court Judge erred in refusing to hear evidence on the ground that the Appellant was precluded from adducing evidence by reason of her having pleaded guilty before the Magistrate.\n3. The learned County Court Judge misdirected himself with respect to the right of the Appellant to change her plea on a trial de novo.\n4. The learned County Court Judge erred in holding in effect that the plea of guilty was not only an admission as to fact but as to law.\n5. The learned County Court Judge erred in refusing the Appellant the right to argue that the Crown had no right to proceed against the Appellant notwithstanding her plea of guilty.\nOn this appeal two identical notices of appeal were prepared respecting the two offences of which the appellant had been convicted, and the appeals having been heard together Roach J.A. rendered the decision of the Court dismissing both appeals. It is from this decision and the order made pursuant thereto that the appellant now appeals to this Court upon the following grounds:\n(a) That the proceedings in the County Court of the County of York were a nullity because the accused was not arraigned on the charges or asked to plead to same;\n(b) That the learned County Court judge erred in refusing to hear evidence on the ground that the appellant was precluded from adducing evidence by reason of her having pleaded guilty before the Magistrate;\n(c) That the learned County Court judge misdirected himself with respect to the right of the appellant to change her plea on a trial de novo;\n(d) Such further and other grounds as counsel may advise and which this Honourable Court may deem sufficient grounds for appeal.\nAfter reading the transcript of the proceedings before the County Court judge which are included in the appeal book in the present case, I am satisfied that the second and third of the above grounds disclose a misunderstanding of what took place in the County Court.\nAs to the first ground, it will appear from what has been said in the cases of Regina v. Dennis[3] and Regina v. Bamsey[4] that I am of opinion that the arraignment and plea form no essential part of the trial de novo contemplated by s. 727 of the Criminal Code, but that an accused who has pleaded guilty in the summary conviction Court has the same right to apply for leave to change his plea before the Appeal Court as he would have had in the Court below before sentence.\nAs to the second and third of the above grounds, it is enough to say that the record of the proceedings in the County Court does not disclose that the learned County Court judge either precluded the appellant from adducing evidence or misdirected himself respecting her right to change her plea.\nThe learned County Court judge, having read the appellant\u2019s affidavit and heard the argument, exercised his discretion by declining to strike out the plea of guilty. That he was entitled to follow this course is made apparent by what was said by Cartwright J., speaking on behalf of the majority of the Court, in Thibodeau v. The Queen[5]:\n\u2026it may first be observed that it is clear that at any time before sentence the Court has power to permit a plea of guilty to be withdrawn. As to this it is sufficient to refer to the following cases; R. v. Plummer, (1902) 2 K.B. 339, The King v. Lamothe, 15 C.C.C. 61, R. v. Guay, 23 C.C.C. 243 at 245-246, and R. v. Nelson, 32 C.C.C. 75. These cases make it equally clear that the decision whether or not permission to withdraw a plea of guilty should be given rests in the discretion of the Judge to whom the application for such permission is made and that this discretion, if exercised judicially, will not be lightly interfered with.\n(The italics are mine.)\nAs I have indicated, I am of opinion that the learned County Court judge in no way exceeded his jurisdiction and that his reasons and decisions in refusing to allow the appellant to change her plea disclose no error in law.\nI can see no other grounds for allowing this appeal and in fact none were seriously urged at the argument. The appeal must, therefore, be dismissed.\nAppeal dismissed.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Freedman, Cohl, Murray & Osak, Toronto.\nSolicitor for the respondent: G.W. Ford, Toronto.\n[1] 122 C.C.C. 375, 29 C.R. 379.\n[2] 122 C.C.C. 375, 29 C.R 379.\n[3] Ante p. 286.\n[4] Ante p. 294.\n[5] [19551 S.C.R. 646.\n"

Wellwood (Defendants) Appellants;\nand\nOutdoor Neon Displays Limited (Plaintiff) Respondent.\n1959: October 15, 16, 19; 1960: January 26.\nPresent: Cartwright, Fauteux, Abbott, Martland and Ritchie JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.\nMunicipal corporations\u2014Building by-law\u2014Erection and location of signs\u2014Permit required from building inspector\u2014Whether inspector has discretion to refuse when by-law requirements met\u2014Whether delegation of power to inspector\u2014Validity of by-law.\nBuilding by-law No. 9868 of the City of Toronto, passed in 1923, deals, inter alia, with the erection and location of signs on private property and prescribes the standards required to obtain a permit to erect such signs. It places upon the building inspector the duty of ascertaining that these standards are met. The by\u2011law further provides that a permit will not be issued until the location of the sign has been approved by the building inspector; and that the erection of the sign shall not be commenced until a permit has been obtained from him. The trial judge dismissed the plaintiff\u2019s application for an order directing the defendants to issue a permit for the erection of a neon display sign on the roof of a building in Toronto. The Court of Appeal directed the permit to be issued on the ground, inter alia, of illegal delegation of power to the inspector. The municipality appealed to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed and the permit issued.\nOn its proper construction, the by-law does not confer any uncontrolled discretion upon the inspector. If he is satisfied that all the requirements are fulfilled and that there is no applicable prohibitory by-law, he has no discretion to refuse to approve the location of the sign and so refuse a permit. The by-law states with sufficient particularity the grounds on which the approval of the proposed location is to be granted or withheld. Consequently, as the appeal was argued on the footing that all the requirements had been fulfilled, it followed that the permit should be issued.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1], reversing a judgment of Treleaven J. Appeal dismissed.\nHon. R.L. Kellock, Q.C., and F.A.A. Campbell, Q.C., for the defendants, appellants. J.T. Weir, Q.C., and A.M. Austin, for the plaintiff, respondent.\nW.R. Jackett, Q.C., and T.B. Smith, for the Attorney General of Canada.\nE.J. Houston, for the Attorney-General of Ontario.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nCARTWRIGHT J.:\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[2] allowing an appeal from a judgment of Treleaven J. and directing the appellant Wellwood forthwith to issue a building permit to the respondent to permit it to erect a neon display sign on the roof of the building known as 131 Front Street West in the city of Toronto.\nOn January 31, 1958, the respondent made application to the appellants for a building permit for the erection of the sign in question. By letter dated March 21, 1958, the appellant Wellwood advised the respondent that the Board of Control had instructed him to withhold the permit and enclosed a copy of the Board\u2019s direction. This direction is dated March 14, 1958, and is signed by the City Clerk; it reads:\nOn March 12, 1958, Controller Newman advised the Board of Control that application has been made for a permit to erect an illuminated sign facing University Avenue on the roof of the building at No. 131 Front Street West.\nController Newman stated that the University Avenue By-law does not cover this location.\nThe Board decided to request the City Solicitor to draft a By-law and present same to the Committee on Property on March 19, to prohibit the erection of the aforesaid sign and other signs which may be similarly located in full view of University Avenue.\nThe Board also decided to request the Commissioner of Buildings to withhold the permit for the above-mentioned sign.\nThe \u201cUniversity Avenue By-law\u201d referred to in this direction prohibits the erection of, inter alia, electric signs on any building or land fronting or abutting on either side of University Avenue between Front Street and College Street. It is not argued that the proposed location of the sign with which we are concerned falls within this prohibition. We were informed by counsel that no by-law such as that suggested in the third paragraph of the direction has been passed.\nIn the course of his cross-examination on an affidavit filed the appellant Wellwood put forward two additional reasons for refusing the permit:\n(i) that he had not approved the location of the sign as provided in paragraph 3 of chapter 31 of the building by-law of the Corporation of the City of Toronto being by-law number 9868, and\n(ii) that the property known as 131 Front Street West is leased by the City of Toronto to Petrie\u2019s Parking Place Limited by a written lease dated March 21st, 1945, that the said lease provides that the lessee will not assign or sub-let without leave, and that the agreement between Petrie\u2019s and the respondent permitting the latter to erect the sign was a breach of the covenant not to sub-let.\nAs to the last mentioned ground (ii), the Court of Appeal were unanimously of opinion that it afforded no answer to the respondent\u2019s claim, and on this point I am in full agreement with the reasons of Roach J.A.\nThe learned judge of first instance gave no written reasons for his decision.\nCounsel agree that the following passage in the reasons of Roach J.A. correctly states the footing on which the appeal was argued:\nThe appeal was argued on the footing that the proposed sign complied with all the standards set forth in By-law No. 9868, that the application to the Building Commissioner was in proper form and that the applicant had complied with every prerequisite required of it in connection with its application for the permit.\nBy-law no. 9868 was passed by the Council of the Corporation of the City of Toronto on December 10, 1923; it is entitled \u201cA By-law to Regulate the Erection and Provide for the Safety of Buildings\u201d; it is both lengthy and comprehensive, consisting of upwards of 250 printed pages divided into more than 40 chapters.\nChapter 31 is entitled \u201cSigns\u201d. The by-law has been frequently amended but the only amendments made to chapter 31 were passed in April 1936. This chapter prescribes in detail what is to be filed in support of the application for a permit to erect a sign located wholly or partly on private property, including:\n2. (2) A block plan, showing the street lines or other boundaries of the property upon which it is proposed to erect such sign or advertising device and the location of the sign or advertising device upon the property in relation to other structures upon such property or upon the premises immediately adjoining thereto.\n(3) Complete drawings and specifications covering the construction of the sign and its supporting framework.\n(4) Drawings of, and such other information with respect to, any building upon which it is proposed to locate the sign or advertising device, as may be necessary to determine whether the structure of such building will carry the additional loads and stresses imposed thereon by the erection of such sign or advertising device without exceeding the stresses specified in this By-law. Such drawings shall in all cases have marked thereon, in figures, the height of such building.\nThe chapter deals, inter alia, with the strength of buildings on which it is proposed to erect signs, the height of such buildings, the height above roof of partly wooden signs and of all-metal signs; ground signs; maintenance; the repair or removal of dangerous or defective signs; and the location of signs as more particularly set out hereafter. In regard to allowable stresses, live loads and wind pressures on buildings it contains cross-references to other chapters of the by-law.\nIn addition to section 2(2) quoted above, the following sections of chapter 31 refer particularly to the locations of signs:\nSection 5. Clearances.\n(1) Every sign or advertising device erected upon the roof of any building shall be so located as to maintain a clear space of at least three feet between the top of the roof or parapet wall of such building and the bottom of such sign.\n(2) No sign or advertising device shall be so located upon any building as to obstruct any window, door, scuttle, skylight or fire escape, so as to prevent the free access of firemen to any part of the building in case of fire.\nSection 13. Ground Signs.\n(3) No such sign or advertising device shall be located adjacent to any dwelling, apartment house or church or so located that the rear part of same is or will be exposed to any street. The section of chapter 31 which gives rise to the chief difficulties in this appeal is section 3, which reads as follows:\n3. Permit.\n(1) A permit shall not be issued by the Inspector of Buildings for the erection of any sign or advertising device located wholly or partly upon private property, until the location of such sign or advertising device has been approved by him.\n(2) The erection or installation of any sign or advertising device located wholly or partly upon private property, shall not be commenced until a permit therefor has been obtained from the Inspector of Buildings.\nThe members of the Court of Appeal were unanimous in construing this section as giving to the Inspector of Buildings an uncontrolled discretionary power to approve or disapprove the proposed location of any sign and to grant or refuse a permit for its erection accordingly. Roach J.A., who wrote the judgment of the majority, dealt with the matter as follows:\nThe Building Commissioner and the Municipal Corporation now take the position which was supported by their counsel on this appeal, that by virtue of Section 3(1) of By-law No. 9868, the Building Commissioner has the power to refuse a permit if the location of a proposed sign, quite apart from matters of construction, does not meet with his approval and that the location of this particular sign does not meet with his approval. I now deal with that contention without for the time being, taking into consideration, Section 3(1) of the City of Toronto Act, 1939, and the order of the Municipal Board dated February 25th, 1942.\nBy-law No. 9868 leaves the approval of the location of a proposed roof sign in any area in the absolute discretion of the Building Commissioner. It contains no indicia to be applied by him in reaching his conclusion either to approve or disapprove. If in his uncontrolled and unqualified discretion he thinks it inappropriate that a sign, though complying with every requirement of the By-law, should be erected at a proposed location he may refuse a permit for it. This is an illegal delegation to the Commissioner of a power exercisable only by the Municipal Council. Whether or not, as a matter of civic planning, a sign in a given area should or should not be permitted, is a matter on which the Municipal Council as the governing body of the Municipality, must apply its own judgment; it cannot delegate that function to a municipal official.\nHaving so construed this section of the by-law the Court of Appeal went on to consider the effect of s. 3 of The City of Toronto Act, 1939 (Ont.), 3 Geo. VI, c. 73. Subsection (1) of that section reads as follows:\n(1) The Ontario Municipal Board may approve by-law No. 9868 passed by the council of the said corporation entitled \u201cA By-law to regulate the erection and provide for the safety of buildings\u201d and any by-law passed by the said council amending such by-law or containing provisions regulating the erection or providing for the safety of buildings, and upon such approval being given any such by-law shall be deemed to have been validated and confirmed.\nOn February 25, 1942, the Ontario Municipal Board made an order \u201cunder and in pursuance of Section 3 of the City of Toronto Act 1939\u201d that By-law no. 9868 as amended by. 88 specified by-laws be approved. Of the 68 amending by-laws, 61 were passed before and 7 after the enactment of the City of Toronto Act, 1939.\nLaidlaw J.A., who dissented, was of the view that s. 3(1) of the City of Toronto Act, 1939 was valid legislation and that the combined effect of that section and of the order of the Municipal Board was to give statutory validity to By-law no. 9868, at all events as regards section 3 of chapter 31 which had not been amended at any time. The majority reached the conclusion that s. 3(1) of the City of Toronto Act, 1939 was ultra vires of the Provincial Legislature, that consequently section 3 of chapter 31 of the by-law had not been validated, that since, as they had construed it, it purported to give to the Building Inspector an uncontrolled discretionary power to refuse an application which complied with every requirement of the by-law it was beyond the powers of the council to enact it, and accordingly ordered that the permit should issue.\nThe first question is as to the true construction of the by-law and particularly section 3 of chapter 31.\nThe by-law must be construed as of the date when it was enacted, some 16 years before the passing of the statute which purports to give the Municipal Board power to validate it. In 1923, the rule concisely stated by Middleton J.A. in Forst v. City of Toronto[3], had long been the established law in Ontario. I refer particularly to the following passage:\nWhen the municipality is given the right to regulate, I think that all it can do is to pass general regulations affecting all who come within the ambit of the municipal legislation. It cannot itself discriminate, and give permission to one and refuse it to another and, a fortiori, it cannot give municipal officers the right, which it does not possess, to exercise a discretion and ascertain whether as a matter of policy permission should be granted in one case and refused in another. It is not suggested that the Court of Appeal laid down any new rule in that case; it applied well settled rules to the by-law there in question.\nIt is a rule of construction that if the words of an enactment so permit they shall be construed in accordance with the presumption which imputes to the enacting body the intention of limiting the operation of its enactments to matters within its allotted sphere. I agree with the following statement in McQuillin on Municipal Corporations, 3rd ed., vol. 9, at p. 138:\nFurthermore, licensing ordinances will be construed, if possible, as not vesting legislative power or absolute discretion in enforcement officials with respect to the grant or issuance of a license.\nWhen section 3 of chapter 31 of the by-law is read, as it must be, in the context of the rest of the chapter and of the whole by-law, I am unable to construe it as conferring any uncontrolled discretion upon the Inspector.\nChapter 1 of the by-law is entitled \u201cGeneral Provisions\u201d; it contains cross-references to other chapters including chapter 31; it provides by section 1:\nThe Commissioner of Buildings, shall be the Inspector of Buildings, whose duty it shall be to see that the provisions of this By-law are carried out.\nChapter 2 provides in part:\nFor the purpose of this By-law,\nPERMIT, when issued by the Commissioner, shall mean certification by him to the effect that the plans and specifications submitted for examination and approval, comply, or have been made to comply, with the requirements of this By-law.\nAs already indicated, chapter 31 deals in several places with the location of signs. In my view, on its true construction it places upon the Inspector the duty of ascertaining that the plans, drawings and specifications filed in support of an application for a permit to erect a sign not only comply with all relevant provisions of the by-law as to method of construction, loads, stresses and so forth, but also show that its proposed location is in accordance with the provisions of sections 5(1), 5(2) and 13(3) of chapter 31 quoted above; the purpose of requiring the applicant to file the material required by section 2(2) of chapter 31 is to enable the Inspector to certify as to these matters. No doubt the Inspector would also have to consider whether there was in existence any by-law such as the \u201cUniversity Avenue By-law\u201d referred to above prohibiting the erection of signs in the area in which the sign is proposed to be located.\nIn my opinion, if the Inspector is satisfied that all the requirements of the by-law are fulfilled and that there is no applicable prohibitory by-law, he has no discretion to refuse to approve the location of the sign and so refuse a permit. The by-law states with sufficient particularity the grounds on which the approval of a proposed location is to be granted or withheld.\nAs the appeal was argued on the footing set out in the passage from the reasons of Roach J.A. quoted above, it follows that, in my opinion, the order of the Court of Appeal directing the permit to be issued was right and should be affirmed, and it becomes unnecessary to consider the question of the constitutional validity of s. 3(1) of the City of Toronto Act, 1939 since, construed as I think it ought to be, section 3 of chapter 31 of the by-law was passed in due exercise of the powers conferred on the council by the Municipal Act and required no statutory validation.\nCounsel for the appellants and for the Attorney General of Ontario invited the Court to express an opinion as to the validity of the 1939 statute even if it should not become necessary for us to do so; but I do not think that we ought to do this. In view of the construction I have placed upon the provisions of the by-law with which we are concerned, anything said as to the constitutional validity of the City of Toronto Act, 1939 would be obiter. The dismissal of the appeal, of course, does not constitute an affirmation of the view of the majority in the Court of Appeal on the constitutional point. I would dismiss the appeal with costs. There should be no order as to costs of the Attorneys-General who intervened.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the defendants, appellants: W.G.

The action for damages instituted by the Crown was maintained by the trial judge who held that the accident was solely due to the negligence of the ship in failing to keep a proper look-out and in proceeding at an excessive speed. The damages awarded included the value of the bridge, the cost of erecting a temporary replacement and loss of use of this highway bridge and channel facilities. However, the damages were limited pursuant to the provisions of the Canada Shipping Act. The ship appealed to this Court and the Crown cross-appealed as to the limited liability under the Act.\nHeld (Locke and Martland JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be allowed in part.\nPer Curiam: The cross-appeal should be dismissed. The trial judge was right in permitting the amount of recovery to be limited in accordance with ss. 649 and 651 of the Canada Shipping Act. Per Taschereau, Cartwright and Judson JJ.: The bridge operator and the Master of the ship were both negligent; the former for failing to give timely and adequate warning that the bridge could not be raised, and the latter for failing to stop short of the bridge. The degrees of fault should be apportionned two-thirds to the bridge operator and one-third to the ship.\nThis was not a case for the application of the rule in Bywell Castle (1879), 4 P.D. 219, dealing with the agony of collision.\nAs this was a common law action for damages within s. 29(d) of the Exchequer Court Act, the Crown, as plaintiff\u2014there being no counterclaim\u2014was entitled to judgment for one-third of its loss under the Ontario Negligence Act. There was no recovery at common law by reasons of the contributory negligence, and the Canada Shipping Act, incorporating the contributory negligence provisions of the Maritime Conventions Act, 1911, had no application to a collision between a ship and a structure on land. T.T.C. v. The King, [1949] S.C.R. 510, applied.\nThe damages awarded by the trial judge for loss of use of the channel and the bridge facilities should be disallowed. There was no monetary loss to the Crown with respect to this item which was really public inconvenience rather than loss of use. The Greta Holme, [1897] A.C. 596; The Mediana, [1900] A.C. 113; The Marpessa, [1907] A.C. 241; Admiralty Commissioners v. S.S. Chekiang, [1926] A.C. 637, distinguished.\nPer Locke and Martland JJ., dissenting: The trial judge's findings of fact, based on his appreciation of the credibility of the witnesses, that the accident was caused by the sole negligence of the ship and that there was no contributory negligence on the part of the bridge operator, should not be disturbed. His assessment of the damages, including the award for loss of use of the bridge facilities, should also not be disturbed. The Crown was deprived of its right to use these facilities in which very large sums of public moneys had been invested, and was entitled to recover for such deprivation although the operation of the bridge was a source of continuous expense and not of profit.

Appeal allowed in part, Locke and Martland JJ. dissenting.\nF. O. Gerity and G. R. Mackay, for the defendant, appellant, Gartland Steamship Co.\nP. B. C. Pepper, for the defendant, appellant, Albert P. LaBlanc.\nC. F. H. Carson, Q.C., J. B. S. Southey and P. M. Troop, for the plaintiff, respondent. The judgment of Taschereau, Cartwright and Judson JJ. was delivered by\nJudson J.:\u2014This accident happened early in the afternoon on April 29, 1952, in the Burlington Channel, which is the approach to the Port of Hamilton, when the S.S. W. E. Fitzgerald collided with and totally destroyed the north span of the highway bridge which crosses the channel. The weather was clear and the wind light. The channel runs east and west and the Fitzgerald was travelling from the lake into the harbour, that is, from east to west. The channel is protected by two piers on the Lake Ontario side. The total distance from the outer end of these piers to the highway bridge is 1,679 feet. A ship approaching the Port of Hamilton from Lake Ontario and passing through this channel has to pass two bridges, first a railway bridge and then the highway bridge. The railway bridge pivots on a concrete abutment, which is in the centre of the channel, and the Lake Ontario end of this abutment is 444 feet from the highway bridge. A ship approaching from Lake Ontario would normally expect to pass these bridges on the north side. No question arises about the railway bridge. It was opened in plenty of time for the ship to pass. The north span of the highway bridge never did open because of a mechanical failure. At some stage of the ship's progress down the channel the south span did open.\nThe theory of this accident, put forward by the Crown as plaintiff in the act on and accepted in full by the learned trial judge, is, first, that this ship entered the channel at an excessive speed and was unable to stop before coming into collision with the north span of the highway bridge; second, that the ship came down the centre of the channel until its bow was about one ship's length from the easterly end of the concrete abutment which supports the railway bridge and at that point changed course so as to pass to the north of the abutment; and third, that the ship struck the north span notwithstanding the fact that from the time the ship entered the channel there was a steady red light on the north span conveying a warning that this span would not or could not be raised to permit the passage, and that, on the other hand, the south span was opened in plenty of time to permit the passage. In my opinion, this theory is a serious over-simplification of the explanation for the accident and is based upon a rejection of evidence that should not have been rejected.\nThe learned trial judge found that when the ship entered the channel between the piers, its speed was greatly in excess of 5 miles per hour and probably at least 7 miles per hour. This conclusion is based upon the evidence of three steamship captains, each of long experience in navigating these waters, who would have reduced to half speed not later than Burlington buoy, which is well out in the lake, and to slow speed not later than half way in and to dead slow at the outer end of the piers if the bridge had not started to rise. The trial judge also found that it was not in accordance with good seamanship to enter the channel at even 5 miles per hour when neither span of the bridge had commenced to open, unless prompt steps were taken to reduce speed further and, if necessary, to stop before reaching the bridge.\nAs to the signal lights on the bridge, the finding was that when the Fitzgerald was not more than a ship's length in the channel, the south span began to rise and that immediately before this the flashing red light on the north span had been changed to a steady red light. The flashing red light is a signal that preparations are being made to raise the span. The steady red light conveys a warning of danger that the span will not be raised. The evidence of the bridge-tender, Hockridge, is the basis for this second finding of fact. When he failed in his efforts to raise the north span, because of some still unexplained mechanical failure, he says that he pressed the button to change the flashing red light on that span to a steady red light and then turned his attention to the south span, pressing the button to change the light on this span from a steady red to a flashing red. He himself could not see the lights. At this time, he says, the ship was just entering the channel and the south span immediately began to rise and was at its full height within a minute.\nAnother witness, Charles Coleman, was on the bridge with Hockridge. He saw the Fitzgerald coming in and he says that the south span started to rise when the ship was about its own length in the channel. He saw no change of course which would indicate an attempt to get into the south channel and no slackening of speed until the anchors were dropped. He has nothing to say about the lights on the bridge.\nOn this evidence and the conclusion that follows from it, there was no excuse for the ship in colliding with the north span, with weather conditions as they were and with a distance of 1,235 feet from the outer end of the pier on the Lake Ontario side to the easterly end of the abutment on which the railway bridge pivots, and with a further distance of 444 feet from this point to the north span.\nThe decisive questions are whether there ever was any change of light from flashing red to steady red and what was the position of the ship when the south span began to rise. On these questions the evidence of one Rowarth, the bridge-tender on the railway bridge, directly contradicts the evidence of Hockridge. He says that there was still a flashing red light on the north span when the bow of the ship passed the centre of the railway bridge. The ship was then about 200 feet from the highway bridge. He also says that when it was at the position marked \"R.1\" on Exhibit K, which is very close, about one-third of the ship's length, to the Lake Ontario end of the abutment on which his bridge pivots, he looked around and saw that the south span was just starting up or had just started up. It is at once obvious that this evidence describes a very different kind of accident from the one described by Hockridge. Rowarth had been employed as bridge-tender on this railway bridge for a period of twenty-eight years and had been the senior man in charge since 1946. We know his precise point of observation. He was in his cabin in the centre of his bridge and he had the best point of observation of any eye witness. He watched the Fitzgerald come in. The light on the north span of the highway bridge was flashing red after he had opened his railway bridge. The ship was then half way between the buoy and the pier and coming in slowly, in his opinion, judging from the bow wave. His next observation was when the Fitzgerald was well in the channel with her bow in line with the centre of the pier on which the railway bridge pivots. At this time his observation was that there was a flashing light on the north span, but that the span had not gone up. His next observation was that the ship was heading into the north channel. At this point he says he was wondering why the bridges were not going up. Neither span had moved and at this time the light on the north span was still flashing red and the light on the south span was a steady red. The bow of the ship then rubbed against his pier. There was still a flashing red light on the north span and the south span was then going up. He heard the noise of the anchor chain just before the boat rubbed on his pier. When the bow of the ship was opposite his cabin it was coming very slowly and his estimate is that the south span was by that time completely up but the flashing red light on the north span was still on. This was the last signal he saw on the north span because the ship in passing obscured his vision.\nThe learned trial judge rejected this evidence in its entirety. He described the evidence as very vague and containing to some extent contradictory estimates. He did not suggest that he was an untruthful witness but came to the conclusion that his recollection had become blurred by lapse of time to such an extent that his \"very indefinite estimates were not to be relied on\". From the written record I cannot find any indication of this vagueness or indefiniteness in estimates. This witness is clear on two points on which he was not shaken in any way. The first is that there never was a steady red light on the north span and the second is that the south span did not begin to rise until the ship was no more than a third of a length from the centre abutment. How can evidence of this kind be rejected? There was no better evidence anywhere. There was no better point of observation. If he was an honest witness, and there is no suggestion that he was not, he could not be mistaken on either point and his evidence strongly supports the evidence of the master and all the members of the crew who gave evidence on these two points.\nAnother independent witness, Mrs. Van Cleaf, gave evidence for the defence. She is the wife of the lighthouse keeper. She observed the Fitzgerald round the buoy out in the lake and heard it whistle for the bridge as it came in. She saw the ship as it entered the channel between the piers and describes its speed at that point as slow. She also heard the ship give another blast at the entrance to the channel and wondered what was wrong. She left her house and went on the pier. When she got outside, the ship, she says, was about 90 feet from the railway bridge abutment and the south span was just beginning to go up. She heard the anchor drop at this point. She made no observation of the lights on the span.\nThe evidence of this witness was rejected on the ground of bias and certain other discrepancies, which to me are of no significance in determining where the ship was when the south span began to rise. Her estimate of 90 feet from the railway bridge abutment may be wrong. The railway bridge-master says it was about one-third of a ship's length. But her evidence on this point is entirely consistent with that of the railway bridgemaster, and that of the ship's master and crew that the south span did not begin to rise until the ship was close to the railway bridge abutment. The bias assigned for the rejection of this evidence is to me very unconvincing and I do not think that the evidence should have been rejected on this ground without testing it by comparison with that of an admittedly truthful witness, who was held to be mistaken. One was said to be biased and the other mistaken but they both testified to the same essential fact of the proximity of the ship to the bridge when the south span began to rise.\nThere was only one witness, apart from Hockridge, who testified that the light on the north span was steady red, one W. R. Love who was an employee of the Department of Public Works, engaged in keeping a tally of the loads of fill being delivered to a work site behind the north pier. He says that he was stationed at a point marked \"L\" on Exhibit 14, which is about half way between the end of the pier and the highway bridge. There is some evidence that he was considerably closer to the bridge. I say this because he was within speaking distance of a man called Williams and there is evidence that the work site where he was was actually closer to the bridge than he estimated. He did not pay any attention to the approach of the Fitzgerald. He was working on his tallies. His attention was first drawn to the ship by the fact that its propellor was running in reverse. There is evidence that the propellor did run in reverse at one point after the captain had tried to enter the south channel and had failed because he was too close. I will deal with this attempt later. He also heard the noise of the anchor immediately after his first observation. His evidence therefore begins at the point where the propellor was going astern and the ship was letting go the anchor. This witness does say that the light on the north span was a steady red at this point. One immediately wonders how this witness, beginning his observations at this point, could possibly say \"in comparison to any other boat I had seen going through I would say it was quite faster than any other ship I had seen going through\". How could he possibly justify a statement of this kind with the observation that he made and how could the learned trial judge prefer this evidence to that of the C.N.R. bridgemaster with all his experience with shipping through this canal and his ability to judge and analyse a dangerous situation? There is no comparison between the respective testimonial abilities of Rowarth and Love based upon experience in observation, a precise identification of the point of observation, and knowledge of the movements of the ship.\nIn my opinion, there was error in rejecting the evidence of Rowarth and Mrs. Van Cleaf for the reasons given by the learned trial judge. The evidence as to the lights on the bridge and the position of the ship seems to me to be overwhelmingly in favour of the defence and I think that in a case where the trial is completed in February 1955 and a reserved judgment delivered in January 1958, the initial advantage of the trial judge who heard and saw the witnesses has largely disappeared.\nI also think that there was error in the judgment of the learned trial judge when he held that the ship made no attempt to get into the south channel. The master did describe such an attempt when he was in the position marked \"R. 1\", described by Rowarth as about one-third or one-half a ship's length from the centre pier. The south span, the master says, was then opening and in an attempt to enter the south channel he turned hard left on the wheel and went full speed ahead. When he found that he was unable to get in, he reversed his engines and dropped his anchor. This attempt, he says, is what caused him to rub on the centre pier when entering the north channel. Now, Rowarth says that the bow did rub on the centre pier when entering the north channel. Could Rowarth be mistaken in a physical fact such as this? Rowarth's evidence strongly confirms that of the master on this point. If the learned judge's finding is accepted that there was no attempt to get into the south channel, the inference is that this master not only sailed his ship into a closed span showing a red light when there was an alternative open course, but sailed it in such a way that his bow rubbed on the centre pier for no reason whatever. To me this is a glaring improbability and I cannot draw an inference of such incredible negligence from this evidence.\nOn the other hand, I think that the bridgemaster, Hock-ridge, was guilty of very serious negligence in failing to sound five short blasts of the bridge whistle to indicate his inability to raise the north span. His explanation is that there was plenty of time for the ship to get into the south channel and there might be some possible excuse for this neglect if the ship were actually in the position in which he says it was when he began to raise the south span. I have already indicated that my conclusion is that the ship was much nearer to danger when the south span did begin to rise. But quite apart from this, I cannot conceive of any more dangerous situation than failure of this span to work. When the ship was approaching and the bridgemaster knew that the north channel was the one which the ship would normally take, why not stop the ship at once by giving the danger signal? The man on the bridge alone knew that there had been a dangerous mechanical failure on the north span and he had no knowledge, at this time, that he could raise the south span. This is not an accident of a routine character. If it is true that the north span would not work and the south span was still untested, there was a situation of extraordinary emergency, a situation which in my opinion was very flippantly disregarded by the bridgemaster even if one accepts his evidence in full.\nThe Burlington Channel regulations read:\n3. (1) The Master of every vessel approaching the bridges of the Burlington Channel and desiring passage through shall sound three long blasts of a whistle or horn to indicate to the bridgemaster that the bridges be opened. (2) If for any reason the bridgemaster is not able to immediately open the bridges he shall signal the approaching vessel by five short blasts of the bridge whistle.\n(3) No liability shall be incurred by the Crown in the event of failure of the bridgemaster or staff to signal the approaching vessel when unable to open the bridge immediately.\n4. (1) A vessel shall not attempt to pass the Burlington Channel bridges until both bridges are in a fully open position on the side of the Channel on which the vessel is approaching and the bridges are showing green lights.\n(2) Every vessel when approaching a bridge which is not in a fully open position shall be kept at such speed and under such control that the vessel may at any time be stopped well clear of the bridge.\nThe interpretation put upon regulation 3(2) by the learned trial judge that there was no obligation to sound the warning blasts unless there was inability to open both spans seems to me to be a very narrow one. This ship expected to pass through the north channel, the normal and expected course of passage for a ship entering from the lake. The bridgemaster knew this and yet he deliberately made no attempt to give the warning signal that this passage would not be available. Reading regulations 3 and 4 together, I cannot regard them as supporting the position taken by the bridgemaster that he was under no obligation to sound the danger blast unless both his spans failed to work, for regulation 4, when speaking of both bridges being open on the same side, must be referring to the railway bridge and the highway bridge. Quite apart from any regulation and what it may mean, in this extraordinary emergency and with a whistle available it seems nonsense to me for the bridgemaster to say that no warning was necessary, even if the ship was where the bridgemaster says it was. I think that this ship was lured into a dangerous position by the failure to warn and by the continuing invitation in the form of the flashing red light that the north span would be raised.\nThe Crown is the plaintiff in this action, seeking to recover damages for the destroyed north span. There is no counterclaim by the ship owner for there was little or no damage to the ship. The Crown must prove negligence against the master and its claim is met not only by a denial of negligence but also by a plea of contributory negligence on the part of the Crown's servant, the bridgemaster. In my opinion this plea of contributory negligence is established. The bridgemaster should have given the warning blasts when the ship was entering the channel, for, according to his own story, he had the time and opportunity to do this and he alone knew of the mechanical failure. I am also of the opinion that he never did change the flashing signal to the steady red signal and that he allowed the ship to advance too far in the face of his invitation before he made any attempt to raise either span.\nI am not satisfied that the learned trial judge's finding as to the speed of the ship is the correct one. He finds that the ship entered the channel at a speed between five and seven miles per hour. His theory of the accident was that this was too high a speed to permit the ship to stop short of the bridge. This theory is based on the inference drawn from the evidence that the ship sailed straight up to the bridge. I am satisfied that this is not the correct inference to draw from the evidence and that the ship did make an effort to get into the south channel and that it did rub the centre pier. In spite of all this, the ship was virtually stopped when it nosed into the bridge. It was not a heavy impact. The expert evidence introduced by the Crown, if it is to be accepted, demonstrates that the ship even at 7 miles per hour when entering the channel could have stopped short of the bridge. It also demonstrates that if the captain executed the manoeuvres that he said he did in his attempt to get into the south channel and then to extricate himself, his ship would rub its bow on the centre pier and would have sufficient momentum to reach and collide with the north span. This expert evidence, to me, is strongly corroborative of the account of the accident given by the defence. Nevertheless, the obligation imposed on the ship by regulation 4 is clear. It must not attempt to pass \"until both bridges are in a fully open position on the side of the Channel on which the vessel is approaching and the bridges are showing green lights.\" This must mean, in this case, the railway bridge and the north span. \"Both bridges on the side of the Channel on which the vessel is approaching\" cannot refer to the north and south spans of the highway bridge. Further, the ship must be under such control that it \"may at any time be stopped well clear of the bridge.\" The appellant submits that it should be relieved from liability under the Bywell Castle1 rule or, in the alternative, that this is a case of contribution. The Bywell Castle rule is appealed to on the ground that the master of the ship was put in a dilemma by the errors and omissions of the bridgemaster by delay at his work and in failing to warn of the danger by blast and lighting and that the attempt to get into the south channel at the last moment was made under real apprehension of danger and was, in the circumstances, a reasonable course of conduct. The master says that it was this attempt that gave his ship the momentum that carried it into the bridge and that if this dilemma had not arisen he would have been able to stop. While I am satisfied, for the reasons I have given, that the attempt to get into the south channel was actually made and that a situation did arise which involved a choice between two unpleasant and unsatisfactory alternatives, I do not think that this is a case for the application of the Bywell Castle rule. At some point in his progress through the channel the master should have decided tha't he had to do something to stop short of the bridge rather than go ahead on the invitation of the flashing red light in the expectation that the north span would be raised. In my opinion he postponed that decision too late. This is the negligence that I would find against him. I think the master should have done in the first place what he did in the second. Instead of going hard to the left and giving the order for full speed, he should have dropped his anchor and reversed his engines. He was too close to the abutment of the railway bridge to do what he did. The case, in my opinion, is one for apportionment of fault.\nI would apportion the fault two-thirds to the bridgemaster and one-third to the ship. The next question is whether the plaintiff can recover anything in these circumstances. Apart from statute this action would be dismissed. With a plea of contributory negligence established as in this case, the plaintiff fails because he does not prove that the defendant caused the damage: T.T.C. v. The King2. The Canada Shipping Act, incorporating the Maritime Conventions Act 1911, has no application to a collision between a ship and a structure on land. The choice is between no recovery at all and a recovery under the Ontario Negligence Act. This is a common law action for damages within s. 29(d) of the Exchequer Court Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 98, and in my opinion the Crown, as plaintiff, is entitled to the advantage of the Ontario Act: T.T.C. v. The King, supra. It should have judgment for one-third of its loss.\nThe learned trial judge's assessment of the damages amounts to $367,823.49. This includes $215,073.52 for the value of the destroyed span, $30,000 for removal of the wreckage and $60,280.18 for a new temporary fixed span. In addition, assessments were made for numerous smaller items of damage. I would not interfere with any of these assessments although I have serious doubt whether more allowance should not have been made for obsolescence in the computation of the value of the destroyed span. But, in addition, the learned trial judge allowed $30,000 for loss of use of the channel and the facilities as they existed before the accident. I would disallow this item in full. There is no evidence that any ship has been unable to get through the channel because of this accident. The south channel was always open. The north channel is closed to shipping until the temporary span is replaced by a moveable span. This has not yet been done and I am not unaware of the fact that a new high-level bridge has been built with the intention of carrying most of the highway traffic which formerly travelled over the damaged bridge.\nTo me this item of damage for which the Crown seeks compensation is better described as public inconvenience rather than loss of use. For a short time, until the so-called temporary span was put in, pedestrian and vehicular traffic suffered inconvenience but the Crown suffered no monetary loss. The same may be said of loss of use of the north channel. If it had been thought wise to replace the span, the work would have taken one year. There was, therefore, a theoretical loss of use of the north channel for shipping during this period. But the loss of use is again really public inconvenience and not monetary loss to the Crown. I do not think that The Greta Holme3, The Mediana4, The Mar-pessa5 and Admiralty Commissioners v. S. S. Chekiang6, where damages were awarded for loss of use of dredgers, a lightship and, in the last case, a warship, can have any application to the facts of this case. The Crown has been fully compensated for all its loss without this item.\nI would therefore reduce the learned trial judge's assessment from $367,823.49 by this item of $30,000, making the total amount of damage proved $337,823.49. Of this the Crown is entitled to judgment for one-third or $112,607.83. In accordance with these reasons, I would vary the judgment under appeal and direct that judgment be entered for $112,607.83 and costs of the trial and other proceedings prior to appeal. The appellant should have the costs of the appeal.\nThe formal judgment of the learned trial judge provided that the plaintiff recover from the defendants $367,823.49 but that the defendant Gartland Steamship Company was entitled to limit its liability to an amount not exceeding $184,383.50. The respondent cross-appealed against that part of the judgment which declared the defendant entitled so to limit its liability. For the reasons given by my brother Locke, I would dismiss the cross-appeal with costs.\nThe judgment of Locke and Martland JJ. was delivered by\nLocke J. (dissenting):\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Exchequer Court delivered by Cameron J. by which damages were awarded against the present appellants in respect of an accident which occurred on April 29, 1952 when the ship \"W. E. Fitzgerald\", owned by the appellant company and in charge of the appellant LaBlanc as master, came into collision with and damaged the northerly span of a bascule bridge, the property of the Crown, which traversed the Burlington Ship Canal near Hamilton.\nThe Burlington Ship Canal is an artificial waterway constructed by the Crown upon its own property for the purpose of providing the means of access for shipping from Lake Ontario to and from the harbour of Hamilton. The width of the channel between the boundary walls is 298 ft., the total length is 2,720 ft. and it was dredged to a depth of 26 ft. In the centre of the channel there is a pier 503 ft. in length, the eastern extremity of which is 1,235 ft. west of the eastern extremity of the channel. This pier divides the main channel into two channels of approximately 130 ft. in width and provides support for the pivot of a Canadian National Railway bridge and the off shore edges of the two span bascule bridge which at the time of the accident afforded the means of crossing the channel to vehicles and pedestrians travelling upon the Queen Elizabeth highway. The pivot of the railway bridge is approximately 190 ft. west of the eastern end of the centre pier and 1,425 ft. from the eastern extremity of the channel. The bascule bridge is about 240 ft. west of the pivot of the railway bridge close to the western extremity of the pier. A bascule bridge is a draw bridge balanced by a counterpoise which rises or falls as the bridge is lowered or raised, and the counterpoises for the spans of this bridge were on the north and south shores of the channel. When the span was raised to permit the passage of a vessel, the floor was elevated to an almost vertical position. Each span was equipped with lights of the nature described in the Notice to Mariners of March 7, 1951, hereinafter quoted.\nAt a distance of about a mile from the easterly end of the channel, there is a buoy referred to as the Burlington Traffic Buoy.\nThe bridge is maintained and operated by the Department of Public Works of Canada. By P.C. 2294 of May 9, 1949, regulations were made under the provisions of the Navigable Waters Protection Act, R.S.C. 1927, c. 140, defining in certain respects the manner in which shipping should be operated when approaching and passing through the channel. These, so far as they are relevant, were as follows:\n1. The maximum speed for vessels navigating the Burlington Channel shall be as follows:\n(a) for vessels not exceeding an over-all length of 260 feet\u2014 8 miles per hour;\n(b) for all other vessels\u2014a minimum speed consistent with the safety of the vessel and the bridges. 3. (1) The Master of every vessel approaching the bridges of the Burlington Channel and desiring passage through shall sound three long blasts of a whistle or horn to indicate to the bridge-master that the bridges be opened.\n(2) If for any reason the bridgemaster is not able to immediately open the bridges he shall signal the approaching vessel by five short blasts of the bridge whistle.\n(3) No liability shall be incurred by the Crown in the event of failure of the bridgemaster or staff to signal the approaching vessel when unable to open the bridge immediately.\n4. (1) A vessel shall not attempt to pass the Burlington Channel bridges until both bridges are in a fully open position on the side of the Channel on which the vessel is approaching and the bridges are showing green lights.\n(2) Every vessel when approaching a bridge which is not in a fully open position shall be kept at such speed and under such control that the vessel may at any time be stopped well clear of the bridge.\n6. Any person violating any of these Regulations shall be liable, upon summary conviction, to a penalty not exceeding fifty dollars and costs, or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding ten days, or to both fine and imprisonment.\nA further regulation was made and notice of it given to mariners dated March 7, 1951, which read:\nAdditional signal lights have been installed on the highway bridge in Burlington Channel, at the top centre of each of the two bascule spans. These are in addition to the navigation lights at the centre floor level of each span, which shows steady Red or no signal when the span is closed and steady Green when it is open to passage of a vessel.\nVessels requiring passage shall be governed by the following signals located on this bridge.\nSteady Red or no signals indicate that the bridge is not ready. A flashing Red signal on top of either span indicates that that span is being made ready for passage of a vessel. A vessel requiring passage shall then alter course if necessary and prepare to pass on the same side of the Centre Pier as that on which the flashing signal is given.\nAfter either span is completely raised, discontinuation of the flashing Red signal and a steady Green signal from the floor of the span, together indicate that that span is ready for passage of a vessel.\nNote: Navigation lights on the Canadian National Railway bridge, on the lakeward side of the highway bridge, remain as heretofore.\nThe case for the Crown, as pleaded, was that the impact of the ship with the span and the resulting damage was caused by the negligence of the defendant LaBlanc in the navigation or operation of the ship, in the course of his employment as a servant of the appellant company. Particulars of the negligence pleaded were that he had caused the ship to approach, or failed to prevent it from approaching the north span, at an excessive rate of speed: that he had failed to keep or cause to be kept a proper look-out: that he had attempted to pass the bridge with the ship before the span was in an open position and showing green lights, contrary to subs. (1) of s. 4 of the Burlington Channel Navigation Regulations, and failed to keep the said ship at such a speed and under such control when approaching the north span to enable it to be stopped well clear of the bridge, contrary to subs. (2) of s. 4 of the said Regulations.\nThe defendants filed separate defences, each of which, in so far as the issue of liability was concerned, denied the allegations of negligence and of excessive speed, alleged that the control apparatus and machinery were not in good operating order and condition, that the accident occurred by reason of the negligence of the bridge tender in failing to give sufficient warning of the failure of the bridge machinery and its control system, in failing to manipulate the light signals so as to indicate that the bridge would not or could not open, and to sound an alarm signal to give warning to the ship of his inability to open the north span.\nOn the day in question the Fitzgerald was bound from Toronto to the Port of Hamilton, part laden with a cargo of sand. The ship is 428 ft. in length and of 52 ft. beam. According to the log, it arrived at the Burlington Buoy at about 1.18 p.m. and it is common ground that at that time the lights on the north span were flashing red, indicating, as required by the Regulations, that that span was being made ready for the passage of the vessel. Captain LaBlanc said that the ship had sounded three long blasts, as required by the Regulations, when it was about half way between the buoy and the entrance of the channel, and, apart from this, it was shown by the evidence that the bridge tender Hockridge had seen the vessel before it reached the buoy and intended to cause the north span to be opened to permit its passage. It is also common ground that, due to some failure either in the electrical power or in the mechanism with which the span was equipped, it failed to operate when Hockridge attempted to open the span. While the most diligent inquiries were made after the event to determine the cause of this failure, it was not ascertained. The ship, after rounding the buoy, proceeded into the main channel and, at some point the determination of which is a matter of controversy, the southern span was raised to permit the passage of the vessel. The captain, however, had directed it into the north half of the channel and, despite going hard astern and dropping two of the ship's anchors, was unable to stop it before it struck the north span. The force of the blow was sufficient to wreck the span and as an operating unit it became a total loss.\nThe facts relating to the movements of the ship after rounding the buoy are reviewed with such clarity and in such detail in the reasons for judgment of the learned trial judge that it is sufficient to summarize them.\nHockridge, the bridge tender who was in charge at the time, had long experience in the operation of the mechanism which raised the spans of the bridge. Earlier on the day in question the north span had been opened to permit the passage of a vessel. Hockridge said that he saw the Fitzgerald well out in the lake about half an hour before the collision and, when it was at the buoy, he started to take the preliminary steps necessary for the opening of the north span and put on the flashing red light on that span, to indicate that he was preparing to raise it. When the vessel was 4 or 5 lengths from the eastern end of the channel, he followed the procedure necessary to clear the bridge of traffic and to prevent further traffic on the highway but when he operated the controls to raise the north span it did not move. After making three attempts, the bridge failing to rise, he reset the lights on the north span, changing the flashing red light back to a steady red light, and pressed the button which changed the steady red light showing on the east side of the south span to a flashing red light, to indicate to the ship that he was preparing that span to be raised. He said that he then looked to see where the ship was, it being in plain view from the place where the controls were situated, and that it was just then entering the east end of the channel or, as he estimated, its bow had just entered the channel. He then moved the throttle for the south span which began immediately to rise and within a minute, according to him, it was raised to its full height. As the entrance to the channel was some 1,235 ft. to the east of the centre pier, if Hockridge's evidence was true, the bow of the ship at that time was at least 1,000 ft. to the east of the easterly extremity of the centre pier and, as the weather was clear, the change in the lights and the movement upward of the south span were in plain view from the ship.\nAccording to LaBlanc, however, the light on the north span which was flashing red when the ship rounded the buoy continued to do so right up to the time the vessel struck the bridge. He said that his attention was drawn to the fact that the south span was being lifted by Erickson, the man at the wheel, when the bow of his ship was only some 200 ft. distant from the centre pier. Thereupon he claimed that he first attempted to change the course of his ship to the south channel but, realizing that that was impossible, he directed it to starboard and, while the two bow anchors were dropped and the propellers were put hard astern, it was found impossible to halt the vessel before it collided with the bridge.\nThere was also a wide divergence between the evidence tendered by the Crown, as to the speed of the ship as it approached the entrance to the channel and at which it proceeded thereafter, and that given by the ship's captain and other members of the crew. According to LaBlanc, the speed of the ship approximated 12 miles per hour as it rounded the buoy and this was maintained until it was half way to the entrance of the channel, at which time it would be a half mile distant, when it was reduced to half speed. He said that the speed as it entered the channel was from 4\u00bd to 5 miles per hour and that this speed was reduced to slow immediately after the entrance had been made. He estimated the speed of the vessel at the time it was one length east of the centre abutment as being between 3 and 4 miles an hour.\nLaBlanc's evidence as to the speed at the time the ship reached the entrance of the channel was corroborated by Van Deuren, the second mate. As opposed to this evidence, Captain Alexander Wilson, the Commodore of the Canada Steamship Lines Fleet having more than forty years' experience on the Great Lakes, when called for the plaintiff said that, in his opinion, the Fitzgerald should have changed to half speed at the Burlington Buoy and to slow half way in from the buoy to the entrance and that if this had been done its speed would have been from 3 to 4 miles per hour, which he considered a proper speed, when entering the channel. Based upon his experience, he said that the ship proceeding at full speed from the buoy to a point half distant from the entrance would have been going easily 7 miles per hour at the entrance.\nS. T. Mathews, a naval architect with the National Research Council, had made a series of tests with a small scale model at the request of the Crown. His qualifications and the nature of the tests made with this model 1\/25th the size of the Fitzgerald in a tank 120 ft. in length which reproduced the material physical features of the channel, are described in the reasons for judgment of Cameron J. Accepting the figures furnished by the captain as to the number of revolutions per minute of the propeller at full speed, half speed and slow, Mathews said that, assuming the ship was at full speed half way from the buoy to the channel entrance, the speed when entering would be 7 miles per hour if its maximum speed was 21.1 miles per hour when loaded as she was at the time. Mathews had computed the maximum speed of the vessel from the entries made in the ship's log of the voyage from Toronto and found her maximum speed to have been 12.35 miles per hour. However, accepting the lesser figure, his tests, which were accepted as being accurate by the learned trial judge, showed that, assuming a speed of 7 miles per hour at the entrance and that the ship was handled thereafter in the manner stated by LaBlanc, the speed, when one ship's length distant from the centre pier, would have been 5.59 miles per hour.\nIt was made clear in the evidence of Captain Wilson and the two other experienced captains called to give evidence for the Crown that, in their opinion, such a speed at the entrance was excessive unless the bridge was up at the time the ship entered the channel, and Captain Scarrow, called to give evidence for the defence, admitted that at a speed between 6 and 7 miles per hour at the entrance the ship would have no chance of stopping before hitting the bridge.\nUpon the issue as to the speed of the vessel, the learned trial judge, after reviewing the evidence, found as a fact that the speed at the time the ship entered the channel was greatly in excess of 5 miles per hour and was probably at least 7 miles per hour, and that when LaBlanc made the first attempt to stop the ship it was travelling at a speed in excess of 5 miles per hour.\nIt will be remembered that, according to LaBlanc, the light on the north span which was flashing red continued to do so up to the time of the impact. A witness, W. R. Love, called for the Crown, was working at the time for the Department of Public Works at a point on the north side of the channel some 800 ft. west of the entrance. When his attention was first called to the ship, he said that it had proceeded about 350 ft. into the channel and when the bow was directly opposite to him he saw the starboard anchor drop. Love said that at that time there was a fixed red light on the north span and the south span was then up, or pretty close to its maximum height. At that point the bow of the vessel, would be some 850 ft. from the north span.\nCharles Coleman, a bridge man employed by the Crown who was on duty at the north end of the bridge, said that when the south span started to rise the ship was about its own length in the channel, or possibly a little more.\nMrs. Donna Cochran, whose husband was employed by the Crown as a radio operator and who lived in a house close to the channel, said that as the south span was raised the light on it was flashing red.\nThe evidence of LaBlanc was supported in part by the evidence of Van Deusen, the second mate, who said that the light was flashing on the north span almost up to the time the ship struck it, that he did not see the south span commence to rise, that he got the captain's order to drop the anchor when the bow was about 100 ft. easterly of the east end of the centre pier, and that he had first observed a change in the south span after both anchors were down. A questionnaire had been submitted to this witness long prior to the trial, in which he had said that he had noticed the south span start to rise when the bow was passing the centre axis of the railway bridge and that it had been raised about 10 ft. when he saw it at that point. The learned trial judge said that he did not believe this witness.\nErickson, the seaman who was at the wheel, said, con- tradicting the evidence of LaBlanc, that the ship had been reduced to half speed at the Burlington buoy. He did not observe the south span lifting until the bow was one ship's length from the centre pier.\nLawrence Korth, a watchman, who was stationed on the forecastle deck, said that the red light on the north span continued to flash up to the time when the ship was only a few feet distant from the bridge.\nMrs. Amy Uan Cleaf, the wife of the lighthouse keeper who lived on the south side of the channel between the rail- way and highway bridges, gave evidence for the defence and said that the ship was only 90 ft. east of the east end of the centre pier when the south span commenced to rise. After reviewing the evidence of this witness and saying that it was impossible to escape the conclusion which he had formed at the trial, both from her demeanour and from her evidence, that she had a distinct bias against the bridge master and the bridge operators, the learned trial judge said in terms that he attached no weight whatever to her evidence.\nP. T. Roworth, the senior bridge tender of the railway bridge called for the defence, said that when the ship was steering into the north channel about half a ship's length from the east end of the centre pier he saw a flashing red light on the north span and a solid red light on the south span. At that time he said that neither span had started to rise but, on cross-examination, contradicted this, saying that when the ship was at that point the south span was being opened, the north end of it being some 8 to 10 ft. in the air. Again, having said that at that time the light on the south span was solid red, when cross-examined he said that the light on that span had been solid red when he looked at it at a time when the ship was still in the lake and that he did not think that he had looked at it again thereafter. A further statement made by him on cross-examination was that the ship had blown a second blast from her whistle when she was near the outer end of the piers of the channel but later, on re-examination, he said that the vessel was then approximately half way between the outer piers and the railway bridge. As to this witness the learned trial judge, after pointing out that he had admitted on cross-examination that he had not looked at the south span at any time after the ship entered the channel, said:\nIn view of the very vague and to some extent contradictory estimates of this witness, I find it difficult to attach much weight thereto. I do not suggest that he was an untruthful witness, but I am satisfied that his recollection of the events had become blurred by lapse of time to such an extent that his very indefinite estimates are not to be relied on.\nSome support for the evidence of LaBlanc as to the time when the south span opened might have been found in an entry in the ship's log made by him on the date of the accident which read:\nStruck north draw (1.29) of bridge wrecking same shoving it off its buttment into river light on north draw flashing to signal using that side. when Entering R R bridge the South Draw opened but too late to change. So we backed full and let go both anchors there was no signal to signify we woulden get North Draw.\nAs to this the learned trial judge found upon the evidence that the entry as to the point at which the south span commenced to rise was false and said that he was quite satisfied that there was in fact no attempt made to get into the south draw.\nUpon this conflicting evidence the learned trial judge found as a fact that the south span commenced to rise when the Fitzgerald was not more than one ship's length in the channel and that immediately prior thereto the flashing red light on the north span had been changed to a steady red light, that the look-out on the ship was entirely inadequate and that this failure to keep a proper look-out in the circumstances was gross negligence which brought about the collision with the bridge. He found further that another factor which caused the disaster was the excessive speed of the vessel at the entrance to the channel, and later when the master, in view of that speed, failed to reduce it in time and to keep his vessel under such control that he could stop before reaching the bridge. The learned judge, as these findings show, accepted the evidence given by Hockridge, Love and Coleman, and that of Mathews as to the speed of the ship and the distances within which she could be stopped, in preference to that of the appellant LaBlanc, Mrs. Van Cleaf, Korth, Van Deusen and Roworth, where their evidence conflicted with that of the witnesses for the Crown which are mentioned.\nIn estimating the credibility of these witnesses whose evidence conflicted on these material points, the learned and greatly experienced trial judge had the advantage, which we have not, of observing these witnesses as they gave their evidence, and with this aid coming to a conclusion as to their veracity. In order to reverse his findings upon this aspect of the matter it would be necessary, in my opinion, for us to conclude that the learned judge was so clearly wrong as to indicate that he had not taken proper advantage of having seen and heard the witnesses. Far from coming to any such conclusion in the present case, I have, after examining all of the evidence in this lengthy record with great care, come to the same conclusion as the learned trial judge. I would not disturb these findings of fact.\nAs to the issue that there was contributory negligence on the part of the bridge tender, the respondent's case is based upon the fact that, admittedly, Hockridge did not signal to the approaching vessel that he was not able to immediately open the north span by having sounded five short blasts of the bridge whistle.\nThe wording of the regulation of June 27, 1949, dealing with this aspect of the matter is:\n3. (2) If for any reason the bridge master is not able to immediately open the bridges he shall signal the approaching vessel by five short blasts of the bridge whistle.\nDealing with this contention the learned trial judge pointed out that the regulation requires the warning to be given only if the bridge master is not able to open both bridges, a situation which did not arise in the present case. In the present matter the change in the lights was made at a time when there was ample opportunity for the ship to be directed into the south channel and the learned judge found that the bridge master did the reasonable and prudent thing in the circumstances by immediately opening the south span when he found the north span could not be used. Being of this opinion, the learned trial judge found no negligence on the part of the bridge operator contributing to the accident, a conclusion with which I am in complete agreement. Hockridge was entitled to assume that a proper look-out would be maintained on the ship and that she would approach at a speed that would be reasonable and in accordance with the regulation. The principle referred to by Lord Atkinson in Toronto Railway Company v. King7, is not restricted in its application to traffic in the streets.\nIn the statement of defence of each of the appellants it was alleged that the bridge constituted an obstruction of the public right of navigation of a navigable channel and the provisions of s. 4 of the Navigable Waters Protection Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 193, are pleaded. The statute applicable at the time of the accident was c. 140, R.S.C. 1927. The language of s. 4 is, however, identical.\nWhat legal consequences would result if the appellant company had an enforceable right to use this channel, constructed by the Crown on its own property, if the exercise of that right was obstructed, due to a negligent act of the said appellants, is not explained either in the appellant's factum or in the argument addressed to us. It may be said also that the appellant company had no such right. Counsel for the appellant expressly disclaimed any contention that the bridge constituted a nuisance which might render applicable the decision of the Judicial Committee in Steamship Eurana v. Burrard Inlet Tunnel and Bridge Company8.\nIt is to be remembered that the Burlington Channel was constructed by the predecessors of Her Majesty upon the property of the Crown and shipping is permitted to use it gratuitously to obtain entry to Hamilton Harbour and it is, of course, not suggested that any obligation rested upon the Crown, either to construct the work or to permit its gratuitous use.\nSection 4 of the Act reads:\nNo work shall be built or placed in, upon, over, under, through or across any navigable water unless the site thereof has been approved by the Governor in Council, nor unless such work is built, placed and maintained in accordance with plans and regulations approved or made by the Governor in Council. Section 3 provides that, except as the provisions of the part which contain s. 4 relate to the rebuilding or repairing of any lawful work, nothing in the part applies to any work constructed under the authority of any Act of the Parliament of Canada. Dealing with this defence, Cameron J. held that, as it was shown that the channel and the south span were originally constructed about 1923 and that in or about 1931 the channel was widened and the north span constructed with funds voted by Parliament for these purposes, when, under an appropriation Act Parliament appropriates funds for the construction of specific works, such works are constructed under the authority of an Act of Canada. It might further be pointed out that the provision referred to in the Navigable Waters Protection Act is not by its terms made applicable to Her Majesty and, therefore, does not bind the Crown: s. 16, The Interpretation Act, R.S.C. 1927, c. 1.\nThe judgment appealed from determined the value of the north span which was wrecked by the collision and rendered valueless, except for some salvage, as being $215,073.52. The learned trial judge decided that the proper principle applicable in deciding its value was replacement cost less depreciation from the time it was constructed. The figure above mentioned was determined in this manner. The contract for the north span had been let by the Crown in 1930 and the construction carried out in 1931. Evidence was given by L. E. Rowebottom, Chief Prices Inspector of the Labour and Prices Division of the Dominion Bureau of Statistics, to the effect that the price index for material, wages and all other matters entering into the cost of construction of such a bridge in 1952 was 230.2 on the basis of 100 for the year 1930. In arriving at this figure, the witness made use of certain official publications of the Bureau of Statistics and, while these were not put in evidence by the Crown as they might have been under the provisions of s. 24 or s. 25 of the Canada Evidence Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 307, counsel for the appellant LaBlanc cross-examined Rowebottom at length upon their contents, having previously asked for their production. The learned trial judge ruled that the documents should be admitted as exhibits and this was done. I respectfully agree that, in the circumstances disclosed by the record, these documents were properly put in evidence and were admissible as proof of their contents and that the objection based upon their admission and their use by the witness fails.\nWhen the north span was wrecked it was decided on behalf of the Crown that, since it would take at least a year to have a bascule span fabricated and built as a replacement, a temporary fixed bridge should be constructed to enable traffic upon the highway to cross the channel. In respect of the construction of this bridge and the approaches thereto the judgment allowed damages for its cost which amounted to $60,280.18. This figure as to the cost of constructing the bridge and the necessary approaches is not questioned but the appellants contend that, if liable, they should not be required to pay the replacement cost of the required span, as well as the cost of a bridge to replace it.\nA further claim by the Crown, which was allowed, was for the loss of use of the bridge for three and one half months and the northerly channel of the canal for one year, and these items may conveniently be considered together.\nIt should be said that there is no evidence to suggest that, when the channel was constructed through the property of the Crown for the convenience of shipping, any legal obligation rested upon the Crown to provide a means of passage across this waterway, either for vehicles or pedestrians. There is no evidence as to the volume of such traffic at the time the channel was first constructed, but it is common ground that at the time of the accident there was a great volume of motor traffic upon the highway which connected with the bridge, which was the main road between Toronto and Niagara Falls and Buffalo, and a considerable volume of pedestrian traffic. The effect of the destruction of the north span was to disrupt this traffic for a period of three and one half months while the temporary span was being constructed. The Department of Public Works undertook this work promptly and also arranged a substituted means of passage for pedestrians across the Canadian National Railway bridge, for the cost of which a claim for damages was made. There was no revenue derived by the Crown, either from vessels using the channel or traffic crossing the bridge, and it is, accordingly, contended by the appellants that no monetary loss having been suffered the claim for loss of use fails.\nThe learned trial judge allowed the claim for the temporary bridge, adopting the principle that if a chattel is injured an amount paid for the hire of another while it is being repaired is recoverable as damages in tort. While the north span was destroyed, the bridge as an entirety suffered damage which resulted in the south span being rendered useless for the carriage of traffic during the time taken to construct the temporary bridge. The bridge had been constructed for the purpose of rendering services of great value to the general public and, as it was intended on behalf of the Crown to continue such services as rapidly as possible, I agree that the cost of the construction of the temporary bridge was recoverable.\nThe claim for loss of use of the north span and of the northerly channel of the ship canal presents further difficulties. As a consequence of the negligence of the master, the Crown was deprived of the use of the north span at least for the period of three and one half months taken to construct the temporary bridge and was deprived at least for one year of the use of the north channel of the canal, thus lessening the value of the channel as a whole and throwing an added burden of work upon the bridge across the south channel.\nIt is undoubted that no legal obligation rested upon the Crown to provide a means of access for shipping from Lake Ontario to and from the Harbour of Hamilton and that no profit resulted to the Crown from its operation. On the contrary, it was a source of continuous expense.\nThat the Crown had incurred a very large expense in constructing the channel and the bridges is undoubted and, to the extent indicated, it was deprived of its right to the use of these facilities for the periods mentioned. The learned trial judge considered that the loss was recoverable upon the principle adopted by the House of Lords in The Greta Holme9, where a body of trustees who were charged with the duty of maintaining the harbour works and waterway of the River Mersey in the interests of the public recovered damages for loss occasioned to a dredge owned by the trustees and engaged in operations on the river. These operations were, of course, a source of expense and not of profit, but it was held by the House of Lords that damages were recoverable for the loss of use of the dredge while it was being repaired. The principle so stated has been followed in other decisions of the House of Lords which are referred to by the learned judge. Of these, perhaps the one which more closely touches the present matter is Admiralty Commissioners v. S.S. Chekiang10. In that case the claim was for damages caused in a collision to H.M.S. Cairo, a light cruiser, the operation of which was a matter of public expense rather than of profit. In the House of Lords Lord Phillimore said in part (p. 650):\npublic bodies who are owners of ships employed in local public service may, when their vessels have been injured by collision, recover, among other sums, damages for their detention while under repair, although no gain which could be measured in money accrues to such bodies by the use of their ships or is lost by reason of their being put out of action.\nAs authority he referred to The Greta Holme, The Mediana11 and The Marpessa12.\nThe claim advanced on behalf of the Crown under this head was for $73,076.04, being for the deprivation of the use of the two bridges for a period of three and one half months amounting to $21,004.22 and for the loss of use of the north channel, estimated at 90 per cent. of its full use, since it could be used for vessels to tie up, and for the cost of providing the north span for eight and one half months. The basis upon which damages are to be assessed in such circumstances is not, in my opinion, entirely clear and the opinions expressed by the law Lords upon the subject have not always been in agreement. Clearly, one of the elements to be taken into account is that the Crown was deprived of its right to use these properties in which very large sums of public moneys had been invested for these extensive periods since no benefit accrued from the use of these moneys during these periods. In The Greta Holme, Lord Halsbury said that a public body had to pay money like other people for the conduct of its operations and if it is deprived of the use of part of its machinery, which deprivation delays or impairs the progress of its work, it was entitled to obtain damages in the same way as other people. Referring to the difficulty of assessing the damages, Lord Herschell said that as the trustees were deprived of the use of the dredger they had sacrified the interest on the money spent on its purchase and that a sum equivalent to that should at least be allowed.\nCameron J. was asked by both parties to consider the matter as a jury might do and, taking into account the whole of the evidence, he reached the conclusion that an award of $30,000 would be fair and reasonable. In my opinion, this finding should not be disturbed.\nBy way of defence the appellants pleaded that the bridge machinery and its control and signal system were in an unsafe and improper condition and that there had been a failure to properly inspect and maintain in good order and condition such machinery and the said system. The evidence dealing with this aspect of the matter was considered at length in the reasons delivered at the trial and I agree with the finding made that the defence failed to prove that there was any inadequacy or negligence in the maintenance of the bridge and its equipment.\nThe appellants dispute their liability for the wages of the regular bridge staff from April 30, 1952, until August 15, 1952, and for the cost of the relocation of the ferry berth which was previously located in the south channel. Upon the evidence I agree with the conclusion of the learned trial judge that these claims should be allowed for the reasons stated by him.\nThe judgment at the trial held that the appellant company was entitled to restrict its liability in the manner provided by ss. 649 and 651 of the Canada Shipping Act, 1934, c. 44. The respondent has cross-appealed against this finding on the ground that, as that statute does not specifically provide that those sections shall apply to Her Majesty, the sections do not apply. The learned trial judge rejected this contention and the judgment as against the company was restricted to $38.92 for each ton of the ship's tonnage. This reduced the damages found to have been sustained and awarded against the appellant LaBlanc of $367,823.49 to $184,383.50.\nThe Canada Shipping Act was enacted by Parliament in reliance upon the powers vested in it by head 10 of s. 91 of the British North America Act. It is not questioned that the sections referred to were within the powers of Parliament and restricted the liability of the owners of vessels for loss or damage occasioned by reason of the improper navigation of a ship owned by them where the event occasioning the loss occurs without their actual fault or privity. This was made applicable to the owners of all ships, except those belonging to His Majesty. This exception was provided by s. 712.\nThe purpose of s. 16 of the Interpretation Act to which I have referred above is, in my opinion, to prevent the infringement of prerogative rights of the Crown other than by express enactment in which the Sovereign is named. Section 712 of the Canada Shipping Act was held in the case of Nesbit Shipping Co. Ltd. v. The Queen13, to effectively prevent the exercise of the Royal prerogative. The effect of the sections of the Canada Shipping Act, however, are to declare and limit the extent of the liability of ship owners in accidents occurring without their own fault and privity. It cannot be said, in my opinion, that the Royal prerogative ever extended to imposing liability upon a subject to a greater extent than that declared by law by legislation lawfully enacted. The fact that liability may not be imposed upon the Crown, except by legislation in which the Sovereign is named, or that any of the other prerogative rights are not to be taken as extinguished unless the intention to do so is made manifest by naming the Crown, does not mean that the extent of the liability of a subject may be extended in a case of a claim by the Crown beyond the limit of the liability effectively declared by law. I am accordingly of the opinion that the learned trial judge was right in permitting the amount of recovery to be restricted in the manner above indicated. The respondent further asked to vary the judgment at the trial by awarding interest upon the damages from the date of the accident. No such claim was made in the information and the matter was accordingly not considered in the judgment delivered at the trial. This is a substantive claim which, if intended to be asserted, should have been pleaded.\nI would dismiss both the appeal and the cross-appeal with costs.\nAppeal allowed in part and cross-appeal dismissed with costs, Locke and Martland JJ. dissenting.\nSolicitors for the defendants, appellants: McMillan, Binch, Stuart, Berry, Dunn, Corrigan & Howland, Toronto.\nSolicitor for the plaintiff, respondent: W.

Consequently, subject to the question of whether they infringe upon the powers of Parliament in relation to trade and commerce (a question with which this Court was asked not to deal), subs. (a), (d), (e), (f), (h), (i), (j), (k), (l),(m), (o), (p), (q),and (t) of s. 41 of the Milk Industry Act, 1956 (B.C.), c. 28, authorizing the machinery for the carrying out in the Province of British Columbia of what is in essence such a pool, are intra vires. These subsections deal in matters of a merely local or private nature in the province and with property and civil rights therein. They do not authorize or impose any levy or tax.\nOrder No. 5 properly made under the Act, and which provides the machinery for the carrying out of the pool, is similarly valid, saving also any question of infringement upon the powers of Parliament under Head 2 of s. 91.\nLower Mainland Dairy Products v.

Is the Milk Industry Act, c. 28 of the Statutes of British Columbia 1956, in its pith and substance a statute to regulate the production, distribution and marketing of milk and manufactured products within British Columbia and within the competence of the Legislative Assembly of British Columbia to enact or is it in its pith and substance a taxing statute to impose indirect taxation and ultra vires of the said Legislative Assembly and if it is ultra vires in what particular or particulars and to what extent?\n2. Is Order No. 5 of the Milk Board under the said Act, dated the 18th day of January, 1957, intra vires of the said Milk Board and if not in what particular or particulars and to what extent?\nThe opinion of the Court as certified to the Lieutenant Governor in Council, reads:\n1. That the Milk Industry Act, being Chapter 28 of the Statutes of British Columbia, 1956, is in its pith and substance a statute to regulate the production, distribution and marketing of milk and manufactured milk products within British Columbia and is within the competence of the Legislative Assembly of British Columbia to enact.\n2. That, subject to the question of whether it infringes upon the legislative jurisdiction of the Parliament of Canada in relation to trade and commerce, Order No. 5 of the Milk Board under the said Act, dated the 18th day of January, 1957, is intra vires of the said Milk Board.\nDavey J.A. dissented as to Question 2, certifying his opinion as being that the said order is completely beyond the powers of the Milk Board because it is based upon indirect taxes to be collected from vendors in the form of adjustment levies.\nThe Milk Industry Act repealed, inter alia, the Milk Act, R.S.B.C. 1948, c. 208, and the Creameries and Dairies Regulation Act, R.S.B.C. 1948, c. 80. The statute contains 72 sections, almost all of which are designed to ensure that milk offered for sale in the Province shall be produced under sanitary conditions from cattle free from disease and that it be sold in the condition and in the manner best calculated to protect the public health. No one contends that these provisions are beyond the powers of the Province. The attack upon the statute is directed against part of one section alone, i.e. subss. (h) to (q) inclusive of s. 41, and the order made by the Milk Board purporting to act under the authority vested in it by these sub-sections.\nBy a commission issued under the provisions of the Public Inquiries Act, R.S.B.C. 1948, c. 162, the Honourable Mr. Justice Clyne was directed to inquire, inter alia, into any matters relating to the production, marketing and distribution of milk in the Province which, in his opinion, ought to be investigated in the public interest, and to make such recommendations as he might think proper. After a lengthy inquiry the commissioner made an exhaustive report in which the difficulties of the producers of milk in the lower mainland of British Columbia were reviewed and recommendations for legislation were made.\nThe preamble to the Milk Industry Act, which is to be deemed as part of the Act intended to assist in explaining its purport and object (the Interpretation Act, R.S.B.C. 1948, c. 1, s. 23(5)) reads in part:\nWHEREAS it has been made to appear to the Government of British Columbia that, as a result of instability in the production and marketing of milk in British Columbia and particularly on the Lower Mainland of the Province and on Vancouver Island, there has been uncertainty that producers of milk would receive a reasonable return therefor, and there have been lacking the incentives necessary to ensure to consumers continuity of supply of safe, clean milk in fluid form:\nAnd whereas it has appeared that, due to the lack of proper and adequate pricing and an unjust and discriminatory marketing system, unwarranted surpluses have been encouraged and improper trade practices have existed which threatened the whole price structure and endangered the continuity of a supply to consumers of safe, clean fluid milk as aforesaid.\nAfter referring to the inquiry conducted by Clyne J. and the fact that by his report certain findings and recommendations had been made to His Honour the Lieutenant Governor in Council, the preamble continues:\nAnd whereas the Legislative Assembly of British Columbia has considered the contents of the said report and is of the opinion:\n(a) That it is necessary to consolidate the present legislation dealing with milk and to enact further measures in relation thereto to safeguard the public health:\n(b) That all milk for human consumption in fluid form must, in respect of qualities of safety and cleanliness, meet a common standard:\n(c) That at the present time the total volume of such milk available for the fluid market greatly exceeds the demand therefor, but that in the foreseeable future, owing to increases in population and the limited area in which milk can be produced, the demand for such fluid milk may exceed the possible supply thereof:\n(d) That the price of milk of such standard for consumption on the fluid market in British Columbia is affected only by local supply and demand, whereas the price for milk for manufacturing purposes is fixed by world market conditions in respect of the manufactured product:\n(e) That, in order to ensure to the consuming public of British Columbia a continuity of supply of safe and clean fresh fluid milk meeting such standard, it is necessary that a premium be offered to producers thereof, but because of market conditions aforesaid the price which all producers shall receive for the total volume of such milk must be conditioned by the price paid for the surplus supply which is sold at the world market price, resulting in a return to the producers of a blended price for all milk produced by them.\n(f) That in this Province the history of production and distribution of milk for consumption in fluid form shows an inequality in bargaining strength as to price between producers and distributors, and that the fixing of prices to be paid to producers for such milk is therefore necessary:\n(g) That, for the foregoing reasons and for other reasons referred to in the said report, it is essential that prices which the producer shall receive for all milk which he has produced under conditions qualifying it for the fluid market be fixed at a level which will ensure an adequate but not an excessive supply of milk qualified for the fluid market.\nBy s. 2 \"qualifying milk\" is defined to mean milk which is produced on an approved fluid-milk dairy-farm or an approved raw-milk dairy-farm, certified as such, which meets such standards for such milk as may be prescribed by regulation made under the statute.\nPart III of the Act constitutes the Milk Board which is declared to be a body corporate and defines its functions.\nSection 41, so far as it need be considered, reads:\nFor the purpose of controlling and regulating under this Act the marketing of milk produced in British Columbia, the Board shall, so far as the legislative authority of the Province extends, have power to make orders in relation to the said marketing, and, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, shall have power to make orders:\n(a) Providing for the classifying of any or all persons engaged in the production, supplying, processing, distribution, or sale of milk within the Province, and providing for the licensing of persons in any or all of such classes and for the qualifications for such licences, and defining standards and grades in relation to the quality of any such milk:\n***\n(c) Prescribing the form of licences and the term of such licences, and the terms and conditions upon which the same shall be issued, renewed, suspended, or revoked:\n(d) Prohibiting any person from engaging in the production, supplying, processing, distribution, or sale of milk, or of any class or classes, grade or grades thereof, within the Province unless he is the holder of a current licence from the Board which has not been suspended or revoked:\n(e) Providing for classes of milk according to acceptability for utilization in each of such classes:\n(f) Prescribing the terms and times of payment for milk supplied to vendors by producers thereof:\n***\n(h) Fixing the minimum value at which vendors shall account to producers for milk which is sold on the fluid market, which value shall be set by formula as hereinafter provided: (i) Determining the minimum value at which vendors shall account to producers for milk used in manufactured milk products, which value shall be determined on the basis of current market yields:\n(j) Fixing the price which shall be paid to all producers for all milk marketed by them and qualifying for the fluid market, which price shall be a blended price, taking into account the quantity of milk which has been sold on the fluid market and the quantity of such milk surplus to fluid-milk requirements and which must be sold on the market for manufactured milk products and the values applicable to the said quantities respectively in accordance with clauses (h) and (i) hereof:\n(k) Apportioning the quantity of milk which has been sold as fluid milk among all producers qualifying for the fluid market and fixing the price for milk qualifying for the fluid market so that each producers of such qualifying milk receives:\n(i) The fluid-milk value as determined in clause (h) for that proportion of all milk qualifying for the fluid market marketed by him which is equal to the proportion that total fluid-milk sales is of the total quantity of milk which qualifies for the fluid market received by licensed vendors in each area of production; and\n(ii) The value as determined in clause (i) for the remainder of the milk marketed by him which qualifies for the fluid market;\nand providing for the distribution of the total proceeds of milk which qualifies for the fluid market accordingly:\n(l) Ordering that the proceeds of the total quantity of milk qualifying for the fluid market and produced by all producers in each area of production and sold on both the said markets shall be prorated among all such producers so that each producer shall receive his proportionate share of the total proceeds in accordance with the quantity of milk qualifying for the fluid market supplied by him:\n(m) Establishing and adopting a formula for the purpose of the fixing of values hereunder in each area of production or for the Province as a whole, which formula shall take into account relevant economic factors, including changes in the general price level, changes in the price of any or all factors of production, and the quantity of milk which is sold on the fluid market in relation to the total quantity of milk which qualifies for the fluid market. The said formula shall be such as to provide a reasonable premium for the production of milk for the fluid market to ensure an adequate but not an excessive supply of milk which qualifies for such market:\n***\n(o) Directing that accounts be given by vendors to producers of the milk received by such vendors from such producers, which accounts shall contain particulars of the quantity of milk received, the total value thereof, and the amount due to each such producer at the values and prices from time to time fixed and determined by the Board, and the basis (as to butter-fat content or on other basis) on which such values and prices have been fixed and determined:\n(p) Directing the payment of the amounts due by vendors to producers in accordance with the said accounts:\n(q) From time to time designating the vendor to whom or through whom a producer shall market his milk, and requiring every such vendor to accept milk from such producers as the Board may determine:\n***\n(t) Establishing or designating an agency to or through which all fluid milk shall or may be delivered or sold:\nIt was under the powers assumed to have been vested in the Milk Board that Order No. 5, the validity of which is questioned, was made.\nThe term \"producer\" is defined in s. 2 of the Act as meaning any dairy farmer who produces milk for human consumption and the term \"vendor\" as meaning, inter alia, any person dealing in milk, whether by purchase or sale or on the basis of delivery on consignment for sale, but not a producer as such. Section 3 of Order 5 provides for the issue of licences to vendors and producers, and by s. 4 no person shall act in either capacity unless he is in possession of a current licence. The fee for such licence is $1.\nSection 15 requires that qualifying milk shall be classified at the premises of the vendor where it is received from the producer on the basis of utilization as follows:\n(a)Class I milk shall be all qualifying milk to be utilized by a vendor for sale in fresh fluid form to:\n(i) Wholesale or retail customers in any part of the Province:\n(ii) Other vendors in any part of the Province:\n(b) Class II milk shall be all qualifying milk sold in the Province to a vendor and surplus to his fluid requirements and utilized in the Province for the manufacture of canned evaporated milk or for the manufacture of concentrated fresh fluid milk:\n(c) Class III milk shall be all qualifying milk sold in the Province to a vendor and surplus to his fluid requirements and utilized in the Province for any purpose other than those set forth in subsections (a) and (b) of this section.\nSection 16 declares the manner in which the minimum value of the various classes of milk, as defined in the order, is to be determined. To the figures which result there may be additions or substractions, dependent on the butter fat content as provided by s. 17. It is the resulting figures which are used for the purpose of the computations directed in the two succeeding sections of the Order.\nSection 18 provides the manner in which the total value of qualifying milk received during any month at each plant by each vendor shall be computed, and s. 19 the manner in which the \"producer price\" per hundred weight for qualifying milk shall be determined. It is unnecessary for the purpose of this opinion to state in more exact detail the manner in which this value is determined.\nSection 24, which contains the provision for what is referred to by the appellants as a levy or tax, reads as follows:\nFor the purposes of milk regulation contemplated by the Act:\n(a) Each producer shall market his qualifying milk in each class in the same proportion that the total sales by all vendors of qualifying milk in each class bears to the total volume of qualifying milk received by them from all producers in each area of production. For the purpose of avoiding the unnecessary cost to vendors, producers, or consumers resulting from the movement of qualifying milk pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this section, and in lieu of requiring vendors to transfer to other vendors such quantity of qualifying milk in any class received by them from their producers as will ensure that each vendor shall market the same proportion of the volume of each class of qualifying milk, the producer price resulting from the computations mentioned in sections 19, 20, 22, 23 and 25 hereof is fixed as one price for qualifying milk so that each vendor will pay to each producer the same price for qualifying milk:\n(b) As in complying with the order for payment of the said price some vendors may be required to pay to producers more and other vendors may be required to pay to producers less than the total value of the volume of qualifying milk received by them as computed in section 18 hereof:\n(i) On or before the fifteenth day after the end of the month during which the milk was received, every vendor shall pay to the Board the amount by which the value of milk received by him as calculated under section 18 hereof is greater than the amount which he must pay to producers in complying with sections 19, 20, 22, 23, and 25 hereof:\n(ii) On or before the seventeenth day after the end of the month during which the milk was received, the Board shall pay to every vendor the amount by which the value of milk received by him as calculated under section 18 hereof is less than the amount which he must pay to producers in complying with sections 19, 20, 22, 23 and 25 hereof. Section 25 (a), so far as it need be considered, reads:\nOn or before the nineteenth day after the end of each month each vendor shall make payment to each producer for qualifying milk received at the plant of such vendor from such producer during the previous month:\n(i) Where the provisions of section 22 have not become applicable, at not less than the price for all qualifying milk adjusted for butter-fat differential as provided in section 20 hereof:\nSection 22 relates to the payment where quotas have been established and we were informed that none such have been established by the Board.\nSection 29 provides that the Board shall announce monthly the minimum accounting value determined for each month for each of the three classes of milk delivered by producers during the preceding month.\nIt will be seen from the foregoing that, so far as the producers (other than producer-vendors) are concerned, the milk is sold to the vendors at a price to be determined in the following month. The vendors are required to report monthly to the Milk Board showing the amount of qualifying milk purchased during the month and the extent to which it has been sold as Class I, Class II or Class III milk, as defined by s. 15.\nWith this information from all of the vendors, including presumably producer-vendors, the Board, in accordance with the formula stated in the Order, determines the value of the milk sold in each of the three classes. The value of the milk sold in the fluid market is placed at a higher figure than that sold for manufacturing purposes which is said to provide the incentive for continued production of qualifying milk. The vendor realizes his profit in handling such milk from the amount added by him to the amount for which he is liable to the Board. While the value placed upon milk sold for consumption in fluid form is an arbitrary figure when computed in accordance with the formula, the value of Class II and Class III milk can be more closely determined from the prices ruling in the manufacturing market during the month in question.\nHaving arrived at the total of the values of all qualifying milk in the manner directed by s. 18 of Order No. 5, the producer price is determined in the manner prescribed by s. 19. It is upon the footing that the respective rights and obligations of the parties are to be those defined in the Order that the parties contract. As between the producer and the vendor, the obligation of the latter is twofold, he must account for the full determined value of all the milk he has received and he must pay to the producer the blended producer price. In order that this may be done in the case of all the producers, the vendor is obligated to pay to the Board any amount by which the value of the milk purchased by him, determined in the prescribed manner, exceeds the amount to be paid for it at the blended price, computed as aforesaid, on the assumption that all vendors discharge this obligation. The amount paid to the Board in these circumstances is in satisfaction of a contractual obligation. It is in no sense a levy.\nSome illustrations of the manner in which these adjustments as between the Board and the vendors are made are to be found in the reasons for judgment of Davey J.A. As between the Board and the vendors the payments are made to and by the Board which accounts to the producers on behalf of what is in essence a pool operated on behalf of all the producers in the production area who have been supplied qualifying milk during the period.\nThe attack upon s. 41 and Order 5 is based upon the judgment of the Judicial Committee in Lower Mainland Dairy Products v. Crystal Dairy Ltd.[2]. Due to the fact that the production of milk in what is now defined by s. 40 of the Act as the Vancouver area of production has been for a very long time in excess of the demand for fluid milk, various attempts have been made by legislation to provide a means whereby the benefit of the available high price on the fluid market should be shared by all of the producers. In the Crystal Dairy case, the legislature had passed the Dairy Products Sales Adjustment Act, 1929, which authorized the appointment of a committee which would be empowered to require the producers to make returns to it of the milk sold by them, and those selling fluid milk were required to pay a levy assessed according to the quantity sold. The total of these levies was to be apportioned by the committee among the farmers who had sold milk to be used for manufacturing purposes at lower prices. The committee was further authorized to make a levy upon the producers to pay its expenses. It was held that both levies were taxes and it was held that, as they would tend to affect the price of commodities, they were indirect taxes and the Act was ultra vires the Province.\nIn a later case decided in this Court: Lower Mainland Dairy Products Board v. Turner's Dairy Ltd.[3], orders made by a marketing board established under the Natural Products Marketing (B.C.) Act, R.S.B.C. 1936, c. 165, which required the producers in the area to sell their milk to a company incorporated at the instance of the Board at prices fixed by it and directed that the proceeds of the resale of the milk should be divided pro rata among all of the producers, were held to be invalid as being merely a colourable attempt to impose indirect taxes upon those producers whose milk might otherwise be disposed of as fluid milk at prices in excess of what they would receive under the orders of the Board. It had been held at the trial that the real purpose of the impugned orders was to take from the producer supplying the fluid market a portion of his real returns and to contribute the same to other producers and that the sales and resales directed by the order were mere shams, and these findings were upheld in this Court.\nIn my view, neither of these cases affect the issue to be decided in the present matter. Apart from any objection that might be made to the legislation and the Order on the ground that, to the extent that they may trespass upon the powers of Parliament in relation to the regulation of trade and commerce under Head 2 of s. 91 of the British North America Act, they are ultra vires (and we are asked not to deal with this point), the parts of s. 41 which are questioned and the Order both deal, in my opinion, with matters of a merely local or private nature in the province within Head 16 of s. 92 and with property and civil rights in the province within Head 13.\nIn my opinion, in dealing with the sale of milk for consumption within the Province, the Legislature might provide for the operation of a pool by a designated body to which all milk produced should be delivered and by which it would be sold and the net proceeds, after deduction of the operating expenses, divided among the producers of milk of equal quality in the proportion that the quantities delivered by each bears to the total quantity sold. I consider that s. 41 of the Act authorizes, and Order No. 5 provides, the machinery for the carrying out of what is in essence such a pool but operated in a manner which effects, for the benefit of the producers and consumers, a large saving of expense by avoiding to a large extent the cost which would be incurred in delivering milk from the eastern and southern portion of the production area to the large market for fluid milk in the cities of Vancouver and New Westminster. The practical effect of the legislation is that each producer receives his proportionate share of the higher value of milk on the fluid market, which is paid to him in the blended price that he receives from the vendor. It is true that he does not receive the full amount realized on the fluid milk market, as he would if the milk was sold on behalf of the pool to which he delivers his milk, since by the method followed the price paid by the vendors must, of necessity, enable them to sell milk on the fluid market at a profit. The fact that the Legislature considers that this method is preferable in the interests of the milk industry as a whole cannot have any bearing upon the validity of the legislation.\nI agree with the argument advanced by counsel for the Attorney-General of British Columbia that the legislation and the Order do not authorize or impose any levy or tax. In so far as the producer is concerned, the legislation authorizes the Board to fix the price which the vendor is to pay to him from month to month, this being the blended price referred to in the preamble, and the accounting value mentioned in the Order which is the value mentioned in paras. (h), (i) and (j) of s. 41.\nIn so far as the vendors are concerned, the contention that the amounts they may be required to pay to the Milk Board under the provisions of para. (b) of s. 24 of Order No. 5 is a levy or tax appears to me to be based upon a misapprehension of the real nature of the transaction between the producers and the vendors.\nAs appears from the reasons for judgment of the Chief Justice and of Sidney Smith and Coady JJ.A., it was contended in the Court of Appeal that subss. (h) to (q), inclusive, of s. 41, and Order No. 5, as they apply to producer-vendors, are ultra vires. A producer-vendor is defined in s. 2 of the Act as being any person who distributes milk produced only by his own cattle.\nSection 44, so far as it need be considered, reads:\nIn the application of the provisions of this Act, a producer-vendor shall be entitled to all the rights and privileges and be subject to all the duties and obligations given to and imposed on a producer and on a vendor.\nOrder No. 5, s. 3, provides for the licensing of vendors and of producers, but not of producer-vendors as such. They are not mentioned elsewhere in the Order and, if there is some other order of the Milk Board regulating the manner in which such dealers shall operate, it is not before us.\nAs producers they are required by s. 24(a) of Order No. 5 to market their qualifying milk in each of the three classes defined by s. 15 in the proportions stated. In the factum filed on behalf of the appellant Hay Bros. Farms Ltd. in this Court, it is stated that the whole of the production of a producer-vendor is sold in the fluid market. As to do this would, upon the material before us, render the dealer liable to the heavy penalties prescribed by s. 63 of the Act and to a suspension of his licence under s. 13 of Order No. 5, it is apparent that in some manner such dealers are relieved of the obligation of complying with s. 24(a). We are not informed as to how this has been done.\nThe language of s. 44 of the Act must be construed as imposing upon a producer-vendor such of the obligations of a vendor as are by their nature applicable. The relation between a producer and a vendor, such as above referred to, is that of vendor and purchaser and the obligation imposed by s. 24 rests upon a vendor qua purchaser. Since one cannot contract with one self, this portion of the Order cannot refer to a producer-vendor.\nWhether there is anything done by the Board in its dealings with producer-vendors which may be objectionable as beyond its powers cannot be determined upon the material before us.\nA further contention made on behalf of the appellants is that Order No. 5 goes beyond the powers vested in the Milk Board by s. 41. In my opinion, ample powers are given to the Board by the subsections of s. 41 which are above quoted to make the said order. While the form in which Question 1 is stated asks the opinion of the Court as to the constitutional validity of the Milk Industry Act as a whole, the answer made should be restricted, in my opinion, to that portion of the Act which it is contended is ultra vires and as to which we have heard argument. Whether or not any of the other 71 sections of the Act deal with matters beyond the powers of the Province is a matter which I consider, should not be determined without argument.\nI would, accordingly, substitute for the answer made by the Court of Appeal to the first question the following:\nSubject to the question of whether they infringe upon the legislative jurisdiction of the Parliament of Canada in relation to trade and commerce, subsections (a), (d), (e), (f), (h), (i), (k), (l), (m), (o), (p), (q) and (t) of s. 41 of the Milk Industry Act are intra vires the Legislature of British Columbia.\nI agree with the answer made by the majority of the Court of Appeal to the second question.\nSubject to the qualification to the answer to Question 1 as above mentioned, I would dismiss this appeal.\nAppeal dismissed, with qualification.\nSolicitors for the appellants, William Crawford and Hillside Farm Dairy Ltd.: Boughton, Anderson, McConnell & Dunfee, Vancouver.\nSolicitors for the appellant, Hay Bros.

Eakins Construction Ltd., [1960] S.C.R. 361\nDate: 1960-02-22\nPeter Kiewit Sons' Company of Canada Limited and Raymond International Company Limited, Carrying on Business Under The Firm Name and Style of Kiewit-Raymond (Defendant) Appellant;\nand\nEakins Construction Limited (Plaintiff) Respondent.\n1959: May 12, 13; 1960: February 22.\nPresent: Locke, Cartwright, Abbott, Martland and Judson JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR BRITISH COLUMBIA\nContracts\u2014Sub-contractor\u2014Action for breach of contract\u2014Whether item of work covered by contract\u2014Whether change in plans\u2014Whether contract substituted by new and different one\u2014Work done under protest\u2014Whether only price of contract recoverable\u2014Quantum meruit\u2014Whether quasi\u2014contractual recovery\u2014Whether frustration.\nThe plaintiff, who took a sub-contract from the main contractor, the defendant, for a pile driving job, protested that he was being asked to do more than the sub-contract called for. The engineer, who had clearly defined duties under the main contract, insisted that the work was according to the sub-contract and no more. The main contractor told the plaintiff that it would have to follow the orders of the engineer and made no promise of additional remuneration. The plaintiff completed the work under protest, and sued for damages for breach of contract and, in the alternative, for compensation on a quantum meruit basis. The trial judge dismissed the action, but this judgment was reversed by the Court of Appeal. The main contractor appealed to this Court.\nHeld (Cartwright J. dissenting): The appeal should be allowed and the action dismissed.\nPer Locke, Abbott, Martland and Judson JJ.: Having elected to do the work in these circumstances, the plaintiff could only recover under the contract. The contract could not have been abrogated and another substituted, since there was no consent, express or implied. When the positions of the parties became clear before any work was done, the proper remedy of the plaintiff was to refuse to go on except on its own interpretation of the contract and, if this was rejected, to elect to treat the contract as repudiated and to sue for damages. In the absence of a clause providing that the matter could be left in abeyance for later determination, the plaintiff could not go on with performance according to the main contractor's interpretation and then impose liability on a different contract.\nThe facts of this case did not justify an inference of frustration so as to remove the original contract and substitute an implied contract. A dispute over a question whether a certain item of work is an extra could not bring about frustration of a contract when the question of extras is covered by the contract. There is no room for the application of any theory of quasi-contractual recovery by way of implied contract or by the imposition of an obligation ex aequo et bono, when the parties, as in this case, have made an express contract covering the very facts in litigation and that contract remains open and unrescinded.\nPer Cartwright J., dissenting: When the main contractor, knowing that the plaintiff was taking the position that it was being called on to do work outside the contract and would expect and demand to be paid for it, persisted, in circumstances of practical compulsion, in ordering that work to be done, the law imposed upon it the obligation to pay the fair value of the work performed, the benefits of which it had received. It was no answer to say that the plaintiff should have had the courage of its convictions and refused to perform any work beyond that which was required by the sub-contract. It must be remembered that that contract was difficult to construe. There is no difference in principle between compelling a man to pay money which he is not legally bound to pay and compelling him to do work which he is not legally bound to do.\nPractice\u2014Costs\u2014Success\u2014against one of two defendants\u2014Whether power to make \"Bullock order\" under British Columbia Rules.\nPer Cartwright J.: In an action taken against two defendants and where success is obtained against one of them, the Court of Appeal for British Columbia has jurisdiction to order that the costs payable by the plaintiff to the successful defendant be recovered by the plaintiff from the unsuccessful defendant. The operation of that rule is not limited to cases in which the issues raised are equitable. In the circumstances of this case, the order of this sort made by the Court of Appeal was a proper one.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia, reversing in part a judgment of Maclean J. Appeal allowed, Cartwright J. dissenting.\nJ. S. Maguire and R. C. Bray, for the defendant, appellant.\nW. Kirke Smith, for the plaintiff, respondent.\nThe judgment of Locke, Abbott, Martland and Judson JJ. was delivered by\nJUDSON J.:\u2014The appellant, on January 9, 1956, entered into a contract with the British Columbia Toll Highways & Bridges Authority, a government corporation, to build the substructure, approach viaduct and northern approach road to the Second Narrows Bridge across Vancouver Harbour for the sum of $4,314,369.70. The respondent took a sub-contract from the appellant to supply and drive the timber piles for the substructure of pier 1 and piers 7 to 14 at stated unit prices, which amounted to a total of $132,350. The respondent sued the Bridge Authority and the main contractor, the appellant, for damages for breach of contract or, in the alternative, for compensation on a quantum meruit. The learned trial judge dismissed the action against both defendants. On appeal the dismissal against the Bridge Authority was sustained but the appeal was allowed against the main contractor and the case remitted to the trial court for an assessment of the work done on piers 10 to 14 to be paid for on a quantum meruit basis. The main contractor now appeals to this Court and asks for the restoration of the judgment given at the trial. The respondent does not cross-appeal against the judgment of the Court of Appeal affirming the dismissal of the action against the Bridge Authority. The dispute here, therefore, is entirely between the main contractor, as appellant, and the subcontractor, as respondent.\nBefore making its tender, the sub-contractor, Eakins Construction Limited, had before it the plans and specifications and the principal contract. The plans required the piles to be driven to a safe bearing capacity of 20 tons. The specifications required them to be driven to a minimum bearing capacity of 20 tons based on a certain formula. The pile driving contract was made on January 10, 1956, but some time in February, the engineer amended the plans by adding a requirement relating to piers 10 to 14 as follows: \"Bottom of timber piles to be below bottom of sheet piling.\" T. K. Eakins, the managing director of the pile driving company, noticed the change at once. Beyond mentioning it to an official of the Kiewit Company, he did nothing. This was long before he began to work on the piers affected by the change and probably before any work was done on piers 7, 8, 9, which were not affected by the change. The work on these three piers was abandoned and settled for in March 1956 because the ground was too hard for the driving of wooden piles. Timber piling also proved to be impractical on pier 1. Steel piling was substituted at this pier. Kiewit did this work itself, Eakins having declined to tender for steel piling except on a cost plus basis. This leaves only the work on piers 10 to 14 at issue in this litigation.\nEakins began to work on pier 10, still without having made any protest about the change in the plans. At this pier wooden pile driving was also unsuccessful. After 22 piles had been driven, the engineer ordered them to be cut off and covered with gravel so that they would not become weight bearing. This work has not been paid for. Eakins submitted an account for this work which Kiewit refused to accept and offered a lesser amount. Eakins is entitled to payment for this work according to the terms of the contract. According to my judgment, this is all that Eakins is entitled to and if the parties cannot agree there will have to be a reference back to ascertain this amount. Clauses 7 and 9 of the contract cover this situation.\nEakins made its first protest that the amended plans provided for pile driving outside the terms of its contract just before it began to work on pier 11. The engineer insisted that the piles had to be driven as he required in accordance with the amended plans and Eakins proceeded with the work. There is no doubt that from this time on Eakins continued to protest that it was being required to do more work than its contract called for and it is equally clear that the engineer insisted that his instructions be followed and that Eakins was entitled to no extra payment for what it chose to call \"overdriving\". The position taken by the disputants could not have been more clearly defined, the sub-contractor saying that it was working beyond its sub-contract and the engineer saying that it was not and threatening to put it off the job if it did not follow instructions.\nNot until September 1956 did Eakins make any complaint in writing to Kiewit. When this brought no reply, Eakins wrote to the engineers, Messrs. Swan & Wooster, the employers of Stanwick, the resident engineer with whom Eakins had been having its controversy. This firm wrote to Kiewit saying that it realized that driving conditions had been difficult, but not entirely unexpected and that they did not \"altogether agree that measures taken to obtain the desired results have been deviations from the contract.\" There is ample evidence of these difficulties but there is also evidence that not all of them arose from natural conditions. I am in agreement with the learned trial judge that some of them at least were the result of inefficient operation and inadequate judgment.\nOn January 29, 1957, a meeting was held at which Eakins, the engineers and Kiewit were represented. Everybody seems to have expressed sympathy for the Eakins company, which was close to being forced to abandon the contract owing to the pressing claims of creditors, but no one made any binding promise to pay anything extra. After this meeting, Eakins made a further complaint to the Bridge Authority on February 6 but did continue with the work which was completed on March 6, 1957.\nThe learned trial judge held that the sub-contractor was bound by all the terms of the main contract and that the addendum of which Eakins made so much was not a change in the plans at all but was added by way of clarification and for the information of the men in the field. After a careful analysis of the contract he came to the conclusion that this was within the engineer's defined powers. His conclusion, therefore, was that all the work was within the contract and that the claim for damages or compensation on a quantum meruit failed. On the other hand, the Court of Appeal took the directly opposite view that the obligation of the Eakins Company was defined by its sub-contract, that the addendum was not a term of the sub-contract and that in any event those clauses of the main contract which were appealed to as authorizing the addendum, did not in fact authorize it. Since Kiewit knew that Eakins expected to be paid for the work done in compliance with the engineer's orders and which it claimed to be outside the contract and since Kiewit's officer had told Eakins that it would have to comply with the engineer's orders, the Court of Appeal held that Eakins was entitled to compensation for the whole job, not merely for the extra work, on a quantum meruit. The basis for this is that Eakins had not been working to the sub-contract at all but that the parties by their conduct and dealings had substituted for the original sub-contract a new and different contract with more onerous obligations on Eakins.\nHad it been necessary to choose between these two views of the legal relations between the parties, I would have preferred the view of the learned trial judge that the Eakins company was performing no more than its contractual duty. But quite apart from this, it is to me an impossible inference in this case that the parties agreed to substitute a new contract for the original one. From the very beginning, the Eakins company knew of this added term. It began to protest late in the day that the term imposed added obligations. The engineer, who had clearly defined duties under the main contract, denied any such interpretation. Nothing could be clearer. One party says that it is being told to do more than the contract calls for. The engineer insists that the work is according to contract and no more, and that what is asserted to be extra work is not extra work and will not be paid for. The main contractor tells the sub-contractor that it will have to follow the orders of the engineer and makes no promise of additional remuneration. In these circumstances the subcontractor continues with the work. It must be working under the contract. How can this contract be abrogated and another substituted in its place? Such a procedure must depend upon consent, express or implied, and such consent is entirely lacking in this case. Whatever Eakins recovers in this case is under the terms of the original sub-contract and the provisions of the main contract relating to extras. The engineer expressly refused to order as an extra what has been referred to throughout this case as \"overdriving\". The work was not done as an extra and there can be no recovery for it on that basis. When this position became clear, and it became clear before any work was done, the remedy of the Eakins company was to refuse further performance except on its own interpretation of the contract and, if this performance was rejected, to elect to treat the contract as repudiated and to sue for damages. In the absence of a clause in the contract enabling it to leave the matter in abeyance for later determination, it cannot go on with performance of the contract according to the other party's interpretation and then impose a liability on a different contract. Having elected to perform in these circumstances, its recovery for this performance must be in accordance with the terms of the contract.\nWith this view of the relations among the parties, my conclusion is that there was error in the judgment of the Court of Appeal in permitting recovery on a new contract which it found as a fact to exist between the sub-contractor and the main contractor but not between the sub-contractor and the Bridge Authority. The basis of such recovery is obviously purely contractual in character and the principle is simply stated in Winfield on the Law of Quasi Contracts, p. 52:\nAnother application of quantum meruit is as a mode of redress on a new contract which has replaced an earlier one. The position is that the parties (or one of them) have not observed the terms of the earlier contract, but it can be implied from their conduct that they have substituted another contract for the first. If they do so, and one of the parties does not fulfil his side of the second contract, the other can sue quantum meruit upon it for what he has done. The obligation sued upon is genuinely contractual, not quasi-contractual.\nUp to this point, there is no suggestion in the reasons of the Court of Appeal that the legal fiction of an implied contract is being applied to enable the plaintiff to recover on a quasi-contractual basis. The suggestion of quasi-contractual recovery does, however, appear in the reasons of the learned Chief Justice, the doctrine of frustration being invoked to get rid of the original contract:\nThe evidence is clear that what the appellant (i.e. Eakins Construction Limited) contracted to do and what it actually did while at all times taking the position that the work done was not within the scope of its contract, was so different from that contemplated that in my view the sub-contract ceased to be applicable and the work done by the appellant should be paid for as though no contract had been made, on a quantum meruit.\nHow can it be found that the contract ceased to be applicable? It did not cease to be applicable by consent of the parties and the case is not one where some supervening event or fundamental change in circumstances rendered further performance impossible or radically different from the contractual obligation. How can a dispute over a question whether a certain item of work is an extra bring about frustration of the whole contract when the question of extras is covered in elaborate detail by the contract itself? The principle to be applied is not in doubt. It was examined again as recently as 1956 in Davis Contractors Ltd v. Fareham Urban District Council[1], where Bush v. Whitehaven Port and Town Trustees (1888), Hudson on Building Contracts, 4th ed., vol. 2, p. 122, a case often appealed to in this type of dispute, was finally overruled. I take the statement of the principle from p. 729 of the Fareham case:\nFrustration occurs whenever the law recognizes that without default of either party a contractual obligation has become incapable of being performed because the circumstances in which performance is called for would render it a thing radically different from that which was undertaken by the contract. Non haec in foedera veni. It was not this that I promised to do.\n***\nIt is not hardship or inconvenience or material loss itself which calls the principle of frustration into play. There must be as well such a change in the significance of the obligation that the thing undertaken would, if performed, be a different thing from that contracted for.\nOn any view of the facts of this case, there cannot be frustration. The performance of extra work will not justify it, even if such work was done. Extra work of the kind said to have been performed in this case is a contingency covered by the express contract and does not afford a ground for its dissolution. If there was to be extra pile driving, the character and extent of the obligation to pay were fully covered in the contract. Even on the plaintiff's own view of the case, its performance was not radically different from that called for by the contract. The facts of the case do not justify an inference of frustration. There is, therefore, no room for the application of any theory of quasi-contractual recovery whether by way of the legal fiction of an implied contract or the decision of the Court in the particular case to impose an obligation ex aequo et bono. The facts upon which such a theory of recovery can be based do not exist in this case, where the parties have made an express contract covering the very facts in litigation and that contract still remains open and unrescinded. Their relations on matters covered by the contract are governed by it and the Court has no power to substitute another form of obligation. This truism is stated in American Law Institute's volume on Restitution, Quasi-Contracts and Constructive Trusts, c. 4, s. 107, in the following terms:\n(1) A person of full capacity who, pursuant to a contract with another, has performed services or transferred property to the other or otherwise has conferred a benefit upon him, is not entitled to compensation therefor other than in accordance with the terms of such bargain, unless the transaction is rescinded for fraud, mistake, duress, undue influence or illegality, or unless the other has failed to perform his part of the bargain.\nSince the work done, if not covered by the sub-contract, was an extra which the engineer might have allowed under the terms of the main contract imported into the subcontract, it was for Eakins to show that the sub-contract had been terminated, either by its repudiation by the contractor and an election to treat the contract as at an end or that it had been abandoned or terminated by agreement between the parties. It is perfectly clear that throughout the performance Kiewit insisted that Eakins was obligated to do the work to the satisfaction of the engineer under the terms of the main contract which, it was contended, were imported into the sub-contract. It is equally clear that Eakins at no time treated the sub-contract as being at an end, simply insisting that it did not cover the additional work.\nIf Eakins had asked the engineer for a written order for the performance of the work which it claimed to be beyond the sub-contract and that had been refused and Kiewit had persisted in its attitude, Eakins might then have treated the contract as repudiated and sued for damages. Having failed to do this, and with the contract still open and unrescinded, it is my conclusion that any claim based upon any theory of quasi-contractual recovery is excluded.\nI can find nothing in the terms of the contract under litigation nor in the events that occurred which could lead to the dissolution of this contract at any stage of its performance. I agree with the learned trial judge and I would allow the appeal with costs. The judgment at trial should be restored subject to a reference to ascertain, in accordance with the contract, the amount to be paid for the 22 piles cut off at pier 10.\nCARTWRIGHT J.(dissenting):\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia, allowing in part an appeal from a judgment of Maclean J..\nThe facts and the terms of the relevant documents are fully stated in the judgments in the Courts below but it is necessary to set them out in some detail in order to make clear the questions raised for decision.\nOn January 9, 1956, the appellant entered into an agreement, hereinafter referred to as \"the principal contract\", with the British Columbia Toll Highways and Bridges Authority, hereinafter referred to as \"the Authority\", to build the sub-structure, approach viaduct and northern approach road for the Second Narrows Bridge across Vancouver Harbour for the sum of $4,314,369.70.\nOn January 10, 1956, an agreement in writing, hereinafter referred to as \"the sub-contract\" was entered into between the appellant and the respondent. It was prepared by the appellant and is in the form of an order addressed by the appellant to the respondent and accepted by the latter. Attached to it is a letter of the same date addressed by the respondent to the appellant quoting its prices for piling and the amount per pile it proposed to charge for driving and cutting off the piles.\nThe sub-contract provides, inter alia:\nYou are to furnish, drive, cut off and treat all the timber piles at the Second Narrows Bridge for us at such unit prices shown on your attached proposal dated January 10th, 1956.\nFor the purposes of this Agreement, the Contractor is Kiewit Raymond, 1104 Hornby Street, Vancouver, B.C. and the Subcontractor is Eakins Construction Company Limited, 900 Pacific Street, Vancouver 1, B.C. This document will serve as our Subcontract to you for the above mentioned services. You are to furnish these services as requisitioned by our Project Manager, Mr. Judson Howell, or his representative.\nIt is understood that all of the specifications of the Authority under which we are bound, apply equally to you as a Material Supplier. This involves not only the plans and specifications, but the contract terms regarding responsibility and insurance.\n***\nKindly acknowledge receipt of this order and Subcontract and your acceptance of its terms and conditions as promptly as possible.\nThe sub-contract was for the supply, driving and cutting off of the timber piles for piers numbers 1, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13 and 14.\nWe are now concerned only with the question of the compensation, if any, due to the respondent for work done on piers 10, 11, 12, 13 and 14. The order for the supply and driving of timber piles on pier 1 was cancelled before anything had been done by the respondent. The driving of timber piles on piers 7, 8 and 9 was abandoned after a certain amount of work had been done but in regard to what was done on those piers there has been an accord and satisfaction. There is no cross-appeal from the judgments below holding that the respondent is not entitled to any further payment in respect of piers 1, 7, 8 and 9.\nPrior to the signing of the sub-contract, the managing director of the respondent had in his possession a copy of the principal contract and the plans referred to in the specifications. The provision in the specifications as to the driving of timber bearing piles is as follows:\nPiles shall be driven truly vertical and to the lines and levels shown on the plans. Piles shall be driven with standard equipment, steam or drop hammers, approved by the engineer, to a minimum bearing capacity of 20 tons based on the following formulae:\u2014\nP=2\nWH\/S+1\nif drop hammer is used\nP=2\nWH\/S+0.1\nIf steam hammer is used.\nButt edges of piles shall be chamfered before driving so that the hammer will strike the heartwood in the centre of the pile and the tops of the piles shall be protected by use of a steel mat to prevent splitting of the pile during driving.\nThe plans referred to in the specifications contained the following note:\n6. All timber bearing piles to be driven to a safe bearing capacity of 20 tons. Shortly after the signing of the sub-contract the respondent returned the copy of the principal contract, specifications and plans. Just before commencing work, towards the end of February 1956, the respondent was furnished with another copy of the principal contract, specifications and plans and its managing director observed that a note had been added to the plans reading as follows:\n10. Bottom of timber bearing piles to be below bottom of sheet piling.\nThis note was added by the engineer of the Authority at some date after the signing of the sub-contract. No addition to, or amendment of, the sub-contract was made to deal with the effect of this addition to the principal contract. The only piers in respect of which sheet piling was specified were numbers 10, 11, 12, 13 and 14.\nThe dispute between the parties arose out of the fact that the resident engineer of the Authority required the respondent to drive the timber bearing piles on piers 10 to 14 inclusive to a much greater depth than was necessary to achieve the safe bearing capacity of 20 tons provided in the specifications and in the note on the plans quoted above, which the respondent had before it when it entered into the sub-contract.\nIt is clear from the evidence; (i) that compliance with the demands of the resident engineer resulted in the respondent \"over-driving\" many of the piles at a cost greatly in excess of what would have been the cost of driving them to the specified safe bearing capacity of 20 tons; (ii) that the respondent repeatedly asserted both to Howell, the responsible officer of the appellant, and to Stanwick, the resident engineer in charge of the work for the Authority, that it was being called upon to do and was doing work which it was not obligated to do under its contract, was being put to heavy additional expense and would expect to be paid for that work; (iii) that the engineer maintained throughout that the respondent was bound to do any overdriving he directed and that the Authority was not obligated to make any payment therefor; (iv) that the appellant told the respondent that the respondent must comply with the orders of the engineer. After the respondent had completed the work on piers 10 to 14 inclusive, to the satisfaction of the engineer including all the over-driving ordered by the latter, it made efforts to obtain payment from either the Authority or the appellant; but the Authority would pay nothing and the appellant was not willing to pay anything to the respondent over and above the unit prices specified in the sub-contract.\nThe respondent brought action against both the Authority and the appellant claiming in effect that it had been required to do work so far beyond the scope of its subcontract that that contract should be regarded as having been cancelled by the defendants and they should be ordered to pay to the plaintiff the value of the materials furnished and the work performed by the respondent on an implied contract to pay, on a quantum meruit, the value of what it had done at their request.\nThe learned trial judge dismissed the action as against both defendants. On appeal to the Court of Appeal the judgment of the learned trial judge in so far as it dismissed the action against the Authority was affirmed; no appeal has been taken to this Court from that affirmation and consequently we are concerned only with the respondent's claim against the appellant.\nThe Court of Appeal allowed the respondent's appeal from the dismissal of its action against the appellant. The formal judgment of the Court of Appeal provides in part as follows:\nAND THIS COURT DOTH FURTHER ORDER AND DECLARE\nthat the Appellant is entitled to compensation on a quantum meruit basis from the Respondents Peter Kiewit Sons Company of Canada Limited and Raymond International Company Ltd. for work done and materials supplied on Piers 10, 11, 12, 13 and 14.\nAND THIS COURT DOTH FURTHER ORDER AND DIRECT\nthat the assessment of the amount of such compensation be referred back to the Court appealed from for determination in accordance with the findings of this Honourable Court, with liberty to the parties to adduce such additional evidence at the said hearing as they or any of them may be advised.\nAND THIS COURT DOTH FURTHER ORDER AND ADJUDGE\nthat the Respondent British Columbia Toll Highways and Bridges Authority do recover from the Appellant its costs here and below after taxation thereof; AND THIS COURT DOTH FURTHER ORDER AND ADJUDGE\nthat the Appellant do recover from the Respondent Peter Kiewit Sons of Canada Ltd. its costs here and below after taxation thereof, together with all costs payable hereunder by the Appellant to the Respondent British Columbia Toll Highways and Bridges Authority.\nThe appellant relied on cls. 3, 4, 6 and 7 of the principal contract which it argued bound the respondent as well as the appellant; these read as follows:\n3. The work shall be commenced forthwith on the execution of this agreement, and carried on and prosecuted to completion by the contractor in all the several parts in such manner and at such points and places as the engineer shall from time to time direct, and to the satisfaction of the engineer, but always according to the provisions of this contract. The contractor shall deliver the work complete in every particular to the Authority on or before the date or dates following, viz:\n***\nTime shall be deemed to be material and of the essence of this contract. 4. The works shall be constructed by the contractor under his personal supervision, of the best materials of their several kinds, and finished in a workmanlike manner, and in strict conformity with this contract, and to the complete satisfaction of the engineer.\n6. The several parts of this contract shall be taken to explain each other and to make the whole consistent; and if it is found by the engineer that anything is necessary for the proper performance or completion of the work or any part thereof, the provisions for which are omitted or misstated in this contract, the contractor shall, at his own expense, at the direction of the engineer, perform and execute what is necessary to be done, as though provision therefor had been properly made and inserted and described in this contract. The correcting of any such error shall not be deemed to be an addition to or deviation from the terms of this contract.\n7. The engineer may, IN WRITING, at any time before the final acceptance of the works, order any additional work, or materials or things, not covered by the contract, to be done or provided, or the whole or any portion of the works to be dispensed with, or any changes to be made which he may deem expedient, in or in respect of the works hereby contracted for, or the plans, dimensions, character, quantity, quality, description, location, or position of the works, or any portion or portions thereof, or in any materials or things connected therewith, or used or intended to be used therein, or in any other thing connected therewith, or used or intended to be used therein, or in any other thing connected with the works, whether or not the effect of such orders is to increase or diminish the work to be done, or the materials or things to be provided, or the cost of doing or providing the same; and the engineer may, in such order, or from time to time as he may see fit, specify the time or times within which such order shall, in whole or in part, be complied with. The contractor shall comply with every such order of the engineer. The decision of the engineer as to whether the compliance with such order increases or diminishes the work to be done, or the materials or things to be provided, or the cost of doing or providing the same, and as to the amount to be paid or deducted, as the case may be, in respect thereof, shall be final. As a condition precedent to the right of the contractor to payment in respect of any such order of the engineer, the contractor shall obtain and produce the order, in writing, of the engineer, and a certificate, in writing, of the engineer, showing compliance with such order and fixing the amount to be paid or deducted in respect thereof.\nThe learned trial judge was of opinion that under the terms of the principal contract, particularly cls. 6 and 7 quoted above, the engineer was entitled to add note 10, \"Bottom of timber bearing piles to be below bottom of sheet piling\", that that addition was not actually a change in the plans at all, but that even if it could be said that the addition was a change it was one permitted by para. 1-8 of the specifications in the principal contract which reads as follows:\n1-8 Alterations to Drawings. It shall be understood that the drawings represent the nature of the work to be executed and not necessarily the works exactly as they will be carried out. The Engineer shall, without invalidating the contract, be at liberty to make any reasonable alteration or to furnish any additional or amended drawings which do not radically change the type of construction.\nThe value of such alterations shall be ascertained by measurement and at the rates set forth in the Schedule of Approximate Quantities and Prices or at the rates to be settled as herein provided and may be added to or deducted from the contract sum as the case may be.\nThe learned trial judge goes on to hold that all the work done by the respondent including the \"over-driving\" was within the purview of the principal contract; and it is implicit in his reasons that the respondent was bound under the sub-contract to perform all the obligations in regard to the supplying and driving of timber bearing piles which rested upon the appellant under the principal contract. In reaching the last mentioned conclusion the learned trial judge appears to have proceeded not so much on the construction of the terms of the written sub-contract as on the evidence of the managing-director of the respondent, T. K. Eakins. This appears particularly from the following two passages in his reasons:\nThe managing director of the plaintiff, Mr. Eakins, admitted both in the discovery and in his evidence at the trial that he considered himself bound by the provisions of the principal contract as contained in this Exhibit 3. His conduct throughout was consistent with this statement.\n***\nMr. Eakins admits that he was bound by the main contract, and that the resident engineer Stanwick had never promised to pay him for his so-called \"over-driving\". Having found that the addition to the plans was permitted under the terms of the principal contract and that the respondent was bound thereby the learned trial judge concluded that all the work done by the respondent was done in fulfilment of its obligations under an express contract and that consequently no contract to pay anything beyond the amounts provided in that express contract could be implied. This conclusion cannot be questioned if the finding on which it is based is accepted.\nIt will be observed that the sub-contract is silent as to the depth to which piles are to be driven and the conclusion seems to me to be inescapable that in agreeing to its terms both the appellant and the respondent contemplated that the obligation assumed by the latter was to drive and cut off the piles in accordance with the provisions of the principal contract as they existed on that date, that is before the addition of note 10 to the plans. It is not necessary to quote at length from the evidence; the following extracts from that of T. K. Eakins sufficiently express his view:\nQ. And are you aware of the contract specifications?\nA. Certainly I am aware of that.\nQ. And you bid on them?\nA. Yes.\nQ. Are you seriously trying to tell this Court you didn't think you were bound by the provisions of that main contract?\nA. Of course I felt I was bound by the main provisions of the contract, because, as I say, in as regards they told me how to drive a pile, and what was expected, that's what they expected to do, and of course I went along with that.\nQ. And those were in your letters of November 23rd and other letters here, I believe, that you quote the sections of the contract in defence of your own position?\nA. That's right. Yes.\n***\nA. I felt that as long as I put down a stable pile to 20-tons I was completing my contract. That is what I contracted to do, that is what I went in to do, but that is not what I was allowed to do.\nIt is not necessary to determine whether the appellant either expressly or by its conduct agreed with the Authority that the piles should be driven in accordance with the terms of the principal contract with the addition of note 10, without the payment of additional compensation. It is clear that the respondent not only did not so agree but repeatedly and vigorously protested that its obligation was limited to driving and cutting off the piles so that they were stable, truly vertical, conformed to the lines and levels shown on the plans and were driven to a safe bearing capacity of 20 tons based on the formula set out in the specifications and quoted above. It should be noted that the evidence of all the witnesses who testified on the point was in agreement that the words in the specifications\u2014\"piles shall be driven \u2026to the levels shown on the plans\"\u2014refer to the levels of the tops of the piles after they have been driven and cut off, and having nothing to do with the prescribed depth of penetration.\nCounsel for the appellant contends that, throughout the proceedings, the significance of the addition of note 10 to the plans has been greatly exaggerated, as, in his submission, the evidence shews that in the numerous discussions between the engineer and the representatives of the respondent the former reiterated that the piles were to be driven to the depth that satisfied him rather than to a depth greater than that to which the sheet piling had been driven. The addition has, however, this importance that without it there was nothing in the principal contract (other than the general powers of the engineer defined in cls. 6 and 7) or in the specifications or in the plans requiring the appellant or the respondent (in so far as the latter had assumed the obligations of the former) to drive the piles to a greater depth than was necessary to achieve the safe bearing capacity of 20 tons in accordance with the specified formula.\nIt is significant that there was no denial of the testimony of T. K. Eakins and H. G. Eakins that the respondent was compelled to do driving to the extent of three to four times the amount necessary to achieve the specified safe bearing capacity. The only attack made on the accuracy of their evidence on this point is found in the evidence of Stanwick who stated that defects and failures in the driving equipment used by the respondent made it difficult to determine whether any particular pile had been \"over-driven\".\nIn my view, on the true construction of the sub-contract interpreted, as it must be, in the light of the circumstances surrounding its execution, the respondent agreed to perform the obligations of the appellant as to the supplying, driving and cutting off of the piles on the piers with which we are concerned as those obligations were defined in the principal contract (including the specifications and plans) as it existed when the sub-contract was made. The evidence shews that the respondent was called upon to do, and did do, work greatly in excess of those obligations.\nProceeding on the assumption that cls. 3, 4, 6 and 7 of the principal contract were incorporated into the sub-contract, Sheppard J.A., after a careful analysis of those clauses and of the relevant portions of the specifications, concluded that they did not authorize the adding of note 10 to the plans or the requirement by the engineer that the respondent should drive the piles to a penetration greatly in excess of that specified. I agree with this conclusion and with the reasons leading to it stated by the learned Justice of Appeal.\nIn my opinion the evidence supports the view expressed by the learned Chief Justice of British Columbia in the following paragraph:\nThe evidence is clear that what the appellant (i.e. Eakins Construction Limited) contracted to do and what it actually did while at all times taking the position that the work done was not within the scope of its contract, was so different from that contemplated that in my view the sub-contract ceased to be applicable and the work done by the appellant should be paid for as though no contract had been made, on a quantum meruit.\nIt can scarcely be denied that the work done by the respondent, under continuing protest, was done under circumstances of practical compulsion. It is clear that Howell repeatedly told the officers of the respondent that they must obey the instructions of the engineer as to the depth to which the piles were to be driven regardless of their views as to the meaning of the contract and the specifications. The sort of pressure exerted on the respondent by Howell is testified to by T. K. Eakins and H. G. Eakins and is exemplified in the following passage in the evidence of the latter:\nMr. Howell reported that their project was some months behind in its schedule, that it was of paramount importance to carry this foundation work on to its completion so that they, in turn, could keep up their working schedule, that if we did not continue to the completion of the work he had no alternative but to call in the bonding company to take over, in which case, he pointed out, not only would the company (i.e the respondent) sacrifice that which remained but would be subject to extraordinary charges which are generally observed when a bonding company takes over. Howell was not called as a witness and there is no denial of this evidence.\nHowell, with the fullest knowledge that the respondent was taking the position that it was being called to do work entirely outside its contract and would expect and demand to be paid for it (a position which, in my opinion, both in fact and in law it was justified in taking) persisted in ordering that work to be done. In these circumstances the law implies an obligation on the part of the appellant to pay for that work of the performance of which it has had the benefit. I find some difficulty in basing the appellant's liability on an implied contract when the evidence shows that the respondent was repeatedly pressing the appellant to agree that it would pay for the work which it was doing and which did not fall within the terms of the sub-contract, and the appellant instead of so agreeing was making only \"nebulous statements\" to the effect that the respondent ought to be paid or that \"there was something coming to\" the respondent. I prefer to use the terminology which has the authority of Lord Mansfield and Lord Wright and was adopted by this Court in Deglman v. Guaranty Trust Company of Canada and Constantineau[2], particularly at pages 734 and 735, and to say that the appellant having received the benefits of the performance by the respondent of the work which the latter did at the insistence of the former the law imposes upon the appellant the obligation to pay the fair value of the work performed.\nIt is said that the respondent (who held what turns out to be the right view as to the meaning of the sub-contract) should have had the courage of its convictions and refused to perform any work beyond that which was required by the sub-contract, and when this resulted in its being put off the job should have sued the appellant for damages. It must, however, be remembered that the sub-contract was so difficult to construe that there has been a difference of judicial opinion as to its true meaning. The appellant (who held what turns out to be a mistaken view as to the meaning of the sub-contract) threatened the respondent with what might well amount to financial ruin unless it did the additional work which the sub-contract did not obligate it to do. To say that because in such circumstances the respondent was not prepared to stop work and so risk the ruinous loss which would have fallen on it if its view of the meaning of the contract turned out to be erroneous the appellant may retain the benefit of all the additional work done by the respondent without paying for it would be to countenance an unjust enrichment of a shocking character, which, in my opinion, can and should be prevented by imposing upon the appellant the obligation to pay to which I have referred above.\nThe case appears to me to be analogous to those in which a person who has paid money, under protest and under circumstances of practical compulsion, to another who was not in law entitled to the payment can recover it back by action. A number of the leading cases which illustrate the application of that principle are collected and discussed in the judgments delivered in this Court in Knutson v. The Bourkes Syndicate[3]. The judgment of Kerwin J., as he then was, concurred in by Rinfret, Crocket and Taschereau JJ., makes two things clear: (i) that it makes no difference whether the duress be of goods and chattels or of real property or of the person; and (ii) that in such cases the plaintiff's right to recover is not affected by the circumstance that the defendant honestly believed he was entitled to the payment which he demanded.\nThe concluding paragraph of the judgment of Kerwin J. at page 425 reads as follows:\nHere the evidence is plain that the payments were made under protest and that they were not voluntary in the sense referred to in the cases mentioned. The circumstance that O. L. Knuston thought that he had a right to insist upon the payments cannot alter the fact that under the agreement of September 16th, 1936, it is clear that he had no such right. In order to protect its position under the option agreement and to secure title to the lands which it was under obligation to transfer to the incorporated company, the Syndicate was under a practical compulsion to make the payments in question and is entitled to their repayment.\nI can discern no difference in principle between compelling a man to pay money which he is not legally bound to pay and compelling him to do work which he is not legally bound to do; in the one case money is improperly obtained, in the other money's worth. The remedy in the former case is to order repayment of the money; the remedy in the latter case should be, in my opinion, to order the person who has compelled the doing and has reaped the benefit of the work to pay its fair value. It would, I think, be a reproach to the administration of justice if we were compelled to hold that the courts are powerless to grant any relief to a plaintiff in such circumstances.\nIt is argued for the appellant that if the appeal does not succeed in toto the order of the Court of Appeal should be varied to provide that the respondent is entitled to be paid on a quantum meruit basis for that work only which was done over and beyond the work called for by the subcontract. On this point I am in agreement wtih the Court of Appeal and am content to adopt the reasons of Sheppard J.A. for rejecting this submission.\nFor the above reasons I have reached the conclusion that the appeal on the substantive claim should be dismissed.\nIt was contended, however, that the Court of Appeal did not have jurisdiction to order that the respondent should recover from the appellant the costs of the trial and in the Court of Appeal payable by the respondent to the Authority. This submission is based on the following decisions which are set out in the appellant's factum and which counsel for the respondent submits were wrongly decided: Hampton v. Park[4], Union Bus Sales Ltd. v. Dueck on Broadway Ltd. et al.[5] and Loonam et al. v. Mannix Ltd. et al.[6].. These are all decisions of single judges and until the present case the question does not appear to have been considered by the Court of Appeal for British Columbia.\nThe English practice in regard to the making of a \"Bullock order\" is well settled. The cases are collected in 26 Halsbury, 2nd ed., p. 98, s. 186, and in the Supplement. Their effect is summarized in s. 186 as follows:\nWhere there are two defendants reasonably sued as being liable jointly or in the alternative, the unsuccessful defendant may be ordered to pay to the plaintiff the costs payable by him to the successful defendant or to pay the costs of the successful defendant direct to him.\nAssuming that there was jurisdiction to make it, the order of the Court of Appeal was proper under the circumstances of the case at bar in which the appellant took the position, inter alia, that if the respondent was entitled to be paid more than the price stipulated in the sub-contract its right of recovery was against the Authority rather than the appellant.\nThere is no doubt that the three cases relied upon by the appellant decide that in British Columbia there is no jurisdiction to make a \"Bullock order\" in cases in which equitable issues do not arise.\nThe first of the cases mentioned above is a decision of Murphy J. It is based on the decision of Clement J. in Green v. British Columbia Electric Railway et al.[7] That learned Judge discusses the question of costs at pages 79 et seq of the report and takes the view that the cases establishing the English practice are based on s. 5 of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (1890), 53 and 54 Vict. C. 44, which reads:\n5. Subject to the Supreme Court of Judicature Acts, and the rules of court made thereunder, and to the express provisions of any Statute, whether passed before or after the commencement of this Act, the costs of and incident to all proceedings in the Supreme Court, including the administration of estates and trusts, shall be in the discretion of the court or judge, and the court or judge shall have full power to determine by whom and to what extent such costs are to be paid.\nThe learned judge points out that there is no such clause in the British Columbia statutes and rejects the submission that the jurisdiction can be inferred from the wording of Order LXV, rule 32, of the British Columbia Rules of Court:\nWhere the costs of one defendant ought to be paid by another defendant, the Court may order payment to be made by one defendant to the other directly; and it is not to be necessary to order payment through the plaintiff.\nIn his view, scope for the operation of this rule is to be found in cases in which the issues raised are equitable.\nThe decision in Green v. British Columbia Railway Co., supra, was criticized by Morrison C.J. in Rhys v. Wright and Lambert[8], but it was not necessary for the learned Chief Justice to express a final opinion in regard to its correctness. In Hampton v. Park, supra, Murphy J. felt himself bound by the decision of Clement J. but he does not appear to have agreed with it. He says at page 664.\nThe correctness of the Green decision on the alternative proposition, (i.e. that the Court was without jurisdiction to make a \"Bullock order\"), is, I think, questionable but inasmuch as it is strictly in point, has stood unimpeached on this aspect for many years and has been followed in at least two instances I do not think it is open to me to disregard it as a precedent.\nUnion Bus Sales Ltd. v. Dueck, supra, was decided by Ruttan J. and Loonam et al. v. Mannix Ltd., supra, by Manson J. Both of these learned Judges were of opinion that they should follow Hampton v. Park.\nIf the matter were res integra it would be my opinion that the Supreme Court of British Columbia has jurisdiction to make an order of the sort in question in any proper case whether the issues raised are legal or equitable.\nSection 9 of the Supreme Court Act, R.S.B.C. 1948, c. 73, provides:\nThe Court is and shall continue to be a Court of original jurisdiction, and shall have complete cognizance of all pleas whatsoever, and shall have jurisdiction in all cases, civil as well as criminal, arising within the Province.\nThe Laws Declaratory Act, R.S.B.C. 1948, c. 179, provides by s. 2, subs. 34:\nGenerally in all matters not hereinbefore particularly mentioned in which there is any conflict or variance between the rules of equity and the rules of the common law with reference to the same matter, the rules of equity shall prevail:\nIn Green v. British Columbia Railway, supra, Clement J. was of opinion that the Supreme Court of British Columbia would have jurisdiction to make a \"Bullock order\" in a case where the issues were equitable, and this view is supported by the English authorities.\nIn the case of Sanderson v. Blyth Theatre Co.[9] a common law action, in which such an order was made, Romer L.J. says at p. 539:\nThis jurisdiction has been frequently exercised in Chancery in proper cases, and can, of course be exercised in the King's Bench Division. The costs so recovered over by the plaintiff are in no true sense damages, but are ordered to be paid by the unsuccessful defendant, on the ground that in such an action as I am considering those costs have been reasonably and properly incurred by the plaintiff as between him and the last named defendant.\nand at p. 544 Vaughan Williams L.J. says:\nI concur in the judgments of my learned brethern because I think there is jurisdiction under the old Chancery practice for ordering the recoupment of costs directed to be paid by another litigant.\nOrder LXV, Rule 1, marginal rule 976, of the British Columbia Rules of Court provides:\n1. Subject to the provisions of these rules the costs of and incident to all proceedings in the Court, including the administration of estates and trusts, shall follow the event, unless the Court or Judge shall, for good cause, otherwise order \u2026\nIt will be observed that, in the case at bar, on the view of Romer L.J., quoted above, the costs, under the order of the Court of Appeal are following the event. The successful Authority is awarded its costs as against the plaintiff, the successful plaintiff is allowed to recover them over from the unsuccessful defendant as \"costs reasonably and properly incurred by the plaintiff as between him and the lastnamed defendant.\"\nThe view that jurisdiction exists is supported by the wording of order LXV, rule 32 of the British Columbia Rules of Court quoted above.\nThe operation of that rule is not, I think, limited to cases in which the issues raised are equitable. Such a distinction would be anomalous in a court having the widest jurisdiction over all cases and in which the rules of equity, in case of conflict, prevail over those of the common law. The wording of the rule presupposes the existence of the power to make a \"Bullock order\" and gives an alternative power to order payment directly from one defendant to another.\nUnfortunately, we have not the benefit of any detailed expression of the reasons which brought the Court of Appeal to the conclusion that the cases relied upon by the appellant on this point ought not to be followed, but, in my respectful opinion, the Court of Appeal had jurisdiction to make the order as to costs which it did make and that order was a proper one under all the circumstances.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.

R.S.C. 1952. c. 14. s. 64(1).\nThe appellants had guaranteed a bank loan to a company. Two months before the company was declared bankrupt, it deposited in its account at the bank a sum sufficient to cover the loan. The bank charged the note against the company's account and returned the guarantee to the guarantors. The trustee in bankruptcy attacked the payment to the bank, but the action was dismissed by the trial judge. The trustee's appeal as against the bank was dismissed, but allowed as against the guarantors who were ordered to pay to the trustee the amount of the guarantee, on the view that the company had intended to give the guarantors a preference, that the latter had intended to receive a preference but that the bank had no such intention. The guarantors were granted special leave to appeal to this Court on the question as to whether there was power under the Act to order payment by the guarantors directly to the trustee.\nHeld: The appeal should be allowed and the action dismissed.\nAccepting, for the purpose of this appeal, the findings of fact made by the Court of Appeal, the question to be determined was whether or not the effect of s. 64(1) of the Bankruptcy Act was to render the payment fraudulent and void as against the trustee. There was only one payment and it was either good or void. It could not be good as between the bank and the trustee and at the same time void as between the guarantors and the trustee. Therefore, since no appeal was taken from the judgment declaring good the payment as between the bank and the trustee, that question was now res judicata. The trustee's only right was to have the payment declared void and consequently to recover the amount of the payment. It was too late for such an order.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick, Appeal Division, reversing in part a judgment of Anglin J. Appeal allowed.\nR. V. Limerick, Q.C., for the Appellants.\nNo one appearing for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nCartwright J.:\u2014This is an appeal by Bernard Velensky, Harry Velensky and Jake Budovitch, brought by special leave granted by my brother Taschereau, from a judgment of the Appeal Division of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick. The appeal to the Appeal Division was brought by the Trustee in Bankruptcy of Bernard Motors Limited, hereinafter referred to as \"the trustee\", from a judgment of Anglin J. The appeal was allowed as against Bernard Budovitch, Bernard Velensky, Jake Budovitch and Harry Velensky, hereinafter referred to collectively as \"the guarantors\" and was dismissed as against the Provincial Bank of Canada, hereinafter referred to as \"the Bank\". By the judgment of the Appeal Division it was ordered that the four guarantors pay to the trustee as a joint and several liability the sum of $10,000.\nThe notice of motion brought by the trustee before Anglin J. asked for numerous items of relief, all of which were refused by that learned judge. The trustee appealed to the Appeal Division as to only two of these items and asked in its notice of appeal for an order:\n(1) declaring fraudulent and void as against the trustee of the bankrupt the payment of the sum of $10,000.00 by the bankrupt to the Provincial Bank of Canada on the second of October, 1953, or, alternatively, the' charging by the Provincial Bank of Canada on the second day of. October, 1953, of the sum of $10,000.00 against the account of the bankrupt with the said bank, in full payment and satisfaction of a promissory note made by the bankrupt under date of the twelfth day of February, 1953, payable on demand, with interest, at the rate of 6% (six per cent) per annum to the order of Bernard Budovitch endorsed by Bernard Budovitch and Bernard Valensky, and payment of which had been guaranteed by the said Bernard Budovitch and Bernard Valensky and by Harry Valensky and Jake. Budovitch; (2) directing the said Provincial Bank of Canada, Bernard Budovitch, Bernard Valensky, Harry Valensky and Jake Budovitch, jointly and severally to pay forthwith to the trustee of the bankrupt the said sum of $10,000.\nAnglin J. reached the conclusion that the presumption in favour of the trustee raised by s. 64 of the Bankruptcy Act had been rebutted and that the intention of Bernard Motors Limited, hereinafter referred to as \"the company\", was not to give a preference to either the Bank or the guarantors.\nThe Appeal Division took a different view as to the inferences which should be drawn from the evidence. Its members were unanimously of opinion that there was an intention on the part of the company to give a preference to the guarantors and an intention on the part of the guarantors to obtain such a preference. Bridges J., with whom Jones J. concurred, was of opinion that the company also intended that the Bank should receive a preference. All three members of the Court were of opinion that the Bank had not intended to receive a preference.\nAs in my opinion even on the view of the evidence most favourable to the trustee the appeal succeeds, I propose to accept for the purposes of this appeal the findings of fact made by the Appeal Division. These are fully set out in the reasons of Bridges J. and Richard J. and I shall attempt to give only a brief summary.\nBernard Budovitch was the president and a director of the company; Bernard Velensky was its secretary-treasurer and a director; the management of the company's business was in their hands. Jake Budovitch is the father of Bernard Budovitch and Harry Velensky is the father of Bernard Velensky.\nOn February 12, 1953, the company borrowed $10,000 from the Bank on a promissory note for that amount signed by the company payable to Bernard Budovitch and endorsed by him and Bernard Velensky. On February 16, 1953, the four guarantors executed a guarantee in favour of the Bank whereby they jointly and severally guaranteed payment of all present and future debts and liabilities owing by the company to the Bank. Under the terms of the guarantee the liability of the guarantors and of each of them was limited to $10,000. The guarantee contained the following clause:\nProvided always that the undersigned, or any one or more of them (if more than one) or the respective executors, administrators or legal representatives of any of the undersigned, may at any time determine their or his further liability under this guarantee by notice in writing to be given to said Bank, but said determination by any one or more of the undersigned or by the respective executors, administrators or legal representatives of any of the undersigned shall not prevent the continuance of the liability hereunder of any others or other of the undersigned or of their or his respective executors, administrators or legal representatives.\nOn October 2, 1953, the company was, and had been for some weeks, an insolvent person as defined in the Bankruptcy Act. On that day Bernard Budovitch made a deposit of $9,531.99 in the account of the company at the Bank and following this deposit the amount standing to the company's credit was $11,527.\nIn the afternoon of October 2, 1953, after the deposit had been made, Jake Budovitch and Harry Velensky went to the Bank and, the manager being absent, saw W. H. Anthony, the assistant manager. They asked him to charge the $10,000 note to the company's account and to return the guarantee to them. Anthony did not consider they had the authority to direct him to do this; he telephoned to the company's office, asked for \"Bernie\", spoke to either Bernard Budovitch or Bernard Velensky, told, the person to whom he was speaking of the request of Jake Budovitch and Harry Velensky and received the answer \"Well, I guess you might as well\". Anthony thereupon charged the note against the company's account and, a few days later when it was received from the head office of the bank, returned the guarantee to Jake Budovitch and Harry Velensky.\nOn December 1, 1953, a receiving order was made against the company and later the Canadian Credit Men's Trust Association was duly elected trustee.\nOn this state of facts, the question as to what are the rights of the trustee turns on the effect of s. 64(1) of the Bankruptcy Act, which reads as follows:\n64. (1) Every conveyance or transfer of property or charge thereon made, every payment made, every obligation incurred, and every judicial proceeding taken or suffered by any insolvent person in favour of any creditor or of any person in trust for any creditor with a view of giving such creditor a preference over the other creditors shall, if the person making, incurring, taking, paying or suffering the same becomes bankrupt within three months after the date of making, incurring, taking, paying or suffering the same, be deemed fraudulent and void as against the trustee in the bankruptcy.\nThis subsection must be read in the light of subs. (3), which provides:\n(3) For the purpose of this section, the expression \"creditor\" shall include a surety or guarantor for the debt due to such creditor.\nThe applicable words of subs. (1) as interpreted by subs. (3) are:\u2014 \u2026 every payment made \u2026 by any insolvent person in favour of any creditor \u2026 with a view of giving such creditor (which expression includes a surety \u2026 for the debt due to such creditor) a preference over the other creditors shall, if the person making \u2026 the same becomes bankrupt within three months after the date of making \u2026 the same, be deemed fraudulent and void as against the trustee in bankruptcy.\nApplying these words to the facts as found by the Appeal Division, it appears that the payment of $10,000 was made by an insolvent person, the company, in favour of a creditor, the bank, with a view of giving the four guarantors (sureties for the debt due to the bank) a preference over the other creditors\u2014which four guarantors, if that is important, also had the intention of being preferred\u2014 and the person making the payment, the company, became bankrupt within three months.\nIn these circumstances the task of the Court was to determine whether or not the effect of s. 64(1) was to render the payment of the $10,000 fraudulent and void as against the trustee.\nI can find nothing in the section or in the jurisprudence to warrant declaring the payment good as between the bank and the trustee and at the same time void as between the guarantors and the trustee.\nThere was only one payment and it must be either good or void. If, as the Appeal Division appear to have held, it would not be void as against the bank unless the bank had the intention of being preferred and so it is good as between the bank and the trustee, then the debt to the bank has been paid and there can be no liability on the part, of the guarantors. They guaranteed only the payment of whatever (up to $10,000) was owing to the bank and on this view nothing was owing.\nWith respect, I incline to the view that it having been found as a fact that the intention of the insolvent was to prefer both the bank and the guarantors and that the intention of the latter, although not of the former, was to be preferred, it should have been held that the payment was void, the bank should have been ordered to repay the $10,000 to the trustee and left to exercise its rights against the guarantors. I do not, however, have to reach a final conclusion as to this because it is too late to make any such order. It is now res judicata that as between the bank and the trustee the payment is good and no appeal has been taken from the judgment so declaring. The debt to the bank for the payment of which the guarantors were sureties has been paid in full and as a result they are discharged.\nI am unable to construe s. 64 as giving any rights to the trustee in regard to a preferential payment other than the right to have such payment declared void and the consequential right to recover the amount of the payment. The question from whom the amount of the payment can be recovered does not arise unless and until the payment has been declared void.\nI agree with the statement in Halsbury, 3rd ed., vol. 2, p. 560:\nIf a payment or other disposition, of property, otherwise valid, be made in circumstances that amount to a fraudulent preference, the payment, at the time it is made, is a good payment, and so remains unless and until it is set aside as a fraudulent preference.\nIn my view, as the payment to the bank (which is the only payment in question) has not been (and cannot now be) set aside, the question whether had it been so set aside an order for payment could have been made directly against the guarantors does not arise and I think it better to express no opinion upon the conflicting views expressed in In re G. Stanley & Co.1 on the one hand, and in Re Lyons2 and Re Conley3, on the other. I would allow the appeal, set aside the order of the Appeal Division as against the three appellants and restore the order of Anglin J. as to them. The appellants should have their costs in the Appeal Division and in this Court against the trustee.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: McNair & McNair, Fredericton, and Limerick and Limerick, Fredericton.\nSolicitors for the respondent: McKelvey, MacCauley, Machum & Fairweather, St. John.\n1 [1925] Ch. 148.\n2 (1934), 152 L.T. 201, [1934] All E.R. 124.\n3 [1937] 4 All E.R. 438, reversed [1938] 2 All E.R. 127.\n"

The trustee of the father's estate applied to the Court for advice and direction as to whether she was entitled to the income. In 1955, the matter was finally decided by this Court in favour of the appellant who had been represented by counsel in all the proceedings. In computing her income tax return for 1955, she deducted the legal fees she had paid her solicitors. The deduction was disallowed by the Minister. The Income Tax Appeal Board allowed the deduction, but the Minister's assessment was affirmed by the Exchequer Court of Canada.\nHeld: (Fauteux and Judson JJ. dissenting): The appellant was entitled to the deduction.\nPer Taschereau, Cartwright and Ritchie JJ.: The outlay in question was not a payment on account of capital within s. 12(1)(b), but an expense, within s. 12(1)(a), properly incurred for the purpose of gaining an income to which she was at all relevant times entitled but of which she was unable to obtain payment without incurring the outlay. Although she became entitled to be paid the income from the one-third share, the legal ownership of the share was to remain in the trustee and in no circumstances could she ever become entitled to any part of that capital. Her right was solely to require the trustee to pay the income. The payment of the legal fees did not bring this right or any asset or advantage into existence. Her right to receive the income was derived not from the judgment of the Court but from the combined effect of the wills. The fact that a bare right to be paid income can be sold or valued on an acturial basis at a lump sum does not require or permit that right, while retained by the beneficiary, to be regarded as a capital asset.\nPer Fauteux and Judson JJ., dissenting: The judgment of the Exchequer Court rightly decided that the outlay was on account of capital and non-deductible by virtue of s. 12(1) (b) of the Act.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of Cameron J. of the Exchequer Court of Canada1, reversing a judgment of the Income Tax Appeal Board and affirming the Minister's assessment.\nAppeal allowed, Fauteux and Judson JJ. dissenting.\nT. Sheard, Q.C., and F. S. Burbidge, for the appellant.\nD. Guthrie, Q.C., and J. D. C. Boland, for the respondent.\nThe judgment of Taschereau, Cartwright and Ritchie JJ. was delivered by\nCartwright J.:\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment2 of Cameron J. allowing an appeal from a decision of the Income Tax Appeal Board delivered by W. S. Fisher, Esquire, Q.C. and affirming an assessment made upon the appellant.\nThe facts are not in dispute.\nThomas Alexander Russell died on December 29, 1940, leaving a large estate; his son, John Alexander Russell who was the first husband of the appellant, died on August 8, 1950; the appellant re-married on July 27, 1953; the widow of Thomas Alexander Russell died on September 20, 1953.\nBy the combined effect of the wills of Thomas Alexander Russell and John Alexander Russell the appellant became entitled on September 20, 1953, for the remainder of her lifetime to the income from a one-third share of the residue of the estate of Thomas Alexander Russell. We were informed by counsel that the income from this one-third share is approximately $25,000 a year. The surviving trustee of the will of Thomas Alexander Russell applied on originating notice to the Supreme Court of Ontario for the opinion, advice and direction of the Court as to the following questions arising in the administration of his estate:\n(1) What is the extent of the power of appointment given by the donor, the late Thomas Alexander Russell by the said Will to the late John Alexander Russell in respect of the disposition of income on the share of the said John Alexander Russell? and\n(2) Has the said John Alexander Russell as donee of the power properly appointed and executed the same under the terms of his Will?\nThe motion came on for hearing before Lebel J., as he then was, and counsel for Mrs. Andersen, the only surviving child of Thomas Alexander Russell, submitted that the appellant was not entitled to the income from the one-third share. The learned judge gave judgment on June 2, 1954, holding that the appellant was entitled to the income. Mrs. Andersen appealed from this judgment to the Court of Appeal for Ontario; her appeal was dismissed by a unanimous judgment delivered on September 10, 1954; she appealed further to this Court3 and, on April 26, 1955, her appeal was dismissed by a unanimous judgment.\nIn all these proceedings the present appellant was represented by solicitors and counsel; she received her party and party costs out of the estate of Thomas Alexander Russell but had to pay personally the sum of $11,974.93, the difference between her party and party costs and her solicitor and client costs; this was paid for her by the trustee of the Thomas Alexander Russell estate out of the income which she would otherwise have been entitled to receive during the year 1955. The question in this appeal is whether in computing the income of the appellant for the year 1955 she was entitled to deduct this sum of $11,974.93.\nThe provisions of the Income Tax Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 148, as amended, which are relevant to the issues in this appeal are:\n2. (1) An income tax shall be paid as hereinafter required upon the taxable income for each taxation year of every person resident in Canada at any time in the year. (3) The taxable income of a taxpayer for a taxation year is his income for the year minus the deductions permitted by Division C.\n3. The income of a taxpayer for a taxation year for the purposes of this Part is his income for the year from all sources inside or outside Canada and, without restricting the generality of the foregoing, includes income for the year from all\n(a) businesses,\n(b) property, and\n(c) offices and employments.\n4. Subject to the other provisions of this Part, income for a taxation year from a business or property is the profit therefrom for the year.\n12 (1) In computing income, no deduction shall be made in respect of\n(a) an outlay or expense except to the extent that it was made or incurred by the taxpayer for the purpose of gaining or producing income from property or a business of the taxpayer,\n(b) an outlay, loss or replacement of capital, a payment on account of capital or an allowance in respect of depreciation, obsolescence or depletion except as expressly permitted by this Part.\n139 (1) In this Act\n(ag) \"property\" means property of any kind whatsoever whether real or personal or corporeal or incorporeal and, without restricting the generality of the foregoing, includes a right of any kind whatsoever, a share or a chose in action.\nSection 12(1) (a) and (b) was derived from s. 6(1) (a) and (b) of the Income War Tax Act, which provided as follows:\n6 (1) In computing the amount of the profits or gains to be assessed, a deduction shall not be allowed in respect of\n(a) disbursements or expenses not wholly, exclusively and necessarily laid out or expended for the purpose of earning the income;\n(b) any outlay, loss or replacement of capital or any payment on account of capital or any depreciation, depletion or obsolescence, except as otherwise provided in this Act.\nCameron J. was of opinion that the payment of $11,974.93 was an outlay on account of capital and so barred from deduction by the provisions of s. 12(1) (b); consequently he found it unnecessary to consider whether or not the payment fell within s. 12(1)(a). The gist of the reasoning which brought the learned judge to this conclusion is contained in the following paragraphs:\nThe answer to the question which I have posed depends upon the nature and quality of the right which the respondent had and in the defence of which the outlay was made. If it was a capital asset I am bound, I think, by the decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in Dominion Natural Gas Co. Ltd. v. M.N.R. (1941) S.C.R. 19, to find that such outlay was one on account of capital and therefore nondeductible. Further reference to that case will be made later.\nUpon first consideration and since Mrs. Evans received only income from her right, the expenditures might seem to have been made not on account of capital but on account of income. That would, I think, have been the case had she in any year found it necessary to lay out money for legal expenses to enforce payment of the quarterly or annual income when the right to receive it was not in question but the trustees had failed to pay it over. Such a case would have been similar to one in which a landlord was required to pay legal expenses in collecting his rent. That, however, was not the case here. What was in dispute was not the amount of income to which she was entitled but whether or not she was entitled to anything. It was her right to income which was disputed on the ground that her father-in-law's Will did not confer on her husband the power to appoint the income to her in the circumstances; and even if it had done so the power was not validly exercised. In my opinion, what the respondent had was a life estate or a life interest in the income from a portion of the residue of her father-in-law's state. That right must be distinguished from the income which flowed therefrom to her as a result of her ownership of the right. While it was an intangible right, I think it would normally be considered a proprietary right\u2014 something which the respondent possessed to the exclusion of all others and quite apart from the fact that by the provisions of s. 139(1) (ag) the word \"property\" includes \"a right of any kind whatsoever\". That right was something capable of evaluation as, for example, by the succession duty officers or by actuaries. It could be sold or pledged. Had that right been purchased, for example, by an investment corporation, the right in its hands would, I think, have been considered as a capital asset. In my view, it was a capital asset and the source of her income.\nWith the greatest respect, I disagree with the conclusion set out in the last sentence of this paragraph that the appellant's right was a capital asset.\nAs I read the whole of his reasons, the learned judge was of opinion that if the decisions of the courts in England were applicable he would have decided the question in favour of the tax-payer but felt himself bound by the decision of this Court in Dominion Natural Gas Ltd. v. M.N.R.4 to reach a contrary conclusion. That case was decided under s. 6(1) of the Income War Tax Act, quoted above. In giving the judgment of the majority of this Court in B.C. Electric Ry. Co. v. M.N.R.5, my brother Abbott said:\nThe less stringent provisions of the new section should, I think, be borne in mind in considering judicial opinions based upon the former sections.\nWhether, in view of the later decisions of this Court in M.N.R. v. The Kellogg Company of Canada Ltd.6 and M.N.R. v. Goldsmith Bros. Smelting and Refining Co. Ltd.7, the Dominion Natural Gas case would be decided in the same manner if it arose to-day under the present section is a question which I do not have to consider. It is distinguishable from the case at bar.\nIn B.C. Electric v. M.N.R., supra, all members of the Court adopted as a useful guide in determining whether an expenditure is one made on account of capital the test formulated by Lord Cave in Atherton v. British Insulated and Helsby Cables Limited8, as follows:\n\u2026when an expenditure is made, not only once and for all, but with a view to bringing into existence an asset or an advantage for the enduring benefit of a trade, I think that there is very good reason (in the absence of special circumstances leading to an opposite conclusion) for treating such an expenditure as properly attributable not to revenue but to capital.\nThe reasons for judgment in Dominion Natural Gas had the effect of adding as an alternative to the words \"with a view to bringing into existence an asset or an advantage for the enduring benefit of a trade\" in the passage quoted, the words \"or with a view to preserving an asset or advantage for the enduring benefit of a trade\". The \"asset\" or \"advantage\" under consideration in Dominion Natural Gas was a valuable, exclusive perpetual franchise; this franchise did not of itself yield any income to the Company which held it; it was a permanent right used and useful in the earning of the company's income by the sale of its product to the persons residing in the territory covered by the franchise; it was rightly regarded as an item of fixed capital.\nIn M.N.R. v. Goldsmith Bros., supra, at p. 57 Rand J. succinctly explained the judgment in Dominion Natural Gas as having been based on the view that the legal fees there in question were \"expenses to preserve a capital asset in a capital aspect\". The judgment in Dominion Natural Gas is not of assistance in deciding whether the right to income possessed by the appellant in the case at bar should be regarded as a capital asset.\nIn the case at bar, as has already been pointed out, the appellant, on September 20, 1953, became entitled for the remainder of her life-time to be paid the income from the one-third share. The legal ownership of that share remains at all times in the trustee and the capital of which it consists will be paid on the appellant's death, to those entitled under the will of Thomas Alexander Russell. In no circumstances can the appellant ever become entitled to any part of that capital; her right is solely to require the trustee to pay the income arising from the share to her; this is a right enforceable in equity and everything received by the appellant by virtue of the right will be taxable income in her hands. The payment of the legal fees in question did not bring this right or any asset or advantage into existence. Her right to receive the income is derived not from the judgment of the Court but from the combined effect of the wills of Thomas Alexander Russell and John Alexander Russell. Wrongly, as it turned out, the trustee entertained doubts, presumably engendered by the claims of Mrs. Andersen, as to whether it should pay to the appellant the income to which she was entitled and it would not pay anything until the matter had been passed upon by the Court. The precise form in which the matter was submitted to the Court appears to me to be of no importance; the legal expenses paid by the appellant were expended by her for the purpose of obtaining payment of income; they were expenses of collecting income to which she was entitled but the payment of which she could not otherwise obtain. So viewed, it could scarcely be doubted that the expenses were properly deductible in computing the appellant's taxable income. This, in my opinion, is the right view of the matter and is not altered by the circumstance that it was mistakenly claimed by Mrs. Andersen that the appellant was not entitled to any income at all.\nWith the greatest respect for the contrary view entertained by the learned Judge, I cannot agree that the fact that a bare right to be paid income can be sold or valued on an actuarial basis at a lump sum requires or permits that right, while retained by the appellant, to be regarded as a capital asset. I do not think that in ordinary language a right to receive income such as that enjoyed by the appellant would be described as a capital asset. If it were all that she possessed, I think that the natural and accurate answer to the question \"Has she any capital?\" which would be made by either the man on the Clapham omnibus or a professional accountant would be \"No, but she has a substantial income\".\nIf the circumstances of the case at bar are viewed in the light most favourable to the respondent it can be said that the legal expenses were incurred not only to collect the income to which the appellant was entitled and which was being wrongly withheld from her but also to prevent the right to receive that income being destroyed; the right in question remains throughout a right to income. In the Dominion Natural Gas case, on the other hand, the expenses were incurred in litigation the subject matter of which was an item of fixed capital.\nIn my opinion, in the circumstances of this case there are two relevant questions both of which must, on the admitted facts, be answered in the affirmative; (i) was the appellant's claim in regard to which the expenses were incurred a claim to income to which she was entitled? (ii) were the legal expenses properly incurred in order to obtain payment of that income? It does not appear to me to be either necessary or relevant to inquire further as to what were the grounds (held by the Court to be without substance) upon which the payment of the income was withheld. It would be a strange result if the question, whether legal expenses incurred in enforcing or preserving a right should be regarded as an outlay on account of capital or on account of income, fell to be determined on a consideration not of the true nature of that right but of the nature of the ill-founded grounds on which it was disputed.\nFor the above reasons it is my opinion that the outlay of the legal expenses in question was not a payment on account of capital falling within s. 12(1) (b) but was an expense, falling within s. 12(1) (a), incurred by the appellant for the purpose of gaining income from property, to which income she was at all relevant times entitled but of which she was unable to obtain payment without incurring these expenses.\nI would allow the appeal, set aside the judgment of the Exchequer Court and restore that of the Income Tax Appeal Board with costs throughout.\nThe judgment of Fauteux and Judson JJ. was delivered by\nFauteux J. (dissenting):\u2014I respectfully agree with the reasons and the conclusion of Mr. Justice Cameron of the Exchequer Court9 and would therefore dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs, Fauteux and Judson JJ. dissenting.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Johnston, Sheard & Johnston, Toronto.\nSolicitor for the respondent: A.

The Queen, [1960] S.C.R. 400\nDate: 1960-04-11\nThomas Kribs, Gerald Griffith, Bernard Griffith and Robert Quirie (Plaintiffs) Appellants;\nand\nHer Majesty The Queen (Defendant) Respondent.\n1960: March 15, 16; 1960: April 11.\nPresent: Kerwin C.J. and Taschereau, Locke, Fauteux and Judson JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.\nCriminal law\u2014Rape\u2014Evidence of complaint\u2014Whether admissible\u2014Person to whom complaint made not called as witness\u2014Whether only bare fact of complaint admissible and not particulars of it.\nThe accused were convicted by a jury on a charge of rape. The only evidence at the trial of any complaint having been made was given by the victim. The person to whom she allegedly complained could not be traced and consequently was not called as a witness in corroboration. The verdict was affirmed by a majority in the Court of Appeal. The accused appealed to this Court on two grounds of law: (1) that the victim\u2019s evidence of the details of the complaint allegedly made by her should not have been admitted at trial, and (2) that the jury should not have been charged that they might conclude from her evidence that her conduct had been consistent throughout. It was conceded by counsel for the accused that the validity of the second ground depended upon the validity of the first.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nThe submission that in the absence of any evidence from the person to whom the complaint was allegedly made, the evidence of the victim as to the fact of the complaint was inadmissible, was ill-founded. The principle upon which such a complaint, not made on oath, nor in the presence of the accused, nor, as in this case, forming part of the res gestae, is admissible in a case of this nature, is one of necessity. It is presumed that the victim will complain at the first reasonable opportunity and, consequently, that her silence might naturally be taken as a virtual self-contradiction of her story. The victim should therefore be entitled to rebut, by her own evidence of complaint, the presumption which would attach to her silence, and that right should not be denied for the sole reason that the person to whom the alleged complaint was made was untraceable. There was no rule, either statutory or of other kind, that such evidence must itself be confirmed or corroborated.\nThe submission that the evidence of complaint should be limited to the fact that a complaint was made without giving any of the particulars of it, could not be entertained. Furthermore, the victim did not give particulars in this case.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1], affirming, by a majority decision, a jury\u2019s verdict on a charge of rape. Appeal dismissed. C. Dubin, Q.C., for the appellants.\nE. Pepper, for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nFAUTEUX J.:\u2014The appellants were convicted by a jury, in the Supreme Court of Ontario, on a charge of rape. The verdict was appealed to the Court of Appeal[2] for the province, and affirmed by a majority decision, Morden J.A. dissenting on two questions of law which now and pursuant to s. 597(1) (a) of the Criminal Code form the basis of this appeal. As stated in appellants\u2019 factum, these two grounds are:\n1. The learned trial Judge erred in admitting the prosecutrix\u2019 evidence of the details of the complaint allegedly made by her.\n2. The learned trial Judge erred in charging the jury that they might conclude from her evidence that her conduct had been consistent throughout.\nFor the appreciation and the consideration of the first ground, it is only necessary, but sufficient, to advert to that phase of the evidence of the prosecutrix, which is related to the complaint itself and to the circumstances immediately contemporaneous with it. Having testified how she had been forcibly conveyed in an automobile to a secluded place and there become the victim of the appellants, she said that she then crossed certain fields to reach the highway where she hailed an approaching truck. She boarded the truck, started to cry and upon the driver\u2019s inquiry as to the cause of her grief, she then made a complaint. Her evidence, the admissibility of which is challenged, proceeds as follows:\nQ. Now, we will go back to the truck again. You were in the truck, you said, going towards Toronto?\nA. Yes.\nQ. Yes. And, having got into the truck, the truck driver asked you a question?\nA. Yes.\nQ. What was the question?\nA. I was crying, and he asked me what was wrong.\nQ. Yes, and did you tell him?\nA. Yes.\nQ. What did you say, please? A. I told him I was attacked by four boys and that my girl friend had got away, and that I didn\u2019t know where she was.\nQ. Yes. Anything else?\nA. He asked me where they were, and I pointed over to the car. You could see it from the truck.\nQ. Yes. You could still see the car?\nA. Yes.\nQ. Now, was there any more conversation?\nA. Yes.\nQ. Go ahead.\nA. He said that he would drive me back to London, but first of all I had to give him a kiss before he would.\nQ. And did you?\nA. No, I never. I got out of the truck.\nQ. You got out of the truck?\nA. Yes.\nWhile she did give a certain description of the truck and of its driver, she did not take the license number of the vehicle nor did she know the driver thereof. In the result, the latter being untraceable, could not be called as a witness and there was consequently no evidence to confirm the fact of her complaint to him.\nAs presented, in the course of the hearing in this Court, the submission made on behalf of the appellants in support of the first ground of appeal is twofold. First, it is said that in the absence of any evidence from the truck driver, the evidence of the prosecutrix as to the fact of the complaint is inadmissible. It is then submitted that even if such evidence is admissible, the particulars of the fact complained of cannot be given in evidence by the prosecutrix as, it is contended, it was in this case.\nThese two points are really the only ones to be considered in this appeal; for, as conceded by counsel for the appellants, the validity of the second ground of appeal, which is related to the address of the trial Judge to the jury on the effect of the evidence of complaint, is conditioned upon the validity of the first for either one of the two points submitted in support of the latter ground.\nNo case in point could be found by counsel for the appellants to support the proposition that evidence of fresh complaint by the prosecutrix is inadmissible in the absence of any evidence from the recipient of such com- plaint. From the following authorities, we were asked to draw, as did the learned dissenting Judge, inferences in affirmance of the validity of this submission.\nThe first is the Lillyman case[3] where both the prosecutrix and the recipient of her complaint testified as to the fact of the complaint. Our attention was called particularly to the following excerpt, at page 170 of the judgment of the Court, delivered by Hawkins J.:\nIt is necessary, in the first place, to have a clear understanding as to the principles upon which evidence of such a complaint, not on oath, nor made in the presence of the prisoner, nor forming part of the res gestae, can be admitted. It clearly is not admissible as evidence of the facts complained of: those facts must therefore be established, if at all, upon oath by the prosecutrix or other credible witness, and, strictly speaking, evidence of them ought to be given before evidence of the complaint is admitted. The complaint can only be used as evidence of the consistency of the conduct of the prosecutrix with the story told by her in the witness-box, and as being inconsistent with her consent to that of which she complains.\nIt was suggested that when speaking of the evidence of complaint, Hawkins J. was referring, not to the prosecutrix\u2019 evidence, but to the evidence of the person to whom she complained. With deference to the dissenting Judge, I am unable to agree with this interpretation. In the consideration of this and the other cases referred to, one is reminded of the two observations made by the Earl of Halsbury L.C. in Quinn v. Leathern[4]:\n\u2026one is\u2026that every judgment must be read as applicable to the particular facts proved, or assumed to be proved, since the generality of the expressions which may be found there are not intended to be expositions of the whole law, but governed and qualified by the particular facts of the case in which such expressions are to be found. The other is that a case is only an authority for what it actually decides. I entirely deny that it can be quoted for a proposition that may seem to follow logically from it.\nWe were then referred to a group of decisions: Rex v. Walker[5]; R. v. Megson[6]; R. v. Guttridge et al.[7]; R. v. Nicholas[8] and R. v. Wallwork[9]. In all of these cases, the prosecutrix did not give evidence, and because of this fact, evidence of the recipient of the complaint as to the fact or the particulars of the outrage complained of was rejected. Reference was also made to Rex v. Osborne[10]; Rex. v. Lovell[11]; Thomas v. The Queen[12]; Rex v. Washington[13] and Rex v. Lebrun[14], where comments are made with respect to the confirmatory or corroborative nature of the evidence of the recipient of the complaint. While the testimony of the recipient of a complaint may be confirmatory or corroborative of the testimony of the prosecutrix as to the fact and the particulars of the complaint made by her, it does not follow that the admissibility of the evidence of the prosecutrix, as to these matters, is conditioned upon the corroboration or confirmation by the recipient. The comments made in these cases are of no assistance and, in my view, beyond the point here to be decided.\nFinally, we were referred to Phipson On Evidence, 9th ed., at page 133, where it is said that:\nThe complaint should be proved by calling both the prosecutrix herself and the person to whom it was made.\nThe authorities relied on by Phipson for this statement do not, as it was ultimately conceded at the hearing, on behalf of the appellants, support the same.\nCounsel for the appellants properly called our attention to two cases where the validity of his first submission is negatived. One is R. v. Eyre[15]. The other is R. v. Ball[16], where Coady J.A. delivering the judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia, said:\nThe evidence of the complainant as to the complaint made by her would be admissible in evidence, it seems to me, even if the party to whom the complaint was made was not called as a witness. The failure to call the party as a witness, or if called, to confirm what was said by the complainant, goes to the weight to be attached to the complainant\u2019s evidence.\nWith this statement of the law and for the reasons hereafter given, I am in complete agreement.\nThe argument underlying appellants\u2019 proposition is that by adding to her recital of the outrage, the fact that she complained about it, the prosecutrix confirms her own story and enhances her credibility. This, it is said, can only properly be done, not by her own, but by independent evidence. The true question, in my view, is not what is the effect of evidence of fresh complaint, but what is the principle upon which such complaint, not made on oath, nor in the presence of the accused, nor, as in this case, forming part of the res gestae, is admissible in a case of the nature of the one here considered.\nThe principle is one of necessity. It is founded on factual presumptions which, in the normal course of events, naturally attach to the subsequent conduct of the prosecutrix shortly after the occurrence of the alleged acts of violence. One of these presumptions is that she is expected to complain upon the first reasonable opportunity, and the other, consequential thereto, is that if she fails to do so, her silence may naturally be taken as a virtual self\u2011contradiction of her story. In Hawkins\u2019 Pleas of the Crown, quoted by Hawkins J. in the Lillyman case, supra, at page 170, it is said:\nIt is a strong, but not a conclusive, presumption against a woman that she made no complaint in a reasonable time after the fact.\nIn Wigmore On Evidence, vol. 4, 3rd ed., p. 218, reference is made to the history of the evidence of complaint in the case of rape and, at page 220, it is said:\n(b) So, where nothing appears on the trial as to the making of such a complaint, the jury might naturally assume that none was made, and counsel for the accused might be entitled to argue upon that assumption. As a peculiarity, therefore, of this kind of evidence, it is only just that the prosecution should be allowed to forestall this natural assumption by showing that the woman was not silent, i.e. that a complaint was in fact made.\nThis apparently irregular process of negativing evidence not yet formally introduced by the opponent is regular enough in reality, because the impression upon the tribunal would otherwise be there as if the opponent had really offered evidence of the woman\u2019s silence. Thus the essence of the process consists in the showing that the woman did not in fact behave with a silence inconsistent with her present story. The Courts have fully sanctioned this analysis of the situation.\nThus it appears that by giving evidence of her conduct shortly after the alleged occurrence, the prosecutrix does not, in a sense, enhance or confirm her story any more than she does in reciting all that she did in resistance to the assault, but she rebuts a presumption and, in doing so, adds, for all practical purposes, a virtually essential complement to her story. In the Lovell case, supra, Lord Chief Justice Hewart, in reference to that type of evidence, said this, at page 169:\nThere is a clear distinction between matters which affect the intrinsic credibility of the witness\u2019s own story when that story is considered by itself, and, on the other hand, corroborative evidence in the sense of independent testimony proceeding from a source other than the prosecutrix and implicating the accused; and it may be that sometimes the distinction between those two things has not been kept clearly in view. Historically, as Sir Richard Muir has pointed out in the cases he has cited and in the passages he has read from Hale\u2019s Pleas of the Crown, in sexual cases the fact of complaint by the prosecutrix was admitted, not so much as new matter tending to support a story sufficient in itself, but rather as an indispensable ingredient in the story of the prosecutrix, without which the story of the prosecutrix would be open to grave suspicion. Historically, that appears to be the origin of the admissibility of evidence of this kind, and in the opinion of the Court the right direction is that which is given in the case of Lillyman in the passage already referred to.\nWhere an accused is charged with rape, the Judge shall, if the only evidence that implicates the accused is the evidence, given under oath, of the female person in respect of whom the offence is alleged to have been committed and that evidence is not corroborated in a material particular by evidence that implicates the accused, instruct the jury that it is not safe to find the accused guilty in the absence of such corroboration, but that they are entitled to find the accused guilty if they are satisfied, beyond a reasonable doubt, that her evidence is true. (Criminal Code, s. 134). Furthermore and if evidence of fresh complaint has been adduced, it is also the duty of the Judge to impress upon the jury that they are not entitled to make use of the complaint as any evidence whatever of the facts complained of but that evidence can only be legitimately used by them for the purpose of enabling them to judge for themselves whether the conduct of the woman was consistent with her testimony on oath, given in the witness box, negativing her consent and affirming that the acts complained of were against her will, and in accordance with the conduct they would expect in a truthful woman, under the circumstances detailed by her. (The Queen v. Lillyman, supra, pp. 177 and 178). But there is no rule, either statutory or of other kind, suggesting that the prosecutrix\u2019 evidence as to fresh complaint must itself be confirmed or corroborated. And there seems to be no valid reason why, in cases such as the present, where the recipient of an alleged complaint is untraceable, the prosecutrix should be denied the right to rebut, by her own evidence of complaint, the factual presumption which would otherwise attach to her silence as to the matter. If appellants\u2019 contention were accepted, a prosecutrix, complaining at the first opportunity to an untraceable witness, might possibly be denied the right to testify that, immediately after this first complaint, she complained to another person available as a witness, on the basis that the former but not the latter complaint was really the one made at the first opportunity.\nFor all these reasons, I agree with the majority of the Court of Appeal that appellants\u2019 first submission is ill-founded.\nThe second objection to the evidence, which is that evidence of complaint should be limited to the fact that a complaint was made without giving any of the particulars of it, was also considered in The Queen v. Lillyman, supra, at page 171 et seq., and at page 177, Hawkins J. said:\nAfter very careful consideration we have arrived at the conclusion that we are bound by no authority to support the existing usage of limiting evidence of the complaint to the bare fact that a complaint was made, and that reason and good sense are against our doing so.\nIt is true that in the Lillyman case, supra, both the prosecutrix and the person to whom she complained were heard as witnesses. However, the reasons given against limiting the evidence of the complaint to the bare fact of that complaint are equally present in cases where the evidence of complaint by the prosecutrix is the only evidence as to fresh complaint.\nI am also in respectful agreement with the Chief Justice for Ontario that, in the present instance, the prosecutrix did not give particulars. I would, therefore, dismiss the appeal. There should be an order that the time spent in custody under the sentences, pending the disposition of this appeal, be allowed as time served under the said sentences.\nAppeal dismissed.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Young & Hutchinson, Woodstock.\nSolicitor for the respondent: W.C.

Subsequently a separate school was established and he became a supporter of that school and was so assessed. In the period from January 1946 to September 1954, seven by-laws authorizing the issue of debentures for public school purposes were passed by the municipality. In the year 1958, the municipal tax bill in respect of the plaintiff\u2019s property claimed, in addition to the separate school rate, an amount to raise the instalments of principal and interest falling due in that year upon the debentures issued pursuant to the seven by-laws. The plaintiff\u2019s action, seeking a declaration that his property was exempt from the payment of all rates imposed for public school purposes, was dismissed by the trial judge. This judgment was reversed by the Court of Appeal. The municipality appealed to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed and the action maintained.\nThe plaintiff, on becoming a separate school supporter, ceased to be liable either personally or to have his property charged for rates subsequently imposed to discharge the debentures. The exemption from the payment of all rates imposed for the support of public schools given by s. 56(1) of The Separate Schools Act is qualified by s. 56(6) and by s. 3 of The Public Schools Act, but only in respect of rates annually imposed before the establishment of a separate school and in respect of any liability already incurred. The rates are not imposed by the debenture by-laws, but are imposed annually when the rating by-law is passed. Nothing in s. 3 creates any liability; the section does no more than provide for the continuation of a liability which can only be found in the limited one arising under s. 56(6) for the rate imposed under the annual rating by-law before the taxpayer becomes a separate school supporter or before the establishment of a separate school.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1], reversing a judgment of Aylen J. Appeal dismissed.\nS.S. Maclnnes, Q.C., for the defendant, appellant.\nA. Kelly, Q.C., and J.K. Smith, for the plaintiff, respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nJUDSON J.:\u2014The respondent sued the appellant township for a declaration that he, as a separate school supporter, was exempt from the payment of all rates imposed for public school purposes, including levies imposed for the purpose of paying the annual instalments of principal and interest on certain debentures issued by the appellant before September 28, 1954. The learned trial judge dismissed his action. The Court of Appeal1 reversed this judgment and granted the declaration asked for. The Township now appeals.\nIn the period from January 24, 1946 to September 28, 1954, the Township authorized seven issues of debentures, totalling $1,014,000 for the purpose of constructing and equipping public schools in Public School Area no. 1. During this period the respondent was a public school supporter within this school area. Between 1954 and 1957 a Roman Catholic separate school was established. The respondent then became a separate school supporter. In the assessment roll prepared for the year 1957 and upon which rates and taxes were levied in the year 1958, the respondent was properly entered and rated as a separate school supporter.\nIn the year 1958 the municipal tax bill issued by the Township in respect of the respondent\u2019s property claimed for school purposes the appropriate separate school rate and, in addition, an amount which was the aggregate of the rates allegedly imposed on the respondent to raise the instalments of principal and interest falling due in the year 1958 upon the debentures issued pursuant to the seven by-laws passed before the establishment of the separate school. The respondent then brought his action.\nThe only part of the declaration sought which needs to be considered in these reasons is in these sharply defined terms:\nA declaration that the plaintiff and the taxable property of the plaintiff are exempt for the year 1958 and for every subsequent year while the plaintiff continues a supporter of a separate school from the payment of all rates imposed by the defendant for the support of public schools and public school libraries, or for the purchase of land or the erection of buildings for public school purposes or for the interest and principal of debentures issued to secure money borrowed for public school purposes.\nThe learned trial judge held that s. 3 of The Public Schools Act, R.S.O. 1950, c. 316, and s. 56, subs. (6) of The Separate Schools Act, R.S.O. 1950, c. 356, exempted the respondent from any further personal liability for public school taxes after he became a separate school supporter, but that the lands of the respondent remained charged with the amount required to pay off the debentures in question.\nThe Court of Appeal held that the exemption from the payment of rates imposed for public school purposes provided for in subs. (1) of s. 56 of The Separate Schools Act was unrestricted save as to any rate imposed before the exemption became effective; that the relevant statutes do not create a liability at large upon separate school supporters to pay taxes to meet debenture payments upon debentures for public school purposes issued prior to the establishment of a separate school, but create only a liability to pay taxes according to rates actually imposed before the exemption becomes effective; and that the passing of a debenture by-law in itself does not impose such a rate, a rate being imposed only by some proceedings taken to fix and collect such rate after the actual rate has annually been determined.\nI would affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeal for the reasons given. The error in the judgment at trial was in the finding that the lands of the respondent were charged with the amounts required to pay off those debentures from the date of their issue. The problem arises because of a supposed conflict between s. 56 of The Separate Schools Act, R.S.O. 1950, c. 356, and s. 3 of The Public Schools Act, R.S.O. 1950, c. 316. The two relevant subsections of s. 56 of The Separate Schools Act read:\n56. (1) Every person paying rates, whether as owner or tenant, who by himself or his agent, on or before the 15th day of July in any year, gives to the clerk of the municipality notice in writing that he is a Roman Catholic and a supporter of a separate school situate in the municipality or in a municipality contiguous thereto shall be exempt from the payment of all rates imposed for the support of public schools and of public school libraries, or for the purchase of land or the erection of buildings for public school purposes within the city, town, village or section in which he resides, for the following year, and every subsequent year thereafter while he continues a supporter of a separate school.\n(6) Nothing in this section shall exempt any person from paying any rate for the support of public schools, or public school libraries, or for the erection of a schoolhouse or schoolhouses, imposed before the establishment of the separate school.\nSection 3 of The Public Schools Act reads:\nNothing in this Act authorizing the levying or collecting of rates on taxable property for public school purposes shall apply to the supporters of Roman Catholic separate schools, except that all taxable property shall continue to be liable to taxation for the purpose of paying any liability incurred for public school purposes while the property was subject to taxation for such purposes.\nThe exception did not come into s. 3 of The Public Schools Act until the year 1909 by 9 Ed. VII, c. 89. But for this exception there would be nothing to qualify the sweeping exemption contained in s. 56(1) of The Separate Schools Act except the qualification of minor scope contained in subs. (6) of s. 56 of the same Act. This minor qualification only relates to rates annually imposed before the exemption becomes effective. These rates are imposed annually by the municipality when the rating by-law is passed. They are not imposed by the debenture by-laws even though each by-law contains a section to the following effect:\nCOMMENCING in the year 1955 and thereafter in each year in which an instalment of principal of the said debt and interest become due, the Corporation shall levy and raise the specific sum shown for the respective year in the fourth column of the said Schedule. Such sum shall be levied and raised by a special rate sufficient therefore, over and above all other rates, upon all the rateable property of ratepayers who are supporters of Public Schools in School Area No. 1 of the Township of Crowland. The debenture by-law is authorized by s. 56(2) of The Public Schools Act, R.S.O. 1950, c. 316, made applicable to rural schools by s. 58 of the same Act, and there is nothing in this legislation to authorize the imposition of a rate by debenture by-law. The section above quoted from the debenture by-law does no more than provide that certain sums are to be levied annually. There can, however, be no rate ascertained in any one year until the number of ratepayers and the assessed value of their properties are determined for that year by the annual Assessment Roll. The sums required become rates only when the amount for which each ratepayer is liable is determined, and the rate is not imposed upon a ratepayer before the passing of the annual by-law fixing and imposing the rate. This is the principle stated In Re Separate Schools Act[2].\nThe historical review of s. 56(6) of The Separate Schools Act contained in the reasons of the Court of Appeal reinforces this interpretation. As originally enacted by 16 Victoria, c. 185, s. 4 (Statutes of Canada 1852-53), it read:\n\u2026nor shall such exemption extend to school rates or taxes imposed or to be imposed to pay for School Houses, the erection of which was undertaken or entered into before the establishment of such separate School.\nA significant change was made in this exemption in 1855 by 18 Victoria, c. 131, s. 12. As amended, it became the recognizable predecessor of s. 56(6) in the following form:\nProvided always, that nothing herein contained shall exempt any such person from paying any rate for the support of Common Schools or common School Libraries, or for the erection of a School-house or School-houses, which shall have been imposed before such Separate School was established.\nWhat the legislation did in 1855 is to me quite clear. \u201cRates or taxes to be imposed\u201d were taken out of the exception to the exemption thus limiting such exception to rates imposed before the establishment of a separate school. There has been no substantial change in subs. (6) of s. 56 of The Separate Schools Act since the year 1855.\nI turn now to the interrelation between s. 3 of The Public Schools Act and s. 56 of The Separate Schools Act. Section 3 of The Public Schools Act came into the legislation in two stages\u2014the first in 1874 and the second in 1909. In 1874, by 37 Victoria, c. 28, s. 193, it was enacted in the following unambiguous terms and it remained unchanged until the year 1909:\nNothing in this Act authorizing the levying or collecting of rates on taxable property for public school purposes shall apply to the supporters of Roman Catholic separate schools.\nStanding in this form, the section could not be in conflict with the exemption contained in The Separate Schools Act. However, in 1909, by 9 Ed. VII, c. 89, the following exception was added.\n\u2026except that all taxable property shall continue to be liable to taxation for the purpose of paying any liability incurred for public school purposes while such property was subject to taxation for such purposes.\nThe appellant\u2019s main submission on the appeal is that the combined effect of the 1909 exception to s. 3 of The Public Schools Act, together with the above quoted section of the debenture by-law directing the levy for the purpose of paying the debentures, is to make the respondent, as a municipal taxpayer, liable to contribute to the payment of these debentures until they are fully paid even after he has become a separate school supporter.\nIt would be a strange result if this exemption were to be cut into by legislation of the kind enacted in 1909, which takes the form of an exception to an exemption already defined in the broadest terms. The fallacy in the appellant\u2019s submission is that nothing in s. 3 creates any liability. The section does no more than provide for the continuation of a liability which must be found elsewhere and the only liability that is to be found elsewhere is the limited one arising under s. 56(6) of The Separate Schools Act for the rate imposed under the annual rating by-law before the taxpayer becomes a separate school supporter or before the establishment of a separate school.\nThere is nothing in the debenture by-law nor in the legislation authorizing its issue which amounts to the imposition of rates within the meaning of s. 56(6) of The Separate Schools Act. Neither the debentures nor their supporting legislation create a charge against land. The main import of the supporting legislation (which is s. 56 of The Public Schools Act) is to provide that the money required for capital purposes by public schools is to be raised by debentures of the municipality, and subs. (2) is added solely for internal purposes to indicate that the money which will be raised annually to pay the debentures must come, not from all ratepayers of the municipality but only from those who are supporters of the public schools and thus to ensure that no part of the money for the debentures shall be raised from separate school supporters.\nThe Municipal Act, R.S.O. 1950, c. 243, s. 308, provides that a yearly rate be levied sufficient to pay all the debts payable within the year. When the council has taken the appropriate action to determine what the annual rate shall be, to cause it to be levied, and to turn the collection over to the collector, then only is there a rate which becomes chargeable against the property of the ratepayer.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the defendant, appellant: Raymond, Spencer, Law & Machines, Welland.\nSolicitors for the plaintiff, respondent: Day, Wilson, Kelly, Martin & Campbell, Toronto.\n[1] [1960] O.R. 9, 20 D.L.R.

The Queen, [1960] S.C.R. 414\nDate: 1960-04-11\nDream Home Contests (Edmonton) Limited Appellant;\nand\nHer Majesty The Queen Respondent.\nRonald A. Hodges Appellant;\nand\nHer Majesty The Queen Respondent.\n1960: February 5; 1960: April 11.\nPresent: Taschereau, Locke, Fauteux, Martland and Ritchie JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF ALBERTA, APPELLATE DIVISION\nCriminal law\u2014Lotteries\u2014Scheme whereby ticket purchaser most closely estimating value of house would receive same as prize\u2014Retention of trust company to assist in conduct of scheme-operators deposited sufficient sum to guarantee prize awarded even if only one ticket sold\u2014whether illegal lottery under s. 179(1) (e) of the Criminal Code, 1953-54 (Can.), c. 51.\nThe appellants conducted a scheme whereby any person buying a ticket for $1 would be entitled to submit an estimation of the value of a house and its contents, and the closest estimator would receive the house with its contents and the land on which the house would be transported. A trust company, engaged to assist in the conduct of the scheme, required, as a condition for providing its services, that the operators deposit a sum sufficient to assure payment for the house and to guarantee that the house would be awarded to the winner of the contest. The accused were convicted of conducting a scheme under s. 179(1) (e) of the Criminal Code. The conviction was affirmed by a majority in the Court of Appeal.\nHeld: The appeals should be dismissed.\nPer Taschereau and Fauteux JJ.: Under s. 179(1) (e) of the Code, the element of chance is not essential. Consequently, following the decision of Roe. v. The King [1949] S.C.R. 652, the offence was committed even if skill had been the only factor that allowed the winner to determine the value of the house, since it was clear that the purchasers of tickets became entitled under the scheme to receive from the operators a larger sum than the amount paid because others had also paid money under the same scheme. The fact that the winner was to receive a house and not a \"larger sum of money\" or \"amount of valuable security\" did not prevent the application of the section, since the words \"valuable security\" are defined in s. 2(42) of the Code as including \"a document of title to lands or goods wheresoever situate\".\nThe argument that the house was to be conveyed, not by the promoters, but by the trust company, could not be accepted. Everything done by the trust company was done on behalf of the promoters.\nPer Locke, Fauteux, Martland and Ritchie JJ.: The submission that by depositing a sufficient sum of money with the trust company, the prize would be awarded irrespective of whether or not any other tickets had been sold, could not be entertained. What constitutes the offence under s. 179(1) (e) is the conducting of a scheme by which a participant will receive, as in this case, a larger amount of valuable security than he paid because other persons have contributed to the scheme. The deposit with the trust company was only made by reasons of the fact that it was part of a scheme by which contestants would pay money to enter the contest. This brought the case squarely under the prohibition of the section.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Supreme Court of Alberta, Appellate Division1, affirming the appellants' convictions under s. 179(1) (e) of the Criminal Code. Appeals dismissed.\nJ. W. McClung, for the appellants.\nH. J. Wilson, Q.C., and J. W. Anderson, for the respondent. The judgment of Taschereau and Fauteux JJ. was delivered by\nTaschereau J.:\u2014Both appellants were charged under ss. 179(1) (a) and 179(1) (e) of the Criminal Code of Canada.\nUnder s. 179(1) (a) the charges read as follows:\nTHE INFORMANT SAYS THAT he has reasonable and probable grounds to believe and does believe that\nDREAM HOME CONTESTS (EDMONTON) LIMITED\nbeing a body corporate, between the 1st day of May A.D. 1959, and the 27th day of June A.D. 1959, at the City of Edmonton, Province of Alberta, did unlawfully advertise a scheme, to wit: the Dream Home Contest, for the purpose of disposing of property, to wit: the Fekete Dream Home, to be disposed of by a mode of chance, contrary to the provisions of Section 179(1) (a) of the Criminal Code.\nTHE INFORMANT SAYS THAT he has reasonable and probable grounds to believe and does believe that\nRONALD A. HODGES\nbetween the 1st day of May A.D. 1959, and the 27th day of June A.D. 1959, at the City of Edmonton, Province of Alberta, did unlawfully advertise a scheme, to wit: the Dream Home Contest, for the purpose of disposing of property, to wit: The Fekete Dream Home, to be disposed of by a mode of chance. Contrary to the provisions of Section 179(1) (a) of the Criminal Code.\nThe charges under 179(1) (e) read as follows:\nTHE INFORMANTS SAYS THAT he has reasonable and probable grounds to believe and does believe that\nDREAM HOME CONTESTS (EDMONTON) LIMITED\nbeing a body corporate, between the 1st day of April A.D. 1959, and the 27th day of June A.D. 1959, at the City of Edmonton, Province of Alberta, did unlawfully conduct a scheme by which a person upon payment of a sum of money shall become entitled under the scheme to receive from the said Company a larger amount of valuable security than the amount paid by reason of the fact that other persons have paid a sum of money under the scheme. Contrary to the provisions of Section\n179(1) (e) of the Criminal Code.\nTHE INFORMANT SAYS THAT he has reasonable and probable grounds to believe and does believe that\nRONALD A. HODGES\nbetween the 1st day of April A.D. 1959, and the 27th day of June A.D. 1959, at the City of Edmonton, Province of Alberta, did unlawfully conduct a scheme by which any person upon payment of a sum of money shall become entitled under the scheme to receive from the person conducting the scheme, or any other person, a larger amount of valuable security than the amount paid by reason of the fact that other persons have paid a sum of money under the scheme. Contrary to the provisions of Section 179(1) (e) of the Criminal Code. The learned magistrate dismissed both charges under 179(1) (a) but convicted both defendants under 179(1) (e).\nHis reasons for dismissing the charges under 179(1) (a) were that under that section, a mixed element of chance and skill entered into the estimates made by those who purchased tickets, while the statutes in order to apply required exclusively a chance element. The magistrate based his opinion on the unanimous judgment rendered by this Court in, Roe v. The King2 where that precise point was definitively settled.\nThe Crown did not appeal this part of the judgment to the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta, and it is therefore unnecessary to deal with it. But. the magistrate convicted both accused on the charge of violating section 179(1) (e), and the Appellate Division3 confirmed his finding, Mr. Justice Johnson dissenting.\nWe have now to deal only with the appeals of Dream Home Contests (Edmonton) Limited and Ronald A. Hodges, both convicted under s. 179(1) (e).\nSection 179(1) (e) reads:\n179. (1) Every one is guilty of an indictable offence and is liable to imprisonment for two years who\n(e) conducts, manages or is a party to any. scheme, contrivance or operation of any kind by which any person, upon payment of any sum of money, or the giving of any valuable security, or by obligating himself to pay any sum of money or give any valuable security, shall become entitled under the scheme, contrivance or operation, to receive from the person conducting or managing the scheme, contrivance or operation, or any other person, a larger sum of money or amount of valuable security than the sum or amount paid or given, or to be paid or given, by reason of the fact that other persons have paid or given, or obligated themselves to pay or give any sum of money or valuable security under the scheme, contrivance or operation.\nThe scheme as engineered was as follows:\u2014The appellants built a house called a \"Dream Home\" that was on display to the public on a lot situate at 117th Street and Jasper Avenue in Edmonton, Alberta. The accused issued a brochure showing who built the Home and giving the names of the 17 suppliers of materials and subcontractors. The contestants eligible to participate in the contest had to purchase a one dollar ticket, and were required to esti- mate the total retail value of this Dream Home with attached garage, including its furnishings, appliances, fixtures and appointments therein contained.\nIt was a condition of the contest that the contestant who most closely estimated the total retail value of the Dream Home, would be awarded the Home, and that it would be conveyed by the company to a permanent lot, in the subdivision of Lynnwood in the Townsite of Jasper Place. The retail value of the Dream Home was to be determined by the persons, firms or corporations supplying products and services in connection with the construction, furnishing, equipping and completing the Home as displayed.\nThe sealed estimates of retail value by those who had purchased tickets, were held \"In Trust\" by the Northwest Trust Company Limited until the close of the contest, which was December 30, 1959, at which time a committee appointed by the Trust company was to open the sealed estimates, and the contestant who most closely estimated the retail value of the Home would be the contest winner. Some 400,000 tickets were printed of which a substantial number were sold, and Home Contests (Edmonton) Limited and the other defendant Hodges, who is the main shareholder and manager of the said company, deposited with the Trust company $31,000 to be drawn against, as the building of the Home progressed.\nI am quite satisfied that in order to determine the retail value of this Dream Home, much more than a mere element of chance was necessary. It was essential for the winner to have at least a fair knowledge of construction, of cost of materials, etc. etc., and skill was obviously a much more important factor than chance in determining the retail value of the Home.\nBut the law as it exists today is the same as that considered in Roe v. The King, supra. In that case, Roe had been prosecuted under the first part of s. 236(c) as it then existed, and secondly, under the second part of the same section added to the Criminal Code in 1935 (25-26 Geo. V, ch. 56, s. 3). Under the new Code of 1955, the corresponding sections are 179(1) (d) and 179(1) (e). In the Roe case it was held that the charge under the first part of the old s. 236(c) ought to be dismissed. It was found that there was a mixed element of skill and chance and that, therefore, there could be no offence.\nBut the Court held that under the second part of the former s. 236(c), now 179(1) (e), there is no reference to chance or to a mixed element of chance and skill, and that the receiving of money was not subordinated to either of these elements. Roe was found guilty because a larger sum of money was paid to the winner, by reason of the fact that other persons had paid money under the scheme.\nIn the present case, it seems clear to me that the purchasers of tickets who pay money, may become entitled under the scheme as they do, to receive from the person managing the operation, a larger sum than the amount paid, because others have also paid money under the same scheme. A ticket purchaser who happens to be the winner, as a result of his skilful guessing, even if the element of chance is entirely absent, receives a larger sum of money than the amount he has paid, because some others who have purchased tickets have also paid money under the same scheme. This is the gist of the offence. It may not be immoral but it is illegal.\nIn s. 179(1) (a) the element of chance is essential, but it is not in 179(1) (e). In Roe v. The King this Court has said:\nThis part of s. 236(c) now 179(1) (e) which stands alone, does not refer to chance, or to mixed chance and skill. The receiving of money is not subordinated to any of these elements. The larger sum of money is paid to the winner by reason of the fact that other persons have paid money under this scheme.\nI think that this Court is bound by its own decision in the Roe case cited supra, and that the offence is committed, even if skill has been the only factor that allowed the winner to determine the retail value of the Dream Home.\nIt has been suggested that s. 179(1) (e) does not apply, because the winner here does not receive as contemplated by the Act a \"larger sum of money\" or \"amount of valuable security\" than the sum or amount paid or given. In the present case, the winner was to receive a house. This argument cannot stand in view of the fact that the words \"valuable security\" are defined in s. 2, subs. 42 of the Criminal Code, and include \"a document of title to lands or goods wheresoever situate.\"\nIt has also been argued that the house was to be conveyed to the winner, not by the promoters of the scheme, but by the Trust company. I am satisfied that everything done by the Trust company was done on behalf of the promoters and that this argument cannot be accepted. As to the appellants' submission that by paying $31,000 to the Trust company, they assured the award of the prize to the successful estimator, irrespective of whether or not any tickets had been sold, I agree with what has been said by my brother Martland.\nBoth appeals should be dismissed.\nThe judgment of Locke, Fauteux, Martland and Ritchie JJ. was delivered by\nMartland J.:\u2014The appellant company is incorporated under the laws of the Province of Alberta. The appellant, Hodges, was a signatory of its Memorandum of Association and is its majority shareholder. In mid 1959, the appellant company caused to be erected a house, which was fully furnished, and which was on display at 117th Street and Jasper Avenue, in the City of Edmonton.\nThe appellant company advertised extensively a contest, which was to continue until the end of the year 1959, under the terms of which the house and its contents would be awarded to the contestant who submitted the closest estimate of the actual retail value of the house, including furnishings and fixtures. Entry into the contest could be effected by the purchase of tickets sold at $1 each. These tickets contained an estimate form and an entry blank. The appellant company had 400,000 tickets printed. At the time of the trial, some 1,400 had been sold. The winner of the contest would be entitled to receive, in addition to the house and its contents, a lot in the subdivision of Lynwood, in the townsite of Jasper Place, to which the house and its contents would be moved by the appellant company after completion of the contest. Arrangements were made by the appellant company to have the tickets widely distributed for sale in Edmonton and in Northern Alberta, by having sales effected through various community leagues and branches of the Canadian Legion.\nThe appellants approached Northwest Trust Company which agreed to receive sealed tenders from the contractors and suppliers in connection with the house which, taken together, would establish its total retail value. The trust company also agreed to receive, record, and dispose of the tickets to the ticket vendors upon the instructions of the appellant company. It also received the moneys derived from the sale of tickets, part of which was to be held by it in trust for the vendors of the tickets, and the balance in trust for the appellant company.\nAs a condition of providing these services, the trust company required the deposit by the appellant company of $31,000 to assure payment of certain expenditures, including the payment for the house. This was to ensure that the house would be awarded to the winner of the contest. Title to the house, to its contents, and to the lot, was taken in trust by the trust company.\nThe arrangements for the printing and distribution of the tickets, the arrangements with the trust company, and, generally, most of the arrangements in respect of the con- test, were effected for the appellant company by the appellant Hodges.\nBoth the appellants were charged under paras. (a) and (e) of subs. (1) of s. 179 of the Criminal Code. The charges under para. (a) were dismissed, but both appellants were convicted by the learned magistrate under para. (e). From these convictions, both appellants appealed, unsuccessfully, to the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta,4 Mr. Justice Johnson dissenting. The present appeal relates solely to the convictions under para. (e), which provides as follows:\n179. (1) Every one is guilty of an indictable offence and is liable to imprisonment for two years who\n* * *\n(e) conducts, manages or is a party to any scheme, contrivance or operation of any kind by which any person, upon payment of any sum of money, or the giving of any valuable security, or by obligating himself to pay any sum of money or give any valuable security, shall become entitled under the scheme, contrivance or operation, to receive from the person conducting or managing the scheme, contrivance or operation, or any other person, a larger sum of money or amount of valuable security than the sum or amount paid or given, or to be paid or given, by reason of the fact that other persons have paid or given, or obligated themselves to pay or give any sum of money or valuable security under the scheme, contrivance or operation;\nThe sole contention of each of the appellants is that no offence was shown because the winning estimator would not become entitled to a larger amount of valuable security because other persons had paid or obliged themselves to pay any sum of money. It was argued that the awarding of the prize was wholly exclusive of the participation in the contest of other unsuccessful estimators. The appellant's submission was that, by paying the $31,000 to the trust company, the appellant company had assured the award of the prize to the successful estimator, who would receive such prize irrespective of whether or not any other tickets had been sold.\nThe appellants seek to distinguish the decision of this Court in Roe v. The King,5 because of the fact that, in that case, which involved a contest to estimate the time for a barrel to float down the Red River from the international boundary to Winnipeg, the appellant had signed an admission that the winning estimators would receive a larger sum of money that that paid for their tickets because other non-winning estimators had contributed to the scheme. In the present case it is contended that the situation is different because the winning of the prize did not depend upon the sale of tickets to non-winning estimators.\nA similar argument was made on behalf of the appellant in Rex v. Blain,6 a judgment of the Court of Appeal of Saskatchewan. In that case the contest involved the estimating of the actual time when the ice in the Saskatchewan River at Prince Albert would break up. Tickets were sold at fifty cents per ticket but the prize of $1,000 was donated by the Kinsmen Club of Prince Albert, who also paid the cost of operating the scheme, thus leaving the proceeds from the sale of the tickets available for charitable purposes. The accused, Blain, was the individual who had managed the scheme.\nThe conviction of the appellant was sustained by the Court of Appeal. In his judgment, at p. 151, Chief Justice Martin referred to the admission made by the appellant in the Roe case, and to the statement by Taschereau J. at p. 657 in that case, that the admission \"brings the case within the prohibition of the statute\".\nChief Justice Martin then goes on to say, and, I think, correctly:\nThis statement was not intended to mean that the only scheme which falls within the second part of sec. 236(1) (c) (the equivalent of sec. 179(1) (e) of the present Criminal Code) is one in which the larger sum comes from the proceeds of the sale of tickets to non-winning estimators. Moreover, the language of the section indicates that the prize need not come from moneys contributed by a limited class of persons. The larger sum of money may come from the person managing the scheme \"or any other person\" by reason of the fact that \"other persons have paid or given \u2026 any sum of money \u2026 under such scheme\".\nIt seems to me that what constitutes the offence defined in s. 179(1) (e) is the conducting of a scheme and the question to be determined, in this case, is whether, under the scheme, a participant will receive a larger amount of valuable security than he paid because other persons have contributed to the scheme. The deposit of the $31,000 with the trust company was a part of an overall scheme conducted by the appellants. That scheme, when examined as a whole, in my view, clearly contemplated, at its inception and throughout, that the award by the appellant company of the prize to the winning estimator would be made at the conclusion of the contest by reason of the payments for tickets of all the other non-winning contestants. The deposit of the funds with the trust company was only made by the appellant company by reason of the fact that it was a part of a scheme by which contestants would pay money to enter the contest. As Macdonald J. A. said, in his judgment in the Appellate Division:\nThe property to be won would be paid for initially by money which came from the appellants, according to the arrangement made with the trust company. But it seems to me there can be no doubt that under the scheme in question, the appellants sought not only to recoup themselves for their initial outlay but also to make a substantial margin of profit, depending upon the number of tickets sold. The number of tickets seized by the police demonstrates that many tickets had been sold to the public, so at the time of such seizure the scheme was well under way. It seems to me that it has been proved beyond any reasonable doubt that the winner would be entitled to receive from the appellant company \"a larger \u2026 amount of valuable security than the sum paid\" by him \"by reason of the fact that other persons have paid \u2026 any sum of money under the scheme\", namely, by the purchase of tickets. The facts proved in evidence beyond any reasonable doubt, in my view, bring the case squarely under the prohibition of the statute.\nIn my opinion, therefore, the appeals of both the appellants should be dismissed.\nAppeals dismissed.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Maclean & McClung, Edmonton.\nSolicitor for the respondent: The Attorney-General for Alberta.\n1 (1959-60), 30 W.W.R. 130, 126 C.C.C. 30.\n2 [1949] S.C.R. 652, 94 C.C.C. 273, 2 D.L.R. 785.\n3 (1959-60), 30 W.W.R. 130, 126 C.C.C. 30.\n4 (1959-60), 30 W.W.R. 130, 126 C.C.C. 30.\n5 [1949] S.C.R. 652, 94 C.C.C. 273, 2 D.L.R. 785.\n6 [1951] 1 W.W.R. 145, 99 C.C.C. 152.\n"

It was provided that if after the five-year period the leased substances were not being produced and the lessee was then engaged in drilling or working operations thereon, the lease would remain in force so long as such operations continued or if any materials were produced so long as the materials were produced. The lessee had the right to pool or combine the lands or any portion thereof with adjoining lands to form a unit, and drilling operations on or production from any lands included in such unit would have the affect of continuing the lease. Clause 3 required the lessee to pay a yearly royalty for all wells on the said lands where gas only or primarily was found and not used or sold, and while the royalty was paid, such wells were to be deemed producing wells. The lease defined the term \"said lands\" as meaning \"all the lands hereinbefore described or referred to\". The plaintiff did not drill any wells on the quarter section or produce any of the substances, but in 1952 drilled a gas well on the north-east quarter of the same section. This well was capped and not connected to any gathering system. Shortly before the expiry of the five year period, the plaintiff gave a notice pooling the south-east quarter with other land, including the quarter on which the gas well had been drilled and capped, and tendered the yearly royalty. The plaintiff's action for a declaration that the lease was in full force and effect was dismissed by the trial judge. This judgment was affirmed by the Court of Appeal.\nHeld: The lease no longer subsisted.\nThe five-year term had expired and there was no well on the quarter-section and no production from the well on the north-east quarter. The pooling provision, in itself, did not result in any extension of the primary five-year term. To be effective to continue the lease in force, drilling operations had to be of the kind defined in the lease, and none of that kind had been made. The capped well was not a producing well under clause 3 so as to continue the term of the lease beyond the five-year period. Prima facie, clause 3 could only apply in relation to a gas well on the quarter section and there was no such well. The pooling provision did not provide that the existence of a non-producing gas well on some part of the unit, other than the quarter section, would have the same effect in extending the term as though it were upon the quarter section itself.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Supreme Court of Alberta, Appellate Division1, affirming a judgment of Primrose J. Appeal dismissed.\nR. A. MacKimmie, Q.C., and J. H. Laycraft, for the plaintiff, appellant.\nJ. M. Robertson, Q.C., for the defendant, respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nMartland J.:\u2014The issue in this case is as to whether a petroleum and natural gas lease, dated July 19, 1950, granted by Herbert Frank Morris to the appellant in respect of the south-east quarter of section 13, township 21, range 29, west of the 4th meridian, in the Province of Alberta (hereinafter referred to as \"the quarter section\"), is still in force and effect, as contended by the appellant, or whether it expired at the end of its primary term of five years, as contended by the respondent. The respondent is the executor of the last will and testament of Herbert Frank Morris, the lessor, who is now deceased. The learned trial judge and the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta2, by unanimous judgment, have decided in favour of the respondent.\nThe lease stated that the lessor, being registered as owner of the quarter section, in consideration of the payment to him of $2,500 by the appellant and in consideration of the royalties in the lease reserved:\nDOTH HEREBY GRANT AND LEASE unto the Lessee all the petroleum and natural gas and related hydrocarbons except coal and valuable stone, (hereinafter referred to as the \"leased substances\"), within, upon or under the lands hereinbefore described \u2026\nTO HAVE AND ENJOY the same for the term of Five (5) years from the date hereof and so long thereafter as the leased substances or any of them are produced from the said lands, subject to the sooner termination of the said term as hereinafter provided.\nThis was followed by a proviso, not applicable in the circumstances of this case, and then by a further proviso which reads, in part, as follows:\nAND FURTHER ALWAYS PROVIDED that if at any time after the expiration of the said Five (5) year term the leased substances are not being produced on the said lands and the Lessee is then engaged in drilling or working operations thereon, this Lease shall remain in force so long as such operations are prosecuted and, if they result in the production of the leased substances or any of them, so long thereafter as the leased substances or any of them are produced from the said lands; \u2026\nThe other clauses of the lease material to this appeal are the following:\n1. In this Lease, unless there is something in the subject or context inconsistent therewith, the expressions following shall have the following meaning, namely:\n* * *\n(b) \"Drilling unit\" shall mean a section, legal sub-division or other unit of land representing the minimum area in which any well may be drilled on or in the vicinity of the said lands as defined or prescribed by or under any law of the Province of Alberta now or hereafter in effect governing the spacing of petroleum and\/or natural gas wells.\n(c) \"Said lands\" shall mean all the lands hereinbefore described or referred to, or such portion or portions thereof as shall not have been surrendered.\n* * *\n3. Provided no royalties are otherwise paid hereunder, the Lessee shall pay to the Lessor each year as royalty the sum of Fifty Dollars ($50.00) for all wells on the said lands where gas only or primarily is found and the same is not used or sold, and while the said royalty is so paid each such well shall be deemed to be a producing well hereunder.\n* * * 9. The Lessee is hereby given the right and power at any time and from time to time to pool or combine the said lands, or any portion thereof, with other lands adjoining the said lands, but so that any one such pool or unit (herein referred to as a \"unit\") shall not exceed one drilling unit as hereinbefore defined, when such pooling or combining is necessary in order to conform with any regulations or orders of the Government of the Province of Alberta or any other authoritative body, which are now or may hereafter be in force in relation thereto. In the event of such pooling or combining, the Lessor shall, in lieu of the royalties elsewhere herein specified, receive on production of leased substances from the said unit, only such portion of the royalties stipulated as the area of the said lands placed in the unit bears to the total area of lands in such unit. Drilling operations on, or production of leased substances from, any land included in such unit shall have the same effect in continuing this Lease in force and effect during the term hereby granted, or any extension thereof, as to all the said lands, as if such operation or production were upon or from the said lands, or some portion thereof.\nThe material facts are not in dispute. No well has ever been drilled by the appellant on the quarter section and since the date of the lease, none of the leased substances has been actually produced from the quarter section. In 1952, the appellant drilled a gas well on the north-east quarter of the same section as that in which the quarter section is situated. This well was capped and is not connected to any gathering system. It is capable of producing natural gas but it has not been on production because of the lack of an outlet for the gas. Under the Drilling and Production Regulations established pursuant to The Oil and Gas Resources Conservation Act, 1950, c. 46, Statutes of Alberta, 1950, the spacing unit for a gas well was a section of land.\nIn June 1955, shortly before the five-year primary term of the lease had expired, the appellant served upon the respondent a notice in the following form:\nTO: Honorable Einar Maynard Gunderson, Esq.,\nExecutor of the Estate of Herbert Morris, Deceased,\n4240 Elbow Drive, Calgary, Alberta.\nRe: A-554-P & N.G.

GADBOIS\nPer:___________________________\nRobert N. Gadbois\nManager, Land Department.\n\"F.J.C.\"\nc.c. Honorable Einar Maynard Gunderson, Esq.,\n1016\u2014475 Howe Street, Vancouver 1, B.C.\nArea Production\nCalgary Division Land\nCalgary Division Production.\nWith this notice was tendered a cheque for $50. Prior to July 19, in each year subsequent to 1955, the appellant tendered to the respondent the sum of $50. None of such tendered payments was accepted by the respondent.\nThe question in issue is as to whether, as a result of the drilling of the well on the north-east quarter, the service of the notice dated June 22, 1955, to pool into a unit the quarter section and the remaining three quarter sections in the same section, and the tender of the annual payments of $50, the term of the lease was extended beyond the five-year period.\nThe term is defined as:\nfive (5) years from the date hereof and so long thereafter as the leased substances or any of them are produced from the said lands \u2026\nThe five-year term has expired. Admittedly, there is no well on the quarter section, and there has not been production from the well on the north-east quarter.\nThe appellant, however, relies upon the pooling provision, clause 9, and particularly upon the last sentence of that paragraph, which states:\nDrilling operations on, or production of leased substances from, any land included in such unit shall have the same effect in continuing this Lease in force and effect during the term hereby granted, or any extension thereof, as to all the said lands, as if such operation or production were upon or from the said lands, or some portion thereof. This provision, in itself, would not appear to result in any extension of the primary five-year term. It provides for drilling operations on or production of leased substances from any land included in the unit having the same effect, in extending the term of the lease, as if they were upon or from the quarter section.\nDrilling operations, in order to be effective to continue the lease in force beyond the five-year term, would have to be of the kind defined in the proviso to the habendum clause, which has been previously quoted. That proviso refers to drilling operations \"after the expiration of the five-year term\". The proviso takes effect only if the lease has been extended as a result of production and if, when production ceases, the lessee is then engaged in drilling operations. The only drilling operations on the unit in this case occurred and were completed in 1952 long before the five-year term expired. They were not drilling operations of the kind contemplated by the proviso.\nIn so far as the provision of clause 9 relating to production of leased substances is concerned, it does not, in itself, serve to extend the five-year term under the provisions of the habendum clause, previously quoted, because there was no production from any part of the unit at the time when the five-year term expired.\nHowever, the appellant then refers to the provisions of clause 3 of the lease. Its contention is that the capped well, though not located on the quarter section, was on the unit which resulted from the pooling notice, that such capped well by virtue of clause 3 was deemed to be a producing well under the lease and, therefore, leased substances were deemed to be produced from the quarter section after the five-year period expired so as to continue the term of the lease.\nThe appellant's case must, therefore, depend upon the validity of this interpretation of clause 3 of the lease. That clause relates solely to wells where gas only or primarily is found and the same is not used or sold. The well on the north-east quarter section falls within that category, but the clause restricts this description by referring only to wells \"on the said lands\". The definition clause, (1)(c), provides that unless there is something in the subject or context inconsistent therewith \"said lands\" \"shall mean all the lands hereinbefore described or referred to, or such portion or portions thereof as shall not have been surrendered.\" The only lands \"hereinbefore described\" were the lands in the quarter section which were described, at the commencement of the lease, by their legal description. Prima facie, therefore, clause 3 could only apply in relation to a gas well on the quarter section and there was no such well.\nThe appellant contends, however, that \"said lands\" where used in clause 3 refers to the whole section because of the provisions as to pooling contained in clause 9. However, I cannot see anything in the subject or context of clause 3 which is inconsistent with giving to the expression \"said lands\" its defined meaning in that clause.\nClearly, the appellant did not consider \"said lands\" in clause 3 to be the whole of the section in the years 1953 and 1954, after the well on the north-east quarter had been drilled, for there appears to have been no tender of any $50 or other payment in those years. The appellant must, therefore, contend that whereas \"said lands\" in clause 3 meant only the quarter section prior to June 22, 1955, the date of the pooling notice, the meaning changed thereafter, because of the pooling notice, so as to include the whole of the section. I do not agree with this. The subject and context of clause 3 in which the words \"said lands\" appear remain the same. There is not, in my view, anything contained in clause 9 sufficient to provide that the existence of a non-producing gas well on some part of the unit, other than the quarter section, shall have the same effect in extending the term of the lease as though it were upon the quarter section itself.\nI am, therefore, of the opinion that the appellant's contention fails and that the judgments in the courts below correctly decided that the lease in question no longer subsists. I think that this appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the plaintiff, appellant: Chambers, Might, Saucier, Peacock, Jones, Black & Gain, Calgary.\nSolicitors for the defendant, respondent: Fenerty, Fenerty, McGillivray, Robertson, Prowse & Brennan, Calgary.\n1 [1959], 28 W.W.R. 506.\n2 [1959], 28 W.W.R. 506.\n"

He has been detained in a penitentiary by the authority of a Calendar of Sentences under the seal of the Court of General Sessions of the Peace. His appeal from the conviction was dismissed and leave to appeal to this Court was refused. He then moved for a writ of habeas corpus which was refused by a judge of this Court. His appeal from the sentence having been dismissed by the Court of Appeal and leave refused by this Court, he now appeals from the refusal of the writ.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed; the application for a writ of habeas corpus was rightly dismissed.\nPer Kerwin C.J.: The Calendar was a certificate regular on its face that the accused had been convicted by a Court of competent criminal jurisdiction and, therefore, it was impossible to go behind it on an application for habeas corpus. There was no substance in the objection that the description of the offence was insufficient; nor did it make any difference that the Court of General Sessions of the Peace was not a superior court of criminal jurisdiction.\nAs to the argument that the sentencing provisions of the former Code should have been applied, there was nothing to indicate that the evidence before the jury did not disclose that the conspiracy commenced after April 1, 1955. The Court of Appeal having heard and dismissed an appeal as to sentence, any judge in Ontario would be bound by that decision and, therefore, any judge of this Court, having by virtue of s. 57 of the Supreme Court Act concurrent jurisdiction with the Court or judges of Ontario, would be similarly bound. There was now no justification for the idea that, if a person is refused a writ of habeas corpus by one judge, he may go to each judge in succession to renew his application.\nPer Taschereau, Fauteux, Abbott and Judson JJ.: The question sought to be determined by the accused\u2014the maximum penalty for the offence of which he was convicted\u2014would require consideration of the evidence at trial, and would be tantamount to converting the writ into a writ of error or an appeal. The functions of such a writ do not extend beyond an inquiry into the jurisdiction of the Court by which process the subject is held in custody and into the validity of the process upon its face.\nThe accused was convicted and sentenced by a Court of competent jurisdiction, the Calendar was a certificate regular on its face, and the application for the writ was rightly dismissed.\nPer Locke and Cartwright JJ.: What was sought by the accused was an adjudication on the question as to what was the maximum penalty for the offence of which he was convicted. That was a point which the trial judge had jurisdiction to decide, and which could be further pursued on appeal. The writ of habeas corpus is not a writ of course and may be refused where an alternative remedy by which the validity of the detention can be determined is available. So long as the sentence of a competent Court stands unreversed, it is a legal justification for the imprisonment. On the facts of this case, the writ was rightly refused, and a fortiori it should be refused now as the very question which the accused seeks to have decided was res judicata between the parties.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of Martland J. of the Supreme Court of Canada1, refusing a writ of habeas corpus. Appeal dismissed.\nG. B. Langille, for the appellant.\nD.H.W. Henry, Q.C., and L. E. Levy, for the respondent.\nThe Chief Justice:\u2014Jack Goldhar applied to Martland J. under s. 57 of the Supreme Court Act, R.S.C 1952, c. 259, for a writ of habeas corpus ad subjiciendum. That section reads as follows:\n57.(1) Every judge of the Court, except in matters arising out of any claim for extradition under any treaty, has concurrent jurisdiction with the courts or judges of the several provinces, to issue the writ of habeas corpus ad subjiciendum, for the purpose of an inquiry into the cause of commitment in any criminal case under any Act of the Parliament of Canada.\n(2) If the judge refuses the writ or remands the prisoner, an appeal lies to the Court.\nThe writ was refused2 and under the authority conferred by subs. (2) Goldhar appealed to the Court.\nOn April 27, 1956, Goldhar had been found guilty in the Court of General Sessions of the Peace for the County of York in the Province of Ontario under the first count of an indictment charging that he and others at the City of Toronto, in the County of York and elsewhere in the Province of Ontario, between the fifteenth day of March and the sixth day of August in the year 1955, unlawfully did conspire together, the one with the other or others of them and persons unknown, to commit the indictable offence of having in their possession a drug, to wit., diacetyl-morphine, for the purpose of trafficking, an indictable offence under the Opium and Narcotic Drug Act, contrary to the Criminal Code. On May 4, 1956, he was sentenced by the judge presiding in the General Sessions of the Peace, His Honour Judge Macdonell, to twelve years imprisonment in the Kingston Penitentiary. Presumably shortly thereafter he was taken to the institution where he is now incarcerated.\nA search was made by a solicitor on behalf of the appellant in the Records Office of the Kingston Penitentiary and there was produced to him a Calendar of Sentences,\u2014Sessions\u2014as being the authority under which the appellant was detained. That calendar was a certificate, dated May 4, 1956, signed by the Deputy Clerk of the Peace, York, and under the seal of the Court of General Sessions of the Peace in and for the County of York, certifying that the name of the prisoner was \"Goldhar, Jack\", that the offence was \"conspiracy (to have in possession a drug for the purpose of trafficking)\", that the date of sentence was \"4th May, 1956\" and that the sentence was \"Twelve years in the Kingston Penitentiary\". Attached to the solicitor's affidavit was a copy of the Calendar of Sentences and a copy of the indictment with the endorsement of the conviction and sentence on the back. The affidavit stated that the deponent had been advised by a stenographer in the Records Office of the penitentiary that the Calendar is the only document received at such office \"when a person is convicted by a Judge at a Court of General Sessions of the Peace or by a Judge at a County Court\"; and that, \"it is only in the situation where a conviction is registered by a magistrate or the Supreme Court that Form 18 of the forms set out in the Criminal Code is used as the Warrant of Committal to Kingston Penitentiary\". Furthermore, he was advised that the Calendar of Sentences,\u2014Sessions was the only authority by which Goldhar was detained in custody. An appeal by Goldhar to the Court of Appeal for Ontario from his conviction was dismissed and an application for leave to appeal from that dismissal to this Court was refused. He thereupon launched the motion for a writ of habeas corpus, which was heard in October and November 1958, and his appeal from the order of Martland J. came on for hearing in June 1959. It then appearing that he had not applied to the Court of Appeal for Ontario for leave to appeal from his sentence, the appeal before us was adjourned in order to permit him to seek such leave, with permission to renew his appeal to this Court after the disposition of his application to the Court of Appeal. That Court granted him leave to appeal from his conviction restricted to the ground:\nWhether Section 408(l)(d) of Criminal Code, 1953-54, Ch. 51 is applicable to the conspiracy committed since, if it is not, the maximum sentence for a conspiracy not specifically named in Criminal Code. R.S.C. 1927, Ch. 36 is found under Section 573 of said statute, namely seven years.\nWhen, pursuant to such leave, his appeal from sentence was heard by the Court of Appeal, it was dismissed. An application by him to appeal to this Court3 from that dismissal was refused. Thereupon, pursuant to the leave reserved to him, he renewed his appeal before us from the order of Martland J. and that appeal was heard on March 7 and 8 of this year.\nSections 49(1) and 51 of the Penitentiaries Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 206 enact:\n49. (1) The sheriff or deputy sheriff of any county or district, or any bailiff, constable, or other officer, or other person, by his direction or by the direction of a court, or any officer appointed by the Governor in Council and attached to the staff of a penitentiary for that purpose, may convey to the penitentiary named in the sentence, any convict sentenced or liable to be imprisoned therein, and shall deliver him to the warden thereof, without any further warrant than a copy of the sentence taken from the minutes of the court before which the convict was tried, and certified by a judge or by the clerk or acting clerk of such court.\n51. The warden shall receive into the penitentiary every convict legally certified to him as sentenced to imprisonment therein, unless certified by the surgeon of the penitentiary to be suffering from a dangerously infectious or contagious disease, and shall there detain him, subject to the rules, regulations and discipline thereof, until the term for which he has been sentenced is completed, or until he is otherwise legally discharged, but a convict, if certified by the surgeon to be suffering in manner aforesaid, may remain and be kept in his former custody until his condition in the opinion of the surgeon justifies withdrawal of the certificate.\nBy s. 2 of The General Sessions Act, R.S.O. 1950, c. 158, it is provided:\n2. The courts of general sessions of the peace shall have jurisdiction to try all criminal offences except homicide, and the offences mentioned in section 583 of the Criminal Code (Canada).\nSection 583 referred to was in the old Criminal Code. By s. 2(10) of the new Criminal Code, 1953-54, c. 51, which came into force April 1, 1955,\n\"court of criminal jurisdiction\" means\n(a) a court of general or quarter sessions of the peace, when presided over by a superior court judge or a county or district court judge, ............................................................................................\nand by s. 413 of the new Code\n413. (1) Every superior court of criminal jurisdiction has jurisdiction to try any indictable offence.\n(2) Every court of criminal jurisdiction has jurisdiction to try an indictable offence other than ........................................................................................... (Certain offences which do not include that of which the accused was convicted.)\nThe Calendar is a certificate regular on its face that the appellant was convicted by a court of competent criminal jurisdiction and therefore it is impossible to go behind it on an application for habeas corpus; Re Trepanier4; Re Sproule5; In re Henderson6.\nThere is no substance in the appellant's objection that the description of the offence in the Calendar as \"conspiracy (to have in possession a drug for the purpose of trafficking)\" is insufficient; nor does it make any difference that the Court of General Sessions of the Peace is not a superior court of criminal jurisdiction; Rex v. Martin7.\nWhile what has been said is sufficient to dispose of the appeal, reference might be made to the argument on behalf of the appellant that as he was found guilty of a charge of having conspired between March 15 and August 6, 1955, and the new Criminal Code came into force on April 1, 1955, the provisions of the old Code applied and he could not be sentenced to more than seven years imprisonment, which was the maximum provided for under the old Code for conspiracy to commit an indictable offence. Under s. 573 of the old Criminal Code the maximum penalty for conspiracy to commit an indictable offence was seven years. Under s. 408(1) (d) of the new Criminal Code the maximum penalty for conspiracy to commit an indictable offence (other than conspiracy to murder, conspiracy to bring a false accusation or conspiracy to defile) is the same as the penalty imposed in respect of the particular indictable offence regarding the commission of which there has been a conspiracy. In the case of having in possession a drug for the purpose of trafficking, the maximum penalty, under s. 4(3) (b) of the Opium and Narcotic Drug Act, is fourteen years. There is nothing to indicate that the evidence before the jury did not disclose that the conspiracy commenced after April 1, 1955, and that therefore the new Code would apply. The Court of Appeal having heard and dismissed an appeal as to sentence any judge in Ontario would be bound by that decision and I agree with what was held by Gwynne J. in In re Boucher8, by Sedgewick J. in In re Patrick White9 and by Girouard J. in In re Charles Seeley10 that, therefore, any judge of this Court, having concurrent jurisdiction with the court or judges of the Province of Ontario under what is now s. 57 of the Supreme Court Act, would be similarly bound.\nIn the Seeley case the order of Girouard J. was confirmed on appeal on other grounds and Chief Justice Fitzpatrick, speaking for the Court, referred to the remarks of Lord Herschell in Cox v. Hakes11, where Lord Herschell stated that it was always open to an applicant for a writ of habeas corpus, if defeated in one court, at once to renew his application to another, and that a person detained in custody might thus proceed from court to court until he obtained his liberty. In Smith v. The King12, Chief Justice Anglin stated that had it been competent for the Court to deal with that aspect of the case before him, he would have been disposed to think Mr. Justice Newcombe right as the latter had decided in the same sense as in the three earlier cases mentioned above. The dissenting opinion of Lament J. in Smith v. The King refers to Lord Halsbury's statement, at p. 514 of Cox v. Hakes:\u2014\"If release was refused a person detained might\u2014see Ex parte Partington\u2014make a fresh application to every judge or every court in turn\". Lamont J. also referred to what Lord Herschell had stated at p. 527 in Cox v. Hakes. Lamont J. also referred to the decision of the Privy Council in Eshugbayi Eleko v. Government of Nigeria13. However, the judgments in connection with various applications by Edward Thomas Hastings show that whatever may have been the position at one time, there is now no justification for the idea that, if a person is refused a writ of habeas corpus by one judge, he may go to each judge in succession to renew his application.\nFrom the report in In re Hastings14, it appears that Hastings had been convicted on each count of an indictment containing five counts. The warrant of commitment sent to the Governor of Walton Prison, Liverpool, where the applicant was detained, stated:\nWhereas ............................................. Edward Thomas Hastings is and stands covicted of larceny, false pretences and fraudulent conversion. It is therefore ordered and adjudged by this court that (he) be sent for corrective training of four years.\nThe applicant applied for leave to appeal against the convictions and leave was given in respect of the first and two of the other counts. The Court of Criminal Appeal quashed the conviction on the first count and the appeal in relation to the two other counts was dismissed. Pearson J. in giving the judgment of the Court stated that the applicant had been \"sentenced on each count concurrently\", that although leave to appeal against sentence had not been asked for, the sentence was, in the view of the Court, reasonable and \"the conviction on the first ground is quashed \u2026\u2026 and there will be no alteration of sentence\". The report in (1958) 1 W.L.R. is the report of an application for a writ of habeas corpus to the Queen's Bench Division on the ground that his detention was illegal, the main argument being that no sentence of the Court was ever passed upon him. That application was denied. Hastings thereupon appealed to the Court of Appeal who refused to entertain the application on the ground that being a criminal cause or matter that Court had no jurisdiction; (The Times, July 29, 1958.).\nThe next step was an application for a writ of habeas corpus to the Queen's Bench Division differently constituted in In re Hastings (No. 2)15. Lord Parker, speaking for himself and Hilbery and Diplock JJ., referred to the statement of Lord Esher when Cox v. Hakes was before the Court of Appeal under the title Ex parte Cox16, that \"it is not correct to say that under the old system there could be an application to all the judges in succession\". He then remarked that none of Their Lordships in the House of Lords dissented from Lord Esher's statement, unless it be Lord Halsbury in the passage quoted. It was pointed out that the decision in the Eleko case had remained unquestioned except in an Irish case, but it was held that the applicant, having already once been heard by a Divisional Court of the Queen's Bench Division, is not entitled to be heard again by another Divisional Court of the same Division.\nThe next step appears in In re Hastings (No. 3)17, where a Divisional Court of the Chancery Division held that an applicant for a writ of habeas corpus in a criminal cause or matter, who had once been heard by a Divisional Court of the Queen's Bench Division, cannot be heard again by a Divisional Court of the Chancery Division. Finally, to complete the picture, an appeal from this decision to the Court of Appeal in In re Hastings (No. 3)18 was dismissed on the ground that no appeal lay to the Court of Appeal.\nIn fact, all reason is consonant with the opposite rule and it is unthinkable that after the Court of Appeal for Ontario has decided a point against the accused on the latter's appeal as to sentence, any judge in that province would decide differently on an application for a writ of habeas corpus. Under s. 57 of the Supreme Court Act every judge of this Court has merely concurrent jurisdiction with the courts or judges of Ontario to issue a writ of habeas corpus and upon an appeal to the Court the latter may make only that order which the single judge would have had power to make.\nThe appeal should be dismissed.\nThe judgment of Taschereau, Fauteux, Abbott and Judson JJ. was delivered by\nFauteux J.:\u2014The appellant appeals from an order of Martland J. refusing his application for a writ of habeas corpus ad subjudiciendum.\nThe question, which counsel for the appellant admittedly sought to be determined by way of habeas corpus proceedings, is stated in the reasons for judgment of other members of the Court. In my view, it is one which would require the consideration of the evidence at trial and which, in this particular case, extends beyond the scope of matters to be inquired under a similar process. To hold otherwise would be tantamount to convert the writ of habeas corpus into a writ of error or an appeal and to confer, upon every one having authority to issue the writ of habeas corpus, an appellate jurisdiction over the orders and judgments of even the highest Courts. It is well settled that the functions of such a writ do not extend beyond an inquiry into the jurisdiction of the Court by which process the subject is held in custody and into the validity of the process upon its face.\nI agree with the view that the appellant has been convicted and sentenced by a Court of competent jurisdiction, that the Calendar is a certificate regular on its face that the appellant has been so convicted and sentenced and that, with the material before him, Martland J. rightly dismissed the application for a writ of habeas corpus.\nI would, therefore, dismiss the appeal.\nThe judgment of Locke and Cartwright JJ. was delivered by\nCartwright J.:\u2014This is an appeal from an order of Martland J. made on November 20, 1958, refusing the appellant's application for a writ of habeas corpus ad subjiciendum19. The relevant facts and the history of the proceedings are set out in the reasons of the Chief Justice.\nI do not find it necessary to deal with all the points which were so fully and ably argued before us. Assuming, contrary to the argument of counsel for the respondent, that Martland J. had jurisdiction to entertain the application I am of opinion that he was right to refuse the writ.\nBefore Martland J. and on the argument of this appeal counsel agreed that, if any objection could have been made successfully to the adequacy of the document held by the warden of the Penitentiary as authority for detaining the appellant, it would have been in order for the warden to obtain a proper minute or warrant of committal setting out the offence of which the appellant was convicted in the terms of the indictment. Counsel for the appellant made it plain that what he sought before Martland J. and before us was an adjudication on the question whether the maximum penalty for the offence of which the appellant was convicted was seven years or fourteen years in view of the circumstance that the indictment alleged a conspiracy between March 15 and August 6 in the year 1955, and if the offence were committed before April 1, 1955, the maximum penalty was seven years while if it were committed after that date the maximum was fourteen years. In my opinion this is a difficult question of law; and my brother Fauteux, in giving the judgment of the majority of the Court in Goldhar v. The Queen20, delivered on November 30, 1959, described it as \"undoubtedly one of substance\".\nIt was, however, a point which the learned Judge who presided at the trial of the appellant in the Court of General Sessions of the Peace had jurisdiction to decide, and if in the view of the appellant he erred in law in reaching his decision the proper course for the appellant to pursue was to appeal to the Court of Appeal.\nThe writ of habeas corpus ad subjiciendum is a writ of right and is issued ex debito justitiae, upon it being shown that there is ground for believing that the applicant is unlawfully held in custody, so that the Court may inquire into the cause of his imprisonment and in a proper case order his immediate release; but it is not a writ of course and may be refused where an alternative remedy by which the validity of the detention can be determined is available to the applicant. In Ex part Corke21, Lord Goddard, delivering the judgment of the Queen's Bench Division in which Slade J. concurred, said that habeas corpus is not a means of appeal where an accused has been convicted and sentenced by a court of competent jurisdiction. The remedy in such a case is by way of appeal; for so long as it stands unreversed the sentence of a competent court is a legal justification for imprisoning the applicant.\nI wish to reserve my opinion as to whether the writ is available if the warrant of committal shows on its face that the sentence was one not permitted by law.\nWhen the matter came before Martland J. it appeared from the material that the appellant had been convicted and sentenced by a court of criminal jurisdiction having jurisdiction to try the appellant on the charge of which he was convicted, that an appeal against the conviction had been taken and dismissed and that no appeal had been taken against the sentence imposed. On this state of the record, in my view, Martland J. was right in refusing the writ, for the judgment of His Honour Judge Macdonell unless set aside by the Court of Appeal furnished a sufficient ground for holding the applicant in custody.\nA fortiori, we should refuse the writ now that the sentence imposed by His Honour has been affirmed by a judgment of the Court of Appeal and an application for leave to appeal to this Court from that judgment has been refused by this Court. The very question which the applicant seeks to have decided on this application is res judicata between the parties. In giving the judgment of the Privy Council in Sambasivam v. Public Prosecutor Federation of Malaya22, Lord MacDermott said:\nThe maxim \"Res judicata pro veritate accipitur\" is no less applicable to criminal than to civil proceedings.\nThe question of the legality of the sentence imposed on the applicant has been conclusively determined by a court of competent jurisdiction and cannot be re-opened; this results not from the application of the principle of stare decisis but from the operation of the rule stated in the maxim quoted above, \"Res judicata pro veritate accipitur\".\nSince the question of the legality of the sentence imposed on the appellant has become res judicata nothing would be gained by endeavouring to form an opinion as to how it should have been answered had it remained open; I have already said that it appears to me to be one of difficulty and I venture to express my regret that we have not the benefit of knowing the reasons which brought the Court of Appeal to the conclusion at which it arrived.\nI would dispose of the appeal as proposed by the Chief Justice.\nAppeal dismissed.\nSolicitor for the appellant: M. Robb, Toronto.\nSolicitor for the respondent: The Attorney-General of Ontario.\n1 [1958] S.C.R. 692, 122 C.C.C. 113, 16 D.L.R. (2d) 509.\n2 [1958] S.C.R. 692, 122 C.C.C. 113, 16 D.L.R.

Consequently, at any time before final judgment is obtained, a plaintiff may, by incidental demand or amendment, claim additional damages resulting from the same cause of action.\nThe plaintiff instituted an action within the one year prescribed by art. 2262 of the Civil Code for damages for bodily injuries resulting from a motor vehicle accident. Some 25 months later he claimed an additional amount of damages by way of incidental demand. The trial judge maintained the action and awarded damages on both the principal and the incidental demands. The Court of Appeal maintained the action but rejected the incidental demand as being prescribed.\nHeld: The judgment at trial should be restored since the incidental demand was not prescribed.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench, Appeal Side, Province of Quebec1, modifying the judgment of Cliche J.

Lagac\u00e9, for the defendant Robert, respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nTaschereau J.:\u2014Dans son action, institu\u00e9e le 25 mars 1954, le demandeur-appelant all\u00e8gue que le 9 octobre 1953, il \u00e9tait passager dans le taxi du d\u00e9fendeur-intim\u00e9 Antonio Lussier. Ce dernier conduisait son automobile sur la route de Granby en direction de Montr\u00e9al, lorsqu'\u00e0 un certain moment il aper\u00e7ut sur la route le camion du d\u00e9fendeur Patenaude, fit une brusque man\u0153uvre \u00e0 gauche pour l'\u00e9viter, mais perdit le contr\u00f4le de son v\u00e9hicule, et se pr\u00e9cipita dans le foss\u00e9 du c\u00f4t\u00e9 gauche.\nComme cons\u00e9quence de cet accident, le demandeur fut gravement bless\u00e9, et a poursuivi conjointement et solidairement le propri\u00e9taire, conducteur du taxi dans lequel il se trouvait, et Patenaude, propri\u00e9taire du camion situ\u00e9 sur la route, attribuant \u00e0 chacun la faute commune de cet accident \u00e0 cause de leur imprudence, de leur inhabilet\u00e9 et de leur inattention. Le montant de la r\u00e9clamation a \u00e9t\u00e9 de $8,091.50.\nLe 23 novembre 1955, le demandeur a produit une demande incidente au montant de $5,599.85, dans laquelle il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que ces dommages additionnels d\u00e9coulaient de l'accident survenu au mois d'octobre 1953, mais dont l'existence ne se serait manifest\u00e9e que dans le cours de l'ann\u00e9e 1955.\nL'honorable juge au proc\u00e8s a, le 2 mai 1956, maintenu la demande principale jusqu'\u00e0 concurrence de $3,639, et a aussi accord\u00e9 sur la demande incidente la somme de $4,518.17, formant un total de $8,157.17. Apr\u00e8s ce jugement, l'un des d\u00e9fendeurs originaires Patenaude est d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9 et son \u00e9pouse, Dame Gabrielle Robert, a repris l'instance devant la Cour du Banc de la Reine.\nCe dernier tribunal2 a confirm\u00e9 la condamnation conjointe et solidaire prononc\u00e9e contre les d\u00e9fendeurs, a modifi\u00e9 cependant le montant accord\u00e9 sur l'action principale, l'a r\u00e9duit \u00e0 $1,139, et a rejet\u00e9 la demande incidente avec d\u00e9pens.\nLe montant accord\u00e9 sur la demande principale a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9duit parce que l'incapacit\u00e9 de dix pour cent soufferte par le demandeur aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 la cons\u00e9quence des faits all\u00e9gu\u00e9s dans la demande incidente, et non de ceux mentionn\u00e9s dans la demande principale. La Cour, M. le Juge Bissonnette dissident, a \u00e9t\u00e9 d'avis que la demande incidente devait \u00eatre rejet\u00e9e, puisqu'elle avait \u00e9t\u00e9 form\u00e9e alors que la prescription lib\u00e9ratoire avait \u00e9t\u00e9 acquise au b\u00e9n\u00e9fice des intim\u00e9s.\nDevant cette Cour, la question de responsabilit\u00e9 conjointe et solidaire prononc\u00e9e par la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure et la Cour du Banc de la Reine ne se pr\u00e9sente pas, de sorte que deux seules questions sont soumises \u00e0 notre consid\u00e9ration.\nLa premi\u00e8re, celle de savoir si les all\u00e9gations contenues dans la demande principale sont suffisantes pour justifier le tribunal de conclure que le dix pour cent d'incapacit\u00e9 permanente doit \u00eatre accord\u00e9 sur cette demande principale, ou sur la demande incidente, ne pr\u00e9sente qu'un int\u00e9r\u00eat secondaire, si cette derni\u00e8re doit \u00eatre maintenue. J'y reviendrai cependant plus tard.\nLe point essentiel sur lequel cette Cour est appel\u00e9e \u00e0 se prononcer et dont d\u00e9pendra le sort de ce litige, est donc de d\u00e9terminer la date o\u00f9 s'est \u00e9teint le droit du demandeur, faute de diligence, d'exercer par demande incidente le recours additionnel en dommages pour lesquels il r\u00e9clame une compensation. Il s'agit \u00e9videmment ici d'une r\u00e9clamation pour l\u00e9sions ou blessures corporelles. L'article 2262 du Code Civil donne \u00e0 la victime une ann\u00e9e pour exercer son recours en dommages contre l'auteur de l'accident, qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 la cause du pr\u00e9judice. C'est un cas de prescription abr\u00e9g\u00e9e o\u00f9 le l\u00e9gislateur a substitu\u00e9 \u00e0 la prescription trentenaire un plus court d\u00e9lai dans lequel la victime doit exercer son droit.\nL'action principale a \u00e9t\u00e9 institu\u00e9e cinq mois et demi apr\u00e8s l'accident, donc, dans le temps voulu; mais la demande incidente par laquelle le demandeur d\u00e9clame des dommages additionnels n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 produite que le 23 novembre 1955, soit deux ans et un mois apr\u00e8s la date de l'accident, et un an et huit mois apr\u00e8s la date de la demande principale.\nLes intim\u00e9s soutiennent que cette demande est tardive, que le droit du demandeur n\u00e9 du fait fautif de l'auteur du quasi-d\u00e9lit est totalement \u00e9teint par le laps de temps. On invoque l'art. 2262 C.C. qui se lit ainsi:\n2262. L'action se prescrit par un an dans les cas suivants:\n2. (Pour l\u00e9sions ou blessures corporelles, sauf les dispositions sp\u00e9cialement contenues en l'article 1056; et les cas r\u00e9gl\u00e9s par des lois sp\u00e9ciales.)\nEt additionnellement on a recours \u00e0 l'argument que si la prescription annale a \u00e9t\u00e9 interrompue par l'institution de l'action principale, elle a recommenc\u00e9 \u00e0 courir pour le m\u00eame temps \u00e0 cause de l'application de l'art. 2264 C.C. dont voici le texte:\n2264. Apr\u00e8s la renonciation ou l'interruption, except\u00e9 quant \u00e0 la prescription de dix ans en faveur des tiers, la prescription recommence \u00e0 courir pour le m\u00eame temps qu'auparavant, s'il n'y a novation, sauf ce qui est contenu en l'article qui suit.\nL'action institu\u00e9e le 25 mars 1954 aurait donc interrompu la prescription, date o\u00f9 elle a recommenc\u00e9 \u00e0 courir pour \u00eatre d\u00e9finitivement acquise le 25 mars 1955. Or, comme la demande incidente n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 produite que le 23 novembre 1955, il s'ensuivrait que le demandeur-appelant n'a pas exerc\u00e9 dans le temps prescrit par la loi, le droit auquel il pouvait pr\u00e9tendre. Ce d\u00e9faut de montrer la diligence requise dans le d\u00e9lai l\u00e9gal le priverait ainsi de r\u00e9clamer la r\u00e9paration du pr\u00e9judice, constat\u00e9 en 1955 mais d\u00e9coulant de l'accident survenu en 1953. Le juge au proc\u00e8s n'a pas reconnu la valeur l\u00e9gale de cette pr\u00e9tention, mais la Cour du Banc de la Reine, M. Le Juge Bissonnette dissident, a conclu que le droit du demandeur de r\u00e9clamer par voie de demande incidente un montant additionnel \u00e9tait \u00e9teint, parce que tardif.\nLe jour m\u00eame o\u00f9 le jugement de la Cour du Banc de la Reine a \u00e9t\u00e9 rendu dans la pr\u00e9sente cause, cette m\u00eame Cour, dans une cause de La Cit\u00e9 de Sherbrooke v. Fortin3, rendait une d\u00e9cision dans un sens oppos\u00e9. Le Banc, form\u00e9 de MM. les Juges Bissonnette, Casey et Choquette, pronon\u00e7ait l'arr\u00eat suivant:\nOnce the action has been instituted the plaintiff has the right, at any time before judgment, to introduce new items of damage or add to those already claimed.\nMais, cette question controvers\u00e9e qui a cr\u00e9\u00e9 de la confusion dans le monde l\u00e9gal \u00e0 cause de ces deux jugements contradictoires de la Cour du Banc de la Reine, et des arr\u00eats ant\u00e9rieurs des diverses juridictions de la province de Qu\u00e9bec, ne pr\u00e9sente plus le m\u00eame int\u00e9r\u00eat vu l'amendement apport\u00e9 au Code, \u00e0 l'art. 2224, au cours de la derni\u00e8re session, qui veut que l'interruption judiciaire se continue jusqu'au jugement d\u00e9finitif, et affecte tous les droits et recours r\u00e9sultant de la m\u00eame source que la demande. Cet amendement longtemps souhait\u00e9, fait dispara\u00eetre les conflits et les h\u00e9sitations qui ont exist\u00e9 ant\u00e9rieurement.\nAinsi, deux \u00e9coles ont en effet entretenu des vues oppos\u00e9es. L'une a soutenu que la victime d'un accident doit exercer son droit dans l'ann\u00e9e qui suit la date de l'acte fautif (C.C. 2262). Si ce droit n'est pas exerc\u00e9, il y a d\u00e9ch\u00e9ance totale. Si, d'autre part, le recours est exerc\u00e9 dans l'ann\u00e9e de l'accident, le droit revit dans toute son int\u00e9gralit\u00e9 pour une nouvelle ann\u00e9e, comput\u00e9e de la signification de l'action (C.C. 2264). Si, au cours de cette ann\u00e9e, la partie demanderesse r\u00e9clame des dommages caus\u00e9s par le d\u00e9lit ou le quasi-d\u00e9lit, mais manifest\u00e9s plus tard, elle aura le droit, par amendement ou demande incidente, de les recouvrer. Elle devra toutefois exercer ce recours dans l'ann\u00e9e qui suit la signification de l'action, car c'est \u00e0 partir de cette date que recommence \u00e0 courir la prescription pour le m\u00eame temps qu'auparavant. L'autre syst\u00e8me de droit veut, au contraire, que quand l'action en r\u00e9clamation pour d\u00e9lit ou quasi-d\u00e9lit est institu\u00e9e dans le d\u00e9lai voulu, il y a interruption de prescription, qui recommence \u00e0 courir, non pas depuis la date de la signification de l'action, mais bien depuis la date du jugement final de l'instance. Cette seconde \u00e9cole est \u00e9videmment inspir\u00e9e de la doctrine de M. le Juge Mignault qui, \u00e0 la page 436, vol. 9, s'exprime ainsi:\nLorsqu'il y a eu demande en justice\u2014et nous avons vu quels actes de proc\u00e9dure judiciaire sont \u00e9quivalents \u00e0 la demande en justice\u2014la prescription est interrompue pendant toute la dur\u00e9e de la demande. C'est ce que le droit romain exprimait par la maxime: actiones quae tempore pereunt, semel inclusae in judicio salvae permanent.\nCet ancien adage du droit romain que l'on trouve au Digeste de Justinien nous vient de Ga\u00efus, et peut se traduire ainsi: \"Toutes les actions qui s'\u00e9teignent par la mort ou un certain espace de temps, subsistent par le moyen de la contestation en cause.\" Capitani l'exprime de la fa\u00e7on suivante: \"Les actions qui s'\u00e9teignent par la mort ou par un d\u00e9lai sont conserv\u00e9es d\u00e8s qu'elles ont \u00e9t\u00e9 intent\u00e9es par l'auteur.\" Et il signale que c'est ce principe que l'on a appliqu\u00e9 lors de la r\u00e9daction des arts. 330 et 957 du Code Napol\u00e9on.\nOn sait que la prescription peut \u00eatre interrompue ou naturellement ou civilement (Code Civil, 2222), et qu'une demande en justice suffisamment libell\u00e9e forme une interruption civile (C.C. 2224). L'article 2244 du Code Napol\u00e9on contient \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s les m\u00eames dispositions.\nEn France comme ici, la prescription est donc interrompue par une demande en justice \"suffisamment libell\u00e9e\". Quand cette prescription recommence-t-elle \u00e0 courir apr\u00e8s cette interruption civile? En France, la question ne pr\u00e9sente pas de difficult\u00e9s. La doctrine est \u00e0 l'effet que l'interruption r\u00e9sultant d'une citation en justice, dure aussi longtemps que l'instance elle-m\u00eame. Si le jugement est favorable au demandeur, la prescription reprend au jour o\u00f9 ce jugement a \u00e9t\u00e9 rendu, et elle est rev\u00eatue des m\u00eames caract\u00e8res que l'ancienne. (Paris, 18 f\u00e9v. 1897) (Recueil Sirey, 1901, 1,289) (Dalloz, Nouveau R\u00e9pertoire, vol. 3, p. 483, nos 83, 84 et 85). Cette doctrine est confirm\u00e9e par les auteurs modernes qui ont \u00e9crit en France sur ce sujet, et, parlant des effets de l'interruption, Planiol et Ripert (vol. 7, p. 781, 2e \u00e9d. 1954) s'expriment ainsi:\nLes effects de l'interruption se produisent d'abord pour le pass\u00e9: le temps ant\u00e9rieurement couru est perdu pour le calcul du d\u00e9lai de prescription. Ils agissent aussi pour l'avenir, en d\u00e9terminant un nouveau point de d\u00e9part pour la prescription qui recommence \u00e0 courir. Il varie suivant la dur\u00e9e de la cause d'interruption: celle-ci prend fin imm\u00e9diatement en cas de commandement ou de reconnaissance, alors qu'elle se prolonge en cas de saisie ou de citation en justice, parce que chaque acte de la proc\u00e9dure la renouvelle. Tant que dure l'instance, l'interruption subsiste, sauf \u00e0 dispara\u00eetre compl\u00e8tement, si le jugement rejette la demande form\u00e9e, s'il y a d\u00e9sistement ou p\u00e9remption. Si le jugement est favorable au demandeur, la prescription va reprendre au jour o\u00f9 il a \u00e9t\u00e9 rendu.\nMais en France, dit-on, il n'y a pas d'article dans le Code Napol\u00e9on qui correspond \u00e0 l'art. 2264 de notre Code Civil. Ceci est parfaitement vrai, mais l'id\u00e9e dominante demeure la m\u00eame, et si on lit l'art. 2265 C.C. avec 2264 C.C. il faut n\u00e9cessairement arriver aux m\u00eames conclusions. L'article 2265 dit en effet ceci:\n2265. La poursuite non d\u00e9clar\u00e9e p\u00e9rim\u00e9e et la condamnation en justice, forment un titre qui ne se prescrit que par trente ans, quoique ce qui en fait le sujet soit plus t\u00f4t prescriptible.\nSi donc, l'action institu\u00e9e dans le d\u00e9lai voulu est d\u00e9clar\u00e9e p\u00e9rim\u00e9e ou rejet\u00e9e, il n'y a pas d'interruption, \u00e0 cause de l'effet combin\u00e9 de 2226, r\u00e9dig\u00e9 en ces termes:\n2226. Si l'assignation ou la proc\u00e9dure est nulle par d\u00e9faut de forme;\nSi le demandeur se d\u00e9siste de sa demande;\nS'il laisse obtenir p\u00e9remption de l'instance;\nOu si sa demande est rejet\u00e9e;\nIl n'y a pas d'interruption.\nIl faut n\u00e9cessairement attendre le jugement final pour d\u00e9terminer quand recommencera \u00e0 courir la prescription.\nM. le Juge Garneau de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure de Montr\u00e9al a, \u00e0 mon sens, parfaitement r\u00e9sum\u00e9 cette th\u00e9orie quand, dans une cause de Plouffe v. Guaranteed Pure Milk4, il \u00e9crivait:\nLes codificateurs citent aussi comme sources de ce dernier article des textes nombreux qui tous soutiennent que la demande en justice interrompt la prescription jusqu'au jugement final, ce qui est d'ailleurs conforme \u00e0 l'art. 2226 C.C. qui dispose qu'il n'y a pas d'interruption si la demande est rejet\u00e9e, et \u00e0 l'art. 2265 C.C. qui dispose qu'il y a interruption jusqu'au jugement final puisque le jugement constitue un titre qui se prescrit que par trente ans. J'endosse \u00e9galement l'opinion de M. le Juge St-Germain de la Cour du Banc du Roi de Qu\u00e9bec, qui, dans une cause de Richman v. Sabourin5, s'exprimait ainsi:\nIl est certain que l'action n'\u00e9tait pas prescrite lorsqu'elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 intent\u00e9e. Or, aux termes de l'art. 2224 C.C., qui correspond \u00e0 l'art. 2244' du Code Napol\u00e9on, 'une demande en justice, suffisamment libell\u00e9e, signifi\u00e9e \u00e0 celui qu'on veut emp\u00eacher de prescrire \u2026 forme une interruption civile', et suivant la doctrine et la jurisprudence fran\u00e7aise, cette interruption de la prescription n'a pas pour effect d'interrompre la prescription pour une autre ann\u00e9e, \u00e0 partir seulement de l'institution de l'action, mais ladite interruption se continue durant tout le cours de l'instance.\nEt \u00e0 la page 420 de la m\u00eame cause, il disait:\nDans la cause actuelle, le montant des dommages suppl\u00e9mentaires que la demanderesse demande \u00e0 ajouter \u00e0 son action d\u00e9coule de la m\u00eame source de droit dont la prescription a \u00e9t\u00e9 interrompue par l'action et, par cons\u00e9quent, comme l'interruption conserve son efficacit\u00e9 tant que dure l'instance elle-m\u00eame, ces dommages suppl\u00e9mentaires, \u00e0 nom humble avis, ne sont pas prescrits.\nM. le Juge St-Germain cite de nombreuses autorit\u00e9s \u00e0 l'appui de sa pr\u00e9tention, entre autres (Aubry et Rau, Droit Civil, t. 2, 4e \u00e9d., p. 364) (Laurent, t. 32, p. 169) (Planiol et Ripert, (1931) t. 7, p. 699) (Juris Classeur, Vo Prescription, art. 2244, n\u00b0 79). Cette th\u00e9orie est \u00e9galement admise par de nombreux jugements dans la province de Qu\u00e9bec, tous cit\u00e9s au jugement de M. le Juge Bissonnette, dissident en Cour du Banc de la Reine6.\nLes autres d\u00e9cisions qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 rendues sur le point qui fait l'objet de cette cause sont, pour la plupart, bas\u00e9es sur un arr\u00eat de la Cour Supr\u00eame du Canada dans une affaire de La Cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al v. McGee7. Avec d\u00e9f\u00e9rence, je crois que ce jugement a \u00e9t\u00e9 erron\u00e9ment interpr\u00e9t\u00e9. En effet, dans cette cause, la Cour Supr\u00eame du Canada a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 ce qui suit:\nThe prescription of actions for personal injuries established by Article 2262 of the Civil Code of Lower Canada is not waived by failure of the Defendant to plead the limitation but the Court must take judicial notice of such prescription as absolutely extinguishing the right of action.\nThe reservation of recourse for future damages in a judgment upon an action for tort is not an adjudication which can preserve the right of action beyond the time limited by the provisions of the Civil Code.\nWhen in an action of this nature there is but one cause of action, damages must be assessed once for all. And when damages have been once recovered, no new action can be maintained for sufferings afterwards endured from the unforeseen effects of the original injury. La diff\u00e9rence essentielle qui existe entre cette cause et celle qui nous int\u00e9resse, c'est que dans la premi\u00e8re, celle de McGee, jugement avait \u00e9t\u00e9 rendu le 12 juin 1896 pour la somme de $1,000. Le 3 d\u00e9cembre 1897, soit environ dix-huit mois plus tard, le demandeur institua une nouvelle action dans laquelle il r\u00e9clama des dommages suppl\u00e9mentaires qui lui furent accord\u00e9s jusqu'\u00e0 concurrence de $5,000. C'est ce dernier jugement que la Cour a renvers\u00e9 avec raison.\nIl est clair, en effet, comme l'a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 la Cour Supr\u00eame dans cette affaire de McGee, que dans une cause de cette nature les dommages doivent \u00eatre \u00e9valu\u00e9s une fois pour toutes. Quand les dommages ont \u00e9t\u00e9 recouvr\u00e9s, comme cons\u00e9quence d'un jugement rendu, aucune autre action ne peut \u00eatre accueillie pour accorder des dommages suppl\u00e9mentaires impr\u00e9vus manifest\u00e9s plus tard. On ne peut ainsi multiplier les r\u00e9clamations judiciaires r\u00e9sultant de la m\u00eame cause d'action. Dans cette cause de McGee, il n'y avait eu avant le jugement aucune demande incidente.\nDans la cause actuelle, la situation qui se pr\u00e9sente est bien diff\u00e9rente. L'action pour r\u00e9clamer des dommages r\u00e9sultant d'un d\u00e9lit ou d'un quasi-d\u00e9lit se prescrit par une ann\u00e9e; elle interrompt \u00e9videmment la prescription, mais elle ouvre une porte au demandeur et permet \u00e0 ce dernier, tant que le jugement final n'est pas rendu, de r\u00e9clamer des dommages additionnels r\u00e9sultant du m\u00eame d\u00e9lit, mais constat\u00e9s plus tard. Dans le cas de McGee, contrairement \u00e0 la cause actuelle, cette porte \u00e9tait ferm\u00e9e par le jugement final sur la premi\u00e8re action, et aucune r\u00e9clamation additionnelle ne pouvait \u00eatre accueillie.\nJe crois donc que cette cause de McGee ne peut nous servir de guide \u00e0 l'appui de la pr\u00e9tention des intim\u00e9s. Au contraire, elle indique bien la justesse des remarques de MM. les Juges Bissonnette, Casey et Choquette de la Cour du Banc de la Reine dans la cause de Cit\u00e9 de Sherbrooke v. Fortin et de l'opinion dissidente de M. le Juge Bissonnette dans la cause actuelle.\nL'erreur des intim\u00e9s repose sur une interpr\u00e9tation erron\u00e9e des art. 2264 et 2265 C.C. L'article 2264 nous dit bien qu'apr\u00e8s la renonciation ou l'interruption, la prescription recommence \u00e0 courir pour le m\u00eame temps qu'auparavant, s'il n'y a novation. Et 2265 C.C. est \u00e0 l'effet que la condamnation en justice forme un titre qui ne se prescrit que par trente ans, quoique ce qui en fait le sujet soit plus t\u00f4t prescriptible. Il faut donc de toute n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 attendre que le jugement soit rendu pour d\u00e9terminer quel sera ce nouveau titre qui sera la base d'o\u00f9 la prescription devra recommencer \u00e0 courir.\nIl est certain que la prescription est interrompue et recommence \u00e0 courir \u00e0 partir de la date de l'interruption, pour le m\u00eame temps qu'auparavant, lorsqu'il s'agit par exemple de renonciation (2264 C.C), mais tel n'est pas le cas d'une interruption par citation en justice. Toute autre interpr\u00e9tation serait illogique, si l'on tient compte du fait que par jugement d\u00e9finitif le cr\u00e9ancier obtient un titre nouveau qui se prescrit par trente ans et qui lui permet, dans ce d\u00e9lai, d'ex\u00e9cuter contre le d\u00e9biteur le jugement qu'il a obtenu. C'est \u00e9videmment \u00e0 partir de la date de ce jugement que doivent se computer les d\u00e9lais, car si l'action est d\u00e9clar\u00e9e p\u00e9rim\u00e9e ou rejet\u00e9e par le tribunal, il n'y a pas d'interruption.\nAvec toute la d\u00e9f\u00e9rence possible pour ceux qui partagent des vues contraires, je suis d'opinion que lorsqu'une action est institu\u00e9e dans le temps voulu pour r\u00e9clamer des dommages, elle interrompt la prescription, et ce n'est qu'\u00e0 partir du jugement d\u00e9finitif qu'elle recommence \u00e0 courir. Il s'ensuit qu'au cours de l'instance, le demandeur peut, selon le cas, par demande incidente ou amendement, r\u00e9clamer des dommages additionnels r\u00e9sultant de la m\u00eame cause d'action. Si j'entretenais une vue contraire, il me faudrait, me semble-til, ignorer les dispositions de l'art. 2265 C.C. En effet, s'il n'y a pas d'interruption de prescription quand la demande est rejet\u00e9e, il s'ensuit n\u00e9cessairement qu'il faut attendre jusqu'au jugement d\u00e9finitif qui d\u00e9termine l'issue du proc\u00e8s, pour savoir quand la prescription doit cesser ou recommencer \u00e0 courir.\nCeci me para\u00eet conforme \u00e0 l'enseignement des auteurs en France, o\u00f9 n'existent cependant pas les art. 2264 et 2265 de notre Code Civil. Mais je crois que nos codificateurs se sont inspir\u00e9s de la doctrine des jurisconsultes qui ont \u00e9crit sur ce point. Il n'y a s\u00fbrement rien dans notre Code de nature \u00e0 contredire cet enseignement. L'amendement r\u00e9cent fait par la L\u00e9gislature \u00e0 l'art. 2224 C.C. sanctionne en substance ce qui, \u00e0 mon sens, a toujours exist\u00e9.\nComme j'en arrive \u00e0 la conclusion que la demande incidente n'est pas prescrite, et comme je crois \u00e9galement que les dommages additionnels qui y sont r\u00e9clam\u00e9s d\u00e9coulent de l'accident survenu le 9 octobre 1953, je suis d'opinion que le jugement du juge au proc\u00e8s doit \u00eatre r\u00e9tabli. II me semble totalement immat\u00e9riel en l'esp\u00e8ce de d\u00e9terminer si la compensation de dix pour cent doit \u00eatre accord\u00e9e \u00e0 l'appelant sur la demande principale ou la demande incidente.\nL'appel est donc maintenu avec d\u00e9pens en Cour Sup\u00e9rieure et devant la Cour du Banc de la Reine. Devant cette Cour, l'appelant aura le droit aux frais d'un seul appel.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nAttorney for the plaintiff, appellant: J.

The accused was tried and summarily convicted of impaired driving. The County Court judge dismissed his appeal for want of jurisdiction because the grounds raised in the notice of appeal were insufficiently stated. Leave to appeal to the Court of Appeal for Ontario was refused by that Court, indicating orally that it was bound by its prior decisions with respect to the point decided by the County Court judge in conformity with these decisions. The accused applied for leave to appeal to this Court either from the judgment of the Court of Appeal or alternatively from the judgment of the County Court.\nHeld (Cartwright, Martland and Ritchie JJ. dissenting): The application for leave to appeal should be dismissed.\nPer Taschereau and Abbott JJ.: This Court had no jurisdiction under s. 41(1) or (3) of the Supreme Court Act to entertain the application for leave to appeal. As the Criminal Code does not provide for an appeal to this Court in summary conviction matters, s. 41 is the only one under which leave could be granted. The Court of Appeal did not acquit or convict, set aside or affirm the conviction, but simply refused leave to appeal, there was, therefore, no judgment that could be appealed under s. 41(3). Furthermore, a refusal to grant leave to appeal is not tantamount to a dismissal of the appeal; it is not a disposal of the case on its merits. There was no alternative jurisdiction in s. 41(1) to allow this Court to grant the relief prayed for. In summary matters, jurisdiction to appeal to this Court is found in s. 41(3). The general proposition that matters which are not mentioned in s. 41(3) must be taken to be included in s. 41(1) was ruled out in Goldhar v. The Queen, [1960] S.C.R. 60. Consequently, since no appeal is given under s. 41(3) against a judgment refusing leave, it is not permissible to resort to s. 41(1) which gives an appeal with leave of the Court only from a final or other judgment of the highest Court of final resort in a province in which judgment can be had, but subject to s. 41(3).\nMoreover, there was no jurisdiction to grant leave to appeal against the judgment of the County Court judge. Section 41(1) does not say the highest Court of final resort in a province in which judgment \u201cwas had\u201d but in which judgment \u201ccan be had in the particular case\u201d, which meant, in this case, the Court of Appeal for Ontario.\nPer Fauteux, Abbott and Judson JJ.: This Court had not jurisdiction to grant leave to appeal from either the judgment of the Court of Appeal or that of the County Court.\nIn 1949, by introducing, in s. 41(1), the words \u201cin which judgment can be had in the particular case sought to be appealed\u201d, Parliament indicated that the Court referred to was the highest Court of final resort in the particular case and not generally. There could be only one Court so qualifying in a province. It could not be suggested that the Court of Appeal was not constituted by s. 743(1) of the Code as the highest Court of final resort in the province, in which judgment could be had in this case. The suggestion that the Court of Appeal disqualified itself as such highest Court by refusing leave and thereby qualified the County Court, could not be entertained. Section 41(1) refers to the Court which, under statute and not as a result of the proceedings made thereunder, is the highest Court in the particular case. The judgment of the Court of Appeal, which in this case was the highest Court of final resort, was not appealable under s. 41. It was not a judgment determining an appeal but a judgment refusing leave to appeal and as such was not within the terms of s. 41(3). Nor did it come within s. 41(1). The proposition that judgments not within the scope of s. 41(3) were necessarily embraced in s. 41(1) was ruled out in Goldhar v. The Queen, supra.\nPer Cartwright, Martland and Ritchie JJ., dissenting: The order sought to be appealed was a \u201cjudgment\u201d within the meaning of s. 2 of the Supreme Court Act and had the effect of \u201caffirming a conviction\u2026 of an offence other than an indictable offence.\u201d That judgment came within the latter words of s. 41(3) and the provisions of s. 41(1) and could be the subject of an appeal to this Court since, in taking the position that as the outcome of the appeal was a foregone conclusion it would serve no useful purpose to grant leave, the Court of Appeal decided the question of law before it on the merits. The circumstances of this case were such as to make the reasoning employed in Lane v. Easdaile, [1891] A.C. 210, inapplicable. It was quite legitimate, in a case such as the present, to raise in the notice of appeal to the County Court the broader issue of whether or not the accused had been wrongly convicted. R. v. Bamsey [1960] S.C.R\u2026; R. v. Dennis [1960] S.C.R. Leave to appeal to this Court should therefore be granted, the appeal should be allowed, and as s. 46 of the Supreme Court Act is capable of being construed, and in this case should be so construed, as empowering this Court to give the judgment on the merits \u201cthat the Court, whose decision appealed against, should have given or awarded\u201d, the case should be remitted to the County Court judge to be heard on appeal by way of trial de novo.\nPer Cartwright J., dissenting: Alternatively, on the assumption that the Court of Appeal refused leave to appeal simply in the exercise of its discretion and without having reached a decision as to how it felt itself bound to decide the appeal on the merits, this Court had jurisdiction to grant leave to appeal from the judgment of the County Court Judge.\nSection 41(3) does not confer jurisdiction, but excepts certain matters which would otherwise be included in the jurisdiction conferred by s. 41(1). When, in 1949, Parliament for the first time introduced the words \u201cin which judgment can be had in the particular case sought to be appealed to the Supreme Court\u201d, it intended to give to this Court power to grant leave to appeal from the judgment of whatever Court in the Province had become the highest Court of final resort in which judgment could be had in the particular case, regardless of whether that Court was or was not the highest Court of appeal having jurisdiction generally in the Province. In the present case, the judgment of the County Court judge was one affirming a conviction of an offence other than an indictable offence and the leave sought was to appeal from that judgment on a question of law and jurisdiction. There was therefore, under the combined effect of s. 41(1) and s. 41(3) jurisdiction since that judgment became that of the highest Court of final resort in this particular case when the Court of Appeal, as is assumed, in the exercise of its discretion, refused to grant leave. Leave should be granted and the appeal allowed. APPLICATION for leave to appeal from refusal of Court of Appeal to hear appeal or alternatively from dismissal of appeal by County Court judge in a summary conviction matter. Application dismissed, Cartwright, Martland and Ritchie JJ. dissenting.\nG.D. Finlayson, for the appellant.\nW.C. Bowman, Q.C., for the respondent.\nThe judgment of Taschereau and Abbott JJ. was delivered by\nTASCHEREAU J.:\u2014The appellant was charged that on or about the third day of October, 1958, at the Town of Brockville in the United Counties of Leeds and Grenville, while his ability to drive a motor-vehicle was impaired by alcohol or a drug, he did unlawfully drive his motor\u2011car, contrary to s. 223 of the Criminal Code of Canada,\nIn view of the election which was made by the prosecutor not to proceed under Part 17 of the Criminal Code, the trial was held under Part 24 (Summary Convictions). Magistrate Gordon H. Jermyn found the accused guilty of the said offence, ordered that he be detained in the County gaol at Brockville for the term of three days, ordered him to pay a fine of $100, and prohibited the accused from driving a motor-vehicle on the highway in Canada for a period of six months.\nThe accused, then, appealed to the County Court Judge, and the reasons for the appeal were the following:\n1. That the conviction was against the evidence and the weight of evidence, and contrary to law.\n2. That the learned Magistrate applied the wrong standard of care to the facts and circumstances of the alleged infraction.\n3. On such further and other grounds as the evidence may disclose and that the Court may permit.\nThe learned County Court Judge, His Honour Judge Lewis, dismissed the appeal. Without hearing any evidence he declined jurisdiction in view of the Crown\u2019s preliminary objection to the wording used in the Notice of Appeal. His honour held that the grounds set out in cls. 1 and 3 referred to were substantially the same as those dealt with in Regina v. Gillespie[1], and that the second ground of appeal was irrelevant to an appeal from a conviction of driving while impaired. On an application for leave to appeal, the Ontario Court of Appeal refused leave, holding that it was bound by its own decision in Regina v. Souter[2], and that His Honour Judge Lewis was right in holding that the second clause was inapplicable to an appeal of this nature.\nThe appellant made an application for leave to appeal to this Court on May 25, 1959, and the judgment of the Court was that this application should be referred to the Court at its sittings in October, 1959, \u201cfor disposition in the event that it is held that there is jurisdiction in this Court to grant leave to appeal from an order of the Court of Appeal refusing leave to appeal, or in the event that it is held that there is jurisdiction in this Court to grant leave to appeal, from the decision of the County Court Judge.\u201d\nThe case was heard by the Court, and the first question which has to be resolved is whether the Supreme Court of Canada has jurisdiction under s. 41(1) or s. 41(3) of the Supreme Court Act to hear the application for leave to appeal.\nIt is only under s. 41 that such a leave may be granted to the applicant. Subsection (1) of s. 41 reads as follows:\n41. (1) Subject to subsection (3), an appeal lies to the Supreme Court with leave of that Court from any final or other judgment of the highest court of final resort in a province, or a judge thereof, in which judgment can be had in the particular case sought to be appealed to the Supreme Court, whether or not leave to appeal to the Supreme Court has been refused by any other court.\nSubsection (3) to which subs. (1) refers is in the following terms:\n(3) No appeal to the Supreme Court lies under this section from the judgment of any court acquitting or convicting or setting aside or affirming a conviction or acquittal of an indictable offence or, except in respect of a question of law or jurisdiction, of an offence other than an indictable offence.\nAs the Criminal Code does not provide for an appeal to this Court in summary conviction matters, it follows that our only authority to grant leave to appeal in the present case, if it exists, must be found in s. 41 of the Supreme Court Act Section 41(3) permits an appeal to this Court in summary conviction matters, against a judgment from any court acquitting or convicting, or setting aside or affirming a conviction or acquittal, only on a question of law or jurisdiction. Our powers are strictly limited, and we would exercise a legislative and not a judicial power if we went beyond what Parliament has decided.\nThe Court of Appeal for Ontario did not acquit or convict, did not set aside or affirm a conviction; it simply refused leave to appeal. There is no judgment that, under the Act, may be appealed from.\nIt is furthermore my strong view, that a refusal by a Court of Appeal to grant leave to appeal is not tantamount to a dismissal of the appeal. It simply means that the right of appeal which does not exist as of right, but only by leave, never came into being. A judgment on an application for leave to appeal is one judgment, and the disposal of the case on its merits when leave has been granted is another judgment. The refusal by the Court of Appeal to grant leave is not a disposal of the case on its merits.\nIt has been submitted that if s. 41(3) does not give jurisdiction to this Court to entertain the present application, s. 41(1) of the Act is sufficiently wide in its terms to allow this Court to grant the relief prayed for. In other words, if our jurisdiction in summary conviction matters cannot be found in 41(3), it is open to this Court to find it in 41(1).\nWith deference, I do not think so. Appeals against convictions or sentence in criminal matters are dealt with in s. 41(3). In matters of indictable offences, it confers no jurisdiction on this Court, and we must find in the Criminal Code the rules that govern such appeals. In summary matters, on the other hand, jurisdiction to appeal to this Court is given in s. 41(3). It was held in Goldhar v. The Queen[3], that if an appeal from a sentence was not given by 41(3), nor the Criminal Code, we could not find any authority in 41(1) to review a sentence imposed by the Courts below. In that case it was stated by Fauteux J. with whom all the members of the Court agreed, Cartwright J. dissenting, that in order to determine if a convicted person could appeal against a sentence in a matter of indictable offence, it was not permissible to look to s. 41(1) for the authority to intervene, but only in the Criminal Code which does not permit an appeal against a sentence.\nThe general proposition that matters which are not mentioned in 41(3) must be taken to be included in 41(1) has been ruled out in Goldhar, supra. If it were otherwise the result would be that even if not given under 41(3), against a judgment acquitting or convicting, or setting aside or affirming a conviction or acquittal, in indictable offences, an appeal would, nevertheless, lie from a judgment of the Court of Appeal, refusing leave on a mixed question of law and fact, or on a pure question of fact. (Cr. C. 583(a)(2)).\nSince no appeal is given under 41(3) against a judgment refusing leave, it is not permissible in my view to resort to s. 41(1) which, as I have said, gives an appeal with leave of the Court only from a final or other judgment of the highest court of final resort in a province in which judgment can be had, but subject to subs. (3) of s. 41.\nMoreover, it is contended that if this Court has no jurisdiction to grant leave to appeal from the judgment of the Court of Appeal, it has jurisdiction to grant leave to appeal against the judgment of the County Court Judge. I think that this proposition is untenable. The highest court of final resort in Ontario is the Court of Appeal, which had jurisdiction, and although the matter had been referred to it, declined to entertain the application.\nSection 41(1) states clearly that an appeal lies to this Court with leave from any final or other judgment of the highest court of final resort in a province or a judge thereof, in which judgment can be had in the particular case. The section does not say \u201cin which judgment was had\u201d, but \u201ccan be had\u201d, which means \u201ccan be had\u201d as a matter of law, and the expression \u201cin the particular case\u201d means in the particular class of cases to which the case belongs. If we were to entertain a different view, we would be confronted in this case with a judgment of the Court of Appeal refusing leave to appeal, and a judgment of this Court granting leave to appeal on the same matter. This would amount to a total disregard of the jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal, and the unauthorized bypassing of that tribunal Since writing this judgment I had the advantage of considering the reasons of my brother Fauteux with which I entirely agree.\nI would refuse the application for leave to appeal. It becomes therefore unnecessary to deal with the other branches of this case.\nCARTWRIGHT J. (dissenting):\u2014I agree with the reasons and conclusion of my brother Ritchie and would dispose of the appeal as he proposes.\nI wish, however, to state my opinion as to the disposition which should be made of this application on the assumption that the Court of Appeal refused leave to appeal simply in the exercise of its discretion and without having reached a decision as to how it felt itself bound to decide the appeal on the merits.\nOn this assumption, two questions arise; the first, whether we have jurisdiction to grant leave to appeal to this Court from the refusal of the Court of Appeal to grant the applicant leave to appeal to it from the decision of His Honour Judge Lewis; the second, whether we have jurisdiction to grant the alternative application for leave to appeal to this Court from the judgment of His Honour.\nI have reached the conclusion that the second of these questions should be answered in the affirmative and that leave to appeal to this Court from the judgment of His Honour should be granted; consequently I do not find it necessary to answer the first question.\nThe words of subss. (1) and (3) of s. 41 of the Supreme Court Act are plain and unambiguous. They are as follows:\n41. (1) Subject to subsection (3), an appeal lies to the Supreme Court with leave of that Court from any final or other judgment of the highest court of final resort in a province, or a judge thereof, in which judgment can be had in the particular case sought to be appealed to the Supreme Court, whether or not leave to appeal to the Supreme Court has been refused by any other court.\n* * *\n(3) No appeal to the Supreme Court lies under this section from the judgment of any court acquitting or convicting or setting aside or affirming a conviction or acquittal of an indictable offence or, except in respect of a question of law or jurisdiction, of an offence other than an indictable offence. It will be observed that subs. (3) does not confer jurisdiction. It excepts certain matters which would otherwise be included in the jurisdiction which subs. (1) confers in terms which, when read in the light of the definitions of \u201cjudgment\u201d and \u201cfinal judgment\u201d contained in s. 2, could scarcely be more widely expressed. While it appears to me to be self-evident that it is subs. (1) of s. 41 which confers upon this Court the jurisdiction to grant leave, it may be observed that it was so declared in the unanimous judgment of this Court in Parkes v. The Queen[4].\nIn my view, when s. 41 is considered in the light of the history of the legislation defining, restricting and enlarging the jurisdiction of this Court it appears that the intention of Parliament in enacting the section in its present form was to give this Court the widest power in every case, subject only to the limitations imposed by subs. (3) of the section, to permit a litigant, who has exhausted all rights of appeal which are open to him in the provincial courts, to obtain the decision of this Court. No doubt this is a jurisdiction to be exercised with great care but, in my opinion, it ought not to be cut down by judicial decision.\nThe judgment of His Honour Judge Lewis is one affirming a conviction of an offence other than an indictable offence and the leave sought is to appeal from that judgment on a question of law and jurisdiction. We therefore clearly have jurisdiction under the combined effect of s. 41(1) and s. 41(3) if the judgment of His Honour is that of the highest court of final resort in the Province of Ontario in which judgment can be had in this particular case. When the applicant was convicted by the learned Magistrate he had an appeal as of right to the learned County Court Judge, provided he followed the procedure prescribed in the Criminal Code. When His Honour dismissed the appeal, the applicant had no further appeal as of right; but he could not, at that point, have applied for leave to appeal to this Court under s. 41, as it was then uncertain whether judgment could be had in a higher court in the province. When, however, he had applied for leave to appeal to the Court of Appeal and that Court, as is assumed, had, in the exercise of its discretion, refused to grant leave, it was established that in the particular case sought to be appealed to this Court the judgment of His Honour was that of the highest court of final resort in the province in which judgment could be had. It is nihil ad rem to point out that it would have been otherwise if the Court of Appeal had granted leave instead of refusing it. In this particular case that did not happen; and it is on the particular case and not on classes of cases that s. 41(1) concentrates attention.\nIf there were doubt as to the meaning of the phrase \u201cthe highest court of final resort in a province, or a judge thereof, in which judgment can be had in the particular case sought to be appealed to the Supreme Court\u201d, it would be of assistance to consider the state of the law prior to 1949 when s. 41 was first enacted in substantially its present form by 1949 (2nd Sess.), 13 Geo. VI, c. 37, s. 2.\nIn International Metal Industries Ltd. v. The Corporation of the City of Toronto[5], an appeal to this Court was launched from a decision of a judge of the County Court of the County of York, affirming an assessment of the appellant in respect of income for the year 1936. The relevant sections of The Assessment Act, R.S.O. 1927, c. 238, gave a right of appeal to the County Court Judge but provided that no appeal should lie from his decision.\nThe respondent moved to quash the appeal on the ground that the judgment of the County Court Judge was not a judgment of the highest court of final resort established in the Province of Ontario within the meaning of the Supreme Court Act, R.S.C. 1927, c. 35, ss. 35 to 41, as amended by I Geo VI, c. 42. The appeal was quashed.\nAt that time s. 37(3) read as follows:\n(3) Save as provided by this section, but subject to section forty-four, no appeal shall lie to the Supreme Court except from the highest court of final resort having jurisdiction in the province in which the proceedings were originally instituted.\nDuff C.J.C., at page 272, dealt with the point as follows:\nIn Farquharson v. Imperial Oil Co. Strong C.J. said:\nIn the case of Danjou v. Marquis, which was an appeal to this court from a judgment of the Court of Review in the Province of Quebec, instituted before the original Act had been amended by the addition of the provision now contained in subsection 3 of section 26, it was held that the words \u2018highest court of last resort\u2019 were to be construed as meaning the highest Court of Appeal having jurisdiction generally in the province, and not as referring to the highest Court of Appeal in the particular case sought to be appealed; thus excluding jurisdiction in a case in which the court of Review was by provincial legislation made the court of last resort in the province.\nThe phrase \u201chighest court of last resort\u201d is not distinguishable from the phrase \u201chighest court of final resort\u201d in section 37(3) of the Supreme Court Act as it now stands. The words \u201cwhether the judgment or decision in such proceeding was or was not a proper subject of appeal to such highest court of final resort\u201d appearing in the section as it formerly stood were discarded as being surplusage in the amending Act of I Geo. VI, ch. 42, s. 1. Nevertheless, their presence in the section in its earlier form would be sufficient to demonstrate that the words \u201chighest court of final resort in the province\u201d had and have the meaning ascribed to the \u201chighest court of last resort\u201d by Strong C.J. in the passage quoted.\nA somewhat similar question arose in Furlan v. City of Montreal[6], where leave was sought to appeal to this Court from a judgment of Gibsone J. quashing a writ of certiorari. The relevant sections of the Supreme Court Act were in the same form as those considered in the International Metal case, supra. Leave was refused on the ground that the Court had no jurisdiction to grant it.\nThe unanimous judgment of the Court reads in part as follows, at page 218:\nIt is contended on behalf of the applicant that it is contemplated by section 36 that an appeal lies from a provincial court of original jurisdiction where, for the purposes of the particular proceeding in question, there is no further appeal. Even if there were any ambiguity in the language of that section (and we think there is not) such ambiguity would be resolved by the express language of section 37, subsection 3. In our opinion all that section 36 does is to make it immaterial whether \u201cthe highest court of final resort\u201d has appellate or original jurisdiction, or both. In either event there is to be no appeal except from such highest court and not merely from a court which may be the court of last resort in any particular proceeding.\nThe question of the jurisdiction of this court in a matter such as this has already been determined adversely to the applicant\u2019s contention by the Privy Council in James Bay Railway Company v. Armstrong. Their Lordships in dealing with a similar argument there said:\nNow, unquestionably, the Court of Appeal in Ontario is the highest court of last resort having jurisdiction in the province. The High Court is not. It was argued that in this particular case the High Court becomes \u2018the highest court of last resort\u2019 when no appeal lies from it to the Court of Appeal, and it is placed by statute for the purpose in hand on an equal footing with the Court of Appeal. But their Lordships think that that result cannot be attained without unduly straining the words of the statute, and that, except in certain specified cases within which the present case does not come, an appeal to the Supreme Court lies only from the Court of Appeal.\u201d\nSince the amendment of the Supreme Court Act in 1937, already referred to, this court has decided the same point in a similar sense in International Metal Industries Limited v. The Corporation of the City of Toronto.\nIt will be observed that in both of these cases and in the case of James Bay Railway v. Armstrong[7], quoted in the latter case, it had been submitted that an appeal lay to this Court provided that the judgment sought to be appealed was that of the highest court in which judgment could be had in the particular case, and, on the then wording of the Act, this submission was uniformly rejected. This appears particularly from the words, in the quotations above, which I have italicized.\nThe conclusion appears to me to be inescapable that when in 1949 Parliament for the first time introduced the words which appear in s. 41(1) \u201cin which judgment can be had in the particular case sought to be appealed to the Supreme Court\u201d it did so with the intention of changing the law which had been declared in the cases cited and of giving to this Court power to grant leave to appeal from the judgment of whatever court in the Province has become the highest court of final resort in which judgment can be had in the particular case, regardless of whether that court is or is not the highest court of appeal having jurisdiction generally in the province.\nHaving concluded that we have the necessary jurisdiction, I would, always on the assumption made above, have granted leave to appeal from the judgment of His Honour Judge Lewis, and would have allowed the appeal on the merits for the reasons given by my brother Ritchie.\nIt is because one of the bases (the most favourable from the point of view of the Crown) on which the appeal was argued was that the Court of Appeal refused leave simply in the exercise of its judicial discretion that I have examined the question as to how, on that basis, the appeal should be dealt with. In so doing I arrive at the same result as that reached by my brother Ritchie and I rest my judgment on the grounds above set out as well as on the reasons which he has given. I wish, however, to make it plain that in the peculiar circumstances of the case before us it is my opinion that the view of my brother Ritchie as to what was done by the Court of Appeal is the right one. We are concerned with substance rather than form.\nI would dispose of the appeal as proposed by my brother Ritchie.\nThe judgment of Fauteux, Abbott and Judson JJ. was delivered by\nFAUTEUX J.:\u2014The facts pertaining to the consideration of this case are detailed in the reasons for judgment of other members of the Court and need be stated here only briefly.\nAn appeal sought by Paul to the County Court from a conviction under Part XXIV of the Criminal Code was dismissed for want of jurisdiction, the grounds raised in the notice of appeal being considered insufficiently stated. Leave to appeal from that judgment to the Court of Appeal for Ontario was sought but refused, the members of the Court indicating orally that the Court was bound by its prior decisions with respect to the point decided by the County Court in conformity with these decisions. An application was then made for leave to appeal to this Court, either from the judgment of the Court of Appeal or alternatively from the judgment of the County Court. This application, allegedly made under s. 41 of the Supreme Court Act, was, upon first being considered, referred to the Bench hearing appeals on the merits, for disposition of the appeal itself in the event that our jurisdiction to grant leave from either the judgment of the Court of Appeal or that of the County Court, should be found to exist.\nThe primary question is that of our jurisdiction. The relevant parts of s. 41 read as follows:\n41. (1) Subject to subsection (3), an appeal lies to the Supreme Court with leave of that Court from any final or other judgment of the highest court of final resort in a province, or a judge thereof, in which judgment can be had in the particular case sought to be appealed to the Supreme Court, whether or not leave to appeal to the Supreme Court has been refused by any other court.\n(2) Leave to appeal under this section may be granted during the period fixed by section 64 or within thirty days thereafter or within such further extended time as the Supreme Court or a judge may either before or after the expiry of the said thirty days fix or allow. (3) No appeal to the Supreme Court lies under this section from the judgment of any court acquitting or convicting or setting aside or affirming a conviction or acquittal of an indictable offence or, except in respect of a question of law or jurisdiction, of an offence other than an indictable offence.\nThe judgment from which an appeal may lie with leave under s. 41(1) is the judgment of the highest court of final resort in a province,\u2026, in which judgment can be had in the particular case. That there can be only one Court in a province qualifying as \u201cthe highest court of final resort\u2026in which judgment can be had in the particular case\u201d, and that the identification of such a Court, in any particular case, can only be ascertained by reference to the Act or Acts relevant to the case under consideration, goes without saying. Depending upon the law governing in the particular case, that highest Court of final resort in a province may be the Court of Appeal or may be a Court of lower jurisdiction if the judgment of the latter Court is not appealable to another Court in the province. In a criminal matter such as the one here involved, the Criminal Code governs and s. 743(1) thereof gives an appeal with leave to the Court of Appeal of the province. No one suggests that the Court of Appeal is not constituted by that section the highest Court of final resort in the province, in which judgment can be had in this case. However, it is said that the dismissal, by the Court of Appeal, of the motion for leave to appeal, had two consequences: it disqualified the Court of Appeal as the highest Court of final resort in the province and qualified the County Court as such. Thus, and on this view of the matter, the nature of the judgment rendered in this case by the highest Court of final resort, the Court of Appeal, becomes the determining factor of the question. With deference, I am unable to agree with this suggestion. The true test, in my opinion, is not one of result, i.e. the actual fate of the proceedings legally taken before the Court of Appeal, but whether the Court of Appeal is, in this case, the highest Court of final resort in the province, in which these proceedings could be taken.\nThe cases of International Metal Industries Limited v. The Corporation of the City of Toronto[8], Furlan v. City of Montreal[9], as well as the authorities quoted therein, and the law under which they were decided as well as the subsequent amendment thereto have been considered but, in my view, supply no support for the proposition advanced for the appellant. When the above cases were decided, the relevant law was contained in s. 37(3) reading as follows:\n(3) Save as provided by this section, but subject to s. 44, no appeal shall lie to the Supreme Court except from the highest court of final resort having jurisdiction in the province in which the proceedings were originally instituted.\nWhat these cases decided is that the highest Court of final resort referred to in this section was the Court which is generally, and not in a particular case, the highest Court of final resort in the province, i.e. the Court of Appeal. By introducing, in 1949, the following words in s. 41(1) \u201cin which judgment can be had in the particular case sought to be appealed to the Supreme Court\u201d, Parliament indicated that the Court referred to in this amendment was the highest Court of final resort in the particular case and not generally.\nSection 41(1) refers to the Court which, under statute and not as a result of the proceedings made thereunder, is the highest Court of final resort in the province in the particular case.\nWith deference, the suggestion that the County Court must, from the date of the dismissal by the Court of Appeal of the motion for leave to appeal be considered in this case as the highest Court of final resort brings a rather novel situation in appellate proceedings. For on the view that the judgment of the County Court is the judgment to be appealed to this Court, the delays within which proceedings in appeal to this Court are to be made, must, by force of s. 41(2) and s. 64 of the Supreme Court Act, be computed from the date of the signing or entry or pronouncing of the judgment of the County Court. Thus time for the exercise of the right of appeal begins to run while this conditional right does not yet exist and while it is still problematical whether it will ever exist.\nAgreeing as I do that the highest Court of final resort in the province, in this particular case, is the Court of Appeal, the next point to consider is whether the judgment of that Court, which is here sought to be appealed, is appealable under s. 41. As pointed out by our brother Taschereau, the judgment of the Court of Appeal is not a judgment determining an appeal but a judgment refusing leave to appeal and as such not within the terms of s. 41(3). The question is then whether it comes within s. 41(1). The proposition that judgments which are not within the scope of s. 41(3) are necessarily embraced in s. 41(1) has been ruled out in the Goldhar case[10], where a strict adherence to the rule of literal construction of s. 41 was, in the matter, shown to lead to repugnancy. Such a result would equally obtain if the judgment refusing leave to appeal, in this case, was held to come within s. 41(1). For on the same reasoning, one would have to hold that, for indictable offences, s. 41(1) authorizes an appeal to this Court from a judgment of the Court of Appeal refusing leave to appeal to its Court from the verdict or judgment of first instance on grounds of mixed law and facts or pure facts. Such a jurisdiction would be inconsistent with the limitation of our jurisdiction to pure questions of law in criminal appeals from convictions or acquittals of offences.\nFor all these reasons, I agree that this appeal should be dismissed for want of jurisdiction.\nThe judgment of Martland and Ritchie JJ. was delivered by\nRITCHIE J. (dissenting):\u2014The applicant in this case, having been charged with driving a motor vehicle while his ability to do so was impaired, was proceeded against by way of summary conviction before Magistrate Gordon M. Jermyn, and having been arraigned and pleaded \u201cnot guilty\u201d he was tried, convicted and sentenced to be imprisoned for three days and to pay a fine of $100 together with costs and also to be prohibited from driving a motor vehicle on the highway in Canada for six months from the date of conviction. From this conviction the applicant gave Notice of Appeal to the County Court of the United Counties of Leeds and Grenville setting forth therein the following grounds of appeal:\n1. That the conviction was against the evidence and the weight of evidence and contrary to law. 2. That the learned magistrate applied the wrong standard of care to the facts and circumstances of the alleged infraction.\n3. On such further and other grounds as the evidence may disclose and this court doth permit.\nAt the hearing in the County Court, objection was taken by counsel for the Crown that these grounds of appeal were not sufficient to comply with s. 722(1) (a) (i) of the Criminal Code, and that the County Court, therefore, had no jurisdiction to hear the appeal. After hearing argument of counsel, the learned County Court judge delivered reasons for judgment in which he made reference to the cases of Regina v. Souter[11], Regina v. Wisnoski[12] and Regina v. Gillespie[13], and concluded by saying,\nI find that the preliminary objection is well taken and on the preliminary objection I must dismiss the appeal for want of jurisdiction.\nFrom this decision the applicant gave Notice of Application for Leave to Appeal to the Court of Appeal for Ontario upon the grounds following:\n1. The learned County Court judge on appeal erred in finding that there were not sufficient grounds set forth in my Notice of Appeal to comply with s. 722 of the Criminal Code.\n2. The learned County Court judge on appeal erred in finding that he had no jurisdiction to hear the said appeal by way of trial de novo.\nThe order of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, made on the return of this notice, directed \u201cthat leave to appeal should be and the same was thereby refused\u201d. Although no written reasons were given for this decision, an affidavit has been filed by the solicitor for the applicant as a part of the appeal case before this Court in which he states that\nI am advised by counsel who appeared on his (Paul\u2019s) behalf and verily believe that leave to appeal was refused without written reasons being given on the grounds that the court felt it was bound by its previous decision in Regina v. Souter (1959) O.W.N. 40.\nAs will hereafter appear, this statement of fact is not disputed by counsel for the respondent. Application for leave to appeal from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario or alternatively from the said County Court was made to this Court on May 25, 1959, upon the following questions of law and jurisdiction:\n1. Was the Court of Appeal for Ontario right in holding that there were not sufficient grounds set forth in the Notice of Appeal before His Honour, Judge Lewis, to comply with s. 722 of the Criminal Code?\n2. Was the Court of Appeal for Ontario right in holding that His Honour, Judge Lewis, on appeal, had no jurisdiction to hear the said appeal by way of trial de novo?\nand in the alternative, upon the following questions of law and jurisdiction:\n1. Was the learned County Court judge on appeal right in holding that there were not sufficient grounds set forth in the Notice of Appeal to comply with s. 722 of the Criminal Code?\n2. Was the learned County Court judge on appeal right in holding that he had jurisdiction to hear the said appeal by way of trial de novo?\nOn June 25, 1959, by order of this Court, the above applications for leave to appeal were adjourned to the sittings of the Court commencing in October 1959, and it was further ordered that these applications be\nreferred to this Court at its sittings in October 1959 for disposition in the event that it is held that there is jurisdiction in this Court to grant leave to appeal from an order of the Court of Appeal refusing leave to appeal or in the event that it is held that there is jurisdiction in this Court to grant leave to appeal from the decision of the County Court judge.\nSections 41(1) and 41(3) of the Supreme Court Act, pursuant to the provisions of which leave to appeal is now sought, read as follows:\n41. (1) Subject to subsection (3), an appeal lies to the Supreme Court with leave of that Court from any final or other judgment of the highest court of final resort in a province, or a judge thereof, in which judgment can be had in the particular case sought to be appealed to the Supreme Court, whether or not leave to appeal to the Supreme Court has been refused by any other court.\n* * *\n(3) No appeal to the Supreme Court lies under this section from the judgment of any court acquitting or convicting or setting aside or affirming a conviction or acquittal of an indictable offence or, except in respect of a question of law or jurisdiction, of an offence other than an indictable offence. \u201cJudgment\u201d is defined by s. 2(d) of the Supreme Court Act as follows:\n\u201cjudgment,\u201d when used with reference to the court appealed from, includes any judgment, rule, order, decision, decree, decretal order or sentence thereof; and when used with reference to the Supreme Court, includes any judgment or order of that Court;\nI am of opinion that the order sought to be appealed from in this case is a \u201cjudgment\u201d within the meaning of s. 2(d) of the Supreme Court Act and that it has the effect of \u201caffirming a conviction\u2026 of an offence other than an indictable offence\u201d. If it can also be said that the judgment is one \u201cin respect of a question of law\u201d and that it constitutes a determination of the merits of the questions raised by the Notice of Application for Leave to Appeal, then I am of the opinion that it comes within the latter words of s. 41(3) and the provisions of s. 41(1) of the Supreme Court Act and can be made the subject of an appeal to this Court if it is considered an appropriate case in which to grant leave so to appeal.\nSection 743 of the Criminal Code provides in part as follows:\n743. (1) An appeal to the court of appeal, as defined in section 581, may, with leave of that court, be taken on any ground that involves a question of law alone, against\n(a) a decision of a court in respect of an appeal under section 727\u2026\nIn my opinion this section confers on the Court of Appeal a discretionary power to determine whether or not leave should be granted by that court in such a case as the present, and if it could be said that leave had been refused in this case simply in the exercise of that discretion then different considerations would apply. In the present case, however, it has been made to appear in this Court to my satisfaction that the learned judges of the Court of Appeal took the position that they were required to decide the questions of law sought to be raised by the application for leave to appeal adversely to the applicant in accordance with the earlier decision of that court in Regina v. Souter, supra, and that as the outcome of the appeal was a foregone conclusion it would serve no useful purpose to grant leave for it to be heard.\nIn taking this position the Court of Appeal, in my opinion, decided the question of law raised before it on the merits and reached the same conclusion for the same reasons as it would have done if leave had been granted. The fact that formal expression was given to this decision by the granting of an order refusing leave to appeal does not detract from the result which is that for all practical purposes the merits of the appeal have been heard and determined. The Criminal Appeal Rules applicable in the Province of Ontario in such cases and to which further reference will hereafter be made provide that on an application for leave to appeal to the Court of Appeal for Ontario, if that court\nis of opinion that leave should be granted, the court may thereupon and without further delay hear the appeal upon its merits (Rule 19).\nAs has been said, the effect of the order granted in the present case was to dispose of the merits of the appeal without having granted leave, and I am of opinion that in a proper case leave should be granted to appeal to this Court from such an order. In the present case the order from which leave to appeal is sought is based on an earlier decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario (Regina v. Souter, supra) which is at variance with decisions of some courts of other provinces and indeed somewhat difficult to reconcile with another decision of the same court to the opposite effect (R. v. Kuusela[14]) and it cannot be overlooked that the liberty of the applicant is involved in these proceedings.\nIt is true that in this case we are deprived of the benefit of having any written or recorded reasons of the Court of Appeal before us and that the formal record of the decision of its learned members is limited to the certificate of the Assistant Registrar of that Court which reads:\nThis Court did order that leave to appeal should be and the same was thereby refused. However, we have been furnished not only with the affidavit of the applicant\u2019s solicitor which is referred to above but also with the following statement in the factum filed on behalf of the Attorney-General for Ontario whose representative appeared for the respondent herein:\nThe issue is whether the Court of Appeal was right or wrong in refusing leave. In the present case the position of the Court of Appeal was that the point in issue had already been decided by it and that the appeal, if leave were granted, must inevitably be dismissed. Therefore, to grant leave would serve no useful purpose. In refusing leave, the Court of Appeal followed the principle enunciated by Chief Justice Duff in Laing v. The Toronto General Trusts, (1941) S.C.R. 32 dealing with a motion to quash an appeal, at p. 34:\n\u201cAnd it is also the settled course of this court that when on a motion to quash it plainly appears to the court that the appeal is one, which, if it came on in the ordinary way, must be dismissed, the court will on that ground quash the appeal.\u201d (The italics are mine.)\nIt has been very forcefully argued on behalf of the respondent that it would be inappropriate for this Court to grant leave to appeal from an order which takes the form of a refusal to grant leave by the Court of Appeal, and it was argued that the reasoning contained in the judgment of Lord Halsbury in Lane v. Esdaile[15], applied to the present circumstances and that the granting of such leave by this Court would defeat the very purpose of requiring leave to be granted by the Court of Appeal before asserting an appeal under s. 743 of the Criminal Code and that it would open the way to appeals being heard in this Court from the refusal of a provincial Court of Appeal to grant leave to appeal on questions of fact and of mixed fact and law in cases of indictable offences sought to be appealed under s. 583(a) (ii) of the Criminal Code which latter result was never intended by the legislature.\nIn my view the circumstances of this case are such as to make the reasoning employed in Lane v. Esdaile, supra, and the above arguments which are based, in part thereon, inapplicable. In that case what was decided by the House of Lords was that where the Court of Appeal had exercised its discretion by refusing to grant leave to appeal after the time limited therefor had expired, its decision was not susceptible of further appeal under the provisions of the Appellate Jurisdiction Act, 1876. It will be noted that the decision of the Court of Appeal there under consideration did not turn on the merits of the case which were overwhelmingly in the appellant\u2019s favour but rather on the ground that\nif people have deliberately elected to let the time for appealing go by, the Court should not give them leave to appeal without special circumstances. (Per Lindley L.J. in Esdaile v. Payne, 40 Ch. D. 520 at 535.)\nIn the present case, as has been said, although the order from which leave to appeal is now sought is in form simply an order refusing leave to appeal to the Court of Appeal, it is apparent from what has been said by both counsel that the merits of the questions raised were considered and found wanting because the learned judges of the Court of Appeal felt that the decision of that court in Regina v. Souter, supra, governed the circumstances. There would have been no difference in principle if the learned judges of the Court of Appeal had treated the questions as being governed by their view of some general principle of law. That such a decision is not one made in the exercise of judicial discretion is clear from what was said by Cannon J. in Glesby v. Mitchell[16], where the question was whether an order of a provincial Court of Appeal directing a new trial was made in the exercise of the discretion of that court, and Cannon J. said:\nThese two learned judges exercised not a discretion but considered themselves bound by their previous decision and their interpretation of certain rules of law.\nAs has been indicated, I would grant leave to appeal to this Court in the present case, but it should be clearly understood that this decision is strictly confined to the circumstances here disclosed and is based on the assumption that the Court of Appeal dealt with and disposed of the merits of the questions of law raised before it on the application for leave to appeal to that court as fully and effectually and for the same reasons and with the same result as they would have done if leave to appeal had been granted. The granting of this application is not to be construed as a review of the discretion vested in the Court of Appeal by s. 743 of the Criminal Code and can have no bearing on the right of the Court of Appeal to refuse leave to appeal in indictable offence cases under s. 583(a) (ii) because what is at issue here is a question of law and cases sought to be appealed under that section are concerned with fact or mixed fact and law. Nor can it be said that the considerations governing this case could apply to an application for leave to appeal to this Court from an order granting leave to appeal to the Court of Appeal because the effect of such an order can only be to pave the way for the questions of law to be decided on the hearing, and such an order cannot, therefore, have the effect of determining the merits of the appeal.\nThe real question of law raised by the grounds upon which leave is now sought is whether or not the grounds set forth in the Notice of Appeal from the summary conviction court were sufficient to comply with s. 722 of the Criminal Code and to clothe the County Court judge with jurisdiction to hear the appeal by way of trial de novo.\nAs will be seen from what has been said in the cases of Regina v. Harry P. Bamsey[17] and Regina v. Raymond John Dennis[18], I take the view that the provisions of s. 720 of the Criminal Code accord a right of appeal to any \u201cdefendant in proceedings under this Part (Part XXIV)\u201d provided that s. 722 is complied with, and I am further of opinion that the grounds of appeal referred to in s. 722(a) (ii) are not required to be set forth with the same particularity as in appeals in indictable offences.\nAn appeal to the Court of Appeal in the case of an indictable offence is, except in a restricted number of cases, largely based upon the record of what has taken place in the court below and the grounds of appeal in such cases are, generally speaking, concerned with specific errors which are alleged to have occurred in the conduct of the trial. As the decision of the Court of Appeal is likely to turn on whether or not the errors so alleged justify the quashing of the conviction or the granting of a new trial, it is, of course, necessary that the grounds set forth in the Notice of Appeal should detail the errors upon which reliance is to be placed in such manner as to inform the respondent of the issues to be met on the appeal and to afford him an opportunity to prepare his case accordingly. In the case of an appeal by way of trial de novo under s. 727 the Appeal Court is not in the least concerned with specific errors in the conduct of the first trial for the very good reason that its decision must be based upon the evidence introduced at the second one, and, accordingly, it is, in my opinion, quite legitimate, in a case such as the present, for the Notice of Appeal under s. 722 to confine itself to raising the broader issue of whether or not the accused has been wrongly acquitted or convicted. I venture to say that the realities of the situation in such cases very often are that an accused who considers himself to have been wrongly convicted is simply launching his appeal in the hope that another judge may take a different view of the evidence from that taken by the magistrate who convicted him, and as I consider that an accused is entitled to do this under the provisions of ss. 722 to 727 of the Criminal Code I am of opinion that by saying \u201cthat the conviction was against the evidence and the weight of evidence and contrary to law\u201d the applicant in this case has sufficiently designated the grounds upon which he seeks relief.\nNotwithstanding the above, I am far from being of opinion that the statement of grounds required by s. 722 is a mere empty formality. As will appear from what has been said in the case of Regina v. Bamsey, supra, I consider that grounds which are obviously irrelevant, frivolous or irreconcilable with the record of the plea in the court below are unacceptable and that if the ground of appeal is that the accused wrongly or mistakenly pleaded guilty in the court below, the reasons which he proposes to urge for being allowed to change his plea in the Appeal Court should be set forth in the Notice of Appeal. I am also of opinion that if the appeal is based upon questions of law, those questions should also be set out in the Notice of Appeal and it is not enough for the applicant to simply say that the conviction was \u201ccontrary to law\u201d.\nAn example of a ground of appeal which does not meet the requirements of s. 722 because of irrelevance is afforded by the second ground set forth in the applicants Notice of Appeal from the summary conviction court in this case. By that ground the applicant alleged that the magistrate \u201capplied the wrong standard of care to the facts and circumstances of the alleged infraction\u201d and as it was not \u201cstandard of care\u201d but \u201cdegree of intoxication\u201d which was at issue before the magistrate, this ground is bad on its face, not because it is lacking in particularity but because it is meaningless in the context in which it is employed.\nIt will be seen from the above that I do not agree with the decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario in Regina v. Souter, supra, and that I am of opinion that the first ground of appeal set forth in the Notice of Appeal to the County Court in this case was effective to clothe the County Court judge with jurisdiction to hear the appeal by way of trial de novo.\nThe appeal should, therefore, be allowed, but there remains to be considered the question of what order this Court is entitled to grant in the circumstances.\nThe Criminal Appeal Rules applicable in the Province of Ontario in such cases (see ss. 586 and 743 of the Criminal Code) include the following:\nRULE 19:\nWhere upon an application for leave to appeal the court is of the opinion that leave should be granted, the court may thereupon and without further delay hear the appeal upon its merits or may, if it sees fit, direct the case to be placed upon the list for hearing at such future time as the court may determine.\nSection 46 of the Supreme Court Act provides that:\nThe Court may dismiss an appeal or give the judgment and award the process or other proceedings that the court, whose decision is appealed against, should have given or awarded.\nWithout having any further material before it and without it being necessary for the applicant to file a Notice of Appeal, the Court of Appeal in the present case could, and in my opinion should, have heard and allowed the appeal on its merits and the judgment which should have been given was to order the case to be remitted to the County Court.\nWhat has been said by counsel enables me to conclude that what in fact happened was that the Court of Appeal reached a decision upon the merits of the appeal, and although its judgment took the form of an order refusing leave to appeal it was in fact a judgment on the merits. I am of opinion that s. 46 of the Supreme Court Act is capable of being construed and on the particular facts of this case should be construed as empowering this Court to give the judgment on the merits \u201cthat the court, whose decision is appealed against, should have given or awarded\u201d.\nI would accordingly allow the appeal, set aside the orders of the Court of Appeal and the County Court judge and remit the case to the County Court judge to be heard on appeal by way of trial de novo.\nApplication for leave to appeal dismissed, CARTWRIGHT, MARTLAND and RITCHIE JJ. dissenting.\nSolicitors for the applicant: Stewart, Corbett & Musclow, Brockville.\nSolicitor for the respondent: The Attorney-General for Ontario.\n[1] (1958), 26 W.W.R. 36, 119 C.C.C. 192, 29 C.R. 44.\n[2] [1959] O.W.N. 40, 123 C.C.C. 393, 29 C.R. 306.\n[3] [1960] S.C.R. 60, 125 C.C.C. 209, 31 C.R. 374.\n[4] [1956] S.C.R. 134, 6 D.L.R.

Respondents.\n1959: June 10, 11; 1960: March 8.\nPresent: Kerwin C.J. and Taschereau, Fauteux, Abbott and Judson JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE EXCHEQUER COURT OF CANADA.\nTaxation\u2014Succession duty\u2014Residue of estate left to wife with power of disposal\u2014Undisposed portion to go to named legatees\u2014Disclaimer of right of disposal made in favour of named legatees within 8 years of death\u2014Whether disclaimed residue taxable as part of wife's estate\u2014Whether disclaimer a gift inter vivos\u2014Whether substitution created by will\u2014Whether \"succession\" within Dominion Succession Duty Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 89, s. 3(1) (c) and (4) \u2014Civil Code, arts. 925 et seq., 960, 962.\nBy his will, the testator bequeathed the residue of his estate to his wife for her free use and disposal, and to the extent that she had not disposed of it during her life, to named legatees. The testator died in 1938 and his wife in 1954. During her life, the wife received the income from the residue but no part of the capital. In 1951, the wife executed a deed of disclaimer of her right to dispose of the residue of her husband's estate delivering over the capital to the named legatees but reserving the income for her own use. In assessing the wife's estate for succession duty at her death, the Minister added the residuary estate of the testator on the ground that it was deemed to form part of her estate and a succession from her to her husband's heirs was deemed to have occurred within the meaning of s. 3(1) (c) and (4) of the Dominion Succession Duty Act . The Exchequer Court of Canada reversed the decision of the Minister, and the Crown appealed to this Court.\nHeld: (Fauteux and Judson JJ. dissenting): The residuary estate was not subject to succession duty.\nPer Kerwin C.J. and Taschereau and Abbott JJ.: A fiduciary substitution having been created by the testator's will, the named legatees received the property directly from the testator pursuant to art. 962 C.C. and consequently that property was excluded from the wife's estate. The three elements necessary to create a substitution were present in the testator's will: two successive benefits were conferred, one to the institute and the other to the substitutes, and there was to be a period between the enjoyment of the institute and the opening of the substitution. The fact that the institute could dispose of the property was no obstacle, as art. 952 provides for a substitution de residuo. Furthermore, an institute can, as was done in this case, deliver over the property in anticipation pursuant to art. 960, and it would be erroneous to think that such a delivery of substituted property constitutes a gift inter vivos. Consequently, as the wife, institute, was not invested with a general power of designation or disposition at her death, s. 3(4) of the Act had no application. Section 3(c) had also no application, since no property was taken under a disposition operating or purporting to operate as an immediate gift inter vivos.\nPer Fauteux and Judson JJ., dissenting: There was, within the technical meaning ascribed to it by the Dominion Succession Duty Act , a succession from the testator's wife concerning the residuary property delivered over pursuant to the deed of disclaimer.\nBy the terms of the testator's will, the wife was given a general power of disposal within the meaning of s. 3(4) of the Act, and her failure to exercise this power would result in the named legatees receiving at her death the property. The fact that under the Civil Code, a substitution might have been created by the testator's will, could not prevent the application of the Act. What constitutes a succession under the Act is the receipt of the property by the benficiary as a consequence of the failure on the part of the institute to exercise the general power of designation or disposition.\nThe submission that s. 3(4) of the Act had no application since, by virtue of the deed of disclaimer, the named legatees received at the time of the making of the deed and not at the time of the wife's death, could not be entertained. Whether art. 960 of the Code applied or not, whether the deed of disclaimer was effective or not to transfer or deliver the property, there was a succession either under s. 3(4) or under s. 3(1) (c). If art. 960 applied and the legatees received at the time of the wife's death, there was within s. 3(1) (c) a gift inter vivos within three years of the wife's death. On the other hand, if the deed of disclaimer did not constitute within art. 960 a delivery in anticipation, there was either, if the property was transferred, a gift within s. 3(1) (c) or, if the property was not transferred, a succession was deemed to have taken place under s. 3(4) .

A. Larivi\u00e8re et un des ses coll\u00e8gues, mais ce dernier n'a aucune importance dans la pr\u00e9sente cause. Cependant, avant son d\u00e9c\u00e8s, Dame Helen Richmond Day, veuve de feu Edgar Maurice Smith, a le 24 ao\u00fbt 1951, devant Dakers Cameron, Notaire Public, sign\u00e9 un document o\u00f9 elle appara\u00eet comme partie de premi\u00e8re part, o\u00f9 \u00e9galement sont signataires les ex\u00e9cuteurs testamentaires de son \u00e9poux d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9, et tous les autres h\u00e9ritiers \u00e9ventuels mentionn\u00e9s au testament, comme parties de seconde et de troisi\u00e8me part. Il est d\u00e9clar\u00e9 ce qui suit:\n1. The Party of the First Part hereby disclaims, refuses to accept and repudiates purely and simply, with effect as from the death of the said Testator, any and all right granted to her or which she might have under the provisions of the said Last Will and Testament or by law to dispose of the property comprising the residue of the Estate of the said Testator or any part of the said residue, and the Parties of the First, Second and Third Parts agree that this disclaimer, refusal and repudiation shall be and remain irrevocable.\n2. The Party of the First Part hereby delivers over to the Substitutes under the said substitution in anticipation of the term appointed for the opening thereof the naked ownership of the property comprising the residue of the Estate of the said Testator, and the Parties of the Second and Third Parts acknowledge to have received and accept the said delivery.\nLes ex\u00e9cuteurs testamentaires ont accept\u00e9 au m\u00eame acte, de recevoir la d\u00e9livrance par anticipation des biens faisant l'objet du document du mois d'ao\u00fbt 1951, et ont consenti \u00e0 d\u00e9tenir les biens substitu\u00e9s pour les appel\u00e9s \u00e0 la substitution, durant la vie de la partie de premi\u00e8re part, et \u00e0 lui payer les revenus nets provenant de ces biens, jusqu'\u00e0 sa mort. Evidement, les parties ont cru qu'il s'agissait d'une substitution, et que la grev\u00e9e Madame Smith pouvait, en vertu de l'art. 960 du Code Civil, faire la remise par anticipation des biens aux appel\u00e9s. C'est ce qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait, car ceux \u00e0 qui ces biens ont \u00e9t\u00e9 remis \u00e9taient les h\u00e9ritiers \u00e9ventuels en qualit\u00e9 d'appel\u00e9s \u00e0 la mort de Madame Smith.\nA la mort de Edgar Maurice Smith en 1938, la Loi des successions f\u00e9d\u00e9rales n'existait pas, et seuls les droits provinciaux ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pay\u00e9s par ses ex\u00e9cuteurs testamentaires. Mais au d\u00e9c\u00e8s de Dame Helen Richmond Day Smith, les ex\u00e9cuteurs testamentaires ont, le 20 juin 1954, produit un \u00e9tat au D\u00e9partment du Revenu National constatant que la valeur nette de sa succession \u00e9tait de $428,504.20. Cependant, le 30 mai 1955, les ex\u00e9cuteurs de cette derni\u00e8re ont \u00e9t\u00e9 avis\u00e9s par le D\u00e9partment du Revenu National que la succession, pour fins d'imp\u00f4t, \u00e9tait de $609,303.80. L'augmentation de $180,799.60 repr\u00e9sentait la valeur des biens substitu\u00e9s de la succession de Edgar Maurice Smith, et transport\u00e9s aux appel\u00e9s par Madame Helen Richmond Day Smith en vertu de la d\u00e9claration du 24 ao\u00fbt 1951.\nLes ex\u00e9cuteurs testamentaires ont appel\u00e9 de cette d\u00e9cision au Ministre, et ce dernier, le 9 f\u00e9vrier 1956, a confirm\u00e9 l'acte de ses officiers, et a rendu la d\u00e9cision suivante:\nas having been made in accordance with the provisions of the Act and in particular on the ground that the said Helen Richmond Day Smith was at the time of her death competent to dispose of the property which she was given power to appropriate by the Will of the late Edgar Maurice Smith and the said property has been properly subjected to duty under the provisions of subsection (4) of section 3 of the Act.\nLes ex\u00e9cuteurs ont appel\u00e9 \u00e0 le Cour de l'\u00c9chiquier, et l'honorable Juge Kearney a renvers\u00e9 cette d\u00e9cision, et a maintenu que ces biens substitu\u00e9s ne faisaient pas partie de la succession de Dame Edgar Maurice Smith, et qu'en cons\u00e9quence, ils n'\u00e9taient pas sujets \u00e0 l'imp\u00f4t.\nEn effet, en vertu des dispositions du Code Civil de la province de Qu\u00e9bec, s'il s'agit d'une substitution, les appel\u00e9s auraient re\u00e7u ces biens directement du testateur, et ils seraient en cons\u00e9quence exclus de la succession de Madame Day Smith. L'article 962 est r\u00e9dig\u00e9 dans les termes suivants:\n962 C.C.\u2014L'appel\u00e9 re\u00e7oit les biens directement du substituant et non du grev\u00e9.\nSi tel est le cas, et s'il s'agit v\u00e9ritablement de biens substitu\u00e9s, la pr\u00e9tention du Ministre est erron\u00e9e. La Couronne soutient qu'il n'y a pas de substitution et que ces biens sont sujets \u00e0 l'imp\u00f4t parce que le document o\u00f9 Madame Day Smith aurait, le 24 ao\u00fbt 1951, renonc\u00e9 \u00e0 la substitution par anticipation et remis les biens aux appel\u00e9s, \u00e9tait une donation inter vivos et faite dans les trois ans pr\u00e9c\u00e9dant la mort de la d\u00e9funte. Il s'agirait donc d'une \"succession\" vis\u00e9e par l'art. 3(1) (c) et (4) de la Loi f\u00e9d\u00e9rale sur les droits successoraux de 1945 et amendements.\nL'article de la Loi f\u00e9d\u00e9rale sur les droits successoraux pertinent, et affectant la pr\u00e9sente cause se lit ainsi:\n3. (1) Une 'succession' est cens\u00e9e comprendre les dispositions de biens suivantes, et le b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire et le d\u00e9funt sont r\u00e9put\u00e9s le 'successeur' et le 'pr\u00e9d\u00e9cesseur', respectivement, \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de ces biens. c) les biens recueillis en vertu d'une disposition produisant ou tendant \u00e0 produire les m\u00eames effets qu'une donation imm\u00e9diate entre vifs, par voie de transfert, d\u00e9livrance, d\u00e9claration de fiducie ou autrement, faite le ou apr\u00e8s le 29 avril 1941 et dans les trois ann\u00e9es ant\u00e9rieures au d\u00e9c\u00e8s du de cujus.\n3. (4) Losque, au d\u00e9c\u00e8s d'une personne ayant un pouvoir g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de d\u00e9signation ou de disposition de biens, une personne recueille un int\u00e9r\u00eat b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire dans les biens en cons\u00e9quence du d\u00e9faut, par le de cujus, d'exercer le pouvoir en question, le fait de recueillir l'int\u00e9r\u00eat dans les biens est cens\u00e9 constituer une succession, et le b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire et le de cujus sont respectivement r\u00e9put\u00e9s le 'successeur' et le 'pr\u00e9d\u00e9cesseur' \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard des biens.\nIl est bon de noter d\u00e8s maintenant que, durant son vivant, Helen Richmond Day Smith n'a touch\u00e9 \u00e0 aucune partie du capital laiss\u00e9 au d\u00e9c\u00e8s du mari, qui faisait partie de sa succession, et que depuis la mort de son mari jusqu'\u00e0 son propre d\u00e9c\u00e8s, elle n'a per\u00e7u que les revenus de ces biens.\nLa premi\u00e8re question qu'il importe de d\u00e9terminer est celle de savoir si les biens dont les appel\u00e9s ont \u00e9t\u00e9 investis, font l'objet d'une substitution dont ces derniers auraient h\u00e9rit\u00e9 directement de Edgar Maurice Smith, le testateur, en vertu des dispositions de l'art. 962 C.C. cit\u00e9 pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment.\nDans le droit de la province de Qu\u00e9bec, les substitutions existent en vertu des art. 925 et suivants du Code. Mignault a d\u00e9fini la substitution comme \u00e9tant \"une disposition par laquelle, en gratifiant quelqu'un, on le charge de rendre la chose donn\u00e9e \u00e0 un tiers que l'on gratifie en second ordre.\" Il r\u00e9sulte de cette d\u00e9finition que la substitution comprend au moins trois personnes: celle qui dispose, celle qui est gratifi\u00e9e \u00e0 charge de rendre (grev\u00e9e), et celle \u00e0 qui l'on doit rendre (appel\u00e9e). La substitution porte donc sur une chose que le grev\u00e9 re\u00e7oit pour la rendre \u00e0 l'appel\u00e9. Il y a par cons\u00e9quent trois \u00e9l\u00e9ments dans la substitution: deux lib\u00e9ralit\u00e9s, un ordre successif, et un trait de temps que les Romains appelaient le tractus temporis. Si l'un de ces \u00e9l\u00e9ments fait d\u00e9faut, il n'y a pas de substitution.\nC'est d'ailleurs ce que Pothier exprimait dans des termes \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s identiques quand il a ainsi d\u00e9fini la substitution fid\u00e9icommissaire:\nC'est la disposition que je fais d'une chose au profit de quelqu'un par le canal d'une personne interpos\u00e9e, que q'ai charg\u00e9e de lui rendre. Th\u00e9venot d'Essaule de Savigny qui, comme Pothier, a \u00e9crit avant la codification du Code Napol\u00e9on de 1804, et qui aussi s'est inspir\u00e9 de la Grande Ordonnance sur les substitutions de 1747, promulgu\u00e9e par Louis XV, donne \u00e0 son tour la d\u00e9finition suivante:\nC'est une disposition de l'homme, par laquelle, en gratifiant quelqu'un express\u00e9ment ou tacitement, on le charge de rendre la chose \u00e0 lui donn\u00e9e, ou une autre chose, \u00e0 un tiers qu l'on gratifie en second ordre.\nNous avons chez nous, comme on le sait, deux sortes de substitutions: la substitution vulgaire et la substitution fid\u00e9icommissaire (925 C.C.) et en vertu de l'art. 926, la substitution fid\u00e9icommissaire comprend toujours la substitution vulgaire.\nIl ne faut pas confondre les substitutions telles qu'elles existent en France et les substitutions qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 accept\u00e9es par nos codificateurs. Comme nous l'avons vu, ici nous avons la substitution vulgaire et la substitution fid\u00e9icommissaire, mais en France, en vertu des disposition de l'art. 896 du Code Napol\u00e9on, les substitutions sont prohib\u00e9es, mais cette prohibition ne s'applique qu'aux substitutions fid\u00e9icommissaires. En effet, l'art. 898 du Code Napol\u00e9on permet la substitution vulgaire, c'est-\u00e0-dire la disposition par laquelle un tiers est appel\u00e9 \u00e0 recueillir le don, l'h\u00e9r\u00e9dit\u00e9 ou le legs, dans le cas o\u00f9 le donataire, l'h\u00e9ritier institu\u00e9 ou le l\u00e9gataire ne peut recueillir. La raison est que les codificateurs en France ont voulu accorder aux citoyens fran\u00e7ais la plus compl\u00e8te libert\u00e9 de tester. Cette libert\u00e9 n'est pas entrav\u00e9e quand il existe une substitution vulgaire, mais elle l'est au contraire dans la substitution fid\u00e9icommissaire, vu qu'il existe un ordre successif qui est un \u00e9l\u00e9ment essentiel \u00e0 la substitution fid\u00e9icommissaire et qui, \u00e0 cause de la double lib\u00e9ralit\u00e9 du substituant, prive le grev\u00e9 du droit de tester. Dans la province de Qu\u00e9bec, cependant, nous n'avons aucun article correspondant aux art. 896 et 898 du Code fran\u00e7ais, et la substitution vulgaire comme la substitution fid\u00e9icommissaire font partie int\u00e9grante de notre droit civil. En France, on admet, en outre de la substitution vulgaire, un fid\u00e9icommis de residuo ou de eo quod supererit, mais qui se distingue clairement de la substitution fid\u00e9icommissaire du droit de Qu\u00e9bec. Ainsi, la jurisprudence fran\u00e7aise veut que le fid\u00e9icommis de eo quod superit, par lequel le donataire ou le l\u00e9gataire est charg\u00e9 de rendre \u00e0 son d\u00e9c\u00e8s ce qui lui restera des biens donn\u00e9s ou l\u00e9gu\u00e9s, est valable, car il n'emporte pas la charge de conserver. (Vide Dalloz, Nouv. Rep., vol. 4, p. 333, n\u00b0 11). Mais, ce qui emp\u00eache en France une semblable disposition de cr\u00e9er une substitution et rend la disposition valide, c'est que la substitution est prohib\u00e9e. Mais ici, tel n'est pas le cas, car nous avons l'art. 952 qui stipule le contraire. Cet article n'a pas d'article correspondant dans le Code fran\u00e7ais.\nCe serait donc une erreur de s'inspirer des auteurs fran\u00e7ais qui ont \u00e9crit depuis la codification en France, pour chercher des directives l\u00e9gales sur les substitutions fid\u00e9icommissaires. C'est plut\u00f4t vers Ricard, Pothier et Th\u00e9venot d'Essaule, qui ont \u00e9crit avant la codification, qu'il faut se tourner pour voir quelle est chez nous la v\u00e9ritable doctrine que la France a rejet\u00e9e en 1804, mais que nos codificateurs et l'Union ont accept\u00e9e en 1866.\nJ'ai dit pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment que l'un des \u00e9l\u00e9ments essentiels de la substitution fid\u00e9icommissaire, telle que comprise dans la province de Qu\u00e9bec, est que le substituant fasse deux lib\u00e9ralit\u00e9s. Il y a en premier lieu une lib\u00e9ralit\u00e9 envers le grev\u00e9 et, en second lieu, une lib\u00e9ralit\u00e9 envers l'appel\u00e9. Dans le cas de l'usufruit, il y a \u00e9galement deux lib\u00e9ralit\u00e9s simultan\u00e9es, en ce sens que l'usufruitier a le droit de jouir de la chose, dont une autre personne est en m\u00eame temps propri\u00e9taire. Dans la substitution, ces lib\u00e9ralit\u00e9s sont successives, en ce sens que le grev\u00e9 poss\u00e8de pour lui-m\u00eame, \u00e0 titre de propri\u00e9taire (C.C. 944), et ce n'est que lorsqu'il a rendu la chose \u00e0 l'appel\u00e9,, que ce dernier en devient le propri\u00e9taire subs\u00e9quent. Il y a donc un ordre successif et un trait de temps qui sont aussi les \u00e9l\u00e9ments essentiels de la substitution.\nDans le cas qui se pr\u00e9sente, le testateur a donn\u00e9 le r\u00e9sidu de ses biens \u00e0 son \u00e9pouse avec droit d'en disposer avant son d\u00e9c\u00e8s, et s'il n'y a pas de telle ali\u00e9nation ou disposition de biens, le r\u00e9sidu est d\u00e9volu \u00e0 des appel\u00e9s que le testateur a express\u00e9ment nomm\u00e9s. Il y a donc double lib\u00e9ralit\u00e9 successive, et un espace de temps, un tractus temporis, entre la p\u00e9riode o\u00f9 l'\u00e9pouse du testateur a la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 des biens, et le temps o\u00f9 elle doit devenir celle des appel\u00e9s. On objecte ici que l'obligation de conserver les biens n'existe pas, car la grev\u00e9e peut en disposer, et il s'ensuivrait qu'il n'y a donc pas de substitution. Mais, comme le faisait remarquer M. le Juge Demers dans une cause de Deguire v. Despatie, il y a des substitutions qui diff\u00e8rent de la substitution ordinaire. C'est l'id\u00e9e que Pothier exprimait dans son Trait\u00e9 des Substitutions, vol. 8, p. 502, art. 140 et 141:\nPar exemple un h\u00e9ritier est quelquefois grev\u00e9 de restituer apr\u00e8s son d\u00e9c\u00e8s ce qui reste des biens de la succession, quod ex haeriditate superfuerit.\nCette substitution est diff\u00e9rente des substitutions universelles ordinaires, en ce qu'elle ne comprend pas tous les biens qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 laiss\u00e9s au grev\u00e9, mais seulement ceux qui lui restent lors de son d\u00e9c\u00e8s.\nEvidemment, nos codificateurs ont accept\u00e9 cette opinion de Pothier, car l'art. 929 C.C. dit ce qui suit:\nLa disposition qui substitue peut \u00eatre conditionnelle comme toute autre donation ou legs.\nMais il me semble que l'art. 952 du Code Civil doit d\u00e9finitivement d\u00e9terminer la solution de ce litige. Cet article, tr\u00e8s clair, est redig\u00e9 dans les termes suivants:\nLe substituant peut ind\u00e9finiment permettre l'ali\u00e9nation des biens substitu\u00e9s; la substitution n'a d'effet en ce cas que si l'ali\u00e9nation n'a pas eu lieu.\nIl est clair que si les biens sont tous ali\u00e9n\u00e9s par le grev\u00e9, qui a le droit de le faire, il n'y a plus de substitution, car il ne reste plus alors d'objet dont pourrait \u00eatre saisi l'appel\u00e9. Mais lorsqu'il reste des biens, \u00e0 la mort du grev\u00e9, la substitution a lieu pour les biens qui demeurent. C'est pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment ce que veut l'art. 952 C.C. C'est ce qu'on est convenu d'appeler une substitution de residuo; que le r\u00e9sidu comprenne la totalit\u00e9 des biens substitu\u00e9s ou la partie seulement qui n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 ali\u00e9n\u00e9e, et dont le grev\u00e9, d\u00fbment autoris\u00e9 par le substituant, n'a pas dispos\u00e9 durant la p\u00e9riode de temps pendant laquelle il \u00e9tait propri\u00e9taire des biens.\nA ce propos, Mignault, vol. 5, p. 92, dit ceci:\nSans m\u00e9conna\u00eetre la force des raisons que l'on invoque aujourd'hui en France afin de soustraire le fid\u00e9icommis de residuo \u00e0 la prohibition que les auteurs du Code Napol\u00e9on ont port\u00e9e contre la substitution fid\u00e9icommissaire, je crois que nous pouvons accueillir dans notre droit la tradition de l'ancienne jurisprudence qui reconnaissait \u00e0 ce fid\u00e9icommis le caract\u00e8re de substitution fid\u00e9icommissaire. Commentant l'art. 952, Trudel, vol. 6, p. 273, dit:\nIl suffit de dire que le Code permet de faire valablement une substitution fid\u00e9icommissaire de cette nature, laissant au grev\u00e9 la libert\u00e9 d'ali\u00e9ner, puisque le grev\u00e9 n'est charg\u00e9 de rendre et ne doit conserver que ce qui restera lors de l'ouverture de la substitution.\nTh\u00e9venot d'Essaule a pos\u00e9 la question dans son ouvrage sur Les Substitutions et a r\u00e9pondu: non, il n'est pas de l'essence de la substitution fid\u00e9icommissaire que le grev\u00e9 n'ait pas la libert\u00e9 ind\u00e9finie d'ali\u00e9ner; une substitution contenant pareille clause est valable vu qu'il y a obligation de rendre dans le cas o\u00f9 le grev\u00e9 n'aurait pas ali\u00e9n\u00e9.\nCette substitution est diff\u00e9rente des substitutions universelles ordinaires, en ce qu'elle ne comprend pas tous les biens qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 laiss\u00e9s au grev\u00e9, mais seulement ceux qui lui restent lors de son d\u00e9c\u00e8s.\nVide \u00e9galement 2 Ricard, p. 453; 8 Pothier, \"Substitutions\", n\u00b0 140.\nNormalement, le grev\u00e9 a la jouissance et la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 des biens substitu\u00e9s sa vie durant, ou \u00e0 l'arriv\u00e9e d'un terme fix\u00e9 par le substituant. Le grev\u00e9 peut cependant, \u00e0 son choix, \u00e0 moins qu'un d\u00e9lai n'ait \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tabli pour l'avantage de l'appel\u00e9, faire la remise des biens par anticipation (960 C.C.). C'est ce qui est arriv\u00e9 dans le pr\u00e9sent cas, le 24 ao\u00fbt 1951, quand Madame Helen Richmond Day Smith, par acte notari\u00e9, a renonc\u00e9 purement et simplement en faveur des appel\u00e9s mentionn\u00e9s au testament, \u00e0 tous les droits qui lui \u00e9taient conf\u00e9r\u00e9s par le testament de son mari, y compris \u00e0 celui de disposer des biens substitu\u00e9s, faisant par l\u00e0 une remise du r\u00e9sidu de tous les biens aux appel\u00e9s \u00e0 la substitution.\nC'est une erreur de penser que cette remise des biens faite par la grev\u00e9e en faveur des appel\u00e9s avant son d\u00e9c\u00e8s, constitue un avantage inter vivos consenti par Madame Smith aux appel\u00e9s. L'article 960 cit\u00e9 plus haut autorise cette remise par anticipation, et d'ailleurs, Mignault, vol. 5, p. 124, commentant cet article, dit ce qui suit:\nLe grev\u00e9, tenu de restituer les biens aux appel\u00e9s \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque de sa mort ou \u00e0 un autre temps, anticipe sur le terme fix\u00e9 par le substituant, renon\u00e7ant, par l\u00e0, en faveur des appel\u00e9s, au titre m\u00eame en vertu duquel il d\u00e9tenait les biens substitutes.\nCette restitution des biens entra\u00eene l'ouverture de la substitution, pourvu qu'elle soit faite en faveur de tous les appel\u00e9s.\nJe suis donc d'opinion qu'il s'agit d'une substitution fid\u00e9icommissaire dans le pr\u00e9sent cas, et que par cons\u00e9quent les appel\u00e9s ont h\u00e9rit\u00e9 directement d'Edgar Maurice Smith. Je pense aussi que la remise des biens faite par anticipation par l'\u00e9pouse du testateur est valide, et que les biens auxquels elle a renonc\u00e9 en 1951, ne font pas partie de sa propre succession ouverte en 1954, et qu'il ne peut s'agir d'une donation inter vivos, consentie par Madame Smith.\nLa seule conclusion logique qui, \u00e0 mon sens, s'impose, est qu'\u00e0 son d\u00e9c\u00e8s, l'\u00e9pouse n'avait pas un pouvoir g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de d\u00e9signation ou de disposition de biens, parce qu'elle y a renonc\u00e9 irr\u00e9vocablement en 1951. C'est l'art. 960 C.C. qui lui a permis d'agir ainsi.\nLa loi f\u00e9d\u00e9rale autorisant le pr\u00e9l\u00e8vement de droits successoraux (art. 3(4) supra), sur des biens qu'une personne poss\u00e8de \u00e0 son d\u00e9c\u00e8s, et affect\u00e9s d'un pouvoir de d\u00e9signation qui n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 exerc\u00e9, n'a donc aucune application. A sa mort, Madame Smith, la grev\u00e9e, n'avait aucun droit de d\u00e9signation.\nIl me para\u00eet clair \u00e9galement que l'art. 3(c) ne peut affecter ce litige. Il ne s'agit pas, en effet, de biens recueillis en vertu d'une disposition produisant ou tendant \u00e0 produire les m\u00eames effets qu'une donation imm\u00e9diate entre vifs.\nPour les raisons ci-dessus, et pour celles donn\u00e9es par M. le Juge Kearney de la Cour de l'\u00c9chiquier, je suis d'opinion que cet appel doit \u00eatre rejet\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens.\nThe judgment of Fauteux and Judson JJ. was delivered by\nFauteux J. (dissenting):\u2014L'appelant se pourvoit \u00e0 l'encontre d'un jugement de la Cour de l'\u00c9chiquier2 annulant une cotisation impos\u00e9e en vertu de la Loi f\u00e9d\u00e9rale sur les droits successoraux (1940-41), 4-5 George VI, c. 14 et ses amendements, et ordonnant la revision de cette cotisation conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision de la Cour sur la question litigieuse divisant les parties. Les circonstances donnant lieu \u00e0 ce litige sont les suivantes.\nAux termes de son dernier testament, Edgar Maurice Smith, apr\u00e8s avoir pourvu au paiement de ses dettes, autoris\u00e9 certaines d\u00e9penses et fait certains legs particuliers, disposait comme suit du r\u00e9sidu de ses biens, aux arts. 9 et 10 de cette derni\u00e8re expression de volont\u00e9s.\nNINTH\nAS to the rest, residue and remainder of my Estate and property, real and personal, moveable and immoveable, including any Life Insurance payable to my Estate, and not specifically distributed or apportioned, I hereby will, devise and bequeath the same to my dear wife, the said DAME HELEN RICHMOND DAY, to have, hold, use, enjoy and dispose of the same as fully and freely as if the next following disposition had not been contained in this my Last Will and Testament.\nTENTH\nIN THE EVENT that my said dear wife, DAME HELEN RICHMOND DAY, should predecease me, or to the extent that my said dear wife has not during her lifetime disposed of the residue of my Estate hereinabove bequeathed to her, I will and bequeath to ................\nSuit alors la mention de personnes susceptibles de devenir b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaires advenant l'une des \u00e9ventualit\u00e9s conditionnant la mise en op\u00e9ration de cette clause 10.\nSmith d\u00e9c\u00e9da le 4 septembre 1938. Son \u00e9pouse, lui survivant, accepta la succession qui lui \u00e9tait ainsi d\u00e9volue. De cette date \u00e0 celle de son propre d\u00e9c\u00e8s, survenant quelque seize ans plus tard, soit le 20 juin 1954, elle toucha tous les revenus de ces biens.\nLe 24 ao\u00fbt 1951, pr\u00e8s de treize ans apr\u00e8s le d\u00e9c\u00e8s de son \u00e9poux, et moins de trois ans avant le sien, Madame Smith, les ex\u00e9cuteurs testamentaires de feu son \u00e9poux, et certaines personnes mentionn\u00e9es \u00e0 la clause 10 comparaissaient devant notaire et signaient respectivement, comme partie de premi\u00e8re, deuxi\u00e8me et troisi\u00e8me part, un acte portant minutes intitul\u00e9 DEED OF DECLARATION AND ACCEPTANCE, qu'il convient de citer au texte, en num\u00e9rotant en chiffres romains, pour fins de r\u00e9f\u00e9rence ult\u00e9rieure, les divers paragraphes:\nWHICH SAID PARTIES DECLARED AS FOLLOWS:\u2014\ni. THAT said late Edgar Maurice Smith died on or about the fourth day of September, One thousand nine hundred and thirty-eight, leaving his said Last Will and Testament, whereby he bequeathed the residue of his Estate as provided in Articles NINTH and TENTH thereof.\nii. THAT the provisions of said Last Will and Testament constitute under the laws of the Province of Quebec a substitution de residuo, under which substitution the Party of the First Part is the Institute and the Parties of the Third Part are the Substitutes;\niii. THAT the Party of the First Part acknowledges that the right which she as Institute under such a substitution would have to dispose of the substituted property, being the residue of the Estate of the said Testator, is limited to alienation by one onerous title for the sole purpose of providing for her needs of support and maintenance;\niv. THAT the said Testator did not extend the said power of disposal beyond the limits aforesaid as appears from the provisions of Article THIRTEENTH of the said Last Will and Testament which provided that all property bequeathed by the said Will was intended for the support and maintenance of the beneficiaries; v. THAT the said right to dispose of the residue of the Estate of the said Testator has never been accepted or acted on or availed of in any way by the Party of the First Part and the substituted property, being the residue of the Estate of the said Testator, has since his death always remained in the physical possession of and been administered by the Parties of the Second Part;\nvi. THAT although under the terms of the said Last Will and Testament the opening of the said substitution would only take place at the death of the Party of the First Part at which time the substituted property would be delivered over to the substitutes, the Party of the First part has a right to deliver over the substituted property in anticipation of the term appointed for the opening of the substitution;\nvii. THAT the Party of the First Part desires to record a disclaimer and repudiation of any and all right to dispose of the substituted property and desires to deliver over the naked ownership of the substituted property in anticipation of the term appointed for the opening of the substitution;\nNOW, THEREFORE, THESE PRESENTS AND THE SAID NOTARY WITNESS:\u2014\nviii. 1. The Party of the First Part hereby disclaims, refuses to accept and repudiates purely and simply, with effect as from the death of the said Testator, any and all right granted to her or which she might have under the provisions of the said Last Will and Testament or by law to dispose of the property comprising the residue of the Estate of the said Testator or any part of the said residue, and the Parties of the First, Second and Third Parts agree that this disclaimer, refusal and repudiation shall be and remain irrevocable.\nix. 2. The Party of the First Part hereby delivers over to the Substitutes under the said substitution in anticipation of the term appointed for the opening thereof the naked ownership of the property comprising the residue of the Estate of the said Testator, and the Parties of the Second and Third Parts acknowledge to have received and accept the said delivery.\nx. 3. The Parties of the Second Part hereby consent to the foregoing delivery in anticipation and agree to hold the said substituted property for the Substitutes under the said substitution during the lifetime of the Party of the First Part and to pay to her the net revenue to be derived therefrom during her lifetime.\nApr\u00e8s la mort de Madame Smith, la d\u00e9termination de la valeur nette de sa succession, aux fins des droits successoraux exigibles sous le r\u00e9gime de la Loi f\u00e9d\u00e9rale sur les droits successoraux , donnait lieu au pr\u00e9sent d\u00e9bat entre, d'une part, le Ministre du Revenu National, et d'autre part, les ex\u00e9cuteurs testamentaires de Madame Smith et personnes mentionn\u00e9es \u00e0 la clause 10 du testament de son \u00e9poux intim\u00e9s en cette cause.\nSuivant les intim\u00e9s, la valeur nette de cette succession doit \u00eatre fix\u00e9e \u00e0 $428,504.20; alors qu'aux vues de l'appelant, cette valeur est de $609,303.80. L'exc\u00e9dent de $180,799.60 repr\u00e9sente la valeur admise de la nue-propri\u00e9t\u00e9 des biens dont Madame Smith disposa le 24 ao\u00fbt 1951, d'apr\u00e8s le DEED OF DECLARATION AND ACCEPTANCE.\nEn droit, la question \u00e0 r\u00e9soudre est de savoir si, contrairement aux pr\u00e9tentions des intim\u00e9s accueillies au jugement de la Cour de l'\u00c9chiquier mais conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 celles de l'appelant, il y a eu,\u2014au sens de la Loi f\u00e9d\u00e9rale sur les droits successoraux ,\u2014une succession venant de Madame Smith, en ce qui concerne les biens livr\u00e9s aux intim\u00e9s d'apr\u00e8s le DEED OF DECLARATION AND ACCEPTANCE.\nA la date de l'ouverture de la succession de Madame Smith, aussi bien qu'\u00e0 celle du DEED OF DECLARATION AND ACCEPTANCE, la Loi pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e\u2014\u00e9dict\u00e9e post\u00e9rieurement au d\u00e9c\u00e8s de son \u00e9poux,\u2014statuait, \u00e0 l'art. 3, ce que, pour les fins de cette loi, il faut entendre par le terme \"succession\". Telles qu'amend\u00e9es \u00e0 la session 1944-45 par 8 George VI, c. 37, les dispositions pertinentes de cet article se lisent comme suit:\n3. (1) Une 'succession' est cens\u00e9e comprendre les dispositions de biens suivantes, et le b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire et le d\u00e9funt sont r\u00e9put\u00e9s le 'successeur' et le 'pr\u00e9d\u00e9cesseur', respectivement, \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de ces biens.\n(c) les biens recueillis en vertu d'une disposition produisant ou tendant \u00e0 produire les m\u00eames effets qu'une donation imm\u00e9diate entre vifs, par voie de transfert, d\u00e9livrance, d\u00e9claration de fiducie ou autrement, faite le ou apr\u00e8s le 29 avril 1941, et dans les trois ann\u00e9es ant\u00e9rieures au d\u00e9c\u00e8s du de cujus.\n3. (4) Lorsque, au d\u00e9c\u00e8s d'une personne ayant un pouvoir g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de d\u00e9signation ou de disposition de biens, une personne recueille un int\u00e9r\u00eat b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire dans les biens en cons\u00e9quence du d\u00e9faut, par le de cujus, d'exercer le pouvoir en question, le fait de recueillir l'int\u00e9r\u00eat dans les biens est cens\u00e9 constituer une succession, et le b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire et le de cujus sont respectivement r\u00e9put\u00e9s le 'successeur' et le 'pr\u00e9d\u00e9cesseur' \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard des biens\".\nCes dispositions, comme d'ailleurs plusieurs sinon toutes les autres contenues en l'art. 3, illustrent manifestement qu'aux fins de la Loi f\u00e9d\u00e9rale sur les droits successoraux , le Parlement a donn\u00e9 au terme \"succession\" un sens technique d\u00e9bordant et m\u00eame en conflit avec le sens qui lui est propre sous le r\u00e9gime de la Common Law ou du Droit Civil de Qu\u00e9bec. C'est donc au regard de l'extension ainsi donn\u00e9e au terme que doivent \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9s le testament de Smith, le DEED OF DECLARATION AND ACCEPTANCE, et que la question en litige doit \u00eatre d\u00e9termin\u00e9e.\nLE TESTAMENT DE SMITH. A la clause 9, Smith, ci-apr\u00e8s appel\u00e9 le testateur, a dispos\u00e9 de tous ses biens non sp\u00e9cifiquement distribu\u00e9s ou r\u00e9partis. Suivant les termes de cette clause, il les a l\u00e9gu\u00e9s \u00e0 son \u00e9pouse\n\u2026 to have, hold, use, enjoy and dispose of the same as fully and freely as if the next following disposition (la clause 10) had not been contained in this my Last Will and Testament.\nLes mots ici soulign\u00e9s ne peuvent plus ad\u00e9quatement correspondre \u00e0 la d\u00e9finition m\u00eame du droit de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 l'art. 406 du Code Civil. Et c'est l\u00e0 la nature du droit conf\u00e9r\u00e9 aux termes de cette clause. Conjurant m\u00eame la possibilit\u00e9 de toute interpr\u00e9tation contraire qu'on pourrait chercher \u00e0 fonder sur les dispositions de la clause 10, le testateur a express\u00e9ment pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 qu'il entendait donner \u00e0 son \u00e9pouse le pouvoir et le droit d'exercer en toute libert\u00e9 et pl\u00e9nitude les droits qu'il lui conf\u00e9rait par cette clause 9, tout comme si la clause 10 n'e\u00fbt pas \u00e9t\u00e9 contenue dans son testament.\nA la clause 10, le testateur a pr\u00e9vu l'\u00e9ventualit\u00e9 du pr\u00e9d\u00e9c\u00e8s de son \u00e9pouse et la caducit\u00e9 de la clause 9 en r\u00e9sultant. Il a aussi pr\u00e9vu l'\u00e9ventualit\u00e9 o\u00f9, dans la cas de la survie de cette derni\u00e8re, elle n'aurait pas, de son vivant, dispos\u00e9 suivant son pouvoir g\u00e9n\u00e9ral et absolu de ce faire, du r\u00e9sidu \u00e0 elle l\u00e9gu\u00e9 par la clause 9. Il a alors pourvu \u00e0 la distribution et r\u00e9partition de tout ce r\u00e9sidu, dans le cas de pr\u00e9-d\u00e9c\u00e8s, ou, au cas de survie, de ce qui pourrait en rester lors du d\u00e9c\u00e8s de son \u00e9pouse.\nIl r\u00e9sulte des clauses 9 et 10 que, de son vivant, Madame Smith avait droit de jouir et de disposer en tout ou en partie du r\u00e9sidu, comme propri\u00e9taire absolue. Elle ne pouvait, cependant, en disposer par voie de testament. De son vivant, et comme tout propri\u00e9taire, elle pouvait \u00e0 son gr\u00e9 ali\u00e9ner ces biens \u00e0 titre on\u00e9reux ou \u00e0 titre gratuit. Elle avait donc, au sens de l'art. 3(4) de la Loi pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, d'apr\u00e8s les clauses 9 et 10 du testament de son \u00e9poux, un pouvoir g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de disposition des biens mentionn\u00e9s et son d\u00e9faut d'exercer ce pouvoir de son vivant avait, \u00e0 son d\u00e9c\u00e8s, la cons\u00e9quence de permettre aux personnes mentionn\u00e9es \u00e0 la clause 10 de recueillir ces biens suivant les parts et r\u00e9partitions y indiqu\u00e9es.\nContrairement \u00e0 ces vues sur l'interpr\u00e9tation du testament de Smith quant aux droits qui y sont donn\u00e9s \u00e0 son \u00e9pouse, les intim\u00e9s ont soumis que le pouvoir donn\u00e9 \u00e0 Madame Smith ne pouvait \u00eatre un pouvoir g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de disposition, mais un pouvoir limit\u00e9 parce que, disent-ils, (i) suivant la clause 13, son droit de disposer \u00e9tait restreint \u00e0 des ali\u00e9nations \u00e0 titre on\u00e9reux pour fins d'aliments, (ii) suivant la clause 15, elle n'avait pas un pouvoir exclusif de disposition puisque semblable pouvoir \u00e9tait donn\u00e9 aux ex\u00e9cuteurs testamentaires de son \u00e9poux et (iii) dans la mesure o\u00f9 elle pouvait ali\u00e9ner, son droit de ce faire \u00e9tait attribuable au droit de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 qu'elle avait sur ce r\u00e9sidu et non \u00e0 un pouvoir g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de disposition au sens de la Loi f\u00e9d\u00e9rale sur les droits successoraux .\nLa clause 13 du testament. La partie pertinente de cette clause se lit comme suit:\nTHIRTEENTH\nALL property hereby bequeathed being intended for the alimentary support and maintenance of the beneficiaries under this Will, is hereby given upon the condition that the same and the revenues derived therefrom shall be at all times exempt from seizure, and shall be insaisissable without the written consent of my Executors provided that after such beneficiaries have received their shares in my Estate nothing herein contained shall prevent any beneficiary hereunder from voluntarily alienating or hypothecating any of the property to which he or she is entitled under this Will;\nAssumant que cette disposition s'applique au r\u00e9sidu attribu\u00e9 \u00e0 Madame Smith et que ce r\u00e9sidu lui ait \u00e9t\u00e9 l\u00e9gu\u00e9 \u00e0 titre d'aliments et soit, pour cette raison, insaisissable, ce fait ne limite aucunement le pouvoir g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de disposition qui lui est conf\u00e9r\u00e9 par la clause 9, avec le droit de l'exercer librement et en pl\u00e9nitude, comme si la clause 10 n'\u00e9tait pas contenue au testament. L'insaisissabilit\u00e9 et l'incessibilit\u00e9 sont deux choses diff\u00e9rentes, la premi\u00e8re ne comportant pas la seconde. Une disposition testamentaire d\u00e9clarant que des biens l\u00e9gu\u00e9s le sont \u00e0 titre d'aliments et sont, pour cette raison, insaisissables, a toujours \u00e9t\u00e9 interpr\u00e9t\u00e9e par les tribunaux, non pas comme limitant le droit du b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire de disposer, \u00e0 son gr\u00e9, de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 l\u00e9gu\u00e9e, mais comme ayant pour seul but d'emp\u00eacher des tiers de prendre possession des biens par voie de saisie, sans le consentement du b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire. Nolin v. Flibotte3; Delisle v. Valli\u00e8res4; Caisse Populaire de L\u00e9vis v. Maranda5. Il en pourrait \u00eatre autrement si le pouvoir g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de disposition du r\u00e9sidu, donn\u00e9 \u00e0 la clause 9, \u00e9tait limit\u00e9, par la clause 13, \u00e0 ce qui est n\u00e9cessaire pour aliments et soutien, en vue et afin d'assurer que, pour le surplus si aucun, la clause 10 op\u00e8re au b\u00e9n\u00e9fice des personnes y mentionn\u00e9es. Mais telle n'est pas la fin de la clause 13, et une telle ou toutes autres semblables limitations du pouvoir de disposition sont express\u00e9ment \u00e9cart\u00e9es par la clause 9.\nLa clause 15 du testament. La partie pertinente de cette clause se lit comme suit:\nI empower my Executors to sell, alienate and dispose of the whole or any part or parts of my Estate and property, whether moveable or immoveable, for such prices, and subject to such terms and conditions as they alone may deem proper; to receive the consideration price of any and all such sales and to give valid discharges therefor. I further empower my Executors to invest and re-invest the proceeds of such sales and the cash assets of my Estate, as they may arise from time to time in such investments as they may choose without being limited as to the. character of the investment which they may make nor as to the proportion of the investment to the security, notwithstanding Article 981\u00b0 of the Civil Code of Lower Canada.\nL'auteur d'un testament est pr\u00e9sum\u00e9 \u00eatre cons\u00e9quent avec lui-m\u00eame et il s'ensuit que si, dans une clause, il a clairement exprim\u00e9 sa volont\u00e9, comme l'a fait le testateur en l'esp\u00e8ce \u00e0 la clause 9 en ce qui concerne les biens attribu\u00e9s \u00e0 son \u00e9pouse, on doit pr\u00e9sumer qu'il n'a pas modifi\u00e9 cette volont\u00e9 dans une clause subs\u00e9quente \u00e0 moins qu'il ne s'en soit clairement exprim\u00e9. Ni en la clause 15 ou autre partie du testament trouve-t-on l'expression d'une pareille intention. Le testament pr\u00e9voit d'ailleurs d'autres situations o\u00f9 les dispositions de la clause 15 peuvent recevoir une application. Ces pouvoirs d'ali\u00e9nation que le testateur a, par cette disposition de la clause 15, donn\u00e9s, pour fins administratives, \u00e0 ses trois ex\u00e9cuteurs testamentaires, soit, son \u00e9pouse, Edmund Howard Smith et la Montreal Trust Company, n'affectent aucunement le droit de Madame Smith de disposer, de son vivant, librement et en pl\u00e9nitude, de ses biens, tel qu'express\u00e9ment pr\u00e9vu \u00e0 la clause 9.\nL'article 3(4) de la Loi. Comme dernier moyen (iii), quant \u00e0 l'interpr\u00e9tation, les intim\u00e9s se sont content\u00e9s d'affirmer que le pouvoir d'ali\u00e9nation de Madame Smith d\u00e9coule de son droit de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 et n'\u00e9quivaut pas \u00e0 un pouvoir g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de disposition au sens de l'art. 3(4) de la Loi f\u00e9d\u00e9rale sur les droits successoraux . Ce pouvoir g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de disposition est accord\u00e9 \u00e0 Madame Smith aux termes m\u00eames du testament de son \u00e9poux o\u00f9 il est pr\u00e9vu qu'\u00e0 d\u00e9faut de l'exercer de son vivant, les personnes mentionn\u00e9es en la clause 10 recueilleront ce qui pourra en rester \u00e0 son d\u00e9c\u00e8s. C'est l\u00e0 une des situations pr\u00e9vues au para. 3(4) de la Loi.\nMais, pr\u00e9tendent les intim\u00e9s, m\u00eame si le testament doit recevoir l'interpr\u00e9tation qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de, les dispositions des arts. 3(1) et 3(4) ne peuvent s'appliquer en l'esp\u00e8ce. Ind\u00e9pendamment de l'effet que peut avoir le DEED OF DECLARATION AND ACCEPTANCE sur la question, disent-ils, en vertu du Code Civil, les clauses 9 et 10 cr\u00e9ent une substitution, les intim\u00e9s re\u00e7oivent alors les biens, non du de cujus\u2014en l'esp\u00e8ce, Madame Smith\u2014mais directement du testateur et ces biens sont, en cons\u00e9quence, exclus de la succession de Madame Smith.\nDu fait que, sous le Code Civil, les pr\u00e9misses et la conclusion de ce raisonnement puissent se justifier, il ne s'ensuit aucunement que les dispositions de ces deux articles de la Loi f\u00e9d\u00e9rale n'aient pas d'application en l'esp\u00e8ce. La question \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer est de savoir si, au sens de cette Loi f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, et non au sens du Code Civil, il y a eu, au d\u00e9c\u00e8s de Madame Smith, une succession venant d'elle en ce qui concerne les biens qui lui furent l\u00e9gu\u00e9s par son \u00e9poux, avec la limitation quant au droit d'en disposer par testament.\nA mon avis, il est parfaitement indiff\u00e9rent et c'est nullement une condition d'application de ces arts. 3(1) et 3(4) que, sous le r\u00e9gime de la Common Law ou du Code Civil, le b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire recueille directement du de cujus. Il suffit qu'il recueille comme cons\u00e9quence du d\u00e9faut de ce dernier d'avoir exerc\u00e9 le pouvoir g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de d\u00e9signation ou le pouvoir g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de disposition qu'il avait, suivant le cas. C'est le fait, dit l'article, pour une personne de recueillir, au d\u00e9c\u00e8s d'une personne ayant pareils pouvoirs, comme cons\u00e9quence du d\u00e9faut de cette derni\u00e8re de les exercer, qui constitue une \"succession\" et constitue le b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire et le de cujus respectivement \"successeur\" et \"pr\u00e9d\u00e9cesseur\" \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de ces biens. Ce texte est clair, ne souffre d'aucune ambigu\u00eft\u00e9 et nous devons lui donner son effet. D'ailleurs, et si le fait que le b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire recueille de l'auteur de l'acte de lib\u00e9ralit\u00e9 et non du de cujus \u00e9tait suffisant pour emp\u00eacher l'application des dispositions pertinentes du para. 3(4) , il en r\u00e9sulterait que ces dispositions seraient lettre morte et n'auraient jamais d'application dans le cas o\u00f9 le pouvoir donn\u00e9 serait un pouvoir de d\u00e9signation.\nEn effet, sous la Common Law, le pouvoir g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de d\u00e9signation est celui qui est donn\u00e9 \u00e0 une personne, dans un acte de lib\u00e9ralit\u00e9, de d\u00e9signer comme b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire, toute personne, incluant m\u00eame la personne \u00e0 qui ce pouvoir est donn\u00e9; le pouvoir sp\u00e9cial de d\u00e9signation \u00e9tant celui qui peut \u00eatre exerc\u00e9 en fonction seulement de certains objets sp\u00e9cifi\u00e9s. Celui qui recueille, comme cons\u00e9quence de l'exercice ou du non exercice de ce pouvoir de d\u00e9signation, ne re\u00e7oit pas de celui \u00e0 qui le pouvoir a \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9 mais de celui qui l'a cr\u00e9\u00e9, \u00e0 moins que, en ce qui concerne le cas de non exercice, il ne r\u00e9sulte de l'acte de lib\u00e9ralit\u00e9 cr\u00e9ant le pouvoir, une indication au contraire. Les constatations qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8dent paraissent d\u00e9cisives sur le point. On peut ajouter, cependant, que le m\u00eame raisonnement et la m\u00eame conclusion valent aussi, je crois, sous le Droit Civil o\u00f9 la facult\u00e9 g\u00e9n\u00e9rale d'\u00e9lire, c'est-\u00e0-dire de choisir, sans objets sp\u00e9cifi\u00e9s, un ou plusieurs b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaires, correspond g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement au pouvoir de d\u00e9signation de la Common Law. Et sous les m\u00eames r\u00e9serves en ce qui concerne le cas du non exercice du pouvoir, celui qui recueille re\u00e7oit \u00e9galement du substituant et non du grev\u00e9. Sur le point, les auteurs suivants, cit\u00e9s avec approbation au jugement de cette Cour dans Lussier v. Tremblay6, s'expriment ainsi:\nTh\u00e9venot d'Essaule, Trait\u00e9 des Substitutions, N\u00b0 1013, p. 319:\nLe grev\u00e9, en \u00e9lisant, n'est point cens\u00e9 exercer une lib\u00e9ralit\u00e9 envers celui qu'il choisit. Il ne peut par cons\u00e9quent le soumettre \u00e0 aucune charge de substitution, ni autre quelconque.\nRicard, Des Donations, vol. 2, p. 448:\nC'est pourquoi le grev\u00e9 qui a fait ce choix, ne peut pas, pour raison de ce seul choix, imposer aucune charge \u00e0 la personne qu'il a choisie: car, en la choisissant, il n'a proprement exerc\u00e9 aucune lib\u00e9ralit\u00e9 envers elle, il ne lui a donn\u00e9 rien du sien.\nMignault, vol. 5, p. 145:\nLe choix fait par le grev\u00e9 ne constitue pas une disposition en faveur de la personne choisie; c'est un pur choix et la personne choisie tiendra les biens du substituant et non pas du grev\u00e9. Ce dernier ne peut donc \u00e0 raison de ce seul choix, imposer aucune charge \u00e0 la personne qu'il a choisie, car il n'exerce envers elle aucune lib\u00e9ralit\u00e9.\nIl est donc immat\u00e9riel que les biens recueillis au d\u00e9c\u00e8s d'une personne nantie d'un pouvoir g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de d\u00e9signation soient exclus des biens de la succession de cette derni\u00e8re et rien dans le texte des arts. 3(1) et 3(4) de la Loi f\u00e9d\u00e9rale n'autorise l'adoption d'une vue diff\u00e9rente dans le cas o\u00f9 le pouvoir donn\u00e9 est un pouvoir g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de disposition. Au contraire, dit l'article, dans les deux cas, c'est le fait pour une personne de recueillir, au d\u00e9c\u00e8s d'une personne ayant pareils pouvoirs, comme cons\u00e9quence du d\u00e9faut de cette derni\u00e8re de les exercer, qui constitue une \"succession\" et constitue le b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire et le de cujus, respectivement, \"successeur\" et \"pr\u00e9d\u00e9cesseur\" \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de ces biens. Aussi bien et en tout respect pour les tenants de l'opinion contraire, je suis d'avis que si on \u00e9carte de la consid\u00e9ration l'existence du DEED OF DECLARATION AND ACCEPTANCE,\u2014comme l'ont fait les intim\u00e9s pour les fins de cet argument,\u2014il ne fait aucun doute qu'au sens de ces articles de la Loi f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, il y a eu, au d\u00e9c\u00e8s de Madame Smith, une succession venant d'elle en ce qui concerne les biens qui lui furent l\u00e9gu\u00e9s par son \u00e9poux.\nDEED OF DECLARATION AND ACCEPTANCE. La conclusion qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de, poursuivent les intim\u00e9s, ne vaut plus si l'on donne effet au DEED OF DECLARATION AND ACCEPTANCE. En vertu de cet acte, ex\u00e9cut\u00e9 le 24 ao\u00fbt 1951, Madame Smith, disent-ils, a fait, tel que le permet l'art. 960 C.C., une remise anticip\u00e9e des biens substitu\u00e9s; une telle remise \u00e9quivaut \u00e0 une renonciation \u00e0 tout pouvoir g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de disposition qu'elle pouvait avoir en vertu du testament, et il en r\u00e9sulte que les intim\u00e9s ont recueilli ces biens, non pas au d\u00e9c\u00e8s de Madame Smith mais le 24 ao\u00fbt 1951, et d\u00e8s lors le para. 3(4) n'a pas d'application.\nCet argument pr\u00e9suppose que la disposition de biens contenue \u00e0 l'acte constitue une remise anticip\u00e9e, au sens de l'art. 960 C.C. Avant d'examiner le m\u00e9rite de cette pr\u00e9misse, dont le bien-fond\u00e9 est contest\u00e9 par l'appelant, quelques commentaires s'imposent sur le contenu de cet acte.\nCet acte du 24 ao\u00fbt 1951 contient, en effet, des d\u00e9clarations qui sont notoirement injustifi\u00e9es en droit et qui, pour cette raison, sont pour le moins extraordinaires sinon r\u00e9v\u00e9latrices d'un doute entretenu, par les parties \u00e0 l'acte, sur l'application de l'art. 960 C.C. ou du proc\u00e9d\u00e9 par elles adopt\u00e9 pour donner, \u00e0 la face de l'acte, une apparence de justification \u00e0 le fonder sur cet article. Ainsi, par exemple, on affirme, et argumente m\u00eame, aux paras. (iii) et (iv) respectivement, que le pouvoir de disposition donn\u00e9 \u00e0 Madame Smith est limit\u00e9 \u00e0 ce qui est n\u00e9cessaire aux aliments; ce qui, pour les raisons ci-dessus donn\u00e9es, est mal fond\u00e9. On ne con\u00e7oit gu\u00e8re, d'ailleurs, l'int\u00e9r\u00eat que pouvait avoir Madame Smith d'affirmer une limitation de ses droits dans un acte par lequel elle pr\u00e9tend en faire l'abandon. L'affirmation, au para. (v), que le droit de disposer du r\u00e9sidu n'a jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 accept\u00e9 par Madame Smith, est insoutenable; ayant, \u00e0 ce temps, retir\u00e9 pendant plus de treize ans tous les revenus, elle a fait indubitablement un acte d'acceptation, non seulement des revenus, mais de tous les droits qui lui sont conf\u00e9r\u00e9s au testament. Au para. (vi), on affirme qu'elle a le droit de faire une remise par anticipation; ce droit est ici pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment en question.\nEn soi, un proc\u00e9d\u00e9 adopt\u00e9 pour \u00e9viter le paiement des droits n'est pas condamnable du seul fait qu'il puisse \u00eatre ult\u00e9rieurement consid\u00e9r\u00e9 inefficace \u00e0 r\u00e9aliser cette intention. Mais, en l'esp\u00e8ce, l'interpr\u00e9tation que les parties \u00e0 l'acte ont cru devoir donner au testament de Smith et aux droits r\u00e9sultant du testament ainsi interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 n'affecte en rien l'interpr\u00e9tation que ce testament doit recevoir exclusivement suivant la teneur de ses dispositions, et n'affecte aucunement les droits de l'appelant.\nPour d\u00e9cider si la remise des biens faite d'apr\u00e8s le DEED OF DECLARATION AND ACCEPTANCE constitue une remise au sens de la remise anticip\u00e9e \u00e0 laquelle pourvoit l'art. 960 C.C. ou, en d'autres termes, si les dispositions de cet article ont, entre autres objets, une disposition testamentaire de la nature de celle r\u00e9sultant des clauses 9 et 10, il convient d'appr\u00e9cier la nature et le caract\u00e8re de cette disposition testamentaire.\nLe fid\u00e9icommis de residuo vient du droit romain et est reconnu sous notre droit par l'art. 952 C.C, lequel se lit comme suit:\n952. Le substituant peut ind\u00e9finiment permettre l'ali\u00e9nation des biens substitu\u00e9s; la substitution n'a d'effet en ce cas que si l'ali\u00e9nation n'a pas eu lieu.\n952. The grantor may indefinitely allow the alienation of the property of the substitution which takes place in such case only when the alienation is not made.\nIl ne faut voir en cet article, dit Mignault, vol. 5, p. 93, qu'une formule g\u00e9n\u00e9rale qui peut se rapporter \u00e0 tous les cas o\u00f9 le grev\u00e9 a le pouvoir d'ali\u00e9ner, sans en restreindre ou en \u00e9tendre les effets particuliers, lesquels, en derni\u00e8re analyse, d\u00e9pendront des termes dont le substituant s'est servi. Le fid\u00e9icommis de eo quod supererit autoris\u00e9 par cet article et qu'on dit r\u00e9sulter des clauses 9 et 10 du testament, se distingue particuli\u00e8rement de la substitution fid\u00e9icommissaire ordinaire en ce que celle-ci impose au grev\u00e9 l'obligation de conserver et de rendre, au terme fix\u00e9 par le testateur pour l'ouverture de la substitution, alors que le fid\u00e9icommis de eo quod supererit n'impose aucune obligation de conserver mais une obligation de rendre limit\u00e9e aux biens non dispos\u00e9s par le grev\u00e9, au jour fix\u00e9 pour l'ouverture de la substitution. Dans le cas qui nous occupe, ce fid\u00e9icommis a pour unique objet les biens que Madame Smith pourrait ne pas avoir ali\u00e9n\u00e9s de son vivant, nonobstant son pouvoir de ce faire, tout comme si la clause 10, \u00e9tablissant ce fid\u00e9icommis, \u00e9tait inexistante. Ce fid\u00e9icommis, comme l'obligation de rendre en r\u00e9sultant, est conditionnel. Il est laiss\u00e9 exclusivement et enti\u00e8rement \u00e0 la volont\u00e9 de Madame Smith d'emp\u00eacher la r\u00e9alisation de la condition et de mettre \u00e0 n\u00e9ant cette substitution par simple ali\u00e9nation. Du jour de l'acceptation de la succession de son \u00e9poux \u00e0 celui de son d\u00e9c\u00e8s, elle n'a aucune obligation vis-\u00e0-vis des personnes mentionn\u00e9es \u00e0 la clause 10, et celles-ci n'ont, vis-\u00e0-vis d'elle, aucun droit \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de ces biens. Elle peut en faire l'ali\u00e9nation, comme toute propri\u00e9taire, que ce soit \u00e0 titre on\u00e9reux ou \u00e0 titre gratuit. Elle peut ali\u00e9ner ces biens \u00e0 toute personne, y compris celles mentionn\u00e9es \u00e0 la clause 10 sans \u00eatre, en ce dernier cas aucunement g\u00ean\u00e9e par les r\u00e8gles et cons\u00e9quences qui r\u00e9gissent et frappent respectivement la remise anticip\u00e9e pr\u00e9vue par l'art. 960 C.C. Les acqu\u00e9reurs, auxquels elle peut, de son vivant, faire la remise de ces biens, qu'ils soient ou non les personnes mentionn\u00e9es \u00e0 la clause 10, ne sont pas sujets \u00e0 \u00e9viction, comme peuvent l'\u00eatre les tiers acqu\u00e9reurs par les appel\u00e9s existant au jour de l'ouverture d'une substitution fid\u00e9icommissaire ordinaire. A mon avis, ce n'est nullement l\u00e0 une situation qu'envisage l'art. 960 C.C, ainsi qu'il appert du texte de cet article, des commentaires des codificateurs et de ceux faits par Mignault:\n960. Le grev\u00e9 peut faire la remise des biens par anticipation, \u00e0 moins que le d\u00e9lai n'ait \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tabli pour l'avantage de l'appel\u00e9; sans pr\u00e9judice aux cr\u00e9anciers du grev\u00e9. \u00e0 op\u00e9rer le transfert ou la d\u00e9livrance des biens. Mais la r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 cette question n'affecte pas celle de savoir si, au sens de la Loi f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, il y a eu succession. Car s'il y a eu transfert ou d\u00e9livrance, ce transfert ou cette d\u00e9livrance \u00e9quivaut \u00e0 une donation, au moins dans le sens \u00e9tendu que l'art. 3(1) (c) donne \u00e0 cette expression. Et, comme ce transfert ou cette d\u00e9livrance a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait apr\u00e8s le 29 avril 1941 et dans les trois ann\u00e9es ant\u00e9rieures au d\u00e9c\u00e8s de Madame Smith, il y a succession aux termes de ce dernier article. Si, au contraire, il n'y a pas eu de transfert ou de d\u00e9livrance r\u00e9sultant du DEED OF DECLARATION AND ACCEPTANCE, il s'ensuit que Madame Smith n'ayant pas autrement dispos\u00e9 de ces biens, de son vivant, les intim\u00e9s les ont recueillis \u00e0 son d\u00e9c\u00e8s et non le 24 ao\u00fbt 1951 ; et, dans cette alternative, c'est l'art. 3(4) qui re\u00e7oit son application et il y a succession.\nEn r\u00e9sum\u00e9, que l'art. 960 C.C. s'applique ou non, que le DEED OF DECLARATION AND ACCEPTANCE soit efficace ou non au transfert ou \u00e0 la d\u00e9livrance des biens, il y a eu succession, soit sous l'art. 3(4) ou soit sous l'art. 3(1) (c).\nDans ces vues, il n'est pas n\u00e9cessaire de poursuivre ult\u00e9rieurement les autres arguments soumis par l'appelant au soutien de la proposition qu'il y a eu succession.\nJe maintiendrais l'appel et r\u00e9tablirais la cotisation impos\u00e9e par l'appelant, le tout avec d\u00e9pens.\nAbbott J.:\u2014I have had the advantage of considering the reasons of my brother Taschereau with which I am in agreement, and I desire to add only a few brief comments.\nI share the view which my brother Taschereau has expressed that the will of the late Edgar Maurice Smith created a substitution de residuo and indeed this was the basis upon which the appeal was argued before us. The unlimited power to alienate the substituted property during her lifetime, which was given to the widow as institute, was solely for her benefit and could therefore be renounced by her at any time. In fact, such renunciation was made by the deed of August 24, 1951, and the substitution thereupon became unconditional. Under the terms of the same document and in virtue of the provisions of art. 960 C.C., the institute also delivered over the substituted property in anticipation of the appointed term.\nThe institute, some three years prior to her death, having effectively renounced any right to dispose of the substituted property, s. 3(4) of the Dominion Succession Duty Act could have no application. It follows, therefore, that in my view, the sole question at issue in this appeal is whether the act of the institute in renouncing her right to alienate and her \"delivery\" of the substituted property pursuant to art. 960 C.C. comes within s. 3(1) (c) of the said Act. That section reads as follows:\n3. (1) A \"succession\" shall be deemed to include the following dispositions of property and the beneficiary and the deceased shall be deemed to be the \"successor\" and \"predecessor\" respectively in relation to such property:\n* * *\n(c) property taken under a disposition operating or purporting to operate as an immediate gift inter vivos, \"whether by way of transfer, delivery, declaration of trust, or otherwise, made on or after the twenty-ninth day of April, one thousand nine hundred and forty-one, and within three years prior to the death of the deceased.\nThis section which purports to bring into a succession, for duty purposes, property taken under a disposition of property made within three years of the death of the person making such disposition, must of course be strictly interpreted. In order to meet its requirements three conditions must be fulfilled:\n(1) There must have been a \"disposition\" of property within three years prior to the death of the deceased.\n(2) Such property must have been taken under such disposition.\n(3) Such disposition must operate or purport to operate as an immediate gift inter vivos. Even if it be assumed\u2014which I think is not free from doubt\u2014that Mrs. Smith's action in (i) renouncing her right to alienate and (ii) delivering the substituted property in anticipation of the appointed term, was a \"disposition\" of property within the meaning of the section, in my view the other two conditions were not fulfilled. The physical custody of the substituted property had remained at all times with the executors as provided under the will. The substitutes did not take under any disposition made by Mrs. Smith, they took under the will of her late husband. Moreover, in my opinion, the action taken by Mrs. Smith did not operate or purport to operate as an immediate gift inter vivos. She exercised no choice in the selection of the persons benefitted, and, in law, they received no benefit from her or from her estate. It follows from what I have said that, in my opinion, s. 3(1) (c) could have no application.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs, Fauteux and Judson JJ. dissenting.\nSolicitor for the appellant: A.

(Excise Tax Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 100, ss. 24, 46(1)(5)(6)).\nThe respondent company paid the Department of National Revenue $24,605.26 prior to June 30, 1953, as excise taxes on processed sheepskins known as \"mouton\". In the following September, the Department having threatened legal proceedings five months earlier, the respondent agreed to make a further payment of $30,000 as a final settlement of it tax arrears. In October, 1957, by petition of right, it sought to recover these amounts as having been paid in error, and referred to the 1956 decision of this Court in Universal Fur Dressers and Dyers Ltd. v. The Queen, [1956] S.C.R. 632, that \"mouton\" was not a fur and therefore not subject to excise tax. The claim as to the first amount was dismissed on the ground that it was made voluntarily, and no application for refund had been made within the time specified' in the Excise Tax Act. As to the second amount, the trial judge found that the respondent was entitled to recover because, on the evidence adduced, it was paid under duress or compulsion. The Crown appealed the latter ruling to this Court.\nHeld (Taschereau J. dissenting): The appeal should be allowed.\nPer Kerwin C.J., Fauteux and Ritchie JJ.: The payment in question was made long after the alleged, but unsubstantiated, duress or compulsion. It was paid under a mistake of law, and no application for a refund was made in writing within the two year time limit as prescribed by s. 105(6) of the Excise Tax Act.\nIn notifying the insurance companies and the respondent's bank not to pay over any moneys due to it, the Department was merely proceeding according to the authority given it by the Act.\nPer Locke and Ritchie JJ.: The respondent carried out a calculated and deliberate plan to defraud the Crown of moneys which it believed were justly payable. A compromise was agreed upon fixing the amount to be paid at $30,000. In the absence of any evidence on the matter, it could not be inferred that the threat made by an officer of the Department either induced or contributed to inducing or influenced the payment of the $30,000. The moneys clearly were paid under a mistake of law and were not recoverable. Brisbane v. Dacres, 5 Taunt. 143, referred to. Per Ritchie J.: Whatever may have been the nature of the threats exerted by the Department the payment of the $30,000 was not made \"under immediate necessity and with the intention of preserving the right to dispute the legality of the demand\" and it could not be recovered as money paid involuntarily or under duress.\nPer Taschereau, J., dissenting: The respondent did not make the $30,000 payment voluntarily. Threats of imprisonment and actual seizures of bank account and insurance moneys were made to bring about the settlement. This kind of pressure amounted to duress, Mashell v. Horner, [1915] 3 K.B. 106, Knutson v. The Bourkes Syndicate, [1941] S.C.R. 419. S. 105 of the Excise Tax Act did not apply, as that section finds its application only when the payment has been made as a result of mistake of law or fact. Such was not the case here.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of Cameron J., of the Exchequer Court of Canada1, granting in part a petition of right. Appeal allowed.\nD. S. Maxwell and D. H. Aylen, for the appellant.\nH. J. Plaxton, Q.C., and R. H. McKercher, for the suppliant, respondent.\nThe judgment of the Chief Justice and of Fauteux J. was delivered by\nThe Chief Justice:\u2014The substantial point in issue in this appeal is whether a payment by the respondent of a sum of $30,000 was made under duress or under compulsion. I have arrived at the conclusion that it was not so made.\nThe circumstances are detailed elsewhere and I do not propose to repeat them. For my purpose it is sufficient to emphasize that such payment was made long after the alleged duress or compulsion. The basis for the allegation is the evidence of Berg, the respondent's president, that in April 1953, in a conversation with the Assistant Deputy Minister of Excise the latter \"took the attitude that he was definitely out to make an example of me in this case. He said: 'The situation has been prevalent in the industry for many years,' He said he is taking this case and making an example if he has to prosecute to the fullest extent.\" It is true that the Assistant Deputy Minister of Excise was not called to deny the alleged statement and, while the trial judge found Berg unworthy of credence in several respects when his testimony was contradicted by that of others, he found that in this particular case Berg was telling the truth. I proceed on the assumption that Berg did tell the truth as to what he was told in April 1953, but even so I find it impossible to believe that that conversation had any effect on the settlement arrived at in September 1953. Furthermore when the petition of right in this matter to recover a large sum of money, including the $30,000 in question, was filed on October 31, 1957, no such claim as that now before us was raised. That was done only on September 25, 1958, at the commencement of the trial.\nAccording to the judgment of this Court in Universal Fur Dressers and Dyers, Limited v. Her Majesty the Queen2 it was held that there was no excise tax payable upon mouton. It was long before this that the $30,000 had been paid. That sum was paid under a mistake of law and, furthermore, under subs. (6) of s. 105 of The Excise Tax Act, no application for a refund was made in writing within two years after the money was so paid. Subs. (6) reads as follows:\n6. If any person, whether by mistake of law or fact, has paid or overpaid to Her Majesty, any monies which had been taken to account, as taxes imposed by this Act, such monies shall not be refunded unless application has been made in writing within two years after such monies were paid or overpaid.\nThese conclusions dispose of all matters in controversy, except for the defence raised by the amendment at the trial, which, in my view, cannot be substantial.\nThe other claims raised by the respondent were disposed of by the trial judge quite properly against it. Before us it was stressed that there was duress because the Department notified the insurance companies and the respondent's bank not to pay over any monies due to it. No such claim was ever alleged but, in any event, what the Department did was merely to proceed according to the authority given it by the Act.\nEach case must be decided on its particular facts and there is nothing inconsistent in this conclusion and that arrived at in Maskell v. Horner3 and Knutson v. The Bourkes Syndicate et al4. The appeal should be allowed with costs and the petition of right dismissed with costs.\nTaschereau J. (dissenting):\u2014The suppliant-respondent is a company incorporated under the laws of the Province of Ontario, having its head office at Uxbridge. The nature of its business was the processing of shearlings and lambskins. Shearlings are sheepskins that have been shorn. The wool is clipped off and used for lining in garments, galoshes, etc. When the wool is left on the skin, after being processed, it is transformed in what in the trade is called \"mouton\".\nShearlings were not at the relevant time excise taxable, but it was thought that \"mouton\" was attracting such a tax, under s. 80(A) of the Excise Tax Act as amended, which reads in part as follows:\u2014\n\"80(A). (1) There shall be imposed, levied and collected, an excise tax equal to fifteen per cent of the current market value of all dressed furs, dyed furs and dressed and dyed furs,\u2014\n(i) imported into Canada, payable by the importer or transferee of such goods before they are removed from the custody of the proper customs officer; or\n(ii) dressed, dyed, or dressed and dyed in Canada, payable by the dresser or dyer at the time of delivery by him.\n(2) Every person liable for taxes under this section shall, in addition to the returns required by subsection one of section one hundred and six of this Act, file each day a true return of the total taxable value and the amount of tax due by him on his deliveries of dressed furs, dyed furs, and dressed and dyed furs for the last preceding business day, under such regulations as may be prescribed by the Minister.\n(3) The said return shall be filed and the tax paid not later than the first business day following that on which the deliveries were made.\"\nFrom June 1951, to the end of June 1953, the respondent paid to the Department of National Revenue, Customs and Excise Division, a sum of $24,605.26. It is clear that the respondent company made false returns to the Department, and billed \"mouton\" products which were thought taxable, as \"shearlings\" products which were not subject to taxation. Mr. Berg, who was the president of the respondent company, is quite frank on this point and does not try to escape his responsibility. In his evidence, he says:\u2014\n\"Q. Now, Mr. Berg, I understand that during 1951 and 1952, it frequently developed that excise tax returns supplied to the department by Beaver Lamb and Shearling were not correct and falsified. Is that a correct statement?\nA. Yes.\nQ. That being so do you assume any responsibility for that result?\nA. Yes. Q. I see. Now, would you be good enough to tell me just what you did in that connection?\nA. We sent out mouton products and billed them as shearlings.\nBY HIS LORDSHIP:\nQ. Would you repeat that?\nA. We sent out mouton products and billed them as shearlings.\nQ. To your knowledge?\nA. Yes, sir.\nBY MR. MAXWELL:\nQ. Why did you do this?\nA. It was quite prevalent in the industry, and other firms were doing the same procedure and we had to stay in business.\"\nOn or about the first week of June, 1953, the respondent was informed by Mr. Phil Duggan, president of Donnell and Mudge, a company operating the same business as the respondent's, that they were claiming with others a refund for excise taxes paid to the Department of National Revenue on \"mouton\", as in their opinion, \"mouton\" not being a fur, but a processed product of a wool-bearing animal, was not subject to excise tax under 80(A) of the Act. The respondent was asked to join with them, and it was suggested that it should write a letter to the Department claiming such a refund.\nIn the meantime, the Department had, on the 13th of April 1953, before the Exchequer Court of Canada, sought to recover from the Universal Fur Dressers and Dyers Limited, $573.03 alleging that the defendant being a dresser and dyer of furs, was liable for the tax. It was held by this Court5, reversing the judgment of the Exchequer Court, that the merino sheep is a wool-bearing animal and not a fur-bearing one, that its skin although with the wool attached is not a fur, and is not, and could not be, transformed into a fur by the processes to which it was subjected. It is obvious that this applied not only to \"mouton\", but also to \"shearlings\".\nThe respondent discontinued making any further daily and monthly reports at the end of June, and in July its premises were destroyed by fire, and the company ceased to operate.\nDuring the course of a routine audit, carried out by one Thomas G. Belch, an auditor employed by the Department of National Revenue, in March 1953, very wide fluctuations in the respondent's inventory were discovered, and further investigations revealed a scheme of operations whereby the respondent's invoices were prepared so as to indicate sales of shearlings where, in fact, mouton had been sold. In April, 1953, the Department issued an assessment against the respondent in the amount of $61,722.20 including penalties, over and above the amount of $24,605.26 which it had already paid.\nFollowing receipt of the assessment, Berg, the president of the respondent company, went to Ottawa to see a high official of the Department. He returned a second time with a Montreal lawyer, but obtained no practical results. Finally, a Toronto lawyer succeeded in obtaining a final settlement on the 15th of September, 1953, upon payment of a sum of $30,000. It was also understood that the company would be prosecuted for having made false returns, would plead guilty, pay a penalty of $10,000 and a fine of $200. All this was complied with.\nIn October, 1957, the respondent, by petition of right, claimed from Her Majesty the sum of $54,605.26, being $24,605.26 paid up to June, 1953, and $30,000 paid in final settlement in September of the same year. Mr. Justice Cameron, in the Exchequer Court, dismissed the claim for $24,605.26, but granted the relief prayed for as to the $30,000.\nThe claim as to the first amount was dismissed on the ground that the payment was made voluntarily and that, in the alternative, in order to succeed, the respondent should have made, pursuant to s. 105 of the Act, an application to obtain such refund within a period of two years. The relevant parts of this section read as follows:\u2014\n\"105. 1. A deduction from, or refund of, any of the taxes imposed by this Act may be granted\n(a) where an overpayment has been made by the taxpayer;\n(b) where the tax was paid in error;\n6. If any person, whether by mistake of law or fact, has paid or overpaid to Her Majesty, any monies which had been taken to account, as taxes imposed by this Act, such monies shall not be refunded unless application has been made in writing within two years after such monies were paid or overpaid.\n5. No refund or deduction from any of the taxes imposed by this Act shall be paid unless application in writing for the same is made by the person entitled therto within two years of the time when any such refund or deduction first became payable under this Act, or under any regulation made thereunder.\" The trial judge found as a fact, after analysing all the evidence, that no \"application\" had been made within\" the period of two years, and that, therefore, the respondent was barred from recovering this sum of $24,605.26. But this issue is immaterial before this Court, as the respondent did not cross-appeal, and the matter is therefore finally settled.\nBut, the respondent alleges that it is entitled, as found by the trial judge, to a refund in the amount of $30,000 because, on the evidence adduced, it was made under duress or compulsion. There is no doubt that when an act is done under duress, under constraint, by injury, imprisonment or by threats, it is invalid. Coercion and compulsion negative the exercise of a free will, and vitiate a consent given under the fear that the threats will materialize. The parties then do not deal on equal terms.\nWhen the president of the respondent company received the additional assessment in April, 1953, in the sum of $61,722.20, he immediately went to Ottawa where he saw a high official of the Department, and he was flatly told that he would be, as well as his bookkeeper, criminally prosecuted and sent to jail. This is how Berg testifies:\n\"He said to me 'Berg, I am very sorry for you, but I intend to prosecute you as this has been going on too long in this industry and it is unfortunate you have to be the one'. He said 'Unless we get fully paid, if I have to we will put you in gaol'.\"\nAnd, as to his bookkeeper, Berg says in his evidence:\u2014\n\"Q. What did you infer from the remarks of these two auditors when they spoke of prosecuting Mrs. Forsyth?\nA. Because she signed falsified returns.\nQ. Did they indicate that it was a matter of civil proceedings or criminal?\nA. Criminal.\nBY HIS LORDSHIP:\nQ. What did they say?\nA. They said she could be prosecuted for signing falsified returns and was liable for imprisonment.\"\nFurther in his evidence, Berg, speaking of his first interview with the official of the Department, testifies as follows:\u2014\n\"Q. And what position did he take in regard to your representations in that connection? A. He took the attitude that he was definitely out to make an example of me in this case. He said: 'This situation has been prevalent in the industry for many years'. He said he is taking this case and making an example if he has to prosecute to the fullest extent.\"\nSome time later, the president of the respondent company, accompanied by his Montreal lawyer, went to see another official of the Department. This official spoke to a higher authority and reported that \"he was very sorry but he could not do anything for us. It was out of his hands; they definitely intended to take the fullest measures to make an example in this case.\"\nAt that time, which was approximately at the end of April, 1953, the respondent company owed nothing to the Department. \"Shearlings\" were not taxable, but it was thought erroneously that \"mouton\" was, as the decision of this Court in the Universal Fur Dressers case had not yet been rendered. But Berg had previously made the mistake of making false returns by billing as \"shearlings\" part of the merchandise which he had sold as \"mouton\".\nBerg then contacted the Toronto lawyer previously referred to, who endeavoured to settle with the Department, and while the negotiations were being carried out in Ottawa, another pressure was exercised upon Berg. After the fire which destroyed the respondent's premises at the end of July, 1953, the Department seized the bank account and the insurance monies, until the amount claimed was fully paid. It is true that, in certain cases under the Act, the appellant has the right to exercise such a recourse, but in the present case, it is obvious that this move coupled with the previous threats that had been made, substantially added to respondent's fears and embarrassment.\nFinally, a settlement was arrived at in September, 1953. The respondent paid $30,000, the company was prosecuted and not Berg personally, for making false returns, a penalty, as agreed upon, amounting to $10,000, and a fine of $200, were imposed and paid.\nAfter a thorough examination of all the evidence, I have come to the conclusion that this appeal must fail. I am firmly convinced that the respondent did not pay this amount of $30,000 voluntarily, as claimed by the appellant, and that the trial judge was right when he negatived that submission. Duress and pressure were exercised by threats of imprisonment and actual seizures of bank account and insurance monies were made to bring about the settlement to which Berg eventually consented. In his uncontradicted evidence, he says:\u2014\n\"BY MR. MAXWELL:\nQ. Yes; I think, my Lord, that is it. Now, I want to talk for a moment about the $30,000 that was paid apparently some time in September 1953. Why was that $30,000 paid?\nA. To relieve the pressure that the department brought to bear, that they intended to put me in gaol if I did not pay that amount of money.\nBY HIS LORDSHIP:\nQ. Would you repeat that.\nA. The department threatened to put me in gaol if there was not a complete settlement made at that time and rather than have them take further action we settled for that.\"\nIt flows from well regulated principles that this kind of pressure to which the president of the respondent company was subject, amounts to duress, that it was a direct interference with his personal freedom and that, therefore, the agreement which resulted was not an expression of his free will. He obviously feared imprisonment and the seizure of his bank account and insurance monies for an indefinite period of time.\nTo support my views, I refer to what has been said by Lord Reading in Maskell v. Horner6,\n\"Upon the second head of claim the plaintiff asserts that he paid the money not voluntarily but under the pressure of actual or threatened seizure of his goods, and that he is therefore entitled to recover it as money had and received. If the facts proved support this assertion the plaintiff would, in my opinion, be entitled to succeed in this action.\nIf a person with knowledge of the facts pays money, which he is not in law bound to pay, and in circumstances implying that he is paying it voluntarily to close the transaction, he cannot recover it. Such a payment is in law like a gift, and the transaction cannot be reopened. If a person pays money, which he is not bound to pay, under the compulsion of urgent and pressing necessity or of seizure, actual or threatened, of his goods he can recover it as money had and received. The money is paid not under duress in the strict sense of the term, as that implies duress of person, but under the pressure of seizure or detention of goods which is analogous to that of duress. Payment under such pressure establishes that the payment is not made voluntarily to close the transaction (per Lord Abinger C. B. and per Parke B. in Atlee v. Backhouse, 3 M & W. 633, 646, 650). The payment is made for the purpose of averting a treatened evil and is made not with the intention of giving up a right but under immediate necessity and with the intention of preserving the right to dispute the legality of the demand (per Tindal C.J. in Valpy v. Manley, 1 C.B. 594, 602, 603). There are numerous instances in the books of successful claims in this form of action to recover money paid to relieve goods from seizure,\"\nThe law, as so clearly stated by the Court of Appeal of England, applies in the instant case. See also Knuston v. The Bourkes Syndicate7 where Mr. Justice Kerwin (now Chief Justice of Canada) reviews the leading authorities.\nThe appellant also relies on s. 105 of the Excise Act which is to the effect that no relief may be granted by the Courts, if no application in writing has been made within two years. This provision of the law surely applies to the amounts that were paid previous to the 30th of June, 1953, as found by the learned trial judge, but surely not to the payment of $30,000 paid under duress or compulsion. This section finds its application only when the payment has been made as a result of a mistake of law or fact. This is not the case here.\nIn the result, I entirely agree with the findings of Mr. Justice Cameron, and particularly with the last two paragraphs of his reasons where he says8:\u2014\n\"In the instant case, I have no hesitation in finding on the uncontradicted evidence of Berg that the payment of $30,000 was made under duress or compulsion. It will be recalled that legal proceedings were threatened against the suppliant, that Berg was threatened with imprisonment, that the main assets of the company namely, its bank account and its right to receive payment from the fire insurance company\u2014were under seizure by the Department. There is no evidence to indicate that up to the time of the settlement, the officials of the Department had withdrawn their threats of criminal proceedings against Berg. The seizure of the bank account and of the insurance monies remained in effect until after the payment of $30,000 was made; and the Department insisted as a term of the settlement that the suppliant should be charged and would plead guilty to making fraudulent returns.\nAs has been stated above, the demand for payment of the taxes was illegal. For the reasons stated, I am of the opinion that the payment of $30,000 was not a voluntary payment but was made under duress or compulsion and that the suppliant is therefore entitled to recover that sum from the respondent.\"\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nLocke J.:\u2014The petition of right in this matter was filed on October 31, 1957 and by it the respondent sought to recover a sum of $24,605.27, said to have been paid by it as excise taxes on the delivery of mouton on and prior to June 1st, 1953, and a further sum of $30,000 \"as and on account of excise taxes relative to delivery of like products\" said to have been paid on February 11, 1954. The basis of the claim for the recovery of these amounts as pleaded was that they had been paid in error, without specifying the nature of the error, and it was said that a refund of the said amounts had been demanded on or about June 1, 1953. It was further alleged that, by a judgment of this Court delivered on June 11, 1956 in the case of Universal Fur Dressers and Dyers Ltd. v. Her Majesty The Queen,9 it had been decided that excise tax was not payable upon mouton.\nBy the defence filed on November 29, 1957 these various allegations, other than that relating to the judgment of this Court which was referred to, were put in issue and, alternatively, it was alleged that if any of the said sums were paid by mistake such payments were made under a mistake of law and were paid voluntarily.\nIt was not until the trial that the petition of right was amended to include an alternative claim that the sum of $30,000 was paid to the Department of National Revenue involuntarily and under duress, such duress consisting of the threat of criminal proceedings and the imposition of large penalties and fines against the suppliant and the president thereof. It was further claimed that the sum was paid under protest. This amendment was made on September 25, 1958.\nThe allegations made by this amendment were put in issue by amendments made to the statement of defence. The amended pleading alleged that the sum of $30,000 had been paid voluntarily by the respondent with a view of settling its excise tax liability with the Department and that effect had been given to the settlement by order-in-council.\nThe statute under which the excise tax referred to was imposed appears as c. 179, R.S.C. 1927, under the name of The Special War Revenue Act. In 1947, by c. 60, the name was changed to The Excise Tax Act. The Act, as originally passed, imposed, inter alia, a consumption or sales tax on a variety of goods produced or manufactured in Canada, and by s. 106 a person liable for tax under Part XIII of the Act was required to file each month a true return of his taxable sales for the last preceding month in accordance with regulations made by the Minister. The Act has been repeatedly amended. By c. 32 of the Statutes of 1942-43 s. 80A was added which imposed an excise tax equal to 25% of the current market value of furs dressed and dyed in Canada, payable by the dresser or dyer at the time of delivery by him, and required that every person liable for taxes under this section should, in addition to the monthly returns required by s-s.(1) of s. 106, file each day a true return of the total taxable value and the amount of the tax due by him on his deliveries of dressed and dyed furs for the last preceding day, such returns to be filed and the tax paid not later than the last business day following that on which the goods were delivered.\nBy c. 60 of the Statutes of 1947 the rate of the tax was reduced and s. 112 of the Act was repealed. The section which was substituted provided that every person required by, or pursuant to, any part of the Act (with an exception that is immaterial) to file a return, who failed to do so was guilty of an offence and liable to a penalty. Further, it was provided that when a return is filed as required \"every person who makes, or assents or acquiesces in the making of, false or deceptive statements in the return, is guilty of an offence\" and liable to a prescribed penalty. By the same enactment an amendment to s. 113(9) was made declaring, inter alia, that any person making, or assenting or acquiescing in the making of, false or deceptive entries in books as records of account required to be kept was guilty of an offence.\nDuring the period between June 1st, 1951 and June 30, 1953 the respondent paid to the Department of National Revenue a sum of $24,605.26 as excise tax payable upon mouton sold during that period. The learned trial judge held as a fact that this money was paid under a mistake of law and that no application for a refund had been made by the respondent within two years of the time when such refund might have become payable and that, accordingly, by virtue of s. 105(6) of the Act, the claim failed. As there is no cross-appeal, this aspect of the case need not be further considered. The claim for the refund of the sum of $30,000 is based entirely upon the facts alleged in the amendment to the ' petition, and to deal with the matter requires some extended reference to the evidence.\nOn February 5, 1953 Thomas G. Belch, an excise tax auditor employed by the Department of National Revenue, examined the records of the respondent company for the purpose of verifying the taxes which had been paid. In doing so he found that, according to the company's records, they had sold some 20,000 to 23,000 skins more than they had available for sale. A subsequent investigation showed that the respondent had over a long period been selling mouton which was considered to be subject to the excise tax but showing on its own records that the sales were of shearlings, which were in value only about one-half that of mouton and which were not subject to the tax.\nIn order to carry out this fraudulent scheme it was necessary for Herbert Berg, the president of the respondent company, to have the assistance of Mrs. Marie Forsyth, the bookkeeper and stenographer for the respondent, who typed the sales invoices. In addition, Berg had apparently the cooperation of numbers of firms who purchased mouton from the respondent. The procedure followed with such firms was to show the goods delivered as being shearlings on the invoice delivered and upon the duplicate retained and, as these skins were free of excise, such sales were excluded from the daily and monthly returns made to the Department. In the ease of certain customers who were not co-operating with the respondent in perpetrating the fraud, while the original sales invoice rendered to the customer showed purchases of mouton as being such, Mrs. Forsyth would place in the company's records what purported to be a second copy of the invoice showing the sale as being of shearlings and the taxable value of the mouton delivered was then omitted from the daily and monthly returns. This was an offence against s. 113 (9) of the Act.\nApparently, the original returns which were made for the period in question were filed in the Police Court when the criminal charge hereinafter mentioned was heard by the presiding magistrate and, in some unknown manner, these records disappeared and were not available at the time of the trial of the action. From the date of the discovery of these frauds, however, the Department of National Revenue insisted that the daily and monthly returns made by the respondent to the Department which showed the total taxable value of the goods delivered should be signed by Berg personally instead of by Mrs. Forsyth, as had been done during the period when the taxable values were falsely stated. These returns were made upon a form specified by the Department for making excise tax returns and showed in each case the total taxable value of the goods delivered and the amount of excise tax paid or payable in respect of such sales. At the foot of each form there appears a form of certificate whereby an official of the company is required to certify that the amount stated truly represents all the tax due on furs dressed and\/or dyed delivered on the date or during the month for which the return is made.\nBetween April 1, 1951 and January 31, 1953 the payment of excise taxes in an amount of $56,082.60 on mouton delivered was avoided in the above mentioned manner. On April 7, 1953 the Department of National Revenue demanded payment of the sum of $61,722.36 for excise tax on deliveries made on April 14 and 15, 1953, and a sum of $4,502.16 for penalties.\nBerg apparently before retaining a lawyer came to Ottawa and it was during a discussion he then had with Mr. V. C. Nauman, Assistant Deputy Minister of Excise, according to Berg, that Nauman told him that he intended to prosecute him and that \"unless we get fully paid if I have to we will put you in gaol\", and said that this situation had been prevalent in the industry for many years, presumably meaning the making of false returns to avoid the payment of excise tax, and that he intended to make an example \"if he has to prosecute to the fullest extent.\" This conversation appears to have taken place shortly after the receipt of the demand of April 17. On cross-examination, when asked why the $30,000 had been paid in September, he said it was to \"relieve the pressure that the department brought to bear, that they intended to put me in gaol if I did not pay that amount of money.\" Thereafter, Berg said that he retained a Montreal solicitor who endeavoured apparently to settle the matter, and later at some unspecified date retained Mr. David Croll, Q.C. to act for the respondent.\nThe only evidence given as to the negotiations which resulted in the claim for excise taxes being settled is a copy of a letter written by the Deputy Minister of Excise to Mr. Croll dated September 15, 1953, which acknowledged the receipt of three certified cheques totalling $30,000 and said that:\u2014\nat our last meeting it was agreed that Berg would plead guilty to a charge of evasion in the amount of the $5,000 in behalf of his company, Beaver Lamb & Shearling Co. Limited. The penalty which the Court will impose will be double the amount of the $5,000 plus a fine of from $100 to $1,000. The Department, however, will be satisfied with a fine of $200 or $300. You asked this morning that the action (sic) be taken against the company instead of Berg personally but you said that there would be no question about his pleading guilty to the charge.\nNeither Mr. Croll nor the Deputy Minister gave evidence. On October 23, 1953 an Information was laid by Belch on behalf of the Minister against the respondent company, charging that between the 1st day of August 1952 and the 6th day of October 1952 the respondent:\u2014\ndid make or assent or acquiesce in the making of false or deceptive statements in the monthly sales and excise tax returns of Beaver Lamb and Shearling Co. Ltd. required to be filed by the Excise Tax Act\u2026 contrary to section 112(2) of the said Act.\nthe false returns alleged to have been made being for the months of August and September 1952. To this charge Berg-pleaded guilty on behalf of the company in the Toronto Police Court on November 14, 1953 when a penalty in the sum of $10,000, being double the amount of the tax evasion charged, and a fine of $200 were imposed. Thereafter, by order-in-council made on January 31, 1954 under the provisions of s. 22 of the Financial Administration Act, c. 116 R.S.C. 1952, c. 116, the sums of $17,859.04 excise taxes and $7,587.34 interest and penalties were remitted.\nNauman was not called as a witness on behalf of the Crown and the evidence given by Berg as to the threats made to him in April is not contradicted by any oral evidence. The mere fact, however, that this statement was said by Berg to have been made is not, in my opinion, in the circumstances of this case decisive of the matter. It is to be borne in mind that Berg was throughout the period between April 1st 1951 and January 31, 1953, during which time this scheme was carried out, of the belief that excise tax was payable upon mouton delivered by the company and that it was a calculated and deliberate plan to defraud the Crown of moneys which he believed were justly payable, a fact which he admitted at the trial. It was upon his instructions that Mrs. Forsyth made false returns to the Department of National Revenue during this period and recorded sales of mouton as shearlings for the purpose of perpetrating the fraud. This fact was also acknowledged by Mrs. Forsyth to Inspector Simmons of the Ontario Fire Marshal's Office, during the course of his enquiry into the fire which destroyed the respondent company's premises at Uxbridge on January 19, 1953 and, while Mrs. Forsyth denied that she had made these statements to the Inspector and that she had admitted to Belch that she knew the returns that were made were false, the learned trial judge did not believe her and said that he accepted the evidence of Simmons and Belch wherever it conflicted with that of Mrs. Forsyth and Berg. The latter had sworn to the fact that in June 1953 he had written a letter to the Department of National Revenue demanding a refund of the taxes paid on mouton prior to June 1, 1953 and Mrs. Forsyth had sworn that she had typed and mailed the letter making the application, but it was shown that no such letter was received by the Department. Cameron J. said that he did not believe either of them. Berg swore positively that he was not present in the Police Court in Toronto on November 14, 1953, when the plea of guilty was entered on behalf of the respondent company, but Belch and Mr. E. F. Denton, an excise tax auditor for the Department, were present and swore that he was there.\nIn view of the learned trial judge's finding that the evidence of the witness Berg is unworthy of belief, the question as to whether the statement said to have been made in April by Nauman induced or contributed to inducing the respondent to make the payment of the sum of $30,000 five months later is a matter to be determined by such inferences as may properly be drawn from the scant evidence that is available. It is to be remembered that the claim to recover the money on the footing that it was paid in consequence of the threats appears to have been an afterthought which was introduced into the case only at the commencement of the trial, nearly a year after the petition of right was filed. Up to that time it appears to have been assumed that the fact that the moneys had been paid in the mistaken belief that mouton was subject to excise tax was a sufficient basis for recovery, even though that mistake was one of law. If it be accepted that the threats were in fact made by Nauman, they were made in the month of April and it was not until nearly five months thereafter that the settlement was made.\nAccording to Berg, the amount claimed in the Notice of Assessment sent to the respondent in April 1953, which showed the sum payable including penalties and interest as being $61,722.36, was excessive and included excise tax upon shearlings delivered in respect of which no tax was payable. This directly conflicts with the evidence of Belch. The respondent, however, elected not to give any evidence as to the negotiations between its solicitor and the Deputy Minister, other than that afforded by the letter of September 15, 1953 above mentioned.\nIn the absence of other evidence, I would infer that the liability of the respondent for excise taxes on the quantities of mouton delivered during the period was admitted by Mr. Croll and a compromise was agreed upon fixing the amount to be paid at $30,000 for reasons which do not appear and with which we are not concerned. It is perfectly clear that the solicitor was informed that the Crown proposed to lay an Information against Berg for breaches of s. 112(2) of the Excise Tax Act and to propose to the magistrate that a penalty of $10,000 and a fine should be imposed, and that it was at the request of the solicitor that the Deputy Minister had agreed that the Information should be laid against the respondent company rather than against Berg. The civil claim of the Crown for the taxes which Berg, the respondent's solicitor and the Deputy Minister believed to be payable and the criminal offences which had admittedly been committed under Berg's instructions were entirely distinct matters. Berg disclaimed any knowledge of the negotiations carried on by the respondent's solicitor who made the arrangements on its behalf.\nIn the absence of any evidence on the matter, we are asked to infer that the threat which had been made by Nauman in the previous April either induced or contributed to inducing or influenced Mr. Croll to agree to the payment of the sum of $30,000 in September, a compromise which on the face of it was a most favourable one for the respondent. For my part I refuse to draw any such inference.\nIt is apparently the fact that after the fire which destroyed the respondent's premises at Uxbridge the Department notified the insurance companies and the respondent's bank at Uxbridge not to pay over any moneys due to the respondent, this being done under the provision of s. 108(6) of the Excise Tax Act. It is suggested in argument that in some way this amounted to duress. However, this is not pleaded and the matter was not in issue at the trial and need not be considered.\nThere is no pretense that the moneys claimed were paid under protest, as would undoubtedly have been the case had Berg written the letter in June 1953 claiming a refund of the amounts paid which was the subject of part of the claim. A mere demand as of right for payment of money is not compulsion and money paid in consequence of it, with full knowledge of the facts, is not recoverable (Brisbane v. Dacres10; Barber v. Pott11).\nThese moneys clearly were paid under a mistake of law and are, in my opinion, not recoverable.\nI would allow this appeal with costs and dismiss the petition of Right with costs.\nRitchie J.:\u2014The facts of this case have been thoroughly reviewed in the reasons of other members of the Court, all of which I have had the benefit of reading.\nAs the Chief Justice has said, the substantial point in issue in this appeal is whether the $30,000 paid by the respondent to the Department of National Revenue in September 1953 was paid involuntarily and under duress or compulsion. The evidence indicates that the Department exerted the full pressure which the fraudulent action of the respondent's ' president and the provisions of the statute then thought to be applicable made available to it, but I am of opinion that even if this pressure did have any effect on the final settlement such effect was limited to hastening the conclusion of the transaction and was, in no sense, the reason for the respondent's recognition of the right to tax \"mouton\" which was at all times accepted wrongly, as the event turned out, by both parties.\nThe following excerpt from Mr. Berg's evidence at p. 33 of the Appeal Case clearly indicates that his objection to paying the full assessment of $61,722.36 which was originally claimed was based on the contention that this amount wrongly included taxes in respect of \"shearlings\" which were not subject to tax:\nBY HIS LORDSHIP:\nQ. I am not clear about that. You were processing shearlings. Are they young sheep?\nA. Yes, sir.\nQ. And you were processing mouton?\nA. Yes, sir; from the sheepskins.\nQ. And is it something different?\nA. Yes.\nQ. You were protesting part of the assessment. Were you doing anything other than processing shearlings so as to produce mouton?\nA. No.\nQ. That is all?\nA. Yes.\nQ. Then you were protesting only part of the assessment?\nA. That assessment they gave me for $61,000.00 which was not correct.\nQ. What part?\nA. It was that they claimed I should have paid excise tax on all the products which I manufactured.\nQ. What were you manufacturing other than mouton?\nA. Just shearlings and mouton. Shearlings were not excise taxable; mounton was.\nQ. Are you protesting that the assessment you received included both shearlings and mouton?\nA. Fes, sir.\nQ. You protested shearlings as not being within Section 80(A)?\nA. Yes. (The italics are mine.)\nIn this regard it is of interest to record the following finding of the learned trial judge:\nIt will be noted that the item of $30,000 now claimed, while less than the total amount originally claimed by the Department, relates entirely to taxes which the suppliant by its fraudulent records and returns had endeavoured to escape paying. It seems to me to follow from this finding that the $30,000 in question was money which was thought to be justly due to the Department and which the suppliant had endeavoured to escape paying.\nThe case of Brocklebank, Limited v. The King12, is cited by the learned trial judge as an authority applicable to the present circumstances and he draws particular attention to the language used by Bankes L.J. at pp. 61-62 in holding that the money there paid was recoverable:\nThe payment is best described, I think, as one of those which are made grudgingly and of necessity, but without open protest, because protest is felt to be useless.\nThat decision is based in part on the fact that the money was paid to an official colore officii as is disclosed by the following observation of Scrutton L.J. in the Court of Appeal where he said at p. 67:\nFurther, I am clear that the payment by the petitioners in this case was not a voluntary payment so as to prevent its being recovered back. It was demanded by the Shipping Controller colore officii, as one of the only terms on which he would grant a licence for the transfer.\nIn this regard it seems appropriate to refer to what was said by Macdonald J.A., speaking in the same connection on behalf of the Court of Appeal of British Columbia in Vancouver Growers Limited v. Snow Limited13, where he said:\nIf payments made pursuant to an invalidated Act are to be regarded as made involuntarily because presumably the parties making the payments were not on equal terms with the authority purporting to act under the statute it may be difficult to procure officials willing to assume the necessary risk. A declaration of invalidity may be made after many years of operation and large amounts might be recoverable if it is enough to show in a literal sense that \"the payments were made under circumstances which left the party no choice,\" or that \"the plaintiff really had no choice and the parties \u2026 were not on equal terms.\" Every Act for taxation or other purposes, whether valid in fact, or for the time being thought to be valid, compels compliance with its terms under suitable penalties. The payee has no choice and the authorities imposing it are in a superior position. It does not follow, however, that all who comply do so under compulsion, except in the sense that every Act imposes obligations, or that the respective parties in the truest sense are not \"on equal terms.\" It should be assumed that all citizens voluntarily discharge obligations involving payments of money or other duties imposed by statute. In that case there was no threat of imprisonment and no freezing of any of the plaintiff's assets, but what was said in that judgment is nonetheless pertinent in considering the extent to which the fact that the demand in the present case was made by officials of the Department is to be treated as giving rise to a situation in which the payment may be considered involuntary. The case has particular relevance to the circumstances here disclosed in that the statute there in question had been invalidated by a subsequent decision of the courts just as the provisions of The Excise Tax Act under which the present assessment was made were subsequently found to be inapplicable to \"mouton\" (see Universal Fur Dressers & Buyers Limited v. The Queen14,).\nThe generally accepted view of the circumstances which give rise to an action for the return of money paid under pressure or compulsion is expressed by Lord Reading in the case of Maskell v. Horner15, which has been approved by this Court in Knutson v. Bourkes Syndicate16, and The City of Saint John et al. v. Fraser-Brace Overseas Corporation et al.17\nIn my view the whole of Lord Reading's decision in that case must be read in light of the following description of the reasons for holding that such a payment can be recovered. Lord Reading there said at p. 118:\nPayment under such pressure establishes that the payment is not made voluntarily to close the transaction. \u2026 The payment is made for the purpose of averting a threatened evil and is made not with the intention of giving up a right but under immediate necessity and with the intention of preserving the right to dispute the legality of the demand \u2026.\n(The italics are mine.)\nIn the present case, according to Mr. Berg's own testimony, as soon as he received the assessment of $61,722.36 he came to Ottawa to protest it on the ground that it included a tax on \"shearlings\" and he was then met by the threat \"unless we get fully paid, if I have to we will put you in gaol.\" If such full payment had at once been made pursuant to this statement, then it might indeed be said to have been made \"for the purpose of averting a threatened evil\", but this is not what happened. On the contrary, the interview at which this statement was made turned out to be but the prelude to a prolonged series of negotiations in which two lawyers participated and which lasted from the end of April to the middle of September, culminating in the respondent paying only $30,000 and the company, not Berg, being prosecuted and subjected to a $10,000 penalty together with a fine of $200.\nIn the case of Knutson v. Bourkes Syndicate, supra, as in the case of Maskell v. Horner, supra, the payments were found to have been made under conditions amounting to protest, and although it is appreciated that actual protest is not a prerequisite to recovery when the involuntary nature of the payment can be inferred from the circumstances, it must nonetheless be observed that the prolonged negotiations for settlement which characterized this case are a poor substitute for \"open protest\" and in my view this serves to distinguish it from the cases above referred to.\nWith the greatest possible respect for the learned trial judge, I take the view that whatever may have been the nature of the threats exerted by the Department the payment of the $30,000 in question in this case which was made in September 1953 was not made \"under immediate necessity and with the intention of preserving the right to dispute the legality of the demand\" and that it cannot be recovered as money paid involuntarily or under duress.\nFor these reasons, as well as those stated by the Chief Justice and Mr. Justice Locke, I am of opinion that this appeal should be allowed with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs, Taschereau J. dissenting.\nSolicitor for the appellant: W.

The respondent contended that the expropriation was invalid, inter alia, because these lands were not laid off by metes and bounds as required by s. 9(1) of the Expropriation Act, R.S.C. 1927, c. 64. The trial judge declared the expropriation invalid on that ground. The Crown appealed to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be allowed.\nPer Kerwin C.J.: Under the Expropriation Act, there are two distinct methods of taking land required by the Crown: (a) by the fact of the taking physical possession thereof and (b) by the filing of the plan and description. When the second method is used, as in the present case, the deposit of the plan and description, signed as provided by the Act, is sufficient.\nPer Taschereau, Locke, Cartwright, Fauteux, Martland and Ritchie JJ.: What s. 9 of the Act requires is that the lands proposed to be taken shall be laid down or marked out on a map or plan and shall also be described by metes and bounds in a written verbal description, which plan and description shall then be deposited in the office of the registrar of deed. It is immaterial whether any work is done by a surveyor or whether any visible marks are placed at the boundaries. All that is required is that the plan and description make clear what land is being expropriated, and, in this case, that requirement was fulfilled.\nPer Curiam: The other grounds on which the respondent sought to have the expropriation declared invalid, were rightly rejected by the trial judge.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of Thorson P. of the Exchequer Court of Canada1, declaring an expropriation of land invalid. Appeal allowed.\nD. S. Maxwell and P. M. Troop, for the appellant.\nK. E. Eaton and W. T. Green, for the respondent. The Chief Justice:\u2014This is an appeal on behalf of Her Majesty the Queen against a judgment of the President of the Exchequer Court2 delivered after the trial of a petition of right and declaring \"that the alleged expropriation of the Suppliant's land on November 3, 1947 was invalid and that the deposit of the plan and description on the third day of November 1947 did not have the effect of vesting the land or lands of the Suppliant in His late Majesty the King in right of Canada.\"\nThe suppliant is the widow, executrix and sole devisee of Lawrence A. Crawford, who died January 16, 1958, and who, in November 1947, was the owner of part of lot 2, concession 4, Rideau Front, of the Township of Gloucester, in the County of Carleton, in the Province of Ontario, and was registered as such in the office of the Registrar of Deeds for the said county. On November 3, 1947, there was registered in the said Registry Office a notice of expropriation reading as follows:\nNOTICE OF EXPROPRIATION\nLand to be Acquired for Government Control Purposes in the Township of Gloucester, County of Carleton, Province of Ontario.\nTAKE NOTICE that the parcels of land and property described in the description hereto annexed and shown coloured red on the plan hereto attached, being situate in the Township of Gloucester, County of Carleton and Province of Ontario, have been taken possession of for the use of His Majesty the King, in right of Canada, the said land and premises being required for Government purposes, and that the said lands and property are vested in His Majesty the King, His Heirs and Successors, by virtue of the \"Expropriation Act\", R.S.C. 1927, Chapter 64.\n\"J. M. Somerville\",\nSecretary of the Department of\nPublic Works of Canada.\nThe description annexed included a great number of parcels of land, but the land of Lawrence A. Crawford (part of lot 2, concession 4, Rideau Front, of the Township of Gloucester) was included in the following:\nALL and Singular those certain parcels or tracts of land and premises, situate, lying and being in the Township of Gloucester, County of Carleton and Province of Ontario, and being composed of......................\nThe whole of Lots 2, 3, 4, and 5 of Concession IV (Rideau Front), and Parts of Lots 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 of Concession III (Rideau Front), All in the above-mentioned Township of Gloucester. After setting out all the parcels of land these words appear: All of which may be more particularly described as follows:\u2014\n(Then follows a detailed description at the end of which is)\nALL AS SHOWN coloured red on the accompanying plan dated July 8th, 1947.\n.......................................................................................................................\nThe above is a plan and description of certain lands and premises shown coloured red or delineated in red, taken for the use of His Majesty the King, in right of Canada, under the provisions of the Expropriation Act, Chapter 64 of the Revised Statutes of Canada, 1927. Ottawa, August 8th, 1947.\nS. E. Farley, O.L.S.\nThe first complaint of the suppliant is dealt with satisfactorily by the President who stated that the Registrar of Deeds for the County of Carleton testified \"that he received the plan and description, and also a notice of expropriation, as one document and recorded it as such\", although by the lapse of time the plan and description had become separated and were filed as separate exhibits. Another attack made on the validity of the expropriation was that a plan and description of each individual's land by itself must be registered or in any event that the land of each such person must be shown separately on the plan and appear separately in the description. I agree with the President's judgment that this cannot be substantiated. While the land of Lawrence A. Crawford was not shown separately, there is no doubt from all the evidence that it was included in the land covered by the plan and description.\nIt was alleged that the plan and description were not signed as required by the Expropriation Act. Here also I agree with the President that it is shown by the evidence that the plan is a print of the plan drawn by Mr. S. E. Farley and that the latter was an Ontario land surveyor duly licensed and sworn in and for the Province of Ontario. Mr. Farley's signature appeared upon the original plan and his signature was reproduced on the print. The evidence of Mr. Arthur Cordes who, in 1947, was the principal clerk in the Secretary's Branch of the Department of Public Works, shows that he typed the certificate that appears on the back of the plan and that he saw Mr. Somerville sign it after it was pasted on the back.\nBy an amendment permitted at the trial, para. 9 was added to the petition of right:\n9. The purported expropriation referred to in paragraph 2 of this petition was invalid in law by reason of the fact that the land described in the plan and description referred to in the said paragraph was not laid off by metes and bounds, at the instance of an authority acting for the respondent, as required by section 9 of the Expropriation Act.\nIt was upon this ground that the President gave the judgment now before us. He came to that conclusion because he considered that two judgments of this Court, Kearney v. Oakes (decided November 10, 1890)3 and Kearney v. The Queen, decided April 30, 1889, but not reported, were in conflict. The latter judgment was given on an appeal from the judgment of Burbidge J. in the Exchequer Court (decided September 24, 1888)4, at the end of which report appears this note:\nOn appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada by the claimant, the amount of compensation awarded by the Exchequer Court was increased on the ground that it did not appear that such compensation was assessed in view of the future damage that may result from the want of a crossing.\nThe reasons for judgment in this Court cannot be located but the entry in the Registrar's Book, on April 30, 1889, with reference to this appeal reads:\nAppeal allowed with costs and compensation awarded by Exchequer Court increased to $4,000, Gwynne J. dissenting,\nalthough in Kearney v. Oakes, Gwynne J. says that the damages were fixed in this Court at $5,131.60.\nWhile Kearney v. The Queen was decided before Kearney v. Oakes, the trespass giving rise to the litigation which culminated in the last named decision occurred in September 1884. The action was brought in Nova Scotia and the reasons of the trial judge, Chief Justice MacDonald, delivered in May 1886 are to be found in volume 57 of the bound Cases Filed in the Supreme Court of Canada. The claim was for damages for trespass against Government contractors concerned in the construction of a branch line of the Inter-colonial Railway more than one mile in length. On August 13, 1884, there had been filed in the Office of the Registry of Deeds at Halifax a plan and description in presumed compliance with subs. (1) of s. 10 of the Government Railways Act, 1881 (Can.), c. 25. This subsection in all relevant respects is the same as s. 9(1) of the Expropriation Act of Canada with which we are concerned. The plan and description indicated the centre line of the proposed railway and designated the land to be expropriated \"as embracing a width\" of a certain number of feet on each side of the line. By s. 6 of the Government Railways Act the Minister of Railways and Canals might for certain purposes, but by and with the authority of the Governor-in-Council, build, make and construct a branch line of railway not to exceed in any one case six miles in length. There was a proviso that where the branch, or siding, did not exceed one mile in length, the Minister might construct such branch, or siding, without an Order-in-Council. The Order-in-Council put in evidence as authority to the Minister to construct the branch, purported to have been made on December 12, 1884, which, of course, was after the filing of the plan and description in the Registry of Deeds and as already stated the branch line was more than one mile in length. Chief Justice MacDonald said in part:\nIf this Order-in-Council be sufficient to justify and legalise an entry upon the plaintiff's land by the Minister of Railways and his servants at any period antecedent to this date, then I find that in all other respects the proceedings to expropriate the plaintiff's land have been in accordance with the statute and sufficient to invest title in Her Majesty and the justification of the defendants is sustained.\nHowever, his conclusion was:\nHere the entry was originally wrongful without lawful authority and a trespass by every person who invaded the plaintiff's possessions against her will, and I cannot hold that the subsequent confirmation by the Order-in-Council made that legal which before was illegal and unwarranted.\nThe Supreme Court of Nova Scotia en banc5 allowed an appeal on the ground that the contractors were employees of the Government department and that under s. 109 of the Government Railways Act they were entitled to one month's notice in writing before bringing the action, which notice had not been given. This Court allowed Mrs. Kearney's appeal. Chief Justice Ritchie dissenting, agreed with the Nova Scotia Court en banc. Gwynne J. dissenting, held that the passing of the Order-in-Council was not necessary because the requisite authority was to be found in the Public Works Act. He also held that the contractors were employees of the Government. A careful examination of the reasons of Patterson J. shows that he agreed with Chief Justice MacDonald, that \"the fundamental difficulty in his way (that is, in the way of counsel for the defendants) is the absence of legal authority to enter on the lands of the plaintiff in September 1884\"; (18 S.C.R. p. 177). Subsequently, at p. 180, he said:\nIt is argued that the effect of the deposit of the plan was under section 10 to vest the lands in the Crown making the entry lawful and confirming the right of the plaintiff to her claim for compensation. I am inclined to think that that would be so if the section had been fully complied with but I have not examined the statute closely enough to speak more decidedly on the point. It seems clear, however, that the plan and description must be of territory laid off by metes and bounds. It is upon \"such lands\" that the statutory conveyance operates and the essential work on the ground is here wanting.\nIt is quite clear that Mr. Justice Patterson did not examine the statute closely on this point because, if he had, he would have found subs. (3) of s. 10 of the Government Railways Act reading as follows:\n(3) Such plan and description may be deposited at any time either before entry upon the lands, or within twelve months thereafter.\nHowever, whether his views that \"the plan and description must be of territory laid off by metes and bounds\" and \"the essential work on the ground is here wanting\" be obiter or not there is no doubt that the only member of the Court who agreed with him was Mr. Justice Fournier. It has already been explained that Chief Justice Ritchie and Mr. Justice Gwynne would have dismissed the appeal. The fifth member of the Court, Taschereau J., stated merely: \"I am also of opinion that the appeal should be allowed\". This cannot be taken as a concurrence in the reasons of Patterson J. This is, therefore, not a decision that \"lands taken for the use of Government railways shall be laid off by metes and bounds\" means that the lands to be taken have to be marked on the ground. There is no inconsistency between the decision which has just been considered and that of this Court in Kearney v. The Queen, because in that case the Minister of Railways and Canals had referred the claim of the owner for compensation to the Exchequer Court and by arrangement between the Crown and the claimant this was without prejudice to the appeal to this Court in Kearney v. Oakes. By that time, of course, as mentioned above, the Order-in-Council of December 12, 1884, had been passed. As Burbidge J. stated6:\nThe only question arising on the reference is as to the amount of compensation that should be awarded to the claimant for the land taken from her for the Dartmouth Branch Railway, and for damages in respect of her property being injuriously affected by the construction of such railway.\nWe are, therefore, untrammelled by any previous decision of this Court as to the meaning to be ascribed to subs. (1) of s. 9 of the Expropriation Act, R.S.C. 1927, c. 64.\nSection 9 must not be considered in isolation but must be read in connection with other sections. Section 3 enacts in part:\n3. The Minister (which is defined as meaning the head of the department charged with the construction and maintenance of the public work) may by himself, his engineers, superintendents, agents, workmen and servants,\n(a) enter into and upon any land to whomsoever belonging, and survey and take levels of the same, and make such borings, or sink such trial pits as he deems necessary for any purpose relative to the public work;\n(b) enter upon and take possession of any land, real property, streams, waters and watercourses, the appropriation of which is, in his judgment, necessary for the use, construction, maintenance or repair of the public work, or for obtaining better access thereto;\nSection 7 provides:\n7. The minister may employ any person duly licensed or empowered to act as a surveyor for any province of Canada or any engineer, to make any survey, or establish any boundary and furnish the plans and descriptions of any property acquired or to be acquired by His Majesty for the public work.\n2. The boundaries of such properties may be permanently established by means of proper stone or iron monuments planted by the engineer or surveyor so employed by the minister.\n3. Such surveys, boundaries, plans and descriptions shall have the same effect to all intents and purposes as if the operations pertaining thereto or connected therewith had been performed and such boundaries had been established and such monuments planted by a land surveyor duly licensed and sworn in and for the province in which the property is situate.\n4. Such boundaries shall be held to be the true and unalterable boundaries of such property, if, \u2026.(certain conditions are complied with).\n5. It shall not be incumbent on the minister or those acting for him to have boundaries established with the formalities in this section mentioned, but the same may be restored to whenever the minister deems necessary.\nSection 9 reads:\n9. Land taken for the use of His Majesty shall be laid off by metes and bounds; and when no proper deed or conveyance thereof to His Majesty is made and executed by the person having the power to make such deed or conveyance, or when a person interested in such land is incapable of making such deed or conveyance, or when, for any other reason, the minister deems it advisable so to do, a plan and description of such land signed by the minister, the deputy of the minister or the secretary of the department, or by the superintendent of the public work, or by an engineer of the department, or by a land surveyor duly licensed and sworn in and for the province in which the land is situate, shall be deposited of record in the office of the registrar of deeds for the county or registration division in which the land is situate, and such land, by such deposit, shall thereupon become and remain vested in His Majesty.\n2. When any land taken is required for a limited time only, or only a limited estate or interest therein is required, the plan and description so deposited may indicate, by appropriate words written or printed thereon, that the land is taken for such limited time only, or that only such limited estate or interest therein is taken, and by the deposit in such case, the right of possession for such limited time, or such limited estate or interest, shall become and be vested in His Majesty.\n3. All the provisions of this Act shall, so far as they are applicable, apply to the acquisition for public works of such right of possession and such limited estate or interest.\n(Subsections (2) and (3) were enacted for the first time in 1903 by 3 Edward VII, c. 22, s. 1.)\nSections 11, 12, 22(1) and 23 are as follows:\n11. A plan and description of any land at any time in the occupation or possession of His Majesty, and used for the purposes of any public work, may be deposited at any time in like manner and with like effect as herein provided, saving always the lawful claims to compensation of any person interested therein.\n12. In all cases, when any such plan and description, purporting to be signed by the deputy of the minister, or by the secretary of the department, or by the superintendent of the public work, or by an engineer of the department, or by a land surveyor duly licensed as aforesaid, is deposited of record as aforesaid, the same shall be deemed and taken to have been deposited by the direction and authority of the minister, and as indicating that in his judgment the land therein described is necessary for the purposes of the public work; and the said plan and description shall not be called in question except by the minister, or by some person acting for him or for the Crown.\n* * *\n22. If any resistance or opposition is made by any person to the minister, or any person acting for him, entering upon and taking possession of any lands, a judge of the Court, or any judge of any superior court may, on proof of the execution of a conveyance of such lands to His Majesty, or agreement therefor, or of the depositing in the office of the registrar of deeds of a plan and description thereof as aforesaid, and after notice to show cause given in such manner as he prescribes, issue his warrant to the sheriff of the district or county within which such lands are situate directing him to put down such resistance or opposition, and to put the minister, or some person acting for him, in possession thereof.\n* * *\n23. The compensation money agreed upon or adjudged for any land or property acquired or taken for or injuriously affected by the construction of any public work shall stand in the stead of such land or property; and any claim to or encumbrance upon such land or property shall, as respects His Majesty, be converted into a claim to such compensation money or to a proportionate amount thereof, and shall be void as respects any land or property so acquired or taken, which shall, by the fact of the taking possession thereof, or the filing of the plan and description, as the case may be, become and be absolutely vested in His Majesty.\nI agree with the submission of counsel for the appellant that there are two distinct methods of taking land required for Her Majesty, namely, (a) by the fact of the taking physical possession thereof (s. 3) and (b) by the filing of the plan and description (s. 9). If the taking is under the latter, the deposit of the plan and description, signed as provided, is sufficient. If this were not so, the expropriation of the land for Camp Gagetown in New Brunswick would not have been feasible: Gagetown Lumber Company v. The Queen7, as is shown by the evidence in this case of Ross W. Arnett, an Ontario land surveyor and civil engineer. The following words in s. 23, and particularly those italicized, appear to me to be conclusive of the matter:\nAny claim to or encumbrance upon such land or property shall, as respects His Majesty, be converted into a claim to such compensation money or to a proportionate amount thereof, and shall be void as respects any land or property so acquired or taken, which shall, by the fact of the taking possession thereof, or the filing of the plan and description, as the case may be, become and be absolutely vested in His Majesty. A reading of the French version of all the sections noted above leads to the same conclusion.\nThe appeal should be allowed, the judgment below set aside and the petition of right dismissed with costs. Under the circumstances there should be no costs of the appeal.\nThe judgment of Taschereau, Locke, Cartwright, Fauteux, Martland and Ritchie JJ. was delivered by\nCartwright J.:\u2014The questions raised on this appeal and the relevant statutory provisions are set out in the reasons of the Chief Justice.\nI agree with the conclusion of the Chief Justice that the learned President8 was right in rejecting all of the grounds, other than those set out in para. 9 of the petition, on which the respondent sought to have the expropriation of the lands owned by her declared invalid.\nThe sole ground on which the learned President proceeded in declaring the expropriation invalid was set out in para. 9, which was added to the petition by amendment made at the trial, and reads as follows:\n9. The purported expropriation referred to in paragraph 2 of this petition was invalid in law by reason of the fact that the land described in the plan and description referred to in the said paragraph was not laid off by metes and bounds, at the instance of an authority acting for the respondent, as required by section 9 of the Expropriation Act.\nThe learned President makes it clear that, in his opinion, this ground also ought to be rejected, but in view of certain observations made in the reasons of Patterson J. in Kearney v. Oakes9, he deemed it advisable to make the declaration of invalidity sought by the petitioner so that the question of law raised as to the true construction of s. 9(1) of the Expropriation Act might be passed on by this Court.\nSection 9(1) of the Expropriation Act, R.S.B.C. 1952, c. 106, is in the same words as s. 9(1) of the Expropriation Act, R.S.C. 1927, c. 64, which was the Statute in force at the date of the expropriation here in question, it reads as follows:\n9(1) Land taken for the use of Her Majesty shall be laid off by metes and bounds; and when no proper deed or conveyance thereof to Her Majesty is made and executed by the person having the power to make such deed or conveyance, or when a person interested in such land is incapable of making such deed or conveyance, or when, for any other reason, the Minister deems it advisable so to do, a plan and description of such land signed by the Minister, the deputy of the Minister or the secretary of the department, or by the superintendent of the public work, or by an engineer of the department, or by a land surveyor duly licensed and sworn in and for the province in which the land is situate, shall be deposited of record in the office of the registrar of deeds for the county or registration division in which the land is situate, and such land, by such deposit, shall thereupon become and remain vested in Her Majesty.\nIn Kearney v. Oakes, supra, consideration was given to the meaning of s. 10 of the Government Railways Act, 1881 (Can.), c. 25. The opening words of this section were:\nLands taken for the use of Government railways shall be laid off by metes and bounds;\nThe remainder of the section was in substantially the same words as s. 9(1) of the Expropriation Act, quoted above.\nThe passage in the reasons of Patterson J. on which the judgment of the learned President is founded appears at page 180 of the report and is as follows:\nIt is argued that the effect of the deposit of the plan was, under section 10, to vest the lands in the crown, making the entry lawful and confirming the right of the plaintiff to her claim for compensation. I am inclined to think that that would be so if the section had been fully complied with, but I have not examined the statute closely enough to speak more decidedly on the point. It seems clear, however, that the plan and description must be of territory laid off by metes and bounds. It is upon \"such lands\" that the statutory conveyance operates, and the essential work on the ground is here wanting.\nI do not find it necessary to form a final opinion as to whether this pronouncement should be regarded as obiter, for I am in agreement with the Chief Justice that it did not form part of the judgment of the majority of the Court and is not binding upon us.\nIt is apparent from the paragraph quoted from the reasons of Patterson J. and from the three paragraphs immediately preceding that quotation that he construed the words \"shall be laid off by metes and bounds\" as meaning \"shall have the boundaries thereof marked physically on the ground by stakes or other visible indicia\". In my opinion this construction was incorrect and involved reading into the section some such words as \"on the ground\" which do not appear in it.\nThe phrase \"lay off\" is given the following meanings, amongst others, in the Oxford English Dictionary (1933), vol. 6, p. 130: \"to mark or separate off (plots of ground etc.); to plot out land in some way or for some purpose\". An example given of its use is: \"They directed that the streets should be laid off obliquely\". Among the meanings assigned in the Oxford Dictionary to the verb \"to plot\" are: \"to make a plan, map or diagram of;\" \"to lay down on a map\"; \"to make a plan of\".\nThe phrase, \"by metes and bounds\" is defined in The Dictionary of English Law, by Earl Jowitt (1959), p. 1169, as \"by measurements and boundaries\". In Words and Phrases, Permanent Edition, vol. 27, the phrase \"metes and bounds\" is given the meanings \"boundary lines or limits\"; \"the boundary lines of land with their terminal points and angles\".\nIn my opinion on the true construction of the opening sentence of s. 9(1), read in the context of the remainder of the sub-section and of the whole act, what is required is that the lands proposed to be taken shall be laid down or marked out on a map or plan and shall also be described by metes and bounds in a written verbal description, which plan and description shall then be deposited in the office of the proper registrar of deeds. It is in my opinion immaterial whether any work is done by a surveyor on the lands or whether any visible marks are placed at the boundaries thereof. The maximum requirement of the sub-section is fulfilled if the plan and description deposited make clear exactly what land is being expropriated. It is plain that in the case at bar this requirement was fulfilled. It appears from the petition and from the deed to Lawrence Crawford filed as an exhibit that the lands of the respondent are part of lot 2 in the 4th concession, Rideau Front, of the Township of Gloucester. The plan and description filed in the Registry office pursuant to s. 9(1) show clearly what lands are taken and that these include the whole of the said lot 2. If the true meaning of the words of section 9(1) were doubtful it would be proper to consider the apparent purpose of Parliament in enacting them as disclosed by the whole act. That purpose appears to be two-fold: (i) to permit the Crown in the cases envisaged by the Act to expropriate lands making due compensation therefor; and (ii) to ensure that the lands taken are identified with certainty.\nIf certainty of description of the lands taken can be achieved without the necessity of a surveyor visiting them and placing marks on their boundaries, it would require plain words to render the performance of such unnecessary acts a condition precedent to the validity of an expropriation, and I find no such words in the section. In construing a statutory provision of which the meaning is not plain assistance may be derived from the presumption expressed in the maxim lex neminem cogit ad vana seu inutilia.\nIn my opinion the requirements of s. 9(1) of the Expropriation Act have been fulfilled in the case at bar and it follows that the appeal succeeds.\nFor the above reasons I would allow the appeal, set aside the judgment below and direct judgment to be entered dismissing the petition of right with costs. In the particular circumstances I would make no order as to the costs of the appeal.\nAppeal allowed; no costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: W. R.

The appellant City had agreed to indemnify the respondent against any damage or injury it might sustain or which might be occassioned to the premises it occupied, by the construction of a bridge to be built by the appellant over the said property. Failing to agree as to the amount to be paid, the parties proceeded to arbitration as provided for by the agreement. An award of $12,500 was made by the arbitrators for injurious affection to the leasehold interest and diminution of property values (that portion of the award was not in question in this appeal). By a majority, the arbitrators awarded $40,000 for loss of business, loss of efficiency, loss through disruption and general inconvenience. As to the claim for special expenses, the arbitrators ruled that it would either be covered by the award of $40,000 or by the taxed costs. The trial judge set aside the award of $40,000 on the grounds that there was no evidence to support it and that it was invalid as being uncertain. This judgment was reversed by the Court of Appeal. The City appealed to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nPer Kerwin C.J. and Abbott and Judson JJ.: The evidence having been taken in shorthand by consent, this Court was entitled to look at it to determine whether or not there was evidence upon which the arbitrators could make their award. As the arbitrators had evidence before them to warrant the award, there was, therefore no error manifest on the face of it, including for that purpose all the evidence.\nAll that the arbitrators decided with respect to the special expenses was that they should not be granted in addition to the $40,000 and costs.\nPer Locke, Cartwright, Abbott and Judson JJ.: Where there has been a submission to arbitrators to determine compensation and the evidence on which the award is based is taken under oath, as permitted by the Arbitration Act, this Court is entitled to examine the record of the proceedings to determine whether, as a matter of law, there was evidence of loss or damage falling within the terms of the submission. In the absence of such evidence, the award may be set aside at common law or under s. 14 of the Act as misconduct; in that case, there would be an error of law appearing on the face of the award. There was, in the present case, evidence upon which the arbitrators could base their award of damages for loss of profit, and, in the absence of a contention that any of the evidence relied upon by the arbitrators was improperly admitted, this Court could not concern itself further with this aspect of the matter. This Court could not in proceedings such as these weigh the evidence or interfere with the award on the ground that it was against the weight of the evidence. Cedar Rapids v. Lacoste, [1914] A.C. 569, distinguished.\nThe contention that the award was rendered uncertain by the manner in which the special expenses had been dealt with, could not be entertained.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1], reversing a judgment of Clyne J. Appeal dismissed.\nHon. J. W. de B. Farris, Q.C., and R. Elliott, for the appellant. D. McK. Brown and R. H. Guile, for the respondent.\nThe judgment of Kerwin C.J. and of Abbott and Judson JJ. was delivered by\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE:\u2014This is an appeal by the City of Vancouver against the judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[2] reversing the order of Clyne J. and restoring the award of certain arbitrators in its entirety. The arbitrators, of whom there were three, had unanimously allowed the company-respondent the sum of $12,500 for injurious affection to its leasehold interest and diminution of property values and the costs of the arbitration. The majority had awarded the company the sum of $40,000 for compensation for loss of business, loss of efficiency, disruption and general inconvenience. An application to Clyne J. to set aside that part of the award as to the $40,000 succeeded and it was ordered that the City pay the company the costs with respect to the claim of $12,500 but that the company pay the City the costs in connection with the claim of $40,000. The company was ordered to pay the costs of the application before Clyne J. The Court of Appeal restored that part of the award as to the $40,000 and ordered the City to pay the costs of the arbitration, of the motion before Clyne J. and of the appeal. The reasons of the majority were delivered by Davey J.A. with whom O'Halloran J.A. agreed. Sidney Smith J.A. dissenting, would have affirmed the decision of Clyne J.\nAbout 1949-50 the City decided to erect a new Granville Street bridge. In the Granville Island area the company and others were tenants of the National Harbours Board. Because the area, including the lots upon which the offices and paint factory of the company were located, was the property of the Crown in right of Canada, doubts arose as to the power of the City to expropriate the company's leasehold interests and in order to avoid litigation, an agreement, dated November 10, 1952, was entered into between the company and the City. It recited that any sub-leasing or alienation of any property leased by the company from the Board or any user of the said property contrary to the terms of its lease, dated June 20, 1939, required the approval of the Board and that the Board had agreed provisionally to give such approval. The agreement also contained the two following recitals:\nAND WHEREAS the City now requires; firstly for construction of a Pier known as M. 1 for the said Bridge, a licence to use a portion of the said property, and secondly, for the footings of the said Pier M. 1, a sub-lease of part of the land covered with water demised by the hereinbefore recited lease, and thirdly, for the said bridge a licence irrevocable during the terms of the said lease to construct and maintain the span suspended over and above the said property.\n***\nAND WHEREAS the use of the portion of the property as above recited will cause certain loss to the Company.\nThe document then proceeded to set forth that the City agreed:\n(a) That the position of the said Pier M. 1 on a portion of the land covered with water leased to the Company shall be as shown outlined in red on the attached plan which said plan is marked Schedule \"A\" hereto and shall form an integral part of this Agreement;\n(b) That the area to be used by the City and its Contractor during the construction of the said Pier M. 1 shall be and shall not exceed the area shown outlined in green on the said plan marked Schedule \"A\" to this Agreement;\n(c) That the estimated duration of occupancy of the area referred to in sub-paragraph (b) above will be 120 days from the 6th day of October A.D. 1952;\n(d) That if at any time after the City or its Contractors shall enter upon the said property pursuant to the terms hereof any damage or injury is sustained by the Company or to the premises of the Company which said damage whether in whole or in part and whether directly or indirectly is occasioned by or attributable to the construction or presence of the said Bridge or to the fact that the said Bridge crosses the property of the Company whether or not a claim arises against the Company under or by virtue of clause 11 of the said lease dated 20th June, 1939, then the City will indemnify the Company in respect of such proportion of such damage or injury as is attributable to such construction or presence of such Bridge;\nClause (d) is relied upon by the company but the City takes the position that it is not applicable as the parties are engaged in a particular arbitration and not litigation about the subject matter of the clause. It is reproduced merely as part of the narrative because in my view it has no relevancy to the matters to be decided.\nThe City further agreed to pay the company the cost of re-locating the latter's office during the period of occupancy referred to in sub-para. (c) set out above which estimated cost was itemized and was to be payable by the City to the company from time to time upon production by the company of receipted vouchers. The proper amount was paid by the City and there is no dispute about these items. Clauses (i) and (j) provide:\n(i) That if during the time, or part of the time, while the said span is under construction over and above the said property of the Company, the office of the Company cannot be used owing to reasonable apprehension of danger to employees of the Company, then the City will also pay to the Company the costs of relocating the office of the Company for such period as may be considered necessary provided always that the need for such relocating as well also as the cost of the same shall, in the absence of agreement between the parties hereto be the subject of arbitration in the manner hereinafter provided in clause 1(j) hereof;\n(j) That the City will pay, in addition to the above, compensation for loss of business, if any, loss of efficiency, disruption, diminution of property values, general inconveniences, injurious affection, or any other loss whatsoever, whether caused by or arising as a result of the relocation of the office whether during the time mentioned in clause (h) or clause (i) hereof, the construction of the said Pier M. 1, or the construction and existence after construction of the said Bridge or any part thereof, a sum of money to be determined by the parties hereto within three months of the end of the period of construction of that portion of the said Bridge suspended over the said property of the Company, failing which a sum of money to be determined by arbitration of three (3) arbitrators, one to be appointed by each party and the third by such two arbitrators and otherwise pursuant to the Arbitration Act of the Province of British Columbia.\nIt is agreed that the word \"as\" should be inserted in the second line of (j) before the word \"compensation\".\nThe City paid the costs of re-locating the company's office but it is important to bear in mind that the re-location continued for a period of about eleven months at a distance of three hundred yards from the company's factory. Bearing that in mind the real dispute hinges upon clause (j) and the terms of the award of the arbitrators with reference to a claim by the company for out-of-pocket expenses.\nThe Board was duly constituted, particulars of claim were delivered on behalf of the City and the Board sat for a total of twenty-four days of which seventeen were occupied with the presentment of the City's claim and the evidence on behalf of both parties. The Board was of opinion that the claim should be divided as follows:\nItem 1. Compensation for loss of business, if any, loss of efficiency, loss through disruption, and general inconvenience.\nItem 2. Diminution of property values, and injurious affection to the leasehold interest. The arbitrators pointed out that the company relied upon the evidence of two chartered accountants but the Board unanimously rejected the method adopted by the auditors of computing the compensation to be paid to the company under Item 1.\nThe award continues:\nA majority of the Arbitrators, consisting of the Chairman and Mr. Smelts, are of the opinion that ample evidence is given to prove loss of business, loss of efficiency, loss through disruption and general inconvenience due to the construction of the bridge. They are also of the opinion that there was ample evidence given for them to compute what sum of money should be paid to the Company as compensation under those headings. After examining all the evidence and weighing it to the best of their ability, they are of the opinion that the sum of $40,000 is a fair amount to award to the Company under these headings. Mr. Wasson, on the other hand, is of the opinion that the Company did not prove any damage and accordingly would award nothing under the abovementioned headings. Attached hereto as Schedule 1 are his Reasons for so finding.\nI do not reproduce Mr. Wasson's reasons because all the matters referred to by him were mentioned in the argument before us on behalf of the City. After awarding the sum of $12,500 for injurious affection and damage to the leasehold interest and diminution of property values, the award states:\nWith regard to the claim for out-of-pocket expenses advanced by the Company, the Board is unanimously of the opinion that such sum as the Company is justly entitled to will either be covered by the amount of $40,000 already awarded or by the award of costs to the Company as hereinafter appears.\nThe costs are disposed of in the following paragraph of the award:\n(c) The Board unanimously awards to the Company the costs of this arbitration, such costs to be based upon the tariff of the Supreme Court of British Columbia and to be taxed under the said tariff.\nI agree that the City was not a wrong-doer as it proceeded in accordance with its agreement with the company. There is also no doubt that the award may be remitted in a proper case, which could not apply here because one of the arbitrators has died, or that it may be set aside, if an error of law appears on the face of the award Absalom Ltd. v. Great Western Garden Village Society Ltd[3].. Here the evidence was taken in shorthand by consent and we are entitled to look at the evidence to determine if the next point taken by counsel on behalf of the City is valid, i.e., that there was no evidence upon which the majority of the arbitrators could award the sum of $40,000; Lacoste v. Cedar Rapids Manufacturing and Power Co.[4], the second time the matter there in dispute was before the Judicial Committee, wherein Lord Warrington of Clyffe, speaking for their Lordships, states:\nThe law and practice of the Province of Quebec governing the procedure of the Court in such matters appear to be in all essentials the same as in this country. Although the appeal is a rehearing, a verdict of a jury or an award of an arbitrator acting within his jurisdiction is not in general set aside unless it is shown that the jury or the arbitrator proceeded on an erroneous view of the law, or that there was no evidence on which the verdict or the award could properly be arrived at, or that there was some manifest error leading to the result. There might also, of course, be some other matter in the conduct of the proceedings such as the wrongful admission or rejection of evidence which might vitiate the result. But as a general rule the Court does not set aside a verdict or an award merely on the ground that it is against the weight of evidence. Of course, a verdict or an award may also be set aside on the ground of misconduct, in the popular sense of the word, on the part of the jury or the arbitrator, but nothing of this kind is alleged in the present case.\nThe argument that in the present case there was no such evidence found favour with Mr. Justice Clyne and Mr. Justice Sidney Smith. However, while I agree with counsel for the City that the decision in Palgrave Gold Mining Co. v. McMillan[5], referred to by Mr. Justice Davey is distinguishable as there the award had to be made before entry without knowing the scope of the intended operations or the effect upon the owner's use of the land or upon its value, I do agree with that learned judge that there is nothing in the agreement under consideration in this appeal which requires loss of business or profits to be proved by loss of specific sales or customers. An attack was made upon certain suggested methods of computing the loss suffered by the company put forward on its behalf but there is nothing in the award to indicate that the majority of the arbitrators adopted any one of these methods in coming to their conclusion. Moreover, as Mr. Justice Davey points out the photographs and the evidence of the officers of the company show that interference, disturbance and inconvenience impaired its sales organization and reduced the company's sales generally, in addition to which extra administrative employees had to be employed. Mr. Brown, for the company, referred to many parts of the record and in my view these are sufficient in order to establish that the majority of the arbitrators had evidence before them to warrant the award.\nSection 14 of the Arbitration Act of British Columbia, R.S.B.C. 1948, c. 16, is the only one requiring mention:\n14. (1) Where an arbitrator or umpire has misconducted himself the Court may remove him.\n(2) Where an arbitrator or umpire has misconducted himself, or an arbitration or award has been improperly procured, the Court may set the award aside.\nThere is no suggestion that any one of the arbitrators misconducted himself and the words \"or an arbitration or award has been improperly procured\" do not apply to a case where there is evidence to justify the award even if the amount allowed might be considered by some to be too large. The parties have agreed to arbitration and the question is not whether a Court would have allowed the same sum but whether there was any evidence upon which the majority of the arbitrators could award the sum of $40,000. There is, therefore, no error manifest on the face of the award including for that purpose all the evidence.\nAs noted above the Board unanimously considered that the out-of-pocket expenses would \"either be covered by the amount of $40,000 already awarded or by the award of costs to the Company as hereinafter appears\". All that part of this statement means is that the Board unanimously awarded the company the costs of the arbitration, such costs to be based upon the tariff of the Supreme Court of British Columbia and to be taxed under the said tariff. I can find in these references no evidence that the Board decided that the out-of-pocket expenses were included in the sum of $40,000 but merely that they should not be granted in addition to the $40,000 and costs.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nThe judgment of Locke, Cartwright, Abbott and Judson JJ. was delivered by\nLOCKE J.:\u2014By the agreement made between the parties to this appeal dated November 10, 1952, it was provided that the appellant would indemnify the respondent against any damage or injury it might sustain or which might be occasioned to the premises occupied by it, either directly or indirectly, by the construction or the presence of the bridge to be built by the appellant over the said property. The clause containing the submission to arbitration described in somewhat more detail the matters in respect of which compensation might be awarded and provided that the appellant would pay in respect of any such loss, failing agreement between the parties as to the amount to be paid:\na sum of money to be determined by arbitration of three arbitrators, one to be appointed by each party and the third by such two arbitrators and otherwise pursuant to the Arbitration Act of the Province of British Columbia.\nThe award of a majority of the arbitrators, which was signed by Mr. A. J. Cowan, Q.C. and Mr. F. W. Smelts, after referring to certain evidence which had been given on behalf of the company based upon figures obtained from the Dominion Bureau of Statistics which was declared to be inadmissible, read in part:\nA majority of the Arbitrators, consisting of the Chairman and Mr. Smelts, are of the opinion that ample evidence is given to prove loss of business, loss of efficiency, loss through disruption and general inconvenience due to the construction of the bridge. They are also of the opinion that there was ample evidence given for them to compute what sum of money should be paid to the Company as compensation under those headings.\nThe sum of $40,000 was fixed as the compensation in respect of the matters last mentioned, and a further sum of $12,500 for injurious affection to the leasehold interest and diminution of property values. As to the last mentioned sum the Board was unanimous and that portion of the award is not in question.\nIn addition to the claims advanced by the respondent in respect of the matters aforesaid, a sum of $8,275.09, of which particulars were given, was claimed as expenses incurred by the company as a result of the construction and existence of the bridge. As to these claims the award stated that the Board was unanimously of the opinion that \"such sum as the company is justly entitled to will either be covered by the amount of $40,000 already awarded or by the award of costs to the company as hereinafter appears.\" Costs were unanimously awarded to the respondent, based upon the tariff of the Supreme Court of British Columbia and to be taxed under the said tariff.\nMr. Evans Wasson, the third arbitrator, dissented as to the award of $40,000 being of the opinion that there was no evidence that the company had suffered any damage from loss of business, loss of efficiency, disruption or from general inconvenience.\nThe City moved to set aside the award on the asserted ground that the arbitrators were guilty of misconduct in finding that the respondent had sustained loss of business, loss of efficiency, loss through disruption and general inconvenience, due to the construction of the bridge, when there was no evidence to substantiate such a finding; in awarding the sum of $40,000 as compensation when there was no evidence of any loss, and in failing to base their award on the evidence and preponderance of evidence. This application was heard by Clyne J. and that learned judge, being of the opinion that there was no evidence to support the award of $40,000 and that on the further ground it was invalid as being uncertain, set it aside.\nThe appeal[6] from that order was allowed by a judgment delivered by Davey J.A., with whom O'Halloran J.A. agreed. Sidney Smith J.A. dissented and would have dismissed the appeal.\nThe Arbitration Act of British Columbia, R.S.B.C. 1948, c. 16, provides by s. 4 that a submision, unless a contrary intention is expressed therein, shall be deemed to include the provisions set forth in the schedule to the Act, so far as they are applicable to the reference under the submission. The schedule referred to provides by para. (h) that the award to be made by the arbitrator or umpire shall be final and binding on the parties.\nSection 14 provides that where an arbitrator or umpire has misconducted himself or an arbitration or award has been improperly procured the court may set the award aside. This section is in the same terms as s. 11 of the Arbitration Act of 1889, 52-53 Vict., c. 49 (Imp.). The section appeared in its present form in the first Arbitration Act passed in British Columbia (c. 1, Statutes of 1893), which statute was taken practically verbatim from the English statute.\nThe case for the appellant is that the evidence given before the arbitrators did not prove that the respondent had suffered any pecuniary loss by reason of any of the matters described in the submission and, alternatively, that the award was rendered uncertain by the failure of the Board to determine what part, if any, of the out of pocket expenses was included in the award of $40,000. The manner in which this portion of the award was worded, it is said, amounted to an attempted delegation to the taxing officer of the powers vested in the arbitrators alone.\nWhere, as in the present matter, there has been a submission to arbitrators to determine compensation to which the terms of the Arbitration Act apply, their award may be set aside if there is error appearing upon its face. It seems to have been assumed by both parties that the evidence taken before the arbitrators might be referred to, at least to determine whether there was evidence of pecuniary damage of a nature falling within the terms of the submission.\nAn error in law appearing on the face of an award means that you can find in the award or a document actually incorporated in it as\u2014for instance\u2014by a note appended by an arbitrator stating the reason for his judgment, some legal proposition which is the basis of the award and which is erroneous: Champsey Bhara & Co. v. Jivraj[7]; Attorney General for Manitoba v. Kelly[8].\nAs their subsequent actions showed, it was the intention of the parties to the submission in this case that, failing agreement, the matter should be determined by arbitrators upon evidence to be adduced before them and that the witnesses, as permitted by the schedule to the Arbitration Act, should be sworn.\nThe evidence referred to in the majority award is that taken on oath before the arbitrators and is stated by them to be that upon which that portion of the award is based. This, in my opinion, permitted the court to examine the record of the proceedings for the purpose of determining whether, as a matter of law, there was evidence of loss or damage falling within the terms of the submission.\nThe motion to set aside the award on the ground that the arbitrators were guilty of misconduct appears to have been made in reliance upon s. 14 of the Arbitration Act. The jurisdiction to set aside the award of an arbitrator for error of law appearing on the face of it is one that exists also at common law independently of the statute: 2 Hals., 3rd ed., p. 60; Race Course Betting Control Board v. Secretary for Air[9], per Greene M.R.\nThe word \"misconduct\" in s. 11 of the Act of 1889 in England has been given a wide meaning. Illustrations are to be found in 2 Hals., 3rd ed., at p. 257 et seq. In Walford v. McFie[10], Lush J., with whom Atkin J. agreed, said that it was legal misconduct on the part of the arbitrator to consider a document which had not been admitted in evidence and which was wholly inadmissible and went to the root of the question submitted to him for decision.\nIn Kelantan Government v. Duff Development Co.[11], Viscount Cave L.C. at p. 411 said that such an award might be set aside if it appeared on the face of it that the arbitrator had proceeded on evidence which was inadmissible or on wrong principles of construction, or had otherwise been guilty of some error in law.\nIf, as contended for the appellant, there was in the present matter no evidence to support an award of compensation for loss of profits from the business during the period of construction, that portion of the award may properly be set aside, in my opinion, whether the matter be dealt with under s. 14 of the statute or at common law.\nIn view of the contention that the arbitrators have acted without any evidence to support their finding, it is necessary to examine the evidence adduced at the hearing and I have done this.\nThe argument for the appellant is that the loss or damage sustained by the respondent company must be proven with some such certainty as claims in the nature of special damages in actions either for tort or breach of contract. While the case for the respondent is that their claim for compensation under the agreement is for loss of profits for the period during which the bridge was under construction, no evidence was given by any former customer of the respondent that he had refrained from dealing with the respondent in consequence of the conditions brought about on Granville Island by the construction of the bridge. The appellant says that the obligation of the respondent was to adduce the best available evidence of its loss and that this was not done. It may be that some better evidence might have been adduced in support of the claim, but this objection really goes to the weight and not to the admissibility of the evidence which was given.\nThe respondent was at the times in question the lessee of a parcel of land on Granville Island and a water lot adjoining it in False Creek under a lease from the National Harbours Board dated June 20, 1939. On this property it had for many years carried on the business of manufacturing and selling paint. Paint was delivered to wholesale and retail dealers and other customers in Vancouver and shipments made to other points in British Columbia from these premises, and it was shown that there was prior to the disruption caused by the construction of the bridge a substantial business in what were called pick-up sales. These were to contractors and others who called at the premises and took delivery of paint in their own vehicles, at times in considerable quantities.\nThe construction of the bridge, as shown in a recital to the agreement of November 10, 1952, called for the construction of a pier and footings for such pier on part of the leased land and part of the land covered by water. Photographs of the premises during the period of construction show that large quantities of building material and equipment were brought upon the respondent's property for the purpose of carrying on the necessary work. The bridge under construction passed over part of the respondent's buildings and, of necessity, the construction work and the material and equipment necessary for it created difficulties of access to the respondent's factory and the premises where sales were made. In the result it was found necessary to move the respondent's office to another location on Granville Island and temporary premises were rented for a considerable period while the work was in progress.\nIn support of the respondent's contention that it had suffered pecuniary loss in consequence of the construction of the bridge, N. M. Crute, a member of the firm of the company's auditors, gave evidence as to the annual profits of the respondent from its operations during the years 1947 to 1954, inclusive. For the year 1952 the profit was less than for any of the five preceding years except the year 1949. For the years 1953 and 1954 the profits were very much less than for any of the years 1947 to 1951, inclusive. While a computation had been made by the company's auditors of the profits which they considered the company would have realized but for the construction of the bridge, which was based upon the figures of the Dominion Bureau of Statistics for similar industries in British Columbia for these three years, this was rejected by the arbitrators as inadmissible.\nJ. D. F. Ekins, who had been the manager of the company from 1950 to March of 1953, described the difficulties caused to the operations by the noise of pile drivers and other equipment engaged in the construction of the pier and the footings, and of the congested conditions on the respondent's property created by the material and equipment of the contractors. This, he said, brought about difficulties for customers wishing to purchase material at the plant and resulted in the falling off of this business. The noise at times rendered it impossible to carry on conversations in the company's office. For the year commencing October 1, 1952, he said there was a drop in sales of over $100,000 from the preceding year, which he attributed to a general loss of efficiency and the interference with and disruption of the company's operations brought about by the construction of the bridge. Ekins had been employed by the company for many years and said that in his capacity as manager he usually spent from 70 to 75 per cent of his time in supervising and directing sales and the promotion of sales and that the time he had available for this purpose was cut in half by reason of his energies being diverted to other matters arising by reason of the work of construction. He said that normally there were from two to three dozen pick-up sales a day but that these fell off completely.\nEvidence was given by Mrs. Margaret Hutchings, the assistant purchasing agent, and Miss Helen Burton, a secretary employed by the company, as to the disruption of the office work caused by the noise and the disturbance and that it was necessary to engage taxis to bring some of the female members of the staff to work.\nGeorge Thompson, the shipper for the company, described the difficult conditions created by the contractor's operations and the moving of the office and said that the shipping room had been blockaded for a day on one occasion and the stock room flooded with water, and that they could not give proper service to their customers in Vancouver.\nJames Randall, a salesman for the company for some fifteen years, said that there was a decrease in the sales made by him in the years 1952 to 1954, which he attributed to his inability to give good service to the customers and which, he said, resulted in the loss of business. There were, he said, constant complaints about poor delivery and service.\nHarold J. McMullin, the office manager of the company, said that the noise of the operations at times caused an entire disruption of the work of the staff and that the efficiency of the staff was materially impaired.\nD. A. McLean, who succeeded Ekins as manager in March of 1953, said that, nearly every day during the period of the construction, traffic on the island was tied up for varying periods, and that, in his opinion, the decrease in the company's sales during the years 1953 and 1954 was attributable to the disruption and disturbance caused by the construction operations. He said that it was of particular importance in the paint business that the manager should devote a large part of his time to the promotion of sales and working with the salesmen and that he normally spent two-thirds of his time on these activities and that he was only able to spend about one-half of this time on such work during the years 1953 and 1954. He also said there was a big increase in the company's sales and resulting profits in the year 1955 when the bridge had been completed. A number of witnesses were called for the City, for the purpose of showing that the falling off of the company's business had been due to other matters unconnected in any way with the bridge. It was also shown that during part of the period there had been a carpenter strike in Vancouver which brought great numbers of operations to a standstill, which would obviously affect the company's business.\nIn my opinion, the evidence of these witnesses and the documents produced by the company's auditor show that the profits of the respondent were diminished during the period of construction and there was evidence from which, if believed, the arbitrators could conclude that the diminution was due to the carrying on of the construction work and the interference with the company's operations.\nThe obligation of the City under the agreement of November 10, 1952, was to indemnify the respondent against any loss or damage attributable to the construction of the bridge. It was apparently common ground that the work would, of necessity, cause damage to the respondent since one of the recitals in the agreement read:\nAnd whereas the use of the portion of the property as above recited will cause certain loss to the company.\nThere is nothing in the agreement to indicate that the parties contemplated that the existence of such damage or its extent should be determined by the arbitrators upon evidence differing in its nature from that which has always been accepted, by way of illustration, in claims for injurious affection resulting from the expropriation of part of an owner's claim. A claim of this nature is considered in the judgment of this Court delivered by Duff J. (as he then was) in St. Michael's College v. City of Toronto[12], where the matters to be considered in determining the quantum of the compensation are indicated. It would obviously be impossible that such a claim could be proven by evidence of the nature required to prove what are commonly designated as special damages in an action for tort. The fact that the appellant was permitted by the agreement to enter upon and carry on its operations upon the respondent's leasehold property and was, accordingly, not a wrong doer cannot affect the nature of the proof required of the damage or loss suffered and for which compensation was to be made. It is commonly the case where lands upon which the owner is actively carrying on business are expropriated that it is necessary to estimate the damage sustained by the dislocation of the business, due to the necessity of moving it to other quarters. While the quantum of the damage cannot be determined with mathematical accuracy, it has never been suggested that this prevents an award based upon evidence that loss actually has resulted from the enforced taking of the nature of that given in the present matter.\nHere there is evidence, in my opinion, upon which the arbitrators might base their award of damages for loss of profit and, in the absence of a contention that any of the evidence upon which the arbitrators relied was improperly admitted, we cannot concern ourselves further with this aspect of the matter. This is not an appeal from the award and the proceedings upon a motion such as this are not in the nature of a rehearing, as was the case in Cedar Rapids v. Lacoste[13]. In that case the expropriation was made under the provisions of the Railway Act, R.S.C. 1906, c. 37, which by s. 209 provided that where the award exceeded a stated amount any party might appeal upon any question of law or fact to a superior court: Lacoste v. Cedar Rapids[14]. This fact is noted in that portion of the judgment of the Judicial Committee in the second appeal in that matter[15], to which we were referred on the argument. We cannot in the present proceedings weigh the evidence or interfere with the award on any such ground as that it is against the weight of the evidence.\nAs to the contention that the award is rendered uncertain by reason of the manner in which the amounts claimed as special damages were dealt with by the arbitrators, I agree with Davey J.A. In my view, that portion of the award which I have quoted above is properly construed as meaning that such portion of the $8,275.09 claimed as is not properly taxable as costs in the manner directed, is included in the sum of $40,000 awarded. The matter left to the taxing officer is not to decide what portion of the amount claimed is to be allowed as compensation but simply which of the items are properly allowable as costs of the proceedings: the items excluded are by virtue of the award included in the lump sum awarded.\nI would dismiss this appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the plaintiff, appellant: E.

However, such buyer is not entitled to consequential or special damages for loss over and above that difference, when such loss was not one directly and naturally resulting, in the ordinary course of events, from the breach of warranty, but one resulting from the use made by the buyer of the goods with full knowledge of their quality.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario1, reversing a judgment of Spence J. Appeal dismissed.\nB. Grossberg, Q.C., for the plaintiff, appellant.\nA. E. Moloney, Q.C., for the defendant, respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by Judson J.:\u2014The appellant sued the respondent for damages for breach of warranty arising from a contract for the sale of sand fill. The appellant accepted 831 loads of this fill and spread it in the basement of a building which it had under construction. It then refused to accept further deliveries and sued for damages. The respondent counterclaimed for $4,155, being the contract price for the 831 loads at $5 per load. The judgment at trial awarded the appellant damages of $5,466.99. On the counterclaim, judgment was given for $1,925, being the contract price for 385 loads out of 831, which, according to the learned trial judge, were in substantial compliance with the contract. The breach of warranty was therefore successfully set up in extinction of the price for 446 loads. The Court of Appeal2 allowed the appeal and dismissed the action. The respondent abandoned his appeal against the amount awarded on the counterclaim. The appellant now appeals to this Court from the dismissal of its action.\nThe question in issue is whether the appellant in the circumstances of this case is entitled to recover consequential damages for breach of warranty over and above the ordinary measure of the difference in values between the goods contracted for and those delivered and accepted. In my opinion there can be no such recovery here and the appeal fails for the reasons given in the majority judgment of the Court of Appeal.\nLaidlaw J.A. accepted the finding of the learned trial judge that the parties entered into a contract for the supply of a good grade of sand fill but not the finding that the contract was for such fill to the extent necessary to fill up the foundation of the building. On the contrary, his conclusion, with which I agree, was that the contract was not an entire one but was a sale by the respondent and a purchase by the appellant of each separate load. The superintendent of the appellant accepted the loads as they were brought on the premises and dumped into the building. The nature of the fill was plain to be seen as it was delivered load by load and the case was not one for consequential damages. Damages in diminution of the price had already been awarded by the reduction of the counterclaim from $4,155 to $1,925. The appellant was engaged in the construction of an addition to an existing industrial building in the Township of Scarborough. It had excavated a basement with an area of approximately 40,000 square feet and had poured the concrete walls to a height of four feet above ground level. It proposed to put in the fill and then to erect the steel frame, walls and roof, install the services and, finally, pour the concrete floor. The respondent, having purchased 10 acres of vacant land in the Township of Scarborough, proposed to remove a hill from this property for the purpose of making it saleable and it was from this hill that the sand fill was to come to supply the contract. The respondent and the president of the appellant met at the site of the sand hill for the purpose of inspection and they there agreed upon a price of $5 per load. There is no doubt that the appellant knew that the sand was to come from this hill. There was no other possible source. Although there is much to be said for the inference that what the appellant bought was sand fill as it might be encountered by the shovel during the course of the removal of the hill, for the purpose of these reasons I take the finding of the learned trial judge, also adopted by Laidlaw J.A. in the Court of Appeal, that the contract was for the supply of a good grade of sand fill.\nThe respondent began delivering loads of the fill on September 16, 1955, and continued until October 21, 1955, when the appellant refused to accept further deliveries. From September 16 to September 30, 483 loads were delivered, and from October 1 to October 21, 348 loads. As each load was delivered it was dumped in the excavation and spread by a bulldozer and then rolled and watered to provide a firm foundation for the concrete floor. The appellant's superintendent of construction, or someone acting for him, signed for all the loads as they arrived at the site. The condition of each load was plain to be seen, both in the truck and after it had been dumped in the excavation. Everything that was delivered was spread and used. The superintendent of the appellant said that the first 150 loads were of good quality but that subsequent loads began to contain a mixture of sand and clay. He made some complaints to the truck drivers and when about half of the quantity had been delivered, he made a complaint to the respondent. He said that the respondent promised that the quality would improve. The appellant rejected no deliveries until October 21, when three loads were rejected. No further loads were delivered by the respondent. The appellant purchased the rest of the fill that it needed from another source.\nThe month of October was a wet month. The excavation was still uncovered and the rain turned the fill into a quagmire, which later froze in the month of November. In February, 1956, the appellant began to remove this frozen mass after being put to considerable expense to make it workable. Some of the fill was removed and it was replaced by about 100 loads of sand fill purchased from another source.\nThe appellant's first contention is that it did not accept these goods and that, at most, there was a mere receipt. In spite of continual grumbling about the deterioration in the quality of the loads, the appellant spread the material in the basement and subjected it to a certain amount of treatment in order to provide a firm foundation for the concrete floor. In these circumstances, it seems to me to be beyond argument, and it has been so found both by the trial judge and in the Court of Appeal, that there was an acceptance of these goods within the meaning of s. 34 of the Sale of Goods Act and that the appellant's claim must, in consequence, be confined to damages for breach of warranty.\nSections 51 and 52 of the Act read:\n51. (1) Where there is a breach of warranty by the seller, or where the buyer elects, or is compelled, to treat any breach of a condition on the part of the seller as a breach of warranty, the buyer is not by reason only of such breach of warranty entitled to reject the goods, but he may,\n(a) set up against the seller the breach of warranty in diminution or extinction of the price; or\n(b) maintain an action against the seller for damages for the breach of warranty.\n(2) The measure of damages for breach of warranty is the estimated loss directly and naturally resulting in the ordinary course of events, from the breach of warranty.\n(3) In the case of breach of warranty of quality such loss is prima facie the difference between the value of the goods at the time of delivery to the buyer and the value they would have had if they had answered to the warranty.\n(4) The fact that the buyer has set up the breach of warranty in diminution or extinction of the price does not prevent him from maintaining an action for the same breach of warranty if he has suffered further damage. 52. Nothing in this Act shall affect the right of the buyer or the seller to recover interest or special damages in any case where by law interest or special damages may be recoverable, or to recover money paid where the consideration for the payment of it has failed.\nThe Act deals only with general damages and merely saves the law relating to the right of the buyer to recover special damages. In the present case, the learned trial judge has found that the breach of warranty is one of quality. The Court of Appeal has accepted this finding. The loss is therefore governed by subs. (3) of s. 51 and this has been fully covered in the counterclaim. The ratio of the majority judgment of the Court of Appeal is that the appellant is not entitled to consequential or special damages because its loss was not one directly and naturally resulting, in the ordinary course of events, from the breach of warranty, but one resulting from the use made by the appellant of the goods with full knowledge of their quality. The goods might have been rejected load by load if they were not in accordance with the contract. Instead of doing this the appellant accepted almost 700 loads after beginning to complain about quality. Whatever loss the buyer suffered resulted from its failure to mitigate its damage. It chose to use the goods with knowledge of the risk to be run from adverse weather conditions before the roof was on the building. In these circumstances, a buyer is not entitled to consequential or special damages. I adopt the statement of law on this point from Benjamin on Sale, 8th ed., p. 1005:\nTo enable a buyer, who has resold or otherwise dealt with the goods, to recover consequential damages for a breach of warranty over and above the ordinary measure of the difference in values, it is necessary that the buyer should not have been negligent in failing to detect the inferiority of the goods before he resells or deals with them, for otherwise the damages claimed do not \"directly and naturally\" result from the seller's breach of warranty, but are due to the buyer's own negligence. The circumstance that the defect in the goods is not readily discoverable is of course very material.\nStatements to the same effect are to be found in 29 Halsbury, 2nd ed., p. 203; Williston on Sales, Revised ed., vol. 3, s. 490; and in Merrill v. Waddell3. The appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the plaintiff, appellant: Levinter, Grossberg, Shapiro, Mayzel & Dryden, Toronto.\nSolicitors for the defendant, respondent: Moloney & Hess, Toronto.\n1 (1959), 19 D.L.R.

(Plaintiffs) Respondents.\n1960: February 3; 1960: April 11.\nPresent: Kerwin, C.J. and Locke, Cartwright, Martland and Judson JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR BRITISH COLUMBIA\nExpropriation\u2014Whether injurious affection by severance to be included in compensation for land taken\u2014Interest on total award\u2014The Highway Act, R.S.B.C. 1948, c. 144, s. 16\u2014The Lands Clauses Act, R.S.B.C. 1948, c. 177, ss. 4, 64.\nUnder the provisions of the Highway Act, R.S.B.C. 1948, c. 144, the appellant took compulsory possession of the lands owned by the respondents. The compensation tendered was refused, and a subsequent arbitration made awards for the lands taken only, but refused compensation for damage sustained by reason of the severance of the respondents' lands from other lands owned by them. The trial judge held that compensation for the severance was properly payable, and this judgment was affirmed by a majority decision of the Court of Appeal. The Minister appealed to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nPer Kerwin C.J. and Cartwright and Martland JJ.: The principle applied in the precedents was that where a statute requires compensation to be paid for lands compulsorily taken, one element to be included in determining the compensation is the damage sustained by the owner by reason of injurious affection to his adjoining lands, because of the severance of the lands taken. Blundell v. The King, [1905] 1 K.B. 516 and The Master and Fellows of University College, Oxford v. The Secretary of State for Air, [1938] 1 K.B. 648, applied. Such compensation was not excluded by s. 16 of the Highway Act. The right to claim such compensation was reinforced by s. 64 of the Lands Clauses Act, the application of which was not excluded by s. 16 of the Highway Act by necessary intendment.\nAll the interest awarded to the respondents, including that given in respect of amounts awarded for injurious affection, was in place of their right to retain possession of their lands and could properly be given as against the Crown. Inglewood Pulp and Paper Company Ltd. v. New Brunswick Power Commission, [1928] A.C. 492 at 498; The King v. Mackay, [1930] S.C.R. 130 at 132, followed.\nPer Locke and Judson JJ.: The amount of compensation to be paid was that provided for by s. 16 of the Highway Act. It was the value of the land to the owner with all the advantages which it possessed, present or future, in his hands which was to be determined. If the ownership of the lands taken enhanced the value of the lands from which they were to be severed, the extent of such enhancement was part of the value to the owner of the lands taken. The extent to which the value of the respondents' remaining land was depreciated by the taking of the lands in question was a matter to be taken into consideration in fixing the amount of compensation.

S. Maguire and D. H. Paterson, for the appellant.\nJ. J. Robinette, Q.C., and J. S. Alley, for the respondent.\nThe judgment of Kerwin C.J. and of Cartwright and Martland JJ. was delivered by\nMARTLAND J.:\u2014The main issue in this appeal is as to whether or not the respondents are entitled, in respect of lands owned by them, possession of which had been compulsorily taken by the appellant under the provisions of the Highway Act, R.S.B.C. 1948, c. 144, to compensation for the damage sustained and to be sustained by them by reason of the severing of the lands taken from other lands owned by them. The lands in question are situated in the Municipality of West Vancouver and were taken for the purpose of establishing a public road through the municipality, known as the \"Upper Levels Highway\", from West Vancouver to Horse Shoe Bay.\nCompensation for these lands was tendered by the appellant to the respondents, which was refused by them as being inadequate. The parties then proceeded to arbitration, pursuant to the provisions of s. 16 of the Highway Act and the provisions of the Department of Highways Act, 1955 (B.C.), c. 33. Awards were made to each of the respondents by the arbitrators, together with interest from March 10, 1954, the date upon which possession of the lands had been taken by the appellant.\nThe arbitrators stated that the amounts awarded were compensation for the lands taken only. They found that the provisions of the Lands Clauses Act, R.S.B.C. 1948, c. 177, and in particular s. 64 thereof, did not apply to the Highway Act, as in their opinion the provisions of the former act were excluded therefrom by necessary intendment. However, in the event that a court of competent jurisdiction should decide that they were in error in that opinion, the arbitrators made an appraisal of the damage sustained by the respondents, by reason of the severance of their lands, in the following amounts, namely:\n1. British Pacific Properties Ltd\n$12,522.35\n2. Vancouver Mortgage Corporation Ltd.\n$17,480.00\n3. Westmount Estates Limited\n$18,885.00\nThe respondents filed an originating summons for determination of this question of law and the learned trial judge awarded to the respondents the additional amounts of compensation above mentioned. This judgment was sustained by the Court of Appeal of British Columbia by a majority decision, from which the appellant has now appealed.\nThe relevant statutory provisions which require to be considered are s. 16 of the Highway Act and ss. 4 and 64 of the Lands Clauses Act. Subsections (1), (2) and (3) of s. 16 of the Highway Act are as follows:\n16. (1) Compensation shall be paid in respect of lands entered upon and taken possession of under this Part for the following matters only:\u2014\n(a)Improvements on the lands so taken, that is to say, everything constructed on or annexed to the soil by the hand of man, such as roads, buildings, structures, and fences, and improvements made by clearing, planting, grading, or cultivating the soil:\n(b) Lands which were originally granted to some person by the Crown, either in the right of the Province or the Dominion, and by the taking of which the total area taken for the purpose of highways from the lands comprised in the original Crown grant is found to exceed one-twentieth of the total area of the lands comprised in the Crown grant, and then only for the area in excess of one-twentieth of that total area; but, where the lands comprised in the Crown grant have been subdivided into parcels by any registered conveyance or plan of subdivision, the area of land which may be so taken from any parcel without the payment of compensation shall not exceed one-twentieth of the area of that parcel, and where lands are being taken from two or more of the parcels at the same time the total area to be so taken without the payment of compensation shall be apportioned among those parcels on the basis of their respective areas.\n(2) If the amount of compensation payable in any case under subsection (1) is not agreed upon, the amount may be appraised and awarded by arbitration, and for that purpose the provisions of the \"Department of Highways Act\" relating to arbitration shall mutatis mutandis apply.\n(3) In determining the compensation payable to any owner in respect of any land entered upon and taken possession of under this Part, there shall be taken into consideration the increased value, beyond the increased value common to all lands in the locality, that will be given to the remaining lands of the owner through which the highway will pass, by reason of the passage of the highway through the same or by reason of the construction of the highway or of works incidental thereto, and the increased value that will be so given shall be set off against the compensation otherwise payable to that owner under this section.\nThe relevant portions of the Lands Clauses Act provide:\n4. This Act shall apply:\u2014\n***\n(b)To every undertaking authorized by any Act which authorizes the purchase or taking of lands situate in any part of the Province for such undertaking;\nand this Act shall be incorporated with every such Act to which this Act shall as aforesaid apply, and all the clauses and provisions of this Act, save so far as they shall be expressly varied or excepted by any such Act, shall apply to the undertaking authorized thereby, so far as the same shall be applicable to such undertaking, and shall, as well as the clauses and provisions of every other Act which shall be incorporated with such Act, form part of such Act, and be construed, together therewith, as forming one Act.\n*** 64. In estimating the purchase-money or compensation to be paid by the promoters of the undertaking in any of the cases aforesaid, regard shall be had by the Justices, arbitrators, or surveyors, as the case may be, not only to the value of the land to be purchased or taken by the promoters of the undertaking, but also to the damage (if any) to be sustained by the owner of the lands by reason of the severing of the lands taken from the other lands of such owner, or otherwise injuriously affecting such other lands by the exercise of the powers of this or the special Act, or any Act incorporated therewith.\nIt is not contested by the appellant that, if the provisions of the Lands Clauses Act are applicable at all, the taking of the lands in question by the appellant was for an \"undertaking\" within the meaning of s. 4 of that Act. The appellant contends, however, that the provisions of that statute, and in particular s. 64, are not applicable in the circumstances of this case because they have been excluded by the terms of s. 16 of the Highway Act. The respondents claim that the provisions of the Lands Clauses Act are not thus excluded and that, by virtue of s. 64 of that Act, they are entitled to receive the additional compensation as appraised by the arbitrators. There would appear to be no doubt that if s. 64 is applicable, the respondents would be entitled to such compensation and the question is, therefore, as to whether or not that section does apply.\nBy virtue of s. 4 of the Lands Clauses Act, s. 64 of this Act would apply save so far as its provisions are expressly varied or excepted by the Highway Act. There is no express reference to the Lands Clauses Act in the Highway Act and, consequently, it is necessary to determine whether they can be regarded as having been excluded, by necessary intendment, because of the provisions of s. 16 of the latter statute.\nThe test to be applied was stated by Westbury, L.C., in ex parte The Vicar and Church Wardens of St. Sepulchre in re The Westminster Bridge Act, 1859[2], where the Lord Chancellor had to determine whether the provisions of the English Lands Clauses Act, 1845 (which contained a provision similar to s. 4 of the British Columbia Act) were excluded by the provisions of the statute there under consideration. It is as follows:\nIf the particular act gives in itself a complete rule on the subject, the expression of that rule would undoubtedly amount to an exception of the subject-matter of the rule out of the Lands Clauses Act. This statement was approved in the case of The London, Chatham and Dover Railway Company v. The Board of Works for the Wandsworth Distric[3]t.\nThe contention of the appellant is that s. 16 of the Highway Act does, in itself, give a complete rule on the subject and that by virtue of that section compensation is to be paid only for improvements on the lands entered and of which possession is taken, and for lands, which were originally granted by the Crown in the right of the Province or of the Dominion, to the extent that the area of the lands entered and of which possession is taken exceeds one-twentieth of the total area comprised in the grant from the Crown. Those, it is said, are the only matters in respect of which compensation is payable and payment of damage, in respect of any other land, is excluded by the necessary intendment of the section.\nThe respondents' answer to this is that when land is compulsorily taken and damage is thereby sustained by the owner, by reason of the severance of such land from other lands of that owner, that damage is a part of the value of the lands which are actually taken and for which compensation must be paid. It is contended that when s. 16 of the Highway Act directs that \"compensation shall be paid in respect of lands entered upon and taken possession of under this Part\" such compensation is included.\nTwo cases cited on behalf of the respondents support this contention. They are Blundell v. The King[4] and The Master and Fellows of University College, Oxford v. The Secretary of State for Air[5]. In the former case, lands were compulsorily taken under the Defence Acts for the erection of a fort. Section 19 of the Defence Act, 1842, required the person determining the compensation \"to find the compensation to be paid either for the purchase of such lands, buildings, and other hereditaments, or for the possession or use thereof \u2026\" There was no provision in this statute similar to that contained in s. 63 of the English Lands Clauses Act (the equivalent of s. 64 of the British Columbia Lands Clauses Act). Nevertheless, Ridley J. held that the owner was entitled to compensation for the injurious affection of his adjoining lands arising from the natural and ordinary uses of the lands taken for the purposes of the fort.\nAt p. 522, he says:\nOn the other side it was argued that \"compensation\" means an indemnity\u2014a full satisfaction for the land taken, and that, if in the taking of that land other land is injuriously affected, that injurious affection must be included in the term. If such a claim were decided by agreement, I think there is no doubt that no person would agree on the compensation due for his land to be taken without also adding to the actual purchase-money a claim in respect of the damages done by injurious affection of other land belonging to him; and it is fairly argued that the same elements must be included when a jury or an arbitrator has to assess the compensation. It is also to be remarked that s. 63 of the Lands Clauses Act does, in fact, treat such injurious affection as a part of the compensation to be given, for it enacts that \"in assessing such compensation 'regard is to be had' not only to the value of the land but also to the damage,\" &c. And in the same section, \"compensation\" is apparently used as equivalent to \"purchase-money\"\u2014so that the damages to be given for injurious affection are treated as a matter to be included in the purchase-money. I am inclined myself to prefer this reasoning, although I am somewhat pressed with the consequence which seems to follow, that even without s. 63 compensation under the Lands Clauses Act, 1845, would have included damages for injurious affection.\nThe decision of Ridley J. was stated to be right by Lord Hewart C.J., who delivered the unanimous judgment of the Court in the University College case.\nThe principle applied in these cases is that where a statute requires compensation to be paid for lands compulsorily taken, one element to be included, in determining the compensation for the lands taken, is in respect of damage sustained by the owner, by reason of injurious affection to his adjoining lands, because of the severance.\nThat element must, I think, be taken into account when applying the broad general principle governing the assessment of compensation to owners of property expropriated by the Crown which was enunciated by Rand J. in Diggon-Hibben Ltd. v. The King[6], and expressly adopted in the judgment of this Court in Woods Manufacturing Co. Ltd. v. The King[7]:\n\u2026the owner at the moment of expropriation is to be deemed as without title, but all else remaining the same, and the question is what would he, as a prudent man, at that moment, pay for the property rather than be ejected from it. Section 16(1) of the Highway Act requires compensation to be paid for lands entered upon and taken \"for the following matters only\", those matters being, under paragraph (a), for improvements and, under paragraph (b), for lands, but limiting the compensation for the latter item to the area in excess of one-twentieth of the total area comprised in the Crown grant. I do not think that these paragraphs restrict the elements which are to be considered in determining the compensation for lands taken. They restrict the area of land in respect of which compensation is to be paid. The word \"only\" refers to \"matters\" and not to the word \"paid\".\nIn my opinion, therefore, in computing the compensation to be paid for lands taken by the appellant pursuant to the provisions of the Highway Act, damage sustained by the land owner by reason of the severance of the lands taken from other lands owned by him is a part of the compensation to be given for such lands. Such compensation is not excluded by s. 16. The right to claim such compensation is reinforced by s. 64 of the Lands Clauses Act, the application of which is not, on my interpretation of s. 16, excluded by that section by necessary intendment.\nThe second issue is with respect to the award, by the learned trial judge, of interest from March 10, 1954, upon the amounts of compensation appraised by the arbitrators in respect of the severance of the respondents' lands. On this point, the appellant argued that an award of interest as against the Crown could not be made. Interest was awarded by the arbitrators on the amounts of compensation which they had determined, and there is no issue with respect to that interest award. In my view, the interest in question here upon the amounts awarded in respect of injurious affection is in the same position as the interest which they awarded. All the interest awarded to the respondents is in place of their right to retain possession of their lands and could properly be given as against the Crown. Inglewood Pulp and Paper Company, Limited v. New Brunswick Electric Power Commission[8]; The King v. MacKay[9]. Certain preliminary objections raised on behalf of the appellant before Collins J. and referred to by him were abandoned in this Court. The point that costs could not be awarded against the appellant was decided adversely to the appellant by all the judges in the Courts below, and it also was abandoned before us.\nIn my opinion, therefore, the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nThe judgment of Locke and Judson JJ. was delivered by\nLOCKE J.:\u2014The question as to whether, in determining the amounts of the compensation to be paid to the respondents for the lands taken, there should be included an allowance for injurious affection to the balance of their land at the place in question, does not, in my opinion, depend upon the provisions of s. 64 of the Lands Clauses Act, R.S.B.C. 1948, c. 177.\nThe amount to be paid is that provided for by s. 16 of the Highway Act, R.S.B.C. 1948, c. 144. The compensation referred to in that section is for the lands taken, subject to any deduction that is to be made under the provisions of s-s. (b), and for improvements of the nature described in s-s. (a) of that section.\nIn my opinion, the principles which have been applied in proceedings under the Railway Act, R.S.C. 1906, c. 37, which were considered in the judgment of the Judicial Committee in Cedar Rapids Manufacturing and Power Co. v. Lacoste[10], and in proceedings under the Expropriation Act, R.S.C. 1927, c. 64, considered in Woods Manufacturing Co. Ltd. v. The King[11], are applicable.\nIt is the value of the land to the owner with all the advantages which it possessed, present or future, in his hands which is to be determined. The authorities are reviewed in the judgment of the former Chief Justice of this Court in the Woods Manufacturing Company case. What was said by Lord Moulton in delivering the judgment of the Judicial Committee in Pastoral Finance Association v. The Minister[12] has been adopted and followed in this Court. The owner is entitled to receive as compensation for the land taken that amount which a prudent man in his position would have been willing to give for the land sooner than fail to obtain it.\nIf the ownership of the lands taken enhances the value of the lands from which they are to be severed, the extent of such enhancement is part of the value to the owner of the lands taken.\nThe extent to which the value of the present respondents' remaining land was depreciated by the taking of the lands in question was a matter to be taken into consideration in fixing the amount of the compensation allowable under s. 16 of the Highway Act.\nAs I consider this to be decisive of the matter I express no opinion as to whether s. 64 of the Lands Clauses Act affects in any way the quantum of the compensation to be allowed under s. 16 of the Highway Act.\nIt was part of the award made that the appellant should pay to the respondents interest at the rate of 5% from the date upon which the lands were taken, and Collins J. directed that interest at this rate be paid upon the compensation, including in the amounts an allowance for injurious affection. The appellant contended before the Court of Appeal and in this Court that no interest should be payable upon that portion of the compensation which was allowed for injurious affection, while not questioning that it should properly be paid upon the amounts found payable by the arbitrators. Since, however, in my opinion, the portion of the compensation awarded in each case for injurious affection to the remaining lands of the respondents forms part of the value to the owners of the lands taken, the basis for the objection disappears.\nI would dismiss this appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Clark, Wilson, White, Clark & Maguire, Vancouver.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Davis & Company, Vancouver.\n[1] (1960), 20 D.L.R.

Act, 1867, s. 91(21)\u2014The Bankruptcy Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 14.\nThe Orderly Payment of Debts Act, 1959 (Alta.), c. 61, applies, with certain exceptions, to contract and judgment debts not in excess of $1,000 and, with the consent of the creditors, to judgment debts in excess of $1,000. Proceedings are instituted by the debtor applying to the clerk of the Court for a consolidation order. This application of the debtor must be supported by an affidavit setting forth, inter alia, particulars of his debts, of the nature and extent of his property, his and his wife's income and his dependants. The clerk settles the amount proposed to be paid by the debtor periodically or otherwise. The consolidation order, when made, becomes a judgment of the Court in favour of each creditor. After the making of the order, no process can be issued against the debtor, except as permitted by the Act or by leave of the Court.\nOn a reference as to the validity of the Act, the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta held that it was ultra vires the Legislature of the Province. The appeal of the Attorney-General for Alberta to this Court was supported by the Attorneys-General for Ontario and Saskatchewan.\nHeld: The Act was ultra vires.\nPer Kerwin C.J. and Taschereau, Fauteux, Abbott, Judson and Ritchie JJ.: The Act was ultra vires as it was in pith and substance bankruptcy and insolvency legislation. The provisions of the Act could be read in no other way than showing that they referred to a debtor who was unable to pay his debts as they matured. A debtor under the Act -was one who ceased to meet his liabilities as they became due and, therefore, fell within s. 21(1) (j) of the Bankruptcy Act. The impugned legislation was not legislation for the recovery of debts.\nPer Locke, Cartwright and Martland JJ.: While the Act does not declare in terms that the debtor must be insolvent in the sense that he is unable to pay his debts as they become due, it must be so construed. It is, therefore, a clear invasion of the legislative field of insolvency and is, accordingly, beyond the powers of the Legislature. Compositions and schemes of arrangement have for more than 100 years past been treated as subject-matters falling within the scope of statutes relating to bankruptcy and insolvency. The provisions of the impugned Act are in conflict with those in the legislation passed by Parliament dealing with the same matters in the Bankruptcy Act and the Farmers' Creditors Arrangement Act. The language of s. 91 of the B.N.A. Act, 1867, is that the exclusive legislative power of the Parliament extends to all matters in relation to, inter alia, bankruptcy and insolvency, and the provinces are excluded from that field. A.G. for Ontario v. A.G. of Canada, [1894] A.C. 189, distinguished. Per: Cartwright and Martland JJ.: In all the decisions of the Judicial Committee or of this Court, upholding provincial legislation impugned as affecting the rights and obligations of an insolvent entity and its creditors, two conditions have been found to exist: (1) that the legislation was not in truth and substance primarily in relation to bankruptcy and insolvency but rather in relation to one or more of the matters found in s. 92; and (2) that it was not in conflict with existing valid legislation of Parliament enacted in exercise of the power contained in s. 91(21), in so far as it affected the rights and obligations of an insolvent and its creditors. Neither of these conditions. exists in this case.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Supreme Court of Alberta, Appellate Division1, on a reference by the Lieutenant-Governor in Council. Appeal dismissed.\nH. J. Wilson, Q.C. and J. W. Anderson, for the appellant, the Attorney-General for Alberta.\nL. Ingle, for the intervenant, the Attorney-General for Saskatchewan.\nW. McKimm, for the intervenant, the Attorney-General for Ontario.\nG. H. Steer, Q.C, counsel appointed by the Court to represent the creditors or other persons opposed to the legislation.\nThe judgment of Kerwin C.J. and of Taschereau, Fauteux, Abbott, Judson and Ritchie JJ. was delivered by\nThe Chief Justice:\u2014Under the provisions of The Constitutional Questions Act, R.S.A. 1955, c. 55, the Lieutenant-Governor in Council of the Province of Alberta referred to the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of the Province2 the following question for hearing and consideration:\nIs The Orderly Payment of Debts Act, being Chapter 61 of the Statutes of Alberta, 1959, intra vires the Legislature of Alberta, either in whole or in part, and if so, in what part or parts, and to what extent?\nThat Court directed that argument of the question be set down for hearing at its sittings to be held in Calgary commencing. June 1, 1959, and that a copy of that direction and of the Order-in-Council and of the Act be served upon\n(1) Canadian Bankers Association;\n(2) Credit Granter's Association of Edmonton;\n(3) Retail Merchants Association of Canada (Alberta) Inc.; (4) Canadian Credit Men's Trust Association Ltd.;\n(5) Canadian Consumer Loan Association (Canada);\n(6) Attorney-General of Canada.\nGeorge H. Steer, Esq., Q.C., was appointed as counsel to argue the case on behalf of creditors or other persons who might be opposed to the provisions of the Act. At the hearing counsel for the Attorney General for the Province and one counsel for three credit associations appeared to uphold the Act while Mr. Steer presented argument against its validity. No one else appeared, although the others mentioned above were duly notified. Judgment was reserved and the Court consisting of the Chief Justice, H. J. Macdonald, M. M. Porter and H. G. Johnson, J.J.A., unanimously decided that the Act was wholly ultra vires the Legislature of the Province.\nThe Attorney General for Alberta appealed to this Court. In accordance with the Rules notice was duly served upon the Attorney General of Canada and by direction notice was also served upon the Attorney General for each of the other provinces. Before us counsel for the Attorney General for Ontario and for the Attorney General for Saskatchewan supported the appeal. No one else appeared except Mr. Steer On behalf of the three provinces it was submitted, as apparently it was argued in the Appellate Division, that the Act was within the legislative competence of the Province of Alberta under Heads 13, 14 and 16 of s. 92 of the British North America Act, 1867:\n13 Property and Civil Rights in thet Province.\n14 The Administration of Justice in the Province, including the Constitution, Maintenance, and Organization of Provincial Courts, both of Civil and of Criminal Jurisdiction and including Procedure in Civil Matters in those Courts.\n16 Generally all Matters of a merely local or private nature in the Province.\nMr. Steer contended that the subject matter of the Act dealt with bankruptcy and insolvency and was therefore within the sole competence of the legislative authority of the Parliament of Canada under Head 21 of s. 91 of the British North America Act. He also contended it was ultra vires because it encroached upon the following heads of s. 91 of that Act:\n15. Banking, incorporation of Banks and the issue of Paper Money. 18. Bills of Exchange and Promissory Notes.\n19. Interest.\nand because it gives to the clerk of a District Court the powers of a judge contrary to the provisions of s. 96 of the British North America Act.\nI agree with the Appellate Division that the Act is ultra vires on the ground that in pith and substance it is bankruptcy and insolvency legislation and that it is therefore unnecessary to consider the other grounds of attack.\nSection 3 of The Orderly Payment of Debts Act provides:\n3. (1) This Act applies only\n(a) to a judgment for the payment of money where the amount of the judgment does not exceed one thousand dollars,\n(b) to a judgment for the payment of money in excess of one thousand dollars if the creditor consents to come under this Act, and\n(c) to a claim for money, demand for debt, account, covenant or otherwise, not in excess of one thousand dollars.\n(2) This Act does not apply to a debt due, owing or payable to the Crown or a municipality or relating to the public revenue or one that may be levied and collected in the form of taxes or, unless the creditor consents to come under this Act,\n(a) to a claim for wages that may be heard before, or a judgment therefor by, a magistrate under The Masters and Servants Act,\n(b) to a claim for a lien or a judgment thereon under The Mechanics Lien Act, or\n(c) to a claim for a lien under The Garagemen's Lien Act.\n(3) This Act does not apply to debts incurred by a trader or merchant in the usual course of his business.\nProvision is then made whereby a debtor may apply to the clerk of the District Court of the judicial district in which he resides for a consolidation order, showing by affidavit all his creditors together with the amount he owes to each one, his income from all sources and, if he is married, the amount of the income of his wife, the number of persons dependent upon him, the amount payable for board or lodging or rent or as payment on home property and whether any of his creditors' claims are secured, and if so, the nature and particulars of the security held by each. The clerk is to settle an amount proposed to be paid by the debtor into court periodically or otherwise on account of the claims of his creditors and provide for hearing objections by the latter. After such a hearing, if necessary, a consolidation order is to be made, which order is a judgment of the Court in favour of each creditor, and provision is made for a review by the Court of any such order.\nSections 12, 13 and 14 are important and read as follows:\n12. The court may, in deciding any matter brought before it, impose such terms on a debtor with respect to the custody of his property or any disposition thereof or of the proceeds thereof as it deems proper to protect the registered creditors and may give such directions for the purpose as the circumstances require.\n13. Upon the making of a consolidation order no process shall be issued in any court against the debtor at the instance of a registered creditor or a creditor to whom this Act applies\n(a) except as permitted by this Act or the regulations, or\n(b) except by leave of the court.\n14. (1) The clerk may at any time require of, and take from, the debtor an assignment to himself as clerk of the court of any moneys due, owing or payable or to become due, owing or payable to the debtor or earned or to be earned by the debtor.\n(2) Unless otherwise agreed upon the clerk shall forthwith notify the person owing or about to owe the moneys of the assignment and all moneys collected thereon shall be applied to the credit of the claims against the debtor under the consolidation order.\n(3) The clerk may issue a writ of execution in respect of a consolidation order and cause it to be filed with the sheriff of a judicial district and at any land titles office.\nWhile the Act applies only to claims or judgments which do not exceed one thousand dollars, unless in the case of a judgment for the payment of money in excess of one thousand dollars the creditor consents to come under the Act, I can read these provisions in no other way than showing that they refer to a debtor who is unable to pay his debts as they mature. Why else is authority given the Court to impose terms with respect to the custody of his property or any disposition thereof or of the proceeds thereof as it deems proper to protect the registered creditors (s. 12) ? And why else may no process be issued in any court against the debtor at the instance of a registered creditor or a creditor to whom the Act applies, except as stated (s. 13)? Section 14 authorizing the clerk to require an assignment to him by the debtor of any monies due, owing or payable or to become due, owing or payable to the debtor, or earned or to be earned by the debtor is surely consonant only with the position of an insolvent debtor. In fact a debtor under the Act is ceasing to meet his liabilities generally as they become due and therefore falls within s. 20(1) (j) of the Bankruptcy Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 14.\nIn Attorney General for British Columbia v. Attorney General for Canada et al.3, Lord Thankerton speaking for the Judicial Committee states at p. 402:\nIn a general sense, insolvency means inability to meet one's debts or obligations; in a technical sense, it means the condition or standard of inability to meet debts or obligations, upon the occurrence of which the statutory law enables a creditor to intervene, with the assistance of a Court, to stop individual action by creditors and to secure administration of the debtor's assets in the general interest of creditors; the law also generally allows the debtor to apply for the same administration. The justification for such proceeding by a creditor generally consists in, an act of bankruptcy by the debtor, the conditions of which are defined and prescribed by the statute law.\nThis was said in an appeal affirming the decision of the majority of this Court in the Reference as to the Validity of The Farmers' Creditors Arrangement Act of the Dominion, as amended4.\nIn Canadian Bankers' Association v. Attorney General of Saskatchewan5, this Court held that The Moratorium Act of Saskatchewan was ultra vires as being in relation to insolvency. There the decision of the Judicial Committee in Abitibi Power and Paper Company v. The Montreal Trust Company6 was relied upon, but, for the reasons given by Mr. Justice Locke, it was held that it had no application. As was pointed out, the Judicial Committee in the 1943 case held that the purpose of the impugned legislation was to stay proceedings in the action brought under the mortgage granted by the Abitibi Company until the interested parties should have an opportunity of considering such plan for the re-organization of the company as might be submitted by a Royal Commission appointed for that purpose. For the same reason that decision is inapplicable here. The older decision of the Privy Council in Attorney General for Ontario v. The Attorney General of Canada7, dealing with The Ontario Assignments and Preference Act, is quite distinguishable, although in my view it is doubtful whether in view of later pronouncements of the Judicial Committee it would at this date be decided in the same sense, even in the absence of Dominion legislation upon the subject of bankruptcy and insolvency.\nThe Act in question is not legislation for the recovery of debts. It has no analogy to provincial bulk sales legislation because there the object is to make sure that when a person sells his stock of goods, wares, merchandise and chattels, ordinarily the subject of trade and commerce, the creditors will not be placed in any difficulty because of the disappearance of the proceeds of the sale. It is unnecessary to express any opinion as to the validity of s. 156 of The Division Courts Act of Ontario, R.S.O. 1950, apparently introduced for the first time in 1950 by c. 16 of the statutes of that year, which provides for a consolidation order.\nThe debtor under The Orderly Payment of Debts Act is not in the same position as the appellant in L'Union St. Jacques de Montr\u00e9al v. B\u00e9lisle8, and the appellant can gain no comfort from Ladore v. Bennett9, because there it was held that the City of Windsor (Amalgamation) Act, 1935 and Amendment were in pith and substance Acts passed in relation to \"municipal institutions in the Province\" and did not encroach upon the exclusive legislative power of the Dominion Parliament in relation to bankruptcy and insolvency, interest, or private rights outside the Province. This was a decision of the Judicial Committee affirming that of the Court of Appeal for Ontario10, which latter, in the meantime, had been applied by the Court of Appeal for British Columbia in Day v. Corporation of the City of Vancouver, McGavin and McMullen11. The legislation in question in each of these cases was quite different from the effort by Alberta in Board of Trustees of the Lethbridge Northern Irrigation District v. I.O.F.12.\nThe appeal should be dismissed.\nThe judgment of Locke and Martland JJ. was delivered by\nLocke J.:\u2014The Orderly Payment of Debts Act was passed by the Legislature of Alberta and appears as c. 61 of the Statutes of 1959. By s. 22 it is declared that the Act is to come into force on a date to be fixed by proclamation. We are informed that, pending the determination of this reference, it has not been proclaimed.\nIn my opinion of the various grounds upon which it is contended that the Act is ultra vires the legislature it is necessary to consider only that as to whether it infringes upon the exclusive jurisdiction of Parliament to make laws in relation to bankruptcy and insolvency under head 21 of s. 91.\nWhile \"bankruptcy\" and \"insolvent person\" are defined in s. 2 of the Bankruptcy Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 14, it is rather the meaning that these words commonly bear that is to be given to them in construing the words in s. 91. In Parker v. Gossage13, Parke B. said that an insolvent in the ordinary acceptation of the word is a person who cannot pay his debts. In Reg. v. Saddlers Company14, Willes J. adopted what had been said by Baron Parke as to the meaning assigned to the term \"insolvent\" and said that the words \"in insolvent circumstances\" had always been held to mean not merely being behind the world, if an account were taken, but insolvency to the extent of being unable to pay just debts in the ordinary course of trade and business.\nIn Attorney General of British Columbia v. Attorney General of Canada15, referring to the words in head 21, Lord Thankerton said that, in a generar sense, insolvency means inability to meet one's debts or obligations.\nWhen the Bankruptcy Act was first enacted in 1919 (c. 36) \"insolvent person\" and \"insolvent\" were declared to include a person who is for any reason unable to meet his obligations as they respectively become due, or who has ceased paying his current obligations in the ordinary course of business, thus substantially adopting what had been said by Parke B. and Willes J. The meaning commonly borne by the terms employed in head 21 of s. 91 did not differ in 1867 from their present day meaning. The statute to be considered does not refer in terms either to bankruptcy or insolvency and this, while not decisive, is a matter to be considered in determining the question as to what is its true nature.\nThe Act is declared by s. 3 to apply to a judgment not in excess of one thousand dollars, to a judgment in excess of that amount if the creditor consents to come under the Act and to a claim for money, demand for debt, account, covenant or otherwise, not in excess of one thousand dollars. Debts due to the Crown or to a municipality or relating to the public revenue, claims for wages that might be heard before a magistrate under the Masters and Servants Act, claims for a lien or a judgment thereon under the Mechanics Lien Act, claims for a lien under the Garagemen's Lien Act and debts incurred by a trader or merchant in the usual course of business are exempted from the operation of the Act.\nAs is the case of a proposal made by a debtor under the provisions of s. 27 of the Bankruptcy Act or s. 7 of the Farmers' Creditors Arrangement Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 1ll, proceedings under this statute are initiated by the debtor who may apply to the clerk of the district court of the judicial district in which he resides for what is called a consolidation order. With the application the debtor is required to file an affidavit in the prescribed form setting forth, inter alia, particulars of the debts owing by him, of the nature and extent of his property, the amount of the income of himself and his wife and the number of persons dependent upon him.\nSection 5 requires the clerk to file the affidavit and the particulars in a register and:\nupon reading the affidavit and hearing the debtor settle an amount proposed to be paid by the debtor into court, periodically or otherwise, on account of the claims of his creditors and enter particulars thereof in the register or, if so proposed, enter in the register a statement that the present circumstances of the debtor do not warrant the fixing of any amount.\nThe clerk is then required to give notice of the application to each of the creditors and fix a date on which he will hear objections. If no objections are received within twenty days after the notices are mailed, the clerk is required to note the fact in the register and issue a consolidation order. By s. 7 it is provided that any creditor may within the time limited file an objection with the clerk either to the amount entered in the register as the amount owing to him or to any other creditor or to the amount \"fixed to be paid into court by the debtor or the times of payment thereof or to the statement fixing no amount.\" Upon such objection being filed the clerk is required to notify the debtor and any other creditor whose claim is objected to.\nBy s. 8 the clerk is empowered to bring in and add to the register the name of any creditor of the debtor of whom he has notice and who is not disclosed in the affidavit of the debtor.\nSection 9 reads:\n(1) At the time appointed for the hearing the clerk shall consider all objections filed with him in accordance with this Act and\n(a) if an objection is to the claim of a creditor and the parties are brought to agreement or if the creditor's claim is a judgment of a court and the only objection is to the amount paid thereon, he may dispose of the objection in a summary manner and determine the amount owing to the creditor.\n(b) if an objection is to the proposed terms or method of payment of the claims by the debtor or that terms of payment are not but should be fixed, he may dispose of the objection summarily and determine as the circumstances require the terms and method of payment of the claims, or that no terms be presently fixed, or\n(c) in any case he may on notice of motion refer any objection to be disposed of by the court or as the court otherwise directs.\n(2) The clerk shall enter in the register his decision or the decision of the court, as the case may be, and shall issue a consolidation order.\nSection 10 provides that the consolidation order shall state the amount owing to each creditor, the amount to be paid into court by the debtor and the times of payment, and declares that a consolidation order is a judgment of the court in favour of each creditor for the amount stated and is an order of the court for the payment by the debtor of the amounts specified.\nSection 11 provides that on notice of motion a judge of the district court may review a consolidation order made by the clerk and vary it or set it aside. Under the provisions of s. 12 the judge may impose such terms on a debtor with respect to the custody of his property or any disposition thereof as he deems proper to protect the registered creditors and give such directions for that purpose as the circumstances require. Section 13 declares that upon the making of a consolidation order no process shall be issued in any court against the debtor at the instance of a registered creditor or a creditor to whom the Act applies, except as permitted by the Act or the regulations, or by leave of the court.\nSection 14 enables the clerk at any time to require the debtor to assign to him any moneys owing to or to become owing or to be earned by the debtor and authorizes him to issue a writ of execution \"in respect of a consolidation order\" and to file it with the sheriff or at any land titles office.\nSection 15 permits an application to be made by a creditor whose claim is not entered in the consolidation order to have it entered in the register and provides the manner of settlement of any dispute as to its amount.\nSection 16 declares that a registered creditor holding security for his claim may, at any time, elect to rely upon his security and if the security is realized any excess above the amount of the creditor's claim is to be paid to the clerk and applied in payment of other judgments against the debtor.\nBy s. 17 provision is made, inter alia, for an application by any registered creditor where a debtor defaults in complying with an order for payment or any other order or direction of the court, or where any other proceeding for the recovery of money has been brought against the debtor, or where a judgment is recovered against him for an amount in excess of one thousand dollars and the judgment creditor refuses to permit his name to be added to the register for leave to take proceedings on behalf of all of the registered creditors to enforce the consolidation order. The section further provides for an ex parte application to the court where a debtor is about to abscond or has absconded or, with intent to defraud his creditors, is about to remove his property from Alberta.\nSection 18 provides that the debtor or any registered creditor may at any time apply ex parte to the clerk for a further examination of the debtor as to his financial circumstances and, after notice has been given to all parties to the consolidation order, vary the order as to the time, amount and method of payment. Section 19 requires the clerk to distribute the moneys paid into court on account of the debts of a debtor at least once every three months pro rata among the registered creditors.\nWhile, according to s. 3, the Act applies only to judgments or claims which do not exceed one thousand dollars, the total of such claims is not mentioned so that the Act can be applied irrespective of the aggregate amount of the debts. While the debtor may be required by the clerk under the provisions of s. 14 to assign any moneys due, owing, payable, or to become due or earned by the debtor, there is no express provision for the conveyance of the debtor's other assets to the clerk, though the powers of the district court judge under s. 12 would permit such an order to be made.\nPersons engaged in farming in Alberta, as that expression is defined in the Farmers' Creditors Arrangement Act, who are entitled to make a proposal to their creditors under the terms of s. 7 of that Act are among those to whom the Orderly Payment of Debts Act will be applicable.\nThe language of s. 5 is that the clerk, upon an application being filed, after reading the affidavit required by s. 4 and hearing the debtor (apparently ex parte) shall \"settle an amount proposed to be paid by the debtor into court periodically or otherwise on account of the claims of his creditors\" or, \"if so proposed\" (presumably by the debtor) enter in the register a statement that the present circumstances of the debtor do not warrant the fixing of any amount. This language, while lacking in clarity, appears to indicate that, at least in the first instance, the clerk is to accept the debtor's estimate as to what, if anything, he can pay to his creditors and record this in the court records. Providing no objections are received within twenty days, this estimate appears to be conclusive by virtue of s. 6 and a consolidation order will issue.\nWhere objections are filed, they are to be dealt with under s. 9 which gives to the clerk power to settle the amount payable under any judgment if the amount is in dispute and, where the proposed scheme of payment is objected to, he may dispose of the objection summarily and decide upon the terms of the consolidation order. This procedure may be compared with that provided for dealing with proposals which may be made to a trustee in bankruptcy by an insolvent person under the provisions of Part 111 of the Bankruptcy Act where the proposal is submitted to a meeting of the creditors and, if accepted by them and approved by the court having jurisdiction in bankruptcy under the terms of s. 34, becomes binding upon the parties concerned. Under the Act in question, where the proposal is objected to by a creditor whose claim does not exceed one thousand dollars, the wishes of the creditors may be disregarded by the clerk. The provisions of s. 13 which prohibit the taking of any proceedings by a registered creditor or a creditor to whom the Act applies are, after a consolidation order has been made as to these creditors, similar in their effect to the provisions of s. 40 of the Bankruptcy Act and s. 11 of the Farmers' Creditors Arrangement Act relating to bankruptcy and to proposals. While s. 4 details certain information that is to be contained in the debtor's affidavit, the form of the affidavit which may be prescribed by the Lieutenant-Governor in Council by regulation is not before us. Whether that affidavit is to contain a statement that the debtor is unable to meet his debts as they become due, or whether the clerk who is required to act by s. 5 is to do so upon the unsworn statement of the debtor that he is in insolvent circumstances, does not appear.\nWhile the Act does not require that the debtor who applies must be insolvent in the sense that he is unable to pay his debts as they become due, it must, in my opinion, be so construed since it is quite impossible to believe that it was intended that the provisions of the Act might be resorted to by persons who were able to pay their way but do not feel inclined to do so. In my opinion, this is a clear invasion of the legislative field of insolvency and is, accordingly, beyond the powers of the legislature.\nThere have been bankruptcy laws in England since 1542 dealing with the estates of insolvent persons, and the terms of statutes in force in England prior to 1867 may be looked at as an aid in deciding what subject matters were generally regarded as included in these terms. The Bankruptcy Consolidation Act of 1849, 12-13 Vict., c. 106, which consolidated the law relating to bankrupts, contained in ss. 201 to 223 provisions by which a trader unable to meet his engagements with his creditors might petition the court to approve a composition or scheme of arrangement for the payment of his debts and declared the manner in which such a proposal might be submitted to the creditors and, if approved, to the court for its approval.\nThe manner in which disputes between the official assignee and the creditors as to the carrying out of a deed of composition or arrangement were to be settled was further dealt with in 1861 in s. 136 of an Act to amend the law relating to bankruptcy and insolvency in England, 24-25 Vict., c. 134.\nCompositions and schemes of arrangement have thus for more than 100 years past been treated as subject matters falling within the scope of the statutes relating to bankruptcy and insolvency. The provisions dealing with this subject at the present day in England are to be found in the Bankruptcy Act of 1914 as amended (see Williams on Bankruptcy, 17th ed., p. 92). When the Bankruptcy Act was enacted in Canada in 1919 it contained in s. 13 provisions whereby an insolvent debtor who wished to make a proposal to his creditors for a composition in satisfaction of his debts or an extension of time for payment thereof or a scheme of arrangement of his affairs might, either before or after the making of a receiving order against him or the making of an authorized assignment by him, require in writing an authorized trustee to convene a meeting of his creditors for the consideration of such proposal and provisions whereby the scheme, if approved, might become binding upon the parties concerned. Similar provisions for dealing with such a proposal, a term which is defined to include a proposal for a composition, an extension of time, or for a scheme of arrangement, are contained in the Bankruptcy Act as it is today.\nThese provisions are made applicable to proposals by farmers in Alberta, Manitoba and Saskatchewan by the Farmers' Creditors Arrangement Act above mentioned. The Act under consideration appears to be an attempt to substitute for the provisions of the Bankruptcy Act and the Farmers' Creditors Arrangement Act relating to proposals for an extension of time or a scheme of arrangement which are submitted to the interested creditors for their approval and, if approved, thereafter to the judge in bankruptcy, a scheme whereby the propriety of accepting such a proposal is to be determined by the clerk of the district court and with regard, apparently, only to the claims of those creditors the debts owing to whom are less than one thousand dollars in amount and those to whom greater amounts are owing who consent to come under the Act, leaving other creditors whose claims are greater to resort to such remedies as they may be advised to take for the enforcement of their claims. The provisions of the provincial Act thus conflict with those in the legislation passed by Parliament dealing with the same matters.\nIn Attorney General of British Columbia v. Attorney General of Canada16, where the Farmers' Creditors Arrangement Act 1934 of the Parliament of Canada, as amended by the Farmers' Creditors Arrangement Act Amendment Act 1935 was considered, Lord Thankerton said in part:\nit cannot be maintained that legislative provision as to compositions, by which bankruptcy is avoided, but whch assumes insolvency, is not properly within the sphere of bankruptcy legislation.\nand referred to the judgment of this Court in the matter of the Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act17, where Sir Lyman Duff, delivering the judgment of the majority, said that the history of the law seems to show clearly that legislation in respect of compositions and arrangements is a natural and ordinary component of a system of bankruptcy and insolvency law.\nSome support for the validity of this legislation is sought in the judgment of the Judicial Committee in Attorney General of Ontario v. Attorney General of Canada18. The question in that appeal was as to whether s. 9 of c. 124, R.S.O. 1887, was within the powers of the legislature. The Act was entitled \"An Act respecting assignments and preferences by insolvent persons.\" A majority of the members of the Court of Appeal who considered the question had found the section to be ultra vires. In an earlier case, Clarkson v. Ontario Bank19, Haggarty C.J.O. and Osier J.A. had held the Act as a whole to be ultra vires as legislation relating to bankruptcy and insolvency, while Burton and Patterson JJ.A. considered it to be intra vires as being in relation to property and civil rights in the province.\nPrior to the passing of that statute the Insolvency Act of 1875 (c. 16) had been repealed by Parliament by c. 1 of the Statutes of 1880 and there was no Bankruptcy or Insolvency Act of the Dominion.\nThe judgment allowing the appeal was delivered by Herschell L.C. The Act, the first two sections of which dealt with fraudulent preferences by insolvents or those knowing themselves to be on the eve of insolvency, permitted a debtor-solvent or otherwise\u2014to make an assignment of his exigible assets to a sheriff for the purpose of realization and distribution pro rata among his creditors. Section 9 provided that such an assignment should take precedence of all judgments and all executions not completely executed by payment. There were no provisions permitting proposals for a composition or extension of time for payment of debts. It was said that the effect to be given to judgments and executions and the manner and the extent to which they might be enforced was prima facie within the legislative powers of the legislature and that the validity of the assignment and the application of s. 9 did not depend on whether the assignor was or was not insolvent. Such an assignment, their Lordships said, did not infringe on the exclusive legislative power of Parliament under head 21. The concluding portion of the judgment reads (pp. 200-201):\nTheir Lordships do not doubt that it would be open to the Dominion Parliament to deal with such matters as part of a bankruptcy law, and the provincial legislature would doubtless be then precluded from interfering with this legislation inasmuch as such interference would affect the bankruptcy law of the Dominion Parliament. But it does not follow that such subjects, as might properly be treated as ancillary to such a law and therefore within the powers of the Dominion Parliament, are excluded from the legislative authority of the provincial legislature when there is no bankruptcy or insolvency legislation of the Dominion Parliament in existence. As Parliament has dealt with the matter, the concluding portion of this judgment would be fatal to the appellant's contention, even if the subject of bankruptcy and insolvency were one in relation to which the province might legislate in the absence of legislation by the Dominion. But the language of s. 91 is that the exclusive legislative power of the Parliament of Canada extends to all matters in relation to, inter alia, bankruptcy and insolvency, and the provinces are excluded from that field. As Lord Watson said in Union Colliery v. Bryden20:\nThe abstinence of the Dominion Parliament from legislating to the full limit of its power could not have the effect of transferring to any provincial legislature the legislative power which had been assigned to the Dominion by s. 91 of the Act of 1867.\nNeither Ladore v. Bennett21 nor Abitibi Power and Paper Co. v. Montreal Trust Co.22, affect the question, in my opinion. In the former case the legislation, while it affected the rights of persons who had claims against insolvent municipalities, was found to be in pith and substance in relation to municipal institutions in the province and, as such, was intra vires the legislature under s. 92(8). In the latter case the purpose of the impugned legislation was to stay proceedings in an action brought under a mortgage until the interested parties should have an opportunity of considering a plan for the reorganization of the company, and the true nature of the legislation was held to be to regulate property and civil rights within the province.\nI would dismiss this appeal.\nThe judgment of Cartwright and Martland JJ. was delivered by\nCartwright J.:\u2014I agree with the conclusion of my brother Locke, that in its true nature and character The Orderly Payment of Debts. Act is legislation in relation to matters coming within the class of subjects specified in head 21 of s. 91 of the British North America Act, and is wholly ultra vires of the Legislature of the Province of Alberta, and I am in substantial agreement with his reasons. I wish, however, to add some observations as to some of the decisions relied upon by counsel who supported the appeal.\nThe first of these is the judgment of the Judicial Committee in Attorney-General of Ontario v. Attorney-General for the Dominion of Canada23. The decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario in that case is reported in24. The question referred to the Court was:\nHad the Legislature of Ontario jurisdiction to enact the 9th section of the Eevised Statutes of Ontario, ch. 124, and entitled 'An Act respecting Assignments and Preferences by Insolvent Persons?'\nThe Court consisted of four judges. Hagarty C.J.O. and Burton J.A. answered in the negative; Maclennan J.A. answered in the affirmative; Osier J.A. made no answer. In the result the decision was that the section was ultra vires of the Legislature. On appeal to the Judicial Committee this decision was reversed and the question was answered in the affirmative.\nIn the earlier case of Clarkson v. Ontario Bank25, Hagarty C.J.O. had reached the conclusion that the whole Act was ultra vires of the Provincial Legislature; in the later case, the learned Chief Justice adhered to the opinion he had expressed in Clarkson's case and speaking of s. 9, to which alone the question put to the Court had reference, he said at p. 493:\nI find it impossible to separate it from the rest of the Act, or to give any opinion as to its effect, standing by itself, unless I arrived at a judgment the opposite to that expressed in 1888 to which I still fully adhere.\nIn the Judicial Committee, the Lord Chancellor, Lord Herschell, who gave the judgment of their Lordships, referred to certain other sections of the Act in order to explain the meaning of section 9 but did not deal with the question of the validity of those other sections or of the Act as a whole. At pp. 198 and 199, he said:\nTheir Lordships proceed now to consider the nature of the enactment said to be ultra vires. It postpones judgments and executions not completely executed by payment to an assignment for the benefit of creditors under the Act. Now there can be no doubt that the effect to be given to judgments and executions and the manner and extent to which they may be made available for the recovery of debts are prima facie within the legislative powers of the provincial parliament. Executions are a part of the machinery by which debts are recovered, and are subject to regulation by that parliament. A creditor has no inherent right to have his debt satisfied by means of a levy by the sheriff, or to any priority in respect of such levy. The execution is a mere creature of the law which may determine and regulate the rights to which it gives rise. The Act of 1887 which abolished priority as amongst execution creditors provided a simple means by which every creditor might obtain a share in the distribution of moneys levied under an execution by any particular creditor. The other Act of the same year, containing the section which is impeached, goes a step further, and gives to all creditors under an assignment for their general benefit a right to a rateable share of the assets of the debtor, including those which have been seized in execution.\nBut it is argued that inasmuch as this assignment contemplates the insolvency of the debtor, and would only be made if he were insolvent, such a provision purports to deal with insolvency, and therefore is a matter exclusively within the jurisdiction of the Dominion Parliament. Now it is to be observed that an assignment for the general benefit of creditors has long been known to the jurisprudence of this country and also of Canada, and has its force and effect at common law quite independently of any system of bankruptcy or insolvency, or any legislation relating thereto. So far from being regarded as an essential part of the bankruptcy law, such an assignment was made an act of bankruptcy on which an adjudication might be founded, and by the law of the Province of Canada which prevailed at the time when the Dominion Act was passed, it was one of the grounds for an adjudication of insolvency.\n* * *\nMoreover, the operation of an assignment for the benefit of creditors was precisely the same, whether the assignor was or was not in fact insolvent.\nViewing the impugned section in this way their Lordships were able to hold that, at all events in one aspect, its true subject matter fell within heads 13 and 14 of s. 92 of the B.N.A. Act (although in another aspect that subject matter would fall within head 21 of s. 91) and so could stand while there was no bankruptcy or insolvency legislation of the Dominion Parliament in existence in relation to the same subject matter.\nIn Ladore v. Bennett26, their Lordships held that the impugned legislation was in its true nature and character in relation to the subject matter comprised in head 8 of s. 92, Municipal Institutions in the Province, and that the fact that the municipal institutions dealt with in the legislation had become insolvent did riot remove the subject matter from the ambit of provincial legislative power. In Abitibi Power & Paper Co. v. Montreal Trust Co.27, their Lordships regarded the subject matter of the legislation there in question as falling within heads 13 and 14 of s. 92. The Montreal Trust Co., as trustee for the bondholders, had commenced an action in the Supreme Court of. Ontario on September 8, 1932, against the Abitibi Company for the enforcement of the security of a deed of trust and bond mortgage. On September 26, 1932, the Abitibi Company was adjudicated bankrupt. On December 7, 1932, leave to continue this action was granted pursuant to s. 21 of the Dominion Winding Up Act. The bond-holders made no claim in the winding-up, and in their Lordships' view, once leave had been granted \"the action proceeded as a provincial action, subject to the provincial law regulating the rights in such an action and subject to the sovereign power of the legislature to alter those rights in respect of property within the province\". The judgment of their Lordships continues as follows at pp. 547 and 548:\nIt could not be denied that the action proceeded subject to the possibility of being stayed under the ordinary rules of procedure as, for instance, for security for costs, default in pleading or discovery, or any special circumstances which the court might think demanded a stay. Middleton J.A. appreciated this position, but he expressed the opinion that the action would proceed in accordance with the orders and rules of practice that were in existence at the date of the application. The limitation to existing rules is significant. Their Lordships can see no ground for such a restriction. If the rules of procedure were subsequently altered before the action came to an end, it must proceed thereafter subject to the rules as amended. The province, therefore, could enact rules in the course of the action imposing a further ground of stay, and, if it can thus impose what may be a general moratorium, there is no reason why its sovereign power should be so limited as not to enable it to impose, if it so desired, a moratorium limited to a special class of action or suitor, or to one particular action or suitor.\nI do not propose to refer in detail to the other authorities relied upon in support of the appeal but, after examining all of them, I think I am right in saying that in every decision of the Judicial Committee or of this Court in which provincial legislation, impugned on the ground that it affected the rights and obligations of an insolvent entity and its creditors and thereby trenched on the subject matter comprised in head 21 of s. 91, has been upheld it appears that in the view of the court two conditions were found to exist; (i) that the impugned legislation was not in truth and substance primarily in relation to Bankruptcy and Insolvency but rather in relation to one or more of the matters enumerated in s. 92; and (ii) that in so far as it affected the rights and obligations of an insolvent and its creditors it did not conflict with existing valid legislation of Parliament enacted in exercise of the power contained in head 21 of s. 91.\nIn the case at bar, as is shown in the reasons of my brother Locke, neither of these conditions exists.\nI would dismiss the appeal.\nAppeal dismissed.\n1 (1959), 29 W.W.R. 435, 20 D.L.R.

Town of Summerside et al., [1960] S.C.R. 591\nDate: 1960-05-16\nLocal Union Number 1432 of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (Plaintiff) Appellant;\nand\nThe Town Of Summerside (Defendant) Respondent.\n1960: February 23; 1960: May 16.\nPRESENT: Kerwin C.J. and Cartwright, Martland, Judson and Ritchie JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF PRINCE EDWARD ISLAND.\nLabour\u2014Collective bargaining\u2014Refusal of town to bargain\u2014Mandamus\u2014 Whether Trade Union Act superseded by powers of town council under its Act of incorporation\u2014Legality and applicability of Trade Union Act, R.S.P.EJ. 1951, c. 164, ss. 2, 3(1)\u2014The Town of Summerside Incorporation Act, 1903 (P.E.I.), c. 18.\nThe plaintiff union applied for an order of mandamus to compel the defendant municipality to bargain collectively. The defence of the municipality was that the Trade Union Act was ineffective to legalize trade union activities in the province, and that in any event it did not apply to the municipality's employees in view of the more specific powers it had under its Act of incorporation respecting hiring, dismissal and remuneration of employees. The action was dismissed by the trial judge on the ground that the Trade Union Act did not apply. The Court of Appeal held that the Trade Union Act was valid and effectual to authorize collective bargaining and was available for that purpose between the parties, but that it did not apply on the topics of wages and dismissals which were reserved to the municipality under its Act of incorporation. The union appealed to this Court and the municipality cross-appealed.\nHeld: The appeal should be allowed and the cross-appeal dismissed.\nSections 2 and 3(1) of the Trade Union Act effectively constitute valid legislative authority for trade unions to organize and bargain collectively in the province.\nThere was no repugnancy between the Trade Union Act and the municipality's Act of incorporation. By the terms of s. 62 of the Act of incorporation, that Act applied only to \"officers\" appointed by the Council, a subject which is outside the jurisdiction of the Trade Union Act. The power to make by-laws given by s. 70 of the Act of incorporation includes the power to make such by-laws as may be deemed proper to comply with the terms of an agreement regulating the conditions of employment of the employees, provided that such provisions are not contrary to the terms of the enabling statute. There were no reasons at law why the powers vested in the Council could not be used to enable it to conclude a binding collective agreement with the union representing its employees.\nAPPEAL and cross-appeal from a judgment of the Supreme Court of Prince Edward Island, in banco [1], modifying a judgment of Tweedy J. Appeal allowed and cross-appeal dismissed.\nW. E. Bentley, Q.C., and J. P. Nicholson, for the plaintiff, appellant.\nJ. O. Campbell, Q.C., and E. H. Strong, Q.C., for the defendant, respondent.\nG. R. Foster, Q.C., for the Attorney-General of Prince Edward Island.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nRITCHIE J.:\u2014This action was commenced by writ of summons dated January 31, 1955, claiming a mandamus to compel the town of Summerside to bargain collectively with the appellant union. The writ was endorsed in the terms following:\nThe plaintiff's claim is for a Mandamus commanding the defendant to comply with the provisions of Section 3 of the Trade Union Act and to recognize the bargain collectively with the members of the plaintiff trade union representing the majority choice of the employees of the defendant in its electric light and power department eligible for membership in the plaintiff trade union, the Provincial Secretary having, under the provisions of the said Act, determined that a unit of employees of the defendant's electric light and power department is appropriate for collective bargaining under the said Act, and having also determined that a majority of the employees of the defendant in such unit are members in good standing of the plaintiff trade union, and that a majority of them have selected the plaintiff to be a bargaining agent on their behalf, and having certified the plaintiff as such bargaining agent, of all of which notice was duly given by the plaintiff to the defendant, the defendant having, after receiving such notice, and after having been duly requested by the duly chosen officers of the plaintiff so to bargain, neglected and refused to do so.\nThe statement of claim and reply amplify this endorsement, but the present appeal is only concerned with the points of law raised in the defence and rejoinder which are adequately summarized for the present purposes by Campbell C.J., speaking on behalf of the Supreme Court of Prince Edward Island in banco[2], in the course of rendering the decision from which this appeal is asserted. He there said at p. 27:\nThe two groups of objection in point of law which occupied the attention of both Courts may be summarized as follows:\n(1) That the Trade Union Act of Prince Edward Island is ineffective to legalize trade union activities in the province;\n(2) That even if the Trade Union Act has made trade unions lawful, its provisions cannot be construed to derogate from the more special provisions of the respondent's Act of Incorporation (Town of Summerside Act, 1903, Prince Edward Island, c. 18) and By-laws respecting the terms of employment of its officers and employees.\nIt was agreed between the parties that these points of law should be heard and determined before any issues of fact raised by the pleadings and by Order of the Court they were set down for hearing before Tweedy J. on September 22, 1955.\nIn his decision rendered on November 25, 1955, Tweedy J. stated that although he was not satisfied that the Trade Union Act, R.S.P.E.I. 1951, c. 164, as amended, by 1953 (P.E.I.), c. 3, was invalid, he was nonetheless of opinion that \"it does not and cannot apply to the employees of the Town of Summerside in the electric light and power department\" and an Order thereupon issued which read in part as follows:\n. . . the Court being of opinion that the decision of such points of law substantially disposes of the whole action, HEREBY DISMISSES this action.\nThis opinion was obviously based on the proposition that the terms of employment of the employees of the town of Summerside were exclusively controlled by the Town of Summerside Incorporation Act, 1903 (P.E.I.), c. 18, and the by-laws passed thereunder and that the Trade Union Act, being a general statute, did not apply to a relationship which was governed by the terms of a special Act.\nOn December 8, 1955, the appellant gave notice of appeal from this decision insofar as the same declared that the Trade Union Act did not apply in the circumstances, and in that notice stated that the Court of Appeal would be moved on a date to be fixed by it for an Order setting aside and reversing that part of the decision.\nFor some reason which does not appear in the record, the date which the Court of Appeal fixed for the hearing of this motion (i.e., November 1, 1956) was almost eleven months after the date of the notice of appeal and when that day came the Chief Justice was unable to be present and the Court adjourned until the 19th of December when argument was heard and the case \"taken under advisement and decision reserved to a day to be fixed\". The next entry concerning this case according to the record before this Court is that after a lapse of approximately nine months the Chief Justice addressed a letter to the solicitors for both parties under date of September 12, 1957, which read as follows:\nThe members of the Court in banco have reached the following opinion as to the point already argued on this appeal:\nWe feel, that though we agree with the general principle enunciated by Mr. Justice Tweedy to the effect that the particular provisions of the Summerside Incorporation Act and By-laws should prevail over the more general provisions of the Trade Union Act, nevertheless there is a certain portion of the field in which the two courses of legislation may have concurrent effect. In other words, we are of the opinion that the provisions of the Summerside Incorporation Act and By-laws preclude the operation of the Trade Union Act in matters relating to the employment, remuneration and dismissal; but that at the same time there remains a limited field for collective bargaining in such matters as hours of work, safety precautions, holidays, social security, etc.\nWe are, however, in doubt as to the propriety of pronouncing judgment on the foregoing point while the other, and broader, questions remains undecided. It would, for instance, be mere dictum for the Court of Appeal to say that a certain portion of the field is open for collective bargaining, while it is still open for argument that the Trade Union Act is entirely invalid.\nCounsel are therefore invited to attend before the Court on Friday, September 20th inst., at the close of the hearing scheduled for that date, to discuss the following questions: (a) whether, in view of the Court's opinion on the effect of the Summerside Incorporation Act, the parties still wish to have the broader question of the validity of the Trade Union Act argued and decided; (b) if the answer to question (a) is in the affirmative, what is the most appropriate method of arriving at a determination of the broader questions?\nCounsel duly appeared on September 20 and addressed the Court after which the appeal was adjourned until November 12, but on that day the Court merely met for the purpose of adjourning until December 13, at which time a representative of the Department of the Attorney-General appeared, and after argument the hearing was further adjourned until January 9, 1958, when the argument was concluded.\nOn April 3, 1958, a memorandum was issued, signed by the Chief Justice and MacGuigan J., and reading as follows:\nThe Court is of the opinion that the Trade Union Act, now R.S., P.E.I., Chapter 164, is valid and effectual to authorize collective bargaining, and is available for that purpose as between the Town of Summerside and its employees except on the topics of wages, salaries, and dismissals, which are reserved to the Town Council by virtue of the Act of Incorporation of the Town of Summerside and by-laws passed thereunder.\nReasons and consequent directions to be given later.\nThe reasons of Campbell C.J., having been filed on July 25, the formal Order of the Court was granted on October 24, 1958, which read in part as follows:\nThis Court doth order and adjudge that the above recited judgment pronounced before Mr. Justice Tweedy be modified to the following extent, namely: that the Respondent's objections in point of law do not preclude the Appellant from obtaining, in proper circumstances, an order of mandamus requiring the Respondent to recognize and bargain collectively with the Appellant with respect to the terms and conditions of employment by the Respondent of its electric light and power employees who are members of the Appellant or with respect to other relevant matters; except on the topics of appointments or hirings, remunerations, and dismissals, which are reserved to the Town Council of the Respondent by virtue of its Act of Incorporation and by-laws passed thereunder.\nThe Court doth further order and adjudge that the action be referred back to the Court from which the appeal was taken for appropriate proceedings in the context of this judgment.\nFrom this judgment the appellant has appealed to this Court, limiting his appeal however\n... to the part of the said Judgment appealed from which purported to refer the said Action back to Mr. Justice Tweedy, and to the failure and omission of this Court to grant to the Appellant the Order of Mandamus for which the Action was brought, and to the part of the said Judgment which purports to exclude and except from the subjects of collective bargaining the topics of appointments or hirings, remunerations and dismissals.\nA cross-appeal was entered by the respondent from that part of the decision which held that the Trade Union Act of Prince Edward Island was effective to legalize trade union activities in the province and also from that part which held that the legal objections raised by the respondent did not preclude the appellant from obtaining an Order of mandamus.\nAt the opening of the appeal before this Court it was suggested by the Chief Justice that in order to obviate any difficulty in the event that the judgment below should be considered not to be a final judgment, it might be advisable for the Court to make an order permitting the appellant to appeal and the respondent to cross-appeal. Counsel for all parties agreed to this suggestion and the order was thereupon made. The Attorney-General of Prince Edward Island was represented by counsel before the Court but took no part in the argument.\nAs to the cross-appeal, I am in complete agreement with the learned Chief Justice of Prince Edward Island in holding that \"the Trade Union Act of Prince Edward Island is effective to legalize trade union activities in the province\".\nThe argument presented on behalf of the town of Summerside in support of the cross-appeal was to the effect that the taint of illegality which attached to trade unions in England in the 18th century was imported to Prince Edward Island with the original colonists and that as it has never been removed by sufficiently explicit legislative language it remains, although unwritten and unrecognized for upwards of 200 years, so much a part of the common law of Prince Edward Island as to make the Trade Union Act, supra, ineffective and to preclude trade unions from the legal right to organize and bargain collectively in that province.\nThe provisions of ss. 2 and 3(1) of the Trade Union Act read as follows:\n2. Employees may form themselves into a trade union, and join the same when formed.\n3. (1) Employees may bargain collectively with their employer or employers and members of a trade union may conduct such bargaining through the trade union and through the duly chosen officers of such trade union. Every employer shall recognize and bargain collectively with the members of a trade union representing the majority choice of the employees eligible for membership in said trade union, when requested so to bargain by the duly chosen officers of said trade union, and any employer refusing so to bargain shall be liable to a fine upon summary conviction of One Hundred Dollars for each such offence, and in default of payment to thirty days imprisonment.\nIn my opinion these provisions effectively constitute valid legislative authority for trade unions to organize and bargain collectively in the province of Prince Edward Island.\nAs to that part of the notice of appeal which objects to the case being referred back to Mr. Justice Tweedy and to the failure of the Court of Appeal to grant the Order of mandamus, I am of opinion that neither of these objections can be sustained. The questions before this Court are limited to the points of law which were set down for hearing and determination before Tweedy J. Under the procedure here adopted and for the limited purpose of determining these questions, it must be taken that the statements of fact alleged in the appellant's pleadings are true, but this does not mean that they can be accepted for the purpose of granting the Order for mandamus. Although this action was started more than five years ago, no evidence has yet been taken, and as the Court appealed from held that\nthe respondent's objections in point of law do not preclude the appellant from obtaining, in proper circumstances, an Order for Mandamus . . .\nit had no alternative but to refer the matter back to the learned judge of first instance. The really substantial ground of appeal to this Court is from that part of the Order and decision\nwhich purports to exclude and except from the subjects of collective bargaining the topics of appointments or hirings, remunerations and dismissals.\nThe reasoning of the learned Chief Justice of Prince Edward Island was that the Trade Union Act was inconsistent with the Town of Summerside Incorporation Act in that the above subjects were specifically dealt with by By-law 326 which was validly passed under the latter statute. This by-law reads as follows:\nThe salaries of Town Officials, Firemen and all other Employees of the Town shall be such as the Town Council may from time to time determine and fix by resolution, and they shall remain in office during the pleasure of the Council, and should any vacancies occur, the Council may appoint others to take their place at any meeting of the Council.\nCampbell C.J. appears to have taken the view that by the provisions of this by-law \"the topics of appointments or hirings, remunerations and dismissals\" of employees were reserved to the Town Council and that the collective bargaining provisions of the Trade Union Act had the effect of trespassing in some manner on this reservation and were, therefore, to this extent inapplicable to the Town because they formed part of a general statute which must give way to the special provisions of the Summerside Incorporation Act.\nMuch was said at the argument before this Court about the principle which is embodied in the maxim \"generalia specialibus non derogant\" and the learned judge of first instance devoted a large part of his decision to the citation of textbook and other authority in this regard, but the matter appears to me to have been most clearly stated by Duff J. (as he then was) in Toronto Railway Company v. Paget[3], where he said:\nOne possible view is that in such cases the provision in the general Act is to be wholly discarded from consideration; the other is that both provisions are to be read as applicable to the undertaking governed by the special Act so far as they can stand together, and only where there is repugnancy between the two provisions and then only to the extent of such repugnancy the general Act is to be inoperative.\nI think the latter is the correct view\u2026 This view was reaffirmed by Rinfret J., speaking for the majority of this Court in City of Ottawa v. Town of Eastview[4], and in my opinion it correctly states the law which governs this branch of the case.\nThe learned judge of first instance approached the problem by saying:\nNow the question to decide is, does the Trade Union Act which is a general Act repeal the Town of Summerside Act which is a special Act?\nand it was apparently by answering this question in the negative that he reached the opinion that the Trade Union Act did not and could not apply to the employees of the town of Summerside in the electric light and power department. With the greatest respect, I am of opinion that, having regard to what was said by Sir Lyman Duff in the case above noted, the learned judge addressed himself to the wrong question, and should rather have asked himself how far the two statutes could stand together in relation to their effect on the desire of the employees in question to bargain collectively with the town of Summerside through their union representatives.\nChief Justice Campbell adopted the approach which was approved in Toronto Railway Company v. Paget, supra, but, as has been indicated, he appears to have considered that the collective bargaining provisions of the Trade Union Act were repugnant to the Summerside Incorporation Act and particularly the aforesaid by-law insofar as the \"topics of appointments or hiring, remunerations and dismissals\" were concerned.\nWith all respect, I am of opinion that there is no repugnancy between these two statutes.\nBy s. 62 of the Town of Summerside Incorporation Act it is provided that \"officers\" may be appointed by the Town Council and \"shall hold office during pleasure\" and that their removal, replacement and remuneration shall be at the pleasure of the council, but the Trade Union Act does not apply to \"officers, officials or other employees employed in any confidential capacity\" and the Town of Summerside Incorporation Act contains no such restrictions with respect to employees generally. In fact, the only reference in that Act to the employment of employees deals specifically with those employed in the town electric plant and system and is in the following broad language:\n163. (2) The Town is empowered to employ such engineers, experts, agents and workmen as may be deemed necessary in surveying, evaluating, constructing, improving, extending and maintaining any such plant or system, and operating the same, and to lease, purchase or otherwise acquire such lands, rights, easements or privileges as may be deemed necessary for the purposes hereof.\nIt is true that By-law 326 is a by-law which is capable of being construed as regulating conditions of employment of employees of the town and as dealing with \"topics of appointments or hirings, remunerations and dismissals\", and it is also true that all such by-laws \"shall be as legal and binding as if incorporated in and forming part of the Act\" (s. 70) so long as they remain in force. It must be remembered, however, that the Council is clothed by s. 70 of the Act with full authority \"to make, ordain, enact, revise, alter and amend such by-laws as they may deem proper . ..\", and this power, in my view, includes the power to make such by-laws as may be deemed proper to comply with the terms of an agreement regulating the conditions of employment of its employees, provided that such provisions do not run contrary to the terms of the enabling statute. If the Town Council purported to pass a by-law changing the terms of the employment of \"officers\" who are by statute declared to hold office \"during pleasure\" other considerations might well apply, but in regulating the employment of the employees here in question there is no statutory restriction on the powers of Council who may make such by-laws to that end \"as they may deem proper\".\nThe requirement of the Trade Union Act that an employer shall bargain collectively with a union representing its employees does not have the effect of compelling either party to conclude an agreement against his will, but collective bargaining would be a mere sham if it were conducted by an employer having no power or authority to conclude such an agreement. I can, however, see no reason at law why the powers vested in the Town Council cannot be employed in such manner as to enable the town to conclude a binding collective agreement with the union acting on behalf of its employees.\nIt will accordingly be apparent that in my view there is nothing in the Town of Summerside Incorporation Act to exclude the respondent from being required to bargain collectively and without restriction with the appellant in accordance with the Trade Union Act, and I am of opinion that if it can be shown that all the requirements of the Trade Union Act have been complied with by the appellant, a mandamus should issue to compel the respondent so to bargain.\nIn view of all the above, I am of opinion that this appeal should be allowed, the cross-appeal dismissed, the judgment of the Supreme Court of Prince Edward Island in banco and of Tweedy J. set aside and the case remitted to Mr. Justice Tweedy for trial and determination of the issues of fact raised by the pleadings.\nCounsel for the appellant entered a vigorous protest against the delays which took place between the hearing before Tweedy J. and the disposition of this case by the Supreme Court in banco, and it is for this reason that the course of events was traced in such detail at the outset of this decision. Having regard to all the circumstances, it is my view that the town of Summerside should immediately pay the appellant its costs of all the proceedings in this matter from the close of the pleadings to the issuance of the formal order on this appeal and cross-appeal, whatever the final result of the trial may be. There should be no costs for or against the Attorney-General of Prince Edward Island.\nAppeal allowed and cross-appeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the plaintiff, appellant: W. E. Bentley, Charlottetown.\nSolicitor for the defendant, respondent: J. O. C. Campbell, Charlottetown.\nSolicitor for the Attorney General of Prince Edward Island: R. R.

Terkuc, [1960] S.C.R. 602\nDate: 1960-06-24\nJames Herd (Defendant) Appellant;\nand\nZvone Terkuc (Plaintiff) Respondent.\n1960: June 8, 24.\nPresent: Locke, Cartwright, Martland, Judson and Ritchie JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.\nTrial\u2014Practice\u2014Jury sent back to reconsider their answers to questions submitted to them\u2014Whether course followed by trial judge a proper one.\nIn the course of a trial in a motor negligence action certain questions were submitted to the jury. The trial judge was dissatisfied with the answers and, without referring to counsel, instructed the jury to reconsider their findings. On the second set of answers judgment was given dismissing the action with costs. The Court of Appeal, by a majority, who were of opinion that the course followed by the trial judge was not a proper one, allowed the plaintiff\u2019s appeal and directed a new trial. The defendant then appealed to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be allowed and the judgment at trial restored.\nThe first set of answers, read in the light of the evidence and of the charge, made it apparent that the jury had failed to grapple with the essential point which they were required to determine. In these circumstances, the trial judge had the power and it was his duty to instruct the jury to reconsider their answers. Napier v. Daniel and Welsh, (1837), 6 L.J.C.P. 62 at 63, and Regina v. Meany, (1862), 9 Cox C.C. 231 at 233, referred to.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1], reversing a judgment of Wells J. and directing a new trial. Appeal allowed.\nA.T. Hewitt, Q.C., and J.L. Nesbitt, for the defendant, appellant.\nD. Boyle, for the plaintiff, respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nCARTWRIGHT J.:\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of of the Court of Appeal for Ontario which, by a majority, allowed the plaintiff\u2019s appeal from a judgment of Wells J. dismissing the action and directed a new trial; Schroeder J.A. dissenting, would have dismissed the appeal. The action was for damages for personal injuries suffered by the respondent in a collision between a motor car owned and driven by one Menard, in which the respondent was a passenger carried gratuitously, and a motor car owned and driven by the appellant.\nThe collision occurred in the City of Ottawa at the intersection of Laurier Avenue and Waller Street, on September 26, 1955, at about 6.30 a.m. Laurier Avenue runs east and west; Waller Street runs north and south. The movement of traffic at this intersection is controlled by signal lights, as provided by s. 41(2) of the Highway Traffic Act, R.S.O. 1950 c. 167. The car in which the respondent was carried was being driven south on Waller Street and the appellant was driving west on Laurier Avenue. Each driver claimed that he entered the intersection with the green signal light in his favour and the crucial question was as to which of them was right in this assertion. The evidence of the two drivers on this point was definite and in direct conflict. One of them must have been mistaken.\nIn the course of an admirable charge the learned trial judge repeatedly impressed upon the jury that their main task was to decide which driver had the traffic light in his favour. He said, for example:\u2014\nYou will have to decide which of these stories you believe, that is the key to this case, because whoever did not have the green light was negligent, I think it is as simple as that.\n* * *\nThere is a concrete wall apparently 8 feet high obscuring vision until you are fairly close to the intersection, but if Menard had a green light, even if he saw Herd coming along, he was entitled to proceed through and entitled to assume Herd would stop. That applies equally to Herd who couldn\u2019t see up Waller because of that wall, and who had every right to assume, if the light was green, any traffic coming up or down Waller would stop on the red light. I think the whole key to the question is who had the light and the man who went through on the red light is negligent.\nThe learned trial judge did not withdraw the question of contributory negligence from the jury; he instructed them accurately and adequately as to the duty of a driver who has the signal light in his favour and went on to tell them, quite properly, that on the evidence there was little room for a finding of negligence on the part of whichever driver did in fact have the signal light in his favour. The following questions were submitted to the jury:\n1. Was there any negligence on the part of the defendant driver, James Herd, which caused or contributed to the injuries suffered by the plaintiff, Zvone Terkuc? Answer Yes or No.\n2. If your answer to Question No. 1 is \u201cYes\u201d then state fully, giving the facts on which you base your conclusions, the particulars of such negligence.\n3. Was there any negligence on the part of the driver of the Plaintiff\u2019s car, Jacques Menard, which caused or contributed to the injuries suffered by the Plaintiff? Answer Yes or No.\n4. If your answer to Question No. 3 is \u201cYes\u201d, then state fully, giving the facts on which you base your conclusions, the particulars of such negligence.\n5. If your answer should disclose that there was negligence on the part of both drivers which caused or contributed to the injuries suffered by the plaintiff, then state in percentage the respective degrees of negligence of each:\nJames Herd\n%\nJacques Menard\n%\n100%\n6. At what amount and irrespective of any other consideration do you assess the total damages suffered by the Plaintiff, Zvone Terkuc?\nAfter deliberating for some two hours the jury returned to the court room and stated that they had reached a verdict. The list of questions was handed to the learned trial judge and contained the following answers:\nTo Question 1: Yes.\nTo Question 2: Excess of speed shown by force of impact.\nTo Question 3: Yes.\nTo Question 4: Failure in looking for cross-bound traffic.\nTo Question 5: James Herd\n60%\nJacques\nMenard\n40%\n100%\nTo Question 6: $16,940.00\nThe learned trial judge without referring to counsel or inviting any submission from them said to the jury:\nYou see your difficulty is you haven\u2019t answered the essential questions. You say \u201cYes\u201d to Question 1 and say \u201cexcessive speed shown by force of impact\u201d. In so far as this driver is concerned, if he had the green light he was entitled to go through. If he had the traffic light he did not have to look for anything unless it was apparent to him that something was coming through against the light. Try to grapple with the essential points in this case. You have a duty to do; now try and do it. The jury thereupon retired and after deliberating for a further two hours returned the following answers to the questions:\nTo Question 1: No.\nTo Question 2: No answer.\nTo Question 3: Yes.\nTo Question 4: Failure to stop at red light.\nTo Question 5: No answer.\nTo Question 6: $16,940.00\nOn these answers the learned trial judge, on motion of counsel for the defendant gave judgment dismissing the action with costs.\nThe majority in the Court of Appeal were of opinion that the course followed by the learned trial judge was not a proper one. With respect, I am unable to agree with this conclusion.\nThe answers of a jury must, of course, be read in the light of the evidence and of the charge; on so reading the answers first made by the jury it was apparent that they had failed to grapple with the question as to which driver had the signal light in his favour which had been clearly presented to them as the essential point which they were required to determine. In these circumstances the learned trial judge had the power and it was his duty to instruct the jury to deal with that question. Particularly in view of the full and accurate charge which he had given on this point, his redirection, which is quoted in full above, while brief was adequate.\nThat the learned judge had the power to send the jury back to reconsider their answers is made plain by the authorities collected in the reasons of Schroeder J.A. I would add a reference to two decisions relied upon by counsel for the appellant. In Napier v. Daniel and Welsh[2], Tindal C.J. said:\nI have always understood the rule to be, that the jury are at liberty to alter the verdict before it is recorded, but not after. This is laid down in Co. Litt. fol. 227, b, where it is said, \u201cafter the verdict recorded, the jury cannot vary from it, but before it be recorded they may vary from the first offer of their verdict, and that verdict which is recorded shall stand.\u201d In Regina v. Meany[3], Pollock C.B. said:\nThere is no doubt that a Judge, both in a civil and criminal court, has a perfect right, and sometimes it is his bounden duty, to tell the jury to reconsider their verdict. He may send them back any number of times to reconsider their finding. The Judge is not bound to record the first verdict unless the jury insist upon its being recorded. If they find another verdict that is the true verdict.\nWhile no doubt this power is not one to be used lightly, the circumstances of the case at bar appear to me to have required its exercise and I conclude, as did Schroeder J.A., that the course followed by the learned trial judge was a proper one.\nFor the above reasons and for those given by Schroeder J.A. with which I am in substantial agreement I would allow the appeal and restore the judgment of the learned trial judge. The appellant is entitled to his costs in the Court of Appeal and in this Court.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Gowling, MacTavish, Osborne & Henderson, Ottawa.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Guertin, Guertin and Boyle, Ottawa.\n[1] [1958] O.R. 37, 11 D.L.R.

Minister of National Revenue, [1960] S.C.R. 606\nDate: 1960-06-13\nSettled Estates Limited Appellant;\nand\nThe Minister of National Revenue Respondent.\n1960: May 9; 1960: June 13.\nPresent: Locke, Cartwright, Abbott, Martland and Judson JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE EXCHEQUER COURT OF CANADA.\nTaxation\u2014Income tax\u2014Exemption claimed as a personal corporation\u2014Claim rejected\u2014The Income Tax Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 148, ss. 63(1)(2), 68(1)(a),139(1)(u)(ac).\nAppellant incorporated as a private company under the Companies Act of British Columbia, was controlled for many years by one Fiddes, who died on April 25, 1954. Letters probate were granted to his executors on June 15, 1954. Following Fiddes' death the shares of the appellant were held by the executors and the company was controlled by them during the 1955 and 1956 taxation years. The appellant claimed that the executors were individuals according to s. 139(1) (u) (ac) of the Income Tax Act and as they had the requisite control and had met all other requirements of s. 68(1), the company was in 1955 and 1956 a personal corporation, and therefore exempt from income tax. The Minister rejected the claim and reassessed for the years in question. These reassessments were confirmed on appeal to the Income Tax Appeal Board and to the Exchequer Court. The appellant then appealed to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nThe executors controlled the appellant company during the period in question on behalf of numerous beneficiaries of the estate. This was not one of the three methods of control contemplated by s. 68(1)(a) of the Act, i.e. (i) by an individual resident in Canada, (ii) by such an individual and one or more members of his family who were resident in Canada, (iii) by any other person on his or their behalf. An executor could not be the individual referred to in that section, because a plain intention to the contrary was to be gathered from its context.\nS. 63 had no relevancy in the determination whether a corporation is a personal corporation.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of Cameron J. of the Exchequer Court of Canada1, affirming reassessments made by the Minister of National Revenue. Appeal dismissed.\nK. E. Meredith, for the appellant.\nE. S. MacLatchy and T. E. Jackson, for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nJudson J.:\u2014The issue in this appeal is whether the appellant was a personal corporation within the meaning of s. 68 of the Income Tax Act during its 1955 and 1956 taxation years. Both the Income Tax Appeal Board and the Exchequer Court2 have found that it was not. The appellant contests this finding and appeals from the reassessments made for the 1955 and 1956 taxation years.\nThe appellant was incorporated as a private company under the Companies Act of British Columbia and for many years it was controlled by the late Robert William Fiddes, who owned 1699 shares out of its 1700 total issued ordinary shares. During the lifetime of the late Mr. Fiddes the appellant was admittedly a personal corporation within the meaning of s. 68 of the Income Tax Act. Mr. Fiddes died on April 25, 1954. Under his Will the Montreal Trust Company and Elmore Meredith, both of the City of Vancouver, were appointed executors and Letters Probate were granted to them on June 15, 1954. Following the death of Mr. Fiddes, the shares of the appellant were held by these executors and the appellant was controlled by them during the 1955 and 1956 taxation years. For these years, in filing its income tax returns, the appellant claimed exemption from tax on the ground that it was a personal corporation. The Minister rejected this claim and reassessed for these years on the ground that the appellant was not a personal corporation. These are the reassessments which were confirmed on appeal to the Income Tax Appeal Board and to the Exchequer Court.\nIn my opinion, the appeal fails and should be dismissed with costs.\n\"Personal corporation\" is defined by s. 68 of the Income Tax Act in the following terms:\n68. (1) In this Act, a \"personal corporation\" means a corporation that, during the whole of the taxation year in respect of which the expression is being applied,\n(a) was controlled, whether through holding a majority of the shares of the corporation or in any other manner whatsoever, by an individual resident in Canada, by such an individual and one or more members of his family who were resident in Canada or by any other person on his or their behalf;\n(b) derived at least one-quarter of its income from\n(i) ownership of or trading or dealing in bonds, shares, debentures, mortgages, hypothecs, bills, notes or other similar property or an interest therein,\n(ii) lending money with or without securities,\n(iii) rents, hire of chattels, charterparty fees or remunerations, annuities, royalties, interest or dividends, or\n(iv) estates or trusts; and\n(c) did not carry on an active financial, commercial or industrial business.\n(2) For the purpose of paragraph (a) of subsection (1), the members of an individual's family are his spouse, sons and daughters whether or not they live together.\nIt is admitted that the income of the corporation qualifies under subs. (b) of s. 68(1). The question is whether the control of the corporation in 1955 and 1956 was such as to qualify it within subs, (a) of s. 68(1). A personal corpora- tion does not pay income tax but its income is taxed in the hands of the shareholders under s. 67 of the Act, which reads:\n67. (1) The income of a personal corporation whether actually distributed or not shall be deemed to have been distributed to, and received by, the shareholders as a dividend on the last day of each taxation year of the corporation.\n(2) No tax is payable under this Part on the taxable income of a corporation for a taxation year during which it was a personal corporation.\nThe appellant's submissions on this appeal were that the executors were individuals according to the definition of \"individual\" and \"person\" in s. 139(1)(u) and (ac), and that consequently, the requirements of s. 68(1) (a) were met.\nSection 139(1) (u) and s. 139(1) (ac) read:\n139(1)(u). \"Individual\" means a person other than a corporation;\n139(1)(ac). \"person\" or any word or expression descriptive of a person, includes any body corporate and politic, and the heirs, executors, administrators or other legal representatives of such person, according to the law of that part of Canada to which the context extends;\u2026.\nThe argument is that since an individual means a person (other than a corporation) and as the definition of \"person\" includes executors and legal representatives, it follows that the executors of the Fiddes estate are individuals and that having had the requisite control and all the other requirements of s. 68(1) having been met, the appellant company was in 1955 and 1956 a personal corporation.\nI have no hesitation in rejecting this argument. The executors controlled this company during the taxation years in question on behalf of the beneficiaries of the estate. This, in my opinion, is not one of the three modes of control contemplated by s. 68(1)(a). The three modes of control are:\n(i) by an individual resident in Canada;\n(ii) by such an individual and one or more members of his family who were resident in Canada (family being defined by statute);\n(iii) by any other person on his or their behalf.\nIn my opinion, the individual first referred to must be a natural living person exercising control on his own behalf. The word does not include executors, whether corporate or otherwise. I say this because that individual first referred to is next referred to in connection with his family. There is no room for executors, whether corporate or otherwise, in this scheme of control. The last mode of control is by any other person on behalf of an individual or on behalf of the individual and members of his family. I can think of situations where executors could exercise control under this third mode of control, for example, if T dies leaving all his shares in a personal corporation to executors and trustees in trust for an individual or for that individual and members of his family. But this is not the present case. Under the terms of the will left by the late Mr. Fiddes, the executors control on behalf of numerous beneficiaries. They do not control on behalf of an individual or the individual and members of his family. My conclusion therefore is that an executor cannot be the individual referred to in s. 68(1)(a).\nNor do I think that the appellant can get any assistance from ss. 63(1) and (2) of the Income Tax Act, which define a trust and then go on to define a trust as an individual as follows:\n63(1). In this Act, trust or estate means the trustee or the executor, administrator, heir or other legal representative having ownership or control of the trust or estate property.\n63(2). A trust or estate shall, for the purposes of this Act, and without affecting the liability of the trustee or legal representative for his own income tax, be deemed to be in respect of the trust or estate property an individual..\u2026\nSection 63 has no relevancy in the determination whether a corporation is a personal corporation. Although s. 63(2) may require executors to be demed an individual for the purpose of taxation of the trust or estate and although they may be an individual holding the shares of the appellant company, for the reasons I have given they cannot be the individual referred to in s. 68(1)(a), because a plain intention to the contrary is to be gathered from the context of the section itself.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Meredith & Co., Vancouver.\nSolicitor for the respondent: A. A. McGrory, Ottawa.\n1 [1959] Ex. C.R. 449, C.T.C. 284, D.T.C. 1138.\n2 [1959] Ex. C.R. 449, C.T.C. 284, D.T.C. 1138.\n"

Robinson (Defendant) Respondent.\n1960: May 20; 1960: June 13.\nPresent: Locke, Cartwright, Martland, Judson and Ritchie JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW BRUNSWICK, APPEAL DIVISION.\nMotor vehicles\u2014Negligence\u2014Findings of fact by trial judge sitting without jury\u2014Whether judgment at trial should be varied by appellate court\u2014Survival of Actions Act, R.S.N.B. 1952, c. 223\u2014Fatal Accidents Act, R.S.N.B. 1952, c. 82\u2014Motor Vehicle Act, 1955 (N.B.), c. 13.\nA collision occurred between an oil tank truck owned by R and operated by his employee G, and an automobile owned and operated by M, who died as a result of injuries received in the accident. The trial judge, sitting without a jury, found that G's negligent driving was the sole cause of the collision. From this decision the defendant appealed to the Appeal Division of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick, where the parties were found to have been equally at fault, and judgment was given awarding 50 per cent of the total damages to the plaintiffs. The plaintiffs then appealed to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be allowed and the judgment at trial restored.\nThe burden lay upon the respondent to prove that after the deceased became or should have become aware of the truck driver's breach of the provisions of s. 131 of the Motor Vehicle Act, he failed to take advantage of an opportunity to avoid the accident of which a reasonably careful and skillful driver would have availed himself. Walker v. Brownlee and Harmon, [1952] 2 D.L.R. 450, referred to.\nThis was a question of fact and as there was evidence to support the conclusion of the learned trial judge with respect to it, his decision should not be varied. S.S. Hontestroom v. S.S. Sagaporack, [1927] A.C. 37, Prudential Trust Company v. Forseth, (1960), 21 D.L.R. (2d) 587 at 593, Semanczuk v. Semanczuk, [1955] S.C.R. 658 at 677, applied. The damages as found by the trial judge were not so excessive as to warrant any interference with the award made by him.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick, Appeal Division, reversing a judgment of Robichaud J. Appeal allowed.\nD. M. Gillis, Q.C., and H. W. Church for the plaintiffs, appellants. P. Barry, Q.C., and R. D. C. Stewart, Q.C., for the defendant, respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nRitchie J.:\u2014This action arises out of a collision between an oil tank truck bearing the name and carrying the products of Imperial Oil Company Limited which was owned by the respondent and operated by his employee, H. P. Giddens, and an automobile owned and operated by the late George MacLaren who died as a result of injuries sustained in the collision.\nThe collision occurred on an icy and steeply banked curve on the highway between St. Stephen and St. Andrews in the province of New Brunswick at about 10:00 a.m. on January 30, 1959, when the respondent's vehicle was proceeding in an easterly direction so that the banked curve sloped down towards his left-hand side of the highway, and as the driver himself admits the truck was skidding or sliding a bit in that direction.\nThis action is brought by the administrator of the estate of the late George MacLaren claiming under the provisions of the Survival of Actions Act, R.S.N.B. 1952, c. 223, and the Fatal Accidents Act, R.S.N.B. 1952, c. 82, and by the late Mr. MacLaren's widow who claims for damages resulting from personal injuries sustained by her in the collision.\nThe statement of claim alleges that the collision was caused by the negligent driving of the truck by Giddens for which the respondent and Imperial Oil Company Limited were responsible, and in the first instance the Imperial Oil Company Limited and Giddens were joined with the respondent as parties-defendant; no appeal has, however, been taken from the Order of the learned trial judge dismissing the action against the Imperial Oil Company Limited nor has any appeal been asserted by the driver.\nBy the original defence the defendants, Giddens and Robinson, simply \"deny the allegations of negligence\" and\nplead inevitable accident in that the Defendants were using all care and caution at the time the said accident happened and allege that the said accident was caused entirely by the conditions of the highway. At the trial, however, the respondent Robinson added a counterclaim of $1,500.00 for damages to his truck, alleging that \"the said George MacLaren was negligent in failing to keep to his own side of the highway and in not having his car under proper control.\"\nThe case was tried before Robichaud J., sitting without a jury, and the learned trial judge, after a careful review of the evidence, concluded that \"Gliddens' negligent driving on that occasion was the sole cause of the collision and the damages resulting therefrom\" and he specified that negligence as follows:\nThe negligence of the defendant driver Giddens consisted, therefore, in the unreasonable speed at which he was driving the Robinson truck, coupled with his lack of control of the same resulting in the rear end of the truck overlapping in the right driving lane of the MacLaren car and colliding therewith.\nPursuant to this finding, the learned trial judge awarded the following damages:\n(1)Under the Survival of Actions Act for hospital\nbills and disbursements, pain and suffering of the\nlate Mr. MacLaren and the loss of his auto-\nmobile \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.........................$2,219.88\n(2)Under the Fatal Accidents Act general damages\nfor loss of maintenance, support and assistance to\nthe dependants of the deceased ............................................. 43,500.00\ntogether with the costs of funeral and burial\nexpenses ......................................................................... 932.60\n(3)For injuries, pain, suffering and inconvenience of\nMrs. MacLaren \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026. 500.00\ntogether with special damages ......................................... 141.50\nFrom this decision the respondent appealed to the Appeal Division of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick, and in accordance with the decision of that Court delivered by Ritchie J.A. whereby the parties were found to have been equally at fault, judgment was given reducing the assessment of the damage sustained for loss of pecuniary benefit under the Fatal Accidents Act from $43,500.00 to $40,000.00 and awarding only 50 per cent. of the total damages to the appellants so that $21,576.24 was awarded in respect of the claims under the Fatal Accidents Act and the Survival of Actions Act, Mrs. MacLaren was awarded $320.75 and the respondent Robinson was awarded one-half of his counterclaim, i.e. $750.00. It is from this judgment that the appellants now appeal. The significant feature of the decision rendered on behalf of the Appellate Division is that it recognizes the negligence of the respondent's driver and allows the appeal entirely on the ground of the appellants' contributory negligence.\nIn reviewing the conduct of the respondent's driver, Ritchie J.A. has this to say:\nGiddens admits that immediately prior to the collision the truck was sliding towards the centre line but says it was \"carrying off\" to the right as it went down the hill. He also admits that, taking a chance nothing would happen and without slowing down, he had continued along the road and around the curve where the collision occurred. The pavement at the scene of the collision was practically glare ice.\nThe crux of the decision appealed from is to be found in the following paragraph:\nAccepting the finding of the learned judge that the rear of the tank wagon was about four feet north of the centre line there was, including the north shoulder, about eighteen feet for the deceased to manoeuver his car so as to avoid collision with the truck. Either he did not have, by reason of the glare ice covering on the pavement, sufficient control of his car to enable him to veer to his right or he was not maintaining a proper lookout and did not see the truck. In any event, with great respect, it is my opinion the evidence, apart from his own statements, points irresistibly to the conclusion there also was negligence on the part of the deceased and that such negligence contributed to the collision.\nIt will be observed that the Appellate Division has not identified the negligence which it attributes to Mr. MacLaren whereas the learned trial judge has made specific findings in the appellants' favour with respect to the allegations in the respondent's counterclaim. The following excerpts from the decision of the learned trial judge will serve to show that these findings relate to questions of fact and that they are based on his assessment of the witnesses who appeared before him.\nAs to the allegation that Mr. MacLaren failed to keep to his own side of the highway, the learned trial judge has this to say:\nAccording to her (Mrs. MacLaren's) evidence, when the Robinson truck \"bumped into\" them, as she said, her late husband was then driving his automobile on his own right-hand side of the highway. This is corroborated by Mrs. Edna Mowatt, an independent witness, who impressed me as a very truthful one. Mrs. Mowatt testified that at the time of the collision the late Mr. MacLaren was driving his automobile \"on the right-hand side going to St. Stephen\". In her cross-examination, by Mr. Barry, Mrs. Mowatt stated that Mr. MacLaren, at that time, \"wasn't far off from the edge of the ditch\"\u2014\"from where it turns down over the ditch\"\u2026.she said, again referring to Mr. MacLaren:\u2014\n\"Well I would say his two wheels was over on the edge of the gravel\u2014 over on the edge of the gravel at the side of the road.\"\nAfter making reference to the evidence of the driver Giddens and his helper, the learned trial judge continued:\nNeedless for me to elaborate any further on the issue of contributory negligence, raised by the inclusion of a counterclaim, by the amendment to Arthur S. Robinson's defence. The evidence to which I have just referred is sufficiently convincing to negative the particulars of negligence set out in the Counterclaim.\nThis seems to me to be a case to which the observations of Lord Sumner in S.S. Hontestroom v. S.S. Sagaporack1, recently approved by this Court in Prudential Trust Company v. Forseth2, and Semanczuk v. Semanczuk3, have particular application. Lord Sumner there said at pp. 47-8:\n\u2026Not to have seen the witnesses puts appellate judges in a permanent position of disadvantage as against the trial Judge, and, unless it can be shown that he has failed to use or has palpably misused his advantage, the higher Court ought not to take the responsibility of reversing conclusions so arrived at, merely on the result of their own comparisons and criticisms of the witnesses and of their own view of the probabilities of the case.\n* * *\nIt is not suggested that the learned trial judge acted on any wrong principle in attributing the cause of the collision entirely to the negligence of Giddens, and I can see no indication of his having either failed to use or having misused the advantage afforded to him by seeing and hearing the witnesses, nor has the Appeal Division cast any reflection on the honesty of any of the witnesses upon whose testimony his findings are based.\nOn the other hand, by accepting the findings of the learned trial judge that the respondent's truck was about 4 feet north of the centre line of the highway, the Appeal Division has confirmed the fact that the truck was being operated contrary to the provisions of s. 131 of the Motor Vehicle Act of New Brunswick, 1955 (N.B.), c. 13, which reads as follows:\nDrivers of vehicles proceeding in opposite directions shall pass each other to the right, and upon roadways having width for not more than one line of traffic in each direction each driver shall give to the other at least one-half of the main travelled portion of the roadway.\nIt accordingly appears to have been accepted by both courts below that, as a result of the truck driver taking a chance and rounding a steeply banked curve covered at least in part with practically glare ice without slowing down, the truck invaded that half of the highway which Mr. MacLaren was entitled to assume would be free for his own use. In these circumstances the burden lay upon the respondent to prove that after Mr. MacLaren became or should have become aware of the truck driver's breach of the law, he failed to take advantage of an opportunity to avoid the accident of which a reasonably careful and skilful driver would have availed himself (see Walker v. Brownlee and Harmon4). This is a question of fact and as there is evidence to support the conclusion of the learned trial judge with respect to it, I do not think that his decision in this regard should be varied nor do I think that the damages as found by him were so excessive as to warrant any interference with the award which he made.\nIn the result, I am of opinion that the judgment at the trial in this case should not have been varied, and I would allow this appeal with costs throughout and restore the judgment of the learned trial judge.\nAppeal allowed with costs throughout.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Logan, Bell & Church, St. John, N.B.\nSolicitor for the respondent: J.

A la suite de cet accident, ledit Kleinberg est d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9.\nLes appelants ont comparu par le minist\u00e8re de leurs procureurs, mais d\u00e9faut a \u00e9t\u00e9 enregistr\u00e9 contre eux parce que le plaidoyer n'avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 produit dans les d\u00e9lais l\u00e9gaux. La cause; a en cons\u00e9quence \u00e9t\u00e9 inscrite ex parte et, s'autorisant de l'art. 421 du Code de proc\u00e9dure civile, la demanderesse, vu qu'il s'agissait d'une action en recouvrement de dommages r\u00e9sultant d'un quasi-d\u00e9lit, a demand\u00e9 un proc\u00e8s par jury. La demanderesse a \u00e9galement fait signifier dans les d\u00e9lais pr\u00e9vus \u00e0 l'art. 423 une requ\u00eate demandant que le cause soit plac\u00e9e sur le r\u00f4le sp\u00e9cial des proc\u00e8s par jury. Lors de l'audition de cette requ\u00eate, les procureurs de l'appelante se sont oppos\u00e9s \u00e0 ce que la cause soit entendue par un jury, et le savant juge a rejet\u00e9 la requ\u00eate parce que l'inscription, au lieu d'avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 faite pour enqu\u00eate et audition ex parte, ne l'avait \u00e9t\u00e9 seulement que pour audition ex parte. La Cour du banc de la reine2 a unanimement renvers\u00e9 ce jugement et a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que l'omission du mot \"enqu\u00eate\" lors de l'inscription ne vicie pas celle-ci, et que le mot \"audition\" seul \u00e9tait suffisant.\nElle a de plus d\u00e9cid\u00e9 une autre question qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9e en Cour sup\u00e9rieure, mais sur laquelle il n'y avait pas eu d'adjudication, \u00e0 l'effet qu'il peut y avoir lieu \u00e0 un proc\u00e8s par jury, m\u00eame lorsqu'il n'y a pas de contestation \u00e9crite et que la cause est inscrite ex parte.\nJe crois que la Cour du banc de la reine a bien jug\u00e9 en d\u00e9cidant que l'omission du mot \"enqu\u00eate\" dans l'avis d'inscription ne constituait pas une erreur fatale. Comme elle je suis d'opinion qu'il faut pr\u00e9f\u00e9rer le libre exercice d'un droit \u00e0 l'application d'un formalisme trop exag\u00e9r\u00e9.\nLa demanderesse-intim\u00e9e avait droit \u00e0 un proc\u00e8s par jury. Ce droit lui est conf\u00e9r\u00e9 par l'art. 421 C.P., mais rien dans le Code ne d\u00e9fend ce recours, m\u00eame si la cause est inscrite ex parte. Il serait trop facile \u00e0 un d\u00e9fendeur de ne pas produire son plaidoyer et de laisser proc\u00e9der ex parte, pour priver le demandeur de son droit de faire d\u00e9terminer par un jury le sort de sa r\u00e9clamation. Ce n'est pas ce que veut la loi. Quand, en vertu de l'art. 421 C.P., le demandeur peut exiger un proc\u00e8s par jury, il doit dans les dix jours de l'inscription pour enqu\u00eate et audition, que la contestation soit li\u00e9e ou que l'on proc\u00e8de ex parte, demander par requ\u00eate que la cause soit plac\u00e9e sur le r\u00f4le sp\u00e9cial des proc\u00e8s par jury (423 C.P.). Cette demande ne peut \u00eatre faite qu'apr\u00e8s l'inscription, et le Code ne dit pas qu'il faut que le plaidoyer \u00e9crit ait \u00e9t\u00e9 produit.\nIl est n\u00e9cessaire de ne pas oublier qu'avant 1954, date o\u00f9 le Code de proc\u00e9dure a \u00e9t\u00e9 amend\u00e9, la situation pouvait \u00eatre diff\u00e9rente, car l'ancien art. 293 C.P. stipulait que seules les causes qui ne devaient pas \u00eatre instruites devant un jury pouvaient \u00eatre inscrites pour preuve et audition, mais la loi est maintenant chang\u00e9e et l'ancienne jurisprudence ne trouve plus son application.\nPour les raisons ci-dessus, et pour celles donn\u00e9es par MM. les Juges Casey, Rinfret et Choquette, je crois que le pr\u00e9sent appel, doit \u00eatre rejet\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nAttorneys for the defendants, appellants: Letourneau, Quinlan, Forest, Deschene & Emery, Montreal.\nAttorney for the plaintiff, respondent: L.

Act, 1867, ss. 121, 122. The Education and Hospitalization Tax Act, R.S.S. 1953, c. 61, as amended, imposes a tax on consumers and users of tangible personal property purchased at retail sale in the Province for consumption and use and not for resale. The Act requires licensed vendors to collect the tax at the time of the retail sale.\nThe plaintiff, a building contractor, purchased component or prefabricated parts for use or incorporation in the construction of houses built by it for sale on its own lands or on lands of others at a fixed-price contract or on a cost-plus basis. The plaintiff contended that the Act was ultra vires and, alternatively, that it was not obligated to pay this tax. The trial judge found that the Act was valid but that it did not apply to the plaintiff. The Court of Appeal unanimously held the Act to be valid and by a majority held that it applied to the plaintiff.\nHeld: The Act was intra vires and was applicable to the plaintiff in this case.\nConsidering the general tendency of the impost, the Act was valid in respect of both durable and non-durable goods as imposing a direct tax within the Province.\nThere was no attempt to tax in disregard of ss. 121 and 122 of the B.N.A. Act, in respect of goods brought into the Province or of which delivery was received therein.\nThe plaintiff, in this case, was the final user of the personal property incorporated in the houses, and the fact that he would attempt to recoup the tax in fixing the price could not change the nature of the tax and make it an indirect one.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan1, reversing in part a judgment of Davis J.

Tremblay, Q.C., for the Attorney-General of Quebec.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nMartland J.:\u2014These proceedings were commenced by the appellant under The Proceedings Against the Crown Act, R.S.S. 1953, c. 79, for the return of the sum of $6,688.84 received by the respondent, which had been paid by the appellant under protest.\nThe appellant is a company incorporated under the laws of the Province of Saskatchewan and carries on, in that province, the business of constructing buildings. A considerable part of its business was the erection of dwelling houses. During the time material to these proceedings, 1953 to 1955 inclusive, most of the dwellings constructed by the appellant were built on the appellant's own lands for sale to the public; some were constructed on lands owned by others, under fixed-price contracts; and a few on lands owned by others, on a cost-plus contract basis.\nThe appellant purchased component or prefabricated parts for these houses from another company, Engineered Buildings (Regina) Limited, which manufactured and sold such parts. These parts would then be assembled and fitted together in the construction of houses by the appellant's employees. Certain portions of the other construction work were done by subcontractors under contract with the appellant.\nIn respect of the component parts sold by the manufacturer to the appellant, the respondent claimed that tax was payable by the appellant under the provisions of The Education and Hospitalization Tax Act, R.S.S. 1953, c. 61. Engineered Buildings (Regina) Limited was a licensed vendor under that statute, the terms of which required it, as an agent of the Crown, to collect the tax. The respondent called upon that company to collect such tax in respect of the sales made to the appellant. The manufacturer, in turn, demanded payment of the tax from the appellant under threat of discontinuing future deliveries in the event of non-payment by the appellant. The appellant thereupon paid the $6,688.84 to its supplier, under protest, which company in turn paid that amount to the respondent. The appellant then sued the respondent for the return of these moneys.\nThe appellant bases its claim upon two grounds: first, that the Act in question is ultra vires of the Saskatchewan Legislature and, second, that even if it is valid, the appellant is not, under the terms of the Act, obligated to pay this tax. Both the learned trial judge and all the members of the Court of Appeal of Saskatchewan2 decided the first issue in favour of the respondent. A majority of the Court of Appeal also decided the second issue in its favour. The learned trial judge and Gordon J.A., who dissented on this point in the Court of Appeal, held in favour of the appellant in respect of the second issue.\nThe main contention of the appellant in respect of the first point is that the statute imposed taxation which is not direct taxation within the province and so is beyond the powers of the Legislature under s. 92(2) of the British North America Act. The following provisions of The Education and Hospitalization Tax Act, as amended prior to judgment, are relevant to the consideration of this issue:\n3. In this Act:\n1. \"consumer\" means any person who within the province purchases from a vendor tangible personal property at a retail sale in the province for his own consumption or for the consumption of other persons at his expense, or on behalf of, or as the agent for, a principal who desires to acquire such property for consumption by such principal or other persons at the expense of such principal;\n* * *\n4. \"purchaser\" means any person who within the province purchases a vendor tangible personal property at a retail sale in the province;\n5. \"retail sale\" means a sale to a consumer or user for purposes of consumption or use, and not for resale as tangible personal property and includes such a sale by auction;\n6. \"sale\" means any transfer, exchange or barter, conditional or otherwise, in any manner or by any means whatsoever, of tangible personal property for a consideration, and includes any agreement of sale whether absolute or conditional;\n7. \"tangible personal property\" means personal property which can be seen or touched, and includes gas used for heating or illumination, and electricity;\n8. \"user\" means any person who within the province purchases from a vendor tangible personal property at a retail sale in the province for his own use or for the use of other persons at his expense, or on behalf of, or as the agent for a principal who desires to acquire such property for use by such principal or other persons at the expense of such principals;\n9. \"vendor\" means any person who, within the province, and in the course of his business, or of continuous or successive acts, sells tangible personal property to a consumer or user at a retail sale in the province for purposes of consumption or use, and not for resale.\n* * *\n4. (1) No vendor shall sell any tangible personal property in the province at a retail sale unless he holds a licence to do so issued to him by the minister and such licence is in force at the time of the sale. (2) The licence shall be issued without fee and shall be signed by the minister, or such person as the minister appoints for the purpose, and, if required by the regulations, shall be kept posted up, in the manner prescribed thereby, in the place where the vendor carries on his business.\n(3) The minister may cancel or suspend the licence of a vendor for his failure to comply with any of the provisions of this Act or the regulation, and thereupon any other licence of the vendor issued by any authority in the province authorizing him to carry on his business shall become and be cancelled and of no effect.\n* * *\n5. (1) Every consumer of tangible personal property purchased at a retail sale in the province shall pay to Her Majesty the Queen for the raising of a revenue for educational and hospitalization purposes, at the time of making his purchase, a tax in respect of the consumption of such property, and such tax shall be computed at the rate of three per cent of the value of the property to be consumed.\n(2) Every user of tangible personal property purchased at a retail sale in the province shall pay to Her Majesty the Queen for the raising of a revenue for educational and hospitalization purposes, at the time of making his purchase, a tax in respect of the use of such property, and such tax shall be computed at the rate of three per cent of the value of the property to be used.\n(2a) A person who consumes or uses tangible personal property acquired by him for resale or who consumes or uses tangible personal property manufactured, processed or produced by him shall be deemed to have purchased such property from a vendor at a retail sale in the province.\n(3) If a vendor in the ordinary course of his business sells any tangible personal property to a person who alleges that he is not purchasing it for consumption or use, the vendor shall nevertheless require such person to deposit with him an amount equal to the tax which would be payable under this Act if the property were sold to a consumer or user as herein defined, but the minister shall refund the deposit on receipt of evidence satisfactory to him that the property was purchased for the purpose of resale by a licensed vendor.\n(4) Every person residing or ordinarily resident or carrying on business in Saskatchewan who brings into the province or who receives delivery in the province of tangible personal property for his own consumption or use, or for the consumption or use of other persons at his expense, or on behalf of or as agent for a principal who desires to acquire such property for consumption or use by such principal or other persons at his expense, shall immediately report the matter to the minister or his appointee and forward or produce to him the invoice, if any in respect of such property and any other information required by him with respect to the property and shall pay the same tax in respect of the consumption or use of such property as would have been payable if the property had been purchased at retail in the province at the price which would have been paid in Saskatchewan if such tangible personal property had been purchased at retail in the province.\n* * *\n7. Every vendor at the time of a retail sale of tangible personal property to a consumer or user shall levy and collect the tax imposed by this Act upon the consumer or user. 8. Every vendor and every person authorized to collect or receive taxes from a vendor shall be a revenue officer within the meaning of The Treasury Department Act and shall be subject to the duties and liabilities of a revenue officer under that Act.\n9. The minister may make an allowance to the vendor for his services in collecting and forwarding the tax to the minister, which allowance shall be determined by the Lieutenant Governor in Council.\n* * *\n29. The consumer or user shall be and remain liable for the tax imposed by this Act until the same has been collected and, in the event of failure on the part of the vendor to collect the tax, the consumer or user may be sued therefor in any court of competent jurisdiction.\nReference was made, during argument, to the many decisions, both of the Privy Council and of this Court, which have had to determine whether the various taxing statutes, under consideration in those cases, imposed direct or indirect taxation and which have established the tests which are to be applied in determining that issue. However, the judgment of the Privy Council in Atlantic Smoke Shops, Limited v. Conlon3 is so closely in point that, in my view, unless it can be distinguished successfully, it must determine the issue here in favour of the respondent.\nThe statute under consideration in that case was The Tobacco Tax Act, 1940, enacted by the Legislature of the Province of New Brunswick, which imposed a tax in respect of tobacco purchased at a retail sale in the province for consumption. The definitions of the words \"consumer\", \"purchaser\", \"retail sale\", and \"retail vendor\" in that Act are practically the same as the definitions of the words \"consumer\", \"purchaser\", \"retail sale\" and \"vendor\" in the Saskatchewan Act. The provisions for the licensing of vendors are similar. Section 4 of the New Brunswick Act, which imposed the tax, is, in terms, practically identical with s. 5(1) of the Saskatchewan Act. The same similarity exists between s. 5 of the New Brunswick Act and subs. (4) of s. 5 of the Saskatchewan Act regarding the imposition of tax where goods are brought into the province and not purchased by retail in the province.\nIn that case, as in the present one, counsel for the appellant urged that the tax was a sales tax, that a sales tax is an excise tax and, therefore, an indirect tax. Viscount Simon, who delivered the judgment of the Privy Council, said at p. 563:\n\u2026 It has been long and firmly established that, in interpreting the phrase \"direct taxation\" in head 2 of s. 92 of the Act of 1867, the guide to be followed is that provided by the distinction between direct and indirect taxes which is to be found in the treatise of John Stuart Mill. The question, of course, as Lord Herschell said in Brewers and Malsters' Association of Ontario v. Attorney-General for Ontario, 1897 A.C. 231, 236, is not what is the distinction drawn by writers on political economy, but in what sense the words were employed in the British North America Act. Mill's Political Economy was first published in 1848, and appeared in a popular edition in 1865. Its author became a member of parliament in this latter year and commanded much attention in the British House of Commons. Having regard to his eminence as a political economist in the epoch when the Quebec Resolutions were being discussed and the Act of 1867 was being framed, the use of Mill's analysis and classification of taxes for the purpose of construing the expression now under review is fully justified. In addition to the definition from Mill's Political Economy already quoted, citation may be made of two other passages as follows: \"Direct taxes are either on income or on expenditure. Most taxes on expenditure are indirect, but some are direct, being imposed not on the producer or seller of an article, but immediately on the consumer\" (bk. V. Ch. 3). And again, in ch. 6, in discussing the comparative merits of the two types of tax, he takes as the essential feature of direct taxation that \"under it everyone knows how much he really pays.\" Their Lordships, therefore, consider that this tobacco tax in the form they have called (a) would fall within the conception of a \"direct\" tax, and ought so to be treated in applying the British North America Act. It is a tax which is to be paid by the last purchaser of the article, and, since there is no question of further re-sale, the tax cannot be passed on to any other person by subsequent dealing. The money for the tax is found by the individual who finally bears the burden of it. It is unnecessary to consider the refinement which might arise if the taxpayer who has purchased the tobacco for his own consumption subsequently changes his mind and in fact resells it. If so, he would, for one thing, require a retail vendor's licence. But the instance is exceptional and farfetched, while for the purpose of classifying the tax, it is the general tendency of the impost which has to be considered. So regarded, it completely satisfies Mill's test for direct taxation. Indeed, the present instance is a clearer case of direct taxation than the tax on the consumer of fuel oil in Attorney-General for British Columbia v. Kingcome Navigation Co., 1934 A.C. 45, for fuel oil may be consumed for the purpose of manufacture and transport, and the tax on the consumption of fuel oil might, as one would suppose, be sometimes passed on in the price of the article manufactured or transported. Yet the Privy Council held that the tax was direct. In the case of tobacco, on the other hand, the consumer produces nothing but smoke. Mr. Pritt argued that the tax is a sales tax, and that a sales tax is indirect because it can be passed on. The ordinary forms of sales taxes are, undoubtedly, of this character, but it would be more accurate to say that a sales tax is indirect when in the normal course it can be passed on. If a tax is so devised that (as Mill expresses it) the taxing authority is not indifferent as to which of the parties to the transaction ultimately bears the burden, but intends it as a \"peculiar contribution\" on the particular party selected to pay the tax, such a tax is not proved to be indirect by calling it a sales tax. Previous observations by this Board as to the general character of sales taxes, or of taxes on commercial dealings, ought not to be understood as denying the possibility of this exception.\nThe appellant seeks to distinguish the Conlon decision and that of the Privy Council in Attorney-General for British Columbia v. Kingcome Navigation Company Limited4, on the grounds that the taxes in question in those cases related to goods purchased for the purpose of consumption by the buyer, tobacco in the Conlon case, fuel oil in the Kingcome case. The Act in question in the present case relates not only to personal property purchased for consumption, which were referred to in argument as non-durable goods, but also to personal property purchased for use, referred to in argument as durable goods. It was contended that the major incidence of the tax imposed by the Act would be upon durable goods. Such goods, it was argued, would, by their nature, continue, after their purchase, to be capable of being the subject-matter of subsequent trading. If they were subsequently traded, the purchaser of them, who had paid the tax, would seek to pass it on to a subsequent purchaser. Consequently it was submitted that a tax upon durable goods is an indirect tax. The trading in of second-hand automobiles was cited as an example.\nAs was pointed out in the judgment of Lord Herschell in Brewers and Maltsters' Association of Ontario v. Attorney-General for Ontario5, referring to Bank of Toronto v. Lambe6:\nThe question was not what was direct or indirect taxation according to the classification of political economists, but in what sense the words were employed by the Legislature in the British North America Act.\nLord Hobhouse, in Bank of Toronto v. Lambe, at p. 581, says:\nProbably it is true of every indirect tax that some persons are both the first and the final payers of it; and of every direct tax that it affects persons other than the first payers; and the excellence of an economist's definition will be measured by the accuracy with which it contemplates and embraces every incident of the thing defined. But that very excellence impairs its value for the purposes of the lawyer. The legislature cannot possibly have meant to give a power of taxation valid or invalid according to its actual results in particular cases. It must have contemplated some tangible dividing line referable to and ascertainable by the general tendencies of the tax and the common understanding of men as to those tendencies. In my opinion, the same reasoning which led the Privy Council to conclude, in the Kingcome and Conlon cases, that the respective statutes there under consideration imposed direct taxation is properly applicable to the Act now under consideration and is not rendered inapplicable because the present statute applies to durable as well as to consumable goods. It is true that the number of cases in which there might be a resale, as second-hand goods, by the taxpayer, of personal property which he has purchased for his own use and on which he has paid tax is greater in relation to durable goods than consumable goods. Our task, however, is to consider the general tendency of the impost for the purpose of classifying the tax. In my view, the sale by the taxpayer, as second-hand goods, after using it, of personal property which he has purchased for his own use, is exceptional when considering the general tendency of the tax as a whole. I cannot reach the conclusion that the Legislature, in imposing the tax, must have had the expectation and intention that it would be passed on.\nIt was also contended for the appellant that the Act is invalid as amounting to an attempt to tax in disregard of ss. 121 and 122 of the British North America Act, which provide:\n121. All articles of the growth, produce, or manufacture of any one of the Provinces shall, from and after the Union, be admitted free into each of the other Provinces.\n122. The customs and excise laws of each Province shall, subject to the provisions of this Act, continue in force until altered by the Parliament of Canada.\nThis argument relates to the provisions of subs. (4) of s. 5 of the Act which imposed the same taxation in relation to goods brought into Saskatchewan, or delivery of which is received there, as would have been payable if the goods had been purchased at a retail sale in Saskatchewan.\nExactly the same argument was raised in the Conlon case respecting s. 5 of the New Brunswick Act, which is almost identical in terms with s. 5(4) of the Saskatchewan Act. The argument was unsuccessful and the Privy Council held that the New Brunswick Act did not attempt to tax in disregard of these two sections of the British North America Act. No valid basis has been suggested whereby that decision can be distinguished on this point, and for that reason I think that this argument also fails. In my opinion, therefore, The Education and Hospitalization Tax Act is intra vires of the Legislature of the Province of Saskatchewan.\nI turn now to the second point of the appellant's argument, namely, that even if the Act is valid legislation, it did not impose a legal obligation upon the appellant to pay the taxes which are in dispute.\nIt was contended that in order to be taxable it must be established that the appellant was a user of personal property purchased at a retail sale, within subs. (2) of s. 5 of the Act. It was then contended that the appellant did not purchase at a retail sale and was not a user of the goods within the meaning of the subsection.\nA \"retail sale\" is defined in the Act as meaning a \"sale to a consumer or user for purposes of consumption or use, and not for resale as tangible personal property\". If the appellant was a user of the goods within the meaning of the Act, I am of the opinion that there was a retail sale to him within the meaning of the definition.\nThis brings me to the main submission, that the appellant was not a user of the goods in question within s. 5(2) of the Act. The contention on this point was that the appellant did not purchase the component parts for its own use but that they were acquired for incorporation into houses being built for the purpose of sale. If, it was argued, the use made of the goods by the appellant was to be construed as the \"use\" contemplated by the Act, it would result in the statute being clearly unconstitutional because the tax would certainly be passed on to the house purchaser. Consequently, it was suggested, the \"use\" which would involve the payment of tax under the Act must be restricted in its meaning so as to exclude use in the process of production or manufacture and be limited to ultimate or final use.\nThis contention was accepted by the learned trial judge and also by Gordon J.A., in the Court of Appeal, who summed up the argument of the appellant in this way:\nThe legal advisers of the provincial legislature knew perfectly well that if the tax were to be valid it would have to fall on the \"ultimate\" consumer or user. That is why a \"consumer\" was defined as one who purchases property at a retail sale \"for his own consumption\". The word \"user\" was defined in a similar way. The phrase \"retail sale\" was also defined as a sale to a consumer or user and not for resale. It is true that by the amendment of 1957 the words \"as tangible personal property\" were added, but, with every deference, I do not think this amendment helps the defendant. If the plaintiff used the personal property to build a house for resale and had to pay the tax it would be an indirect tax and ultra vires. Most definitely the personal property involved in these proceedings was bought for resale in houses. If this was just an isolated transaction in which the law had an indirect application it could still be valid but such is not the case. I can take judicial notice of the fact that companies like the plaintiff are carrying on extensive operations and the tax collected may run into a large sum.\nThe contrary view may be summed up in the words of Culliton J.A., who said:\nHere the respondent purchased certain building materials which were admittedly tangible personal property as defined in the Act. This material was purchased not for the purpose of resale as tangible personal property but for the purpose of constructing houses to be sold as real property. By the incorporation of these building materials in these houses such building materials lost their character as tangible personal property and became an integrated part of the real property. The respondent therefore was the ultimate user or consumer of such tangible personal property and thus liable for the tax imposed upon it by the legislation. That liability in my opinion arises under the provisions of the Act without recourse to either the regulations or rulings.\nIn my opinion, the appellant was a \"user\" of the goods in question here and was made liable for payment of tax under s. 5(2) of the Act. I would agree that the intention of the Act is to impose the tax upon the final consumer or user of the personal property purchased. It was upon that basis that the Privy Council upheld the New Brunswick legislation under consideration in the Conlon case. But it also appears to me that a person who purchases personal property and incorporates it into something else, in the process of which it loses its own identity as personal property, is the final user of that personal property so incorporated. The nails which were hammered into the structure, the paint placed on the walls, or the shingles on the roof were finally used for the purposes for which they were created when they became a part of the building. Equally, the prefabricated parts were finally used when they were incorporated into the houses which the appellant constructed. The purchaser of a house would not thereafter use them as component parts. He would make use of the completed house.\nIs the general character of the tax altered because a house-builder, such as the appellant, would seek, as he undoubtedly would seek, in fixing the price of the house, to recoup the tax which he was required to pay in respect of the component parts? I do not think that it is. In my view, this attempt to recoup the tax in such cases is no different from the attempt which, in argument in the Kingcome case, it was suggested would be made by the manufacturer or the transporter to pass on the fuel oil tax there in question in the price of the article manufactured or transported. The appellant would undoubtedy seek, when selling the house which he constructed, to recoup himself for municipal land taxes which he had been required to pay on the land on which the house is situated, yet, clearly, a tax of this general character does not cease to be direct because cases may occur in which the taxpayer may be able to pass it on, as was established in City of Halifax v. Fairbanks Estate7. If the general tendency of the tax imposed is such that it may be classified as a direct tax, the authorities establish that its nature is not changed because, in some instances, it may be passed on. This point is stated by Lord Greene in Attorney-General for British Columbia v. Esquimalt and Nanaimo Railway Company8:\nIt is argued, however, that the tax, whatever name be given to it, is an indirect tax because the natural tendency for the person who is to be assessed to it will be to pass it to others and thus indemnify himself against it. This operation of passing, it is said, would take one or other or both of two forms\u2014a \"passing back\" to the railway company by means of a lowering of the purchase price, and a \"passing on\" to purchasers of the cut timber. It is probably true of many forms of tax which are indisputably direct that the assessee will desire, if he can, to pass the burden of the tax on to the shoulders of another. But this is only an economic tendency. The assessee's efforts may be conscious or unconscious, successful or unsuccessful; they may be defeated in whole or in part by other economic forces. This type of tendency appears to their Lordships to be something fundamentally different from the \"passing on\" which is regarded as the hallmark of an indirect tax.\nMy conclusion on this point is, therefore, that, as the general tendency of this tax is such as to make it a direct tax, and, as the appellant is a final user of the personal property here in question, the appellant is not relieved from liability for payment of the tax because he might be able, in his own case, to pass it on. Nor do I think that the words of the statute must be construed in each individual case in a manner which ensures that the tax shall never apply to a taxpayer who could establish the likelihood of his being able to pass it on.\nThe appellant further contended that the wording of the Act is incomprehensible and should not be construed as imposing any valid tax. The basis of this argument is that the taxing provisions, such as s. 5(1), when read in the light of the definitions contained in the interpretation section, have no meaning because in various instances a definition paragraph, in defining a word, has, in the definition, made use of other words, also having a defined meaning, the definitions of which, in turn, relate back to the word defined. For example, the definition of \"consumer\" commences with the words \"any person who within the province purchases from a vendor\", while the definition of \"vendor\" is \"any person \u2026 who, within the province \u2026 sells \u2026 to a consumer \u2026.\" Applying these definitions, therefore, s. 5(1) would apply to \"every person who purchases from any person who sells to any person who purchases from any person who sells to \u2026 etc. etc.\"\nThis argument may constitute a valid criticism of the draftsmanship of the interpretation section, but it pays attention only to the words of each definition which are themselves defined and overlooks the other limiting parts of the definition of each word; for example, that a consumer is one who purchases for his own consumption and that a vendor is one who sells in the course of his business. I think the intent and object of the taxing provisions can be determined satisfactorily with the assistance of the definition paragraphs. The Privy Council was apparently able to interpret the like clauses in the New Brunswick Act in the Conlon case with like definitions. Furthermore, to the extent that the strict definition of any of the words used would be inconsistent with the intent or object of the Act or give an interpretation inconsistent with the word's context, the situation is provided for by subss. (2) and (1) of s. 3 of the Interpretation Act, R.S.S. 1953, c. 1. In my opinion, therefore, the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the plaintiff, appellant: Shumiatcher, Moss & Laverry, Regina.\nSolicitor for the defendant, respondent: E.

A new tail shaft was flown in a specially converted bomber from Wales to Singapore. The claim was for the difference between the cost of flying the new tail shaft and the cost of sending one by sea. The defendants denied liability on the ground that the ship was unseaworthy, and argued that the expense was not an \"extra\" expense incurred in place of another so as to be allowable as general expense within Rule F of the York-Antwerp Rules, 1924. Shortly before beginning its outward voyage, the ship propeller struck a fender log, but inspections showed that no damage had been done. The owner had been alerted to the high incidence of tail shaft failures on ships of that class (although the cause of this failure was still unknown at the time of the loss in this case), and had the tail shaft carefully examined before the outward voyage even though her classification did not require this to be done at the time. The trial judge found that the ship was unseaworthy, but that the carrier had exercised due diligence to make her seaworthy. This judgment was reversed by a majority in the Court of Appeal. The carrier appealed to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be allowed.\nWhen unseaworthiness has been shown to be the cause of the loss, the statutory burden imposed upon the carrier by Art. IV, Rule 1 of the schedule to the Water Carriage of Goods Act, is limited to that of proving the exercise of due diligence to make the ship seaworthy before and at the beginning of the voyage. This burden does not require the carrier to prove either the cause of the loss or the cause of the unseaworthiness and is not to be treated as going so far as to make him prove all the circumstances which explain an obscure situation.\nIn this case, the evidence disclosed that the carrier had met the burden of proving due diligence to make the ship seaworthy before and at the beginning of the voyage. The beginning of the voyage must be taken as the period from at the least the beginning of the loading of the cargo until the ship started on the contemplated voyage. The defect in the tail shaft was a latent one in this case, and due diligence did not require the carrier to install torsiograph equipment and make numerous tests before the cause of the weakness could be determined.\nThe evidence did not warrant the inference that it was usual to charter an aircraft for the purpose of bringing an 8-ton shaft from Wales to Singapore. This was an extra expense incurred in place of that which would have been involved in sending one by sea.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1], reversing a judgment of Whittaker J. Appeal allowed.\nJ. I. Bird and W. C. D. Tuck, for the plaintiff, appellant.\nC. C. I. Merritt and D. B. Smith, for the defendants, respondents.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nRITCHIE J.:\u2014This action was brought by the appellant for General Average Contribution from the respondents as owners of cargo carried in the appellant's steamship Lake Chilco on September 20, 1947, when that ship's tail shaft broke while at sea in calm weather as a result of what was later discovered to be a defect in the design of the main propulsion machinery.\nThe 38 Bills of Lading covering the cargo in question were identical in form and variously related to the carriage of goods from Mombasa, Colombo and Singapore to Los Angeles and Vancouver. These contracts were all expressed to be subject to the Water Carriage of Goods Act, 1936 (Can.), c. 49 (now R.S.C. 1952, c. 291), and to the York-Antwerp Rules, and each contained the following clause:\n10. General Average shall be adjusted according to York Antwerp Rules, 1924, and, as to matters not therein provided for, according to the laws and usages of the Dominion of Canada, and the general average shall be prepared by average adjusters selected by the carrier, the said adjusters to attend to the settlement and collection of the average subject to the customary charges.\nIn the event of accident, danger, damage or disaster, before or after commencement of the voyage resulting from any cause whatsoever, whether due to negligence or not, for which, or for the consequence of which, the carrier is not responsible by statute, contract, or otherwise, the goods, shippers, consignees or owners of the goods shall contribute with the carrier in general average to the payment of any sacrifices, losses, or expenses of a general average nature that may be made or incurred and shall pay salvage and special charges incurred in respect of the goods. If a salving ship is owned or operated by the carrier, salvage shall be paid for as fully as if such salving ship or ships belonged to strangers.\nSuch deposit as the carrier or his agents may deem sufficient to cover the estimated contribution of the goods and any salvage and special charges thereon shall, if required, be made by the goods, shippers, consignees or owners of the goods to the carrier before delivery.\nThe Lake Chilco was built in British Columbia in 1944 in accordance with plans and specifications approved by Lloyd's Register of Shipping. She was one of the Victory Class ships which are of substantially the same design as, though not identical with, ships of the American Liberty Class. This ship was purchased by the appellant in April 1946 at which time she was inspected and surveyed by the appellant's Superintendent Engineer and a Lloyd's Registered Surveyor, and although the tail shaft was not \"drawn\" at that time the propeller was backed off to permit a visual examination in the normal manner, everything was found to be in order and a Lloyd's Classification Certificate was duly issued. One of the Lloyd's requirements for this ship was that the tail shaft should be drawn and inspected every three years but the next such inspection was not due until August 1947.\nIn April 1947 the Lake Chilco was due to leave on the voyage during which the loss occurred, and it is apparent that at this time the appellant knew that it was a matter of general interest and comment in the shipping and marine insurance world on the west coast that a considerable number of Liberty and Victory Class ships had manifested a tendency to develop a weakness in the tail shaft from some cause then unexplained. In fact the appellant operated 20 such ships, most of which were of the Victory Class, and in January of that same year one of these ships, the Lake Sicamous, had suffered a fractured tail shaft while at sea. These considerations no doubt account, at least in part, for the fact that the Lake Chilco's shaft was drawn and subjected to close examination by a Lloyd's Surveyor when she was in drydock at Vancouver on April 25, 1947, although the classification requirements did not make this necessary. The procedure followed in making this examination was to draw in the shaft, uncouple it and carefully examine the shaft, key, keyway, taper and the bronze liner under a magnifying glass. The rubber sealing ring and the fit of the propeller on the taper were all carefully examined, and all having been found in fit condition, the ship was prepared for sea on April 29. Lloyd's Register of Shipping issued a certificate pursuant to this examination, and although there is some suggestion that the use of substances called magnaflux and magnaglow might have disclosed concealed cracks in the shaft which could not be detected under the magnifying glass, these substances were not available at the time, and it appears to me that the usual standard and approved method of inspection was employed having regard to the then state of knowledge of all concerned, and that there was no neglect or default on the part of the surveyor.\nOn May 9, 1947, while the Lake Chilco was coming alongside the dock at Victoria for the purpose of loading part of her cargo for the outward voyage, her propeller struck a Douglas Fir fender log at the berth, leaving three gashes in the log about 18 inches apart, the deepest of which was about 6 inches. On the following day the master, together with the chief engineer and a marine surveyor, examined the blades and the surveyor reported that:\nIn so far as could be seen blades had suffered no damage and vessel consequently in fit condition to take on part cargo of lumber here and then to proceed to Mainland ports, to complete for destination.\nIt was recommended that close attention be given the action of propeller and shafting while proceeding to these ports, any excessive vibration to be reported at Vancouver, B.C.\nOn May 11 the ship proceeded to New Westminster and thence to Vancouver from which port she sailed bound for Balboa on May 16. During this voyage the shafting was observed in accordance with the recommendations of the surveyor and no unusual vibration which might have indicated propeller damage was noted. The propeller was again seen 3 1\/2-4 feet out of the water when the ship was virtually in ballast after unloading at Beira, Portuguese East Africa in August, and at this time no damage was seen.\nThe ship continued on the voyage and reached Mombasa on August 21, where loading of the first of the cargo in question commenced at 5.45 p.m. on August 25. After completing loading at Mombasa, she proceeded without incident via Zanzibar to Colombo where more of the cargo was loaded and thence to Singapore where loading was completed on September 16 and 17 and from whence she sailed bound for Los Angeles on the evening of the 18th.\nOn the early morning of September 20, in a smooth sea, heavy vibrations suddenly shook the entire ship, and upon investigation it was found that the tail shaft had fractured at the after end and the propeller had dropped off. The Lake Chilco was towed to Singapore where it was found that no appropriate tail shaft was available for replacement, and after making inquiries in Australia, the Orient, Canada, the United States and the United Kingdom it was found that the least costly available shaft from the viewpoint of transportation was one obtainable from Wales, and as a consequence a Halifax bomber aircraft was specially converted and chartered to carry the shaft to Singapore. The cost of transporting this shaft by air was $22,018; the steamer freight would have amounted to $246.75, and the appellant now claims the difference between these two figures, namely, $21,771.25 as a General Average item on the ground that the time saved by flying the shaft out resulted in avoiding Port of Refuge expenses estimated at $24,606, and that the cost of air freight was, therefore, an \"extra expense incurred in place of another expense which would have been allowable as general average\" within Rule F of the York-Antwerp Rules, 1924. The relevant provisions of the York-Antwerp Rules read as follows:\nRULES D. Rights to contribution in general average shall not be affected, though the event which gave rise to the sacrifice or expenditure may have been due to the fault of one of the parties to the advanture; but this shall not prejudice any remedies which may be open against that party for such fault. RULE F. Any extra expenses incurred in place of another expense which would have been allowable as general average shall be deemed to be general average and so allowed, but only up to the amount of the general average expenses avoided.\nIn the event of it being determined that the respondents are liable to contribution, the only item disputed by them is the sum of $10,182 being the amount claimed as their portion of the excess of air over sea freight hereinbefore referred to which they contend to be a \"normal\" rather than an \"extra\" expense and, therefore, not one which is properly allowable as General Average expense.\nThe respondents, however, contend that they are not liable for any contribution at all under the circumstances of this case, alleging that the loss was occasioned by reason of the unseaworthiness of the Lake Chilco. This is expressed in the following language in para. 3 of the defence:\n(a) The said Lake Chilco had, to the knowledge of the Plaintiff, while berthing at Victoria, British Columbia, on the 9th day of May, 1947, struck with her propeller a fender log with such violence as to damage the said tail shaft and to render it liable, or, alternatively, more liable to fracture and the Plaintiff failed to inspect and repair said tail shaft or failed adequately so to do and the Plaintiff permitted the said ship to proceed on the voyage in question in this action with its said tail shaft in said damaged condition and the loss of the said propeller was due directly to said damage; or alternatively to a combination of said damage and the defect in construction hereinafter referred to;\n(b) The Lake Chilco was a vessel of such construction that her tail shaft was, to the knowledge of the Plaintiff, at and before the commencement of the voyage upon which she lost her propeller, liable to fracture and the said Lake Chilco lost her propeller by fracture of her said tail shaft;\n(c) With knowledge of said defect in construction, or of such damage, or alternatively, of both defect and damage, the Plaintiff permitted the said vessel to proceed upon said voyage without carrying with her a spare tail shaft, and the alleged \"substituted expenses\" claimed in the average statement referred to in \u2026 the Statement of Claim were occasioned by such default and such unseaworthiness.\nThe allegation of negligence with respect to failure to carry a spare tail shaft was not sustained by the evidence and little reliance was placed upon this defence either at the trial or on the appeal. These defences must, of course, be viewed in the light of art. III, Rule I and art. IV, Rule I of the Schedule to the said the Water Carriage of Goods Act which read as follows:\nARTICLE III, RULE I.\n1. The carrier shall be bound, before and at the beginning of the voyage, to exercise due diligence to\n(a) make the ship seaworthy;\n(b) properly man, equip, and supply the ship;\n(c) make the holds, refrigerating and cool chambers, and all other parts of the ship in which goods are carried, fit and safe for their reception, carriage and preservation.\nARTICLE IV, RULE I.\n1. Neither the carrier nor the ship shall be liable for loss or damage arising or resulting from unseaworthiness unless caused by want of due diligence on the part of the carrier to make the ship seaworthy, and to secure that the ship is properly manned, equipped and supplied, and to make the holds, refrigerating and cool chambers and all other parts of the ship in which goods are carried fit and safe for their reception, carriage and preservation in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 1 of Article III.\nWhenever loss or damage has resulted from unseaworthiness, the burden of proving the exercise of due diligence shall be on the carrier or other person claiming exemption under this section.\nThe learned trial judge and the members of the Court of Appeal[2] treated the allegations contained in para. 3(a) and (b) of the defence separately, and examined the evidence with a view to determining whether the ship owner exercised due diligence to make the ship seaworthy (a) having regard to the fender log incident, and (b) having regard to its knowledge of the potential tail shaft weakness.\nThere has been no appeal from the following finding of the learned trial judge that the ship was unseaworthy and it can be taken as agreed to by the appellant:\nThe evidence establishes that tail shafts in ships of the Lake Chilco's class were peculiarly susceptible to torsional stress and that this was due to some defect in design of the ship or propulsion machinery. I accept the evidence of the experts who stated that the weakness engendered in the Lake Chilco's shaft as a result of this stress was probably present before the ship left Vancouver on the voyage in question, and, of course, later on when she left Mombasa. I think therefore, that by direct evidence and by inference from all the circumstances this particular allegation of unseaworthiness has been established.\nThe learned trial judge went on to find that the appellant had discharged the onus of proving that it exercised due diligence to make the ship seaworthy within the meaning of arts. III and IV of the Schedule in respect of this defect, and he found also that the respondents had fallen far short of proving unseaworthiness with respect to the fender log incident, but that, in any event, due diligence had been exercised in that regard also. From this decision the respondents appealed to the Court of Appeal for British Columbia, the members of which considered the fender log incident and the state of the appellant's knowledge as two separate issues as to which they were sharply divided in their opinion.\nO'Halloran J.A. found that the learned trial judge did not err in holding that the ship owner had exercised due diligence in respect of the fender log incident and that there was not sufficient evidence to make it more likely than not that this incident was a causative factor in the loss of the propeller. He then went on to hold that the appellant had failed to exercise due diligence to make the ship seaworthy having regard to its knowledge of the frequency of tail shaft failures in Victory Class ships.\nDavey J.A., on the other hand, concluded that due diligence had been exercised by the ship owner except that it had failed to discharge the burden of proving that the fender log incident, when considered together with the weakness of the shaft, did not cause or contribute to the loss, and he held that due diligence had not been exercised in this regard.\nSheppard J.A. agreed with the learned trial judge that, notwithstanding the appellant's knowledge of the tendency to weakness in these shafts, due diligence had been exercised before the commencement of the voyage, and also found that the fender log incident must be disregarded for the reason that it had not contributed to the accident, and, in any event, that the learned trial judge had found due diligence to have been exercised in respect thereof and that this finding should not be disturbed.\nIn the result, the Court of Appeal gave formal judgment setting aside the judgment of the trial judge and dismissing this action, and it is from this judgment that the appellant now appeals. The burden of proving that the loss was caused or contributed to by the fender log incident which was assumed by the respondents by their pleadings must, of course, be considered in light of the statutory rules and provisions hereinbefore recited and of the fact that it is now admitted that the vessel was unseaworthy \"owing to a defect in the design of the main propulsion machinery of the ship\".\nThe decision of Davey J.A. is based in large measure upon the conclusion which he reached as to the nature of this burden. In this regard he expressed himself as follows:\nIn my opinion, appellant's counsel was right in his submission that once he proved, as he did, the ship was unseaworthy at the commencement of the voyage because of the weakened shaft, which caused the casualty, the statutory onus resting on the respondent to prove due diligence required it to show the actual cause of the unseaworthiness, i.e., the cause of the weakened shaft, and that it had exercised due diligence in respect of that cause, or failing proof of the actual cause, to enumerate all probable causes and show that it had been diligent in respect of each.\nThis opinion is based on that portion of the judgment delivered by Fry L.J. in the Merchant Prince[3], where that learned judge discussed the burden resting on a defendant who relies upon inevitable accident as an answer to a claim founded in negligence which reads:\nThey must either shew what was the cause of the accident, and shew that the result of that cause was inevitable; or they must shew all the possible causes, one or other of which produced the effect, and must further shew with regard to every one of these possible causes that the result could not have been avoided.\nThe Merchant Prince was a case in which a ship, moving down a crowded channel on a stormy day, ran into a ship at anchor and could thus only avoid liability by showing inevitable accident. In fact, the accident was not found to have been inevitable at all because it was apparent that the probable cause of the collision was the stretching of a chain in the steering machinery which could and should have been foreseen. That case was not concerned at all with whether or not due diligence had been taken to make the ship seaworthy, the only question at issue being the cause of the collision, and it was held that the circumstances were such as to require the moving ship to prove that all causes of the mishap were beyond its control and could not have been avoided by it. It seems to me that the distinction between the statutory burden of proof imposed by art. IV, Rule I and the burden which falls on a party to a collision who is required to rely upon \"inevitable accident\" by way of defence is that in the latter case the issue to be determined is confined to \"the cause\" of the collision whereas in the former \"unseaworthiness\" must have already been determined to be a \"cause\" of the loss before any burden is cast upon the carrier at all.\nWhen, as in the present case, unseaworthiness has been shown to be the cause, the burden then arising under art. IV is limited to that of \"proving the exercise of due diligence to make the ship seaworthy before and at the beginning of the voyage\". Notwithstanding the views expressed by Davey J.A., this language does not, in my view, serve to shift to the carrier the onus of proving either the cause of the loss or the cause of the unseaworthiness and should not be treated as going so far \"as to make him prove all the circumstances which explain an obscure situation\" such as the one here disclosed (see Dominion Tankers Limited v. Shell Petroleum Company of Canada Limited[4], per Maclean J.).\nThe evidence presented at the trial of this action attributing the loss of the propeller to the effect of torsional vibrations on the propulsion machinery of the ship is, in my opinion, so strong as to exclude the probability of the fender log incident as a contributing cause of the loss, but it is to be remembered that at the time of the striking the appellant had no way of being sure that the shaft would not be weakened by contact with the log, and, accordingly, I think it would have been incautious to ignore the possible effect of this incident on the propeller and the shaft. In this regard, however, I am satisfied that the investigation and inspection carried out in May and the subsequent care and attention given to the matter by the ship's engineer constituted the exercise of due diligence within the meaning of art. IV of the Schedule, and I am not satisfied that if any further steps had been taken any further evidence of damage would have been discovered.\nIt seems to me that much of the difficulty presented by this case has been created by treating the facts as if they gave rise to two separate issues of unseaworthiness casting two separate burdens of proof upon the appellant, one relating to the fender log incident and the other to the state of the appellant's knowledge of the ship's tendency to shaft weakness. In fact there is only one issue which has been hereinbefore stated to be whether or not, having regard to all relevant circumstances, (which would have included the fender log incident if it had been shown to be relevant) the appellant exercised due diligence to make the ship seaworthy \"before and at the beginning of the voyage\".\nAs has been pointed out, the present action is brought pursuant to 38 separate contracts of carriage entered into at Mombasa, Colombo and Singapore and relating to cargoes loaded at those points in August and September 1947. The second paragraph of each of these Bills of Lading reads as follows:\nIt is agreed that the custody and carriage of the goods are subject to the following terms which shall govern the relations, whatsoever they may be, between the shipper, consignee, and the carrier, master and ship in every contingency, wheresoever and whensoever occurring, and also in the event of deviation, or of unseaworthiness of the ship at the time of loading or inception of the voyage or subsequently, and none of the terms of this Bill of Lading shall be deemed to have been waived by the carrier unless by express waiver in writing signed by a duly authorized agent of the carrier.\nIn my view the \"beginning of the voyage\" contemplated by each of those contracts must be taken \"as the period from at least the beginning of the loading\" of the cargoes respectively referred to therein until the vessel started on the voyage contemplated thereby (see in this connection the observations of Lord Somervell in Maxine Footwear Co. Ltd. et al. v. Canadian Government Merchant Marine Ltd.[5]).\nAs the first of these cargoes was loaded at Mombasa on August 25 and as there is no suggestion of any change in the ship's condition or the appellant's state of knowledge between that time and September 20 when the shaft broke, it seems to me that the only question to be determined is whether or not, having regard to the state of its knowledge at that time and to all other relevant circumstances, the appellant exercised due diligence to make the Lake Chilco seaworthy before starting to load her cargo at Mombasa. In determining this question, it is to be remembered that as Lord Sumner said in F. O. Bradley and Sons Lim. v. Federal Steam Navigation Co. Lim.[6]:\nIn the law of carriage by sea neither seaworthiness nor due diligence is absolute. Both are relative, among other things, to the state of knowledge and the standard prevailing at the material time.\nIt was apparently made known to the appellant by a letter dated July 11 which is not in evidence that the torsional characteristics of the propulsion system of Liberty Class ships was under investigation by the American Bureau of Shipping in the Summer of 1947, but the results of this investigation, disclosing as they did the cause of the shaft weakness, were not made known until January 1948. In the meantime, the only specific recommendation made known to the appellant by the American Bureau of Shipping was contained in a letter of May 20 to which reference will hereafter be made and was to the effect that the shafts in these ships should be drawn every two years.\nIn view of the fact that the cause of this loss was only finally determined in January 1948 after prolonged investigation and experiment, it is perhaps helpful to recall what was said by Scrutton L.J. when the last-noted case was before the Court of Appeal in England. In speaking of the standard of seaworthiness, he made the following observations which are reported in 24 Lloyd's Law List at pp. 454-455:\nThe vessel is to be reasonably fit. It certainly need not have fittings or instruments which had not at the time been invented, because by subsequent inquiry a danger has been discovered which these fittings and instruments when invented might avert. While the shipowner may be bound to add improvements in fittings where the improvement has become well known or the discovery of danger established, the position is quite different where at the time of the voyage the discovery had not been made or the danger discovered. It is not enough in my view to say, \"we have now after the event discovered that there was a danger to which the cargo was exposed, the nature of which was unknown at the time; and, the danger being known, we have thought of a remedy, which was not common knowledge at the time, and which a prudent owner would not be imprudent in neglecting, having regard to the existing state of knowledge.\" In the present case O'Halloran J.A. has made the following finding:\nIt was the frequency of tail shaft failures at sea that made clear the inherent unseaworthiness of the ship. With that knowledge the shipowner took a calculated risk that a tail shaft failure would not happen during the voyage; in these circumstances the shipowner cannot claim immunity because he did not know the exact cause of the failure.\nIt is true that there is evidence to the effect that in the month of April 1947 the appellant had been alerted to the high incidence of tail shaft failures in American Liberty Class ships and to a lesser extent in those of the Canadian Victory Class, and that this situation had been brought home to the appellant by the loss of the shaft of the Lake Sicamous in January 1947, but in my view this does not make clear \"the inherent unseaworthiness\" of the particular ship here in question.\nThe evidence with respect to tail shaft failures is that in 1949 it was reported in \"Transactions of the Institution of Naval Architects\" that 583 shafts were renewed and 100 of these ships had been disabled at sea by reason of tail shaft failure in the three years preceding December 1, 1948. There is no evidence as to how many of these ships were afloat during the period in question and the record is also silent as to the age of the ships encountering such failures and of the shafts that failed, and there is certainly no suggestion that any such failure occurred in a ship that was only three years old whose shaft had been drawn and passed as sound by a competent surveyor four months before breaking. On the other hand, it is shown that of the 20 of such ships operated by the appellant, only one had experienced such a failure and the cause of this failure was still unknown in August 1947.\nThe fact that special care was taken to examine the tail shaft at the time of purchase in 1946 and that this shaft was drawn and carefully examined in April 1947, although its classification did not require this to be done, indicates that the appellant was exercising more than ordinary caution because of the concern evinced in shipping circles about these failures, but it does not indicate to me that the appellant or anyone else appreciated that there was any risk of the shaft of the Lake Chilco breaking while she was at sea. In assessing the knowledge attributable to the appellant in August 1947, the letter of May 21 from the American Bureau of Shipping seems to me to be most significant. I think it can be taken from the terms of that letter that it represented the considered opinion of a very influential body in the shipping world as to the best remedy that could at that time be suggested for tail shaft failures in Liberty Class vessels and I think also that the ship owner was entitled to treat this as an authoritative guide in assessing the best method of limiting or excluding the risk, if any, of tail shaft breakage in these ships. The terms of the letter were as follows:\nAs you are aware, the record of failures at sea on tailshafts on the above mentioned vessels is quite abnormal and is a matter of considerable concern to all interested partners.\nThe Bureau Rules require tailshafts, with continuous liners, to be drawn every three years and in view of the above circumstances it is strongly recommended that the period between tailshaft drawings should not exceed two years for the Liberty type vessels.\nIt would be greatly appreciated if you would change your schedules for tailshaft drawing due dates to conform with the above recommendation and also advise your field representatives accordingly. On those vessels whose tailshaft drawings are due within a year, the shafts should be drawn for examination on the occasion of the next drydocking of the vessel.\nThe further letter of July 11, 1947, from the same source which has been hereinbefore referred to made no further recommendations and no further warnings were issued concerning these shafts before the time of loading at Mombasa.\nThe Lake Chilco was a comparatively new ship built in accordance with widely accepted standards; it is not suggested that she had had any previous trouble either with her shaft or otherwise and she had been subjected to a survey of her shaft and other machinery in April. I am accordingly of opinion that at the time when loading commenced at Mombasa on August 25 the owner was justified in regarding this as a seaworthy ship, subject only to a potential weakness of unknown origin in her propulsion system which made it necessary to have the tail shaft drawn and inspected every two years rather than every three years. In these circumstances and as the tail shaft had been drawn only four months earlier, I do not think that it was unreasonable for a carrier to load cargo nor do I think that in so doing the appellant was exposing the respondents to any risk of which it was or ought to have been aware other than the normal risks attendant upon any marine adventure.\nThe contention that something more should have been done before leaving Vancouver to discover the potential weakness seems to me to be met, at least in part, by a consideration of the length of time taken by experts working with special equipment before the cause of the weakness was determined. In saying this, I am not ignoring the fact that the investigation by the American Bureau of Shipping was delayed through a strike, but even when allowance is made for this delay it seems apparent that the defect was not one which could be discovered by any of the usual and accepted methods of inspection currently employed on the west coast of Canada in April 1947.\nIn any event, the appellant more than complied with the requirements of Lloyd's Register of Shipping in maintaining the Lake Chilco and it is to be remembered that one paragraph of the written \"Admission of Facts\" agreed to on behalf of the respondents reads as follows:\nLloyds Register of Shipping was established for the purpose of obtaining for the use of Merchant Shipowners and Underwriters a faithful and accurate classification of mercantile shipping, and many shipowners as a matter of sound commercial practice maintain their vessels in accordance with the requirements of this Classification Society. (The italics are mine.)\nWhile not express, it does seem to me that this constitutes a tacit recognition of the fact that the requirements of \"sound commercial practice\" are considered by many ship owners to be met by maintaining the Lloyd's classification requirements.\nThe decision of O'Halloran J.A. is based in large measure upon the case of Smith Hogg & Co. Ltd. v. Black Sea and Baltic General Insurance Co.[7], also reported in 60 Lloyd's Law List, p. 253, and his reasoning in this regard is disclosed in the following excerpt from his judgment:\nThat case has basic similarities with the present case in that (a) the happening which actually brought about the loss crystallized a substantial time after the ship had commenced her voyage; and (b) the cause of the disaster was the ship's instability which made the ship unseaworthy when she sailed from Soroka. In the Smith Hogg case the unseaworthiness was due to its large negative metacentric height, and in our case was due to torsional vibration, both due to the design of the ship; (c) the ship owners in the Smith Hogg case were held not to have exercised due diligence; with due deference the same reasoning applies here, for the lack of due diligence here was sending an unseaworthy ship to sea; (d) in each case the true cause of the loss was not the lack of due diligence in the conventional sense but inherent unseaworthiness springing from the fault of the ship owners in knowingly sending an unseaworthy ship to sea; in the Smith Hogg case owing to its instability and in this case owing to its being subject to tail shaft failure at sea; and (e) in either case the disaster would not have occurred but for the unseaworthiness when the ship was sent to sea.\nI do not find it necessary to analyze the facts of the Smith Hogg case because I accept the view of that case expressed by Lord Wright in the course of his judgment which appears to me to be at variance with the interpretation placed upon it by Mr. Justice O'Halloran. Lord Wright said of the ship involved in that case[8]:\nThe unseaworthiness, constituted as it was by loading an excessive deck cargo, was obviously only consistent with want of due diligence on the part of the shipowner to make her seaworthy. Hence the qualified exception of unseaworthiness does not protect the shipowner. In effect, such an exception can only excuse against latent defects. The overloading was the result of overt acts.\nAs I understood it, Mr. Bird, on behalf of the appellant, rejected the suggestion that the potential weakness of the Lake Chilco's shaft was \"a latent defect\", and while it is no doubt true that, at least for certain marine insurance purposes, an error in design is not considered to be a latent defect, it nevertheless seems to me that the condition of the shaft of the Lake Chilco, when it was inspected in April, was such that its potential weakness was not discoverable by the exercise of due diligence, and that the defect was \"latent\" in the sense in which Lord Wright used that word in the passage above quoted.\nThe observations of Kennedy J. in Jackson v. Mumford[9], have been widely quoted as indicating one of the limitations of the words \"latent defect in the machinery\" for purposes of the marine insurance clause there under consideration. He there says:\nBut for the purposes of today it is sufficient for me, without attempting to define its boundaries, to say that the phrase, at all events, does not, in my view, cover the erroneous judgment of the designer as to the effect of the strain which his machinery will have to resist, the machinery itself being faultless, the workmanship faultless, and the construction precisely that which the designer intended it to be. Although the defect in the design of the main propulsion machinery of the Lake Chilco would, no doubt, not be a latent defect within the meaning of Jackson v. Mumford, supra, it nonetheless seems to me that it had much in common with the kind of defect to which Branson J. referred in Corporacion Argentina de Productores de Carnes v. Royal Mail Lines, Ltd.[10], when he said:\nSupposing that one had a tail-shaft which had a flaw in it which nobody could possibly discover by any examination short of destroying the thing, and that tail-shaft broke, it would be no answer to the shipowner's defence that there was a latent defect not discoverable by due diligence, to say that it might be he had not exercised any diligence to look at that tail-shaft at all. If the defect is such that it cannot be discoverable by due diligence it becomes immaterial to consider whether due diligence was exercised or not, because ex hypothesi if it had been exercised it would have been useless.\nAlthough the defect in the present case was in the design rather than in the shaft itself and it would not have been necessary to destroy the thing in order to discover the weakness, it is nonetheless apparent from the American Bureau of Shipping letter of January 8 that it was necessary to install \"torsiograph\" equipment on a ship and to conduct numerous experiments before the cause of the weakness could be determined and in my view the exercise of due diligence to make the ship seaworthy under the circumstances did not require the ship owner to install such equipment even if it had been available or to make such tests.\nAlthough I agree with Mr. Justice Branson when he says that \"if the defect is such that it cannot be discoverable by due diligence, it becomes immaterial to discover whether due diligence was exercised \u2026.\". I do not base my decision on this premise because I consider that the evidence discloses that due diligence was in fact exercised by the appellant in this case in the manner and for the purposes required by arts. III and IV of the Schedule of the Water Carriage of Goods Act, and I am, therefore, of opinion that the respondents are liable for contribution in General Average in respect of the expenses consequent upon the loss of the ship's propeller in the manner and to the amount determined by the Average Adjustment statement which is an exhibit in this case. As has been indicated, the respondents contend that they are not liable for the difference in cost between the amount of freight which would have had to be paid if the shaft had been shipped from England by sea and the amount which actually was paid in bringing it out by air. This contention is based on the ground that spare parts for ships are frequently flown into Singapore by air and that the cost of flying the shaft was a usual expense and not one of the \"extra\" expenses contemplated by Rule F of the York-Antwerp Rules. In my view the evidence does not warrant the inference that it is usual to charter an aircraft for the purpose of bringing an 8-ton shaft from Wales to Singapore, and I cannot treat this as anything other than an extra expense which was incurred in place of the expense which would have been involved if the ship had been required to remain at Singapore while a shaft was being sent out by sea.\nIn view of all the above, I would allow this appeal with costs and restore the judgment of the learned trial judge.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the plaintiff, appellant: Campney, Owen & Murphy, Vancouver.\nSolicitors for the defendants, respondents: Bull, Housser, Tupper, Ray, Guy & Merritt, Vancouver.\n[1] (1959), 20 D.L.R.

(Defendant) Respondent.\n1960: March 9, 10, 11; 1960: June 24.\nPresent: Taschereau, Cartwright, Fauteux, Abbott and Judson JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE EXCHEQUER COURT OF CANADA.\nCopyright\u2014Infringement\u2014Broadcast of opera \"Pell\u00e9as et M\u00e9lisande\"\u2014Whether copyright protected in Canada\u2014Registration\u2014Assignment\u2014The Copyright Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 55\u2014History of Copyright legislation.\nThe plaintiff brought this action against the defendant for infringement of the copyright resulting from the broadcast of \"Pell\u00e9as et M\u00e9lisande\", an opera of which the plaintiff claimed to be the proprietor of both the copyright and the performing rights. The plaintiff had not registered the work, or otherwise complied with the Canadian copyright legislation in force in Canada prior to January 1, 1924. The Exchequer Court held that the authors had validly assigned their copyright and performing rights to the plaintiff's predecessors in title, but dismissed the action on the grounds that (1) the plaintiff had assigned its rights to sue directly to Sacem, a society of authors, etc., in France, and (2) that it had failed to comply with the requirements of s. 48 of the Copyright Act. The plaintiff appealed to this Court and the defendant cross-appealed against the finding that the plaintiff held the copyright and the performing rights.\nHeld: The appeal should be allowed and the cross-appeal dismissed.\nThe evidence made it clear that the plaintiff had not given Sacem the performing rights in this opera, and consequently the plaintiff was not precluded from suing for infringement. Furthermore, there was no evidence to support the finding that s. 48 of the Act applied to the plaintiff.\nAs to the cross-appeal. It was clear that s. 4 of the Act applied to rights acquired on or after January 1, 1924, and, therefore, the contention that the plaintiff had acquired rights under that section could not be supported. However, by virtue of the combined application of various Imperial statues, the Berne convention of 1885 and Canadian legislation in force in Canada prior to January 1, 1924, the plaintiff, as the successor in title to the authors, was entitled to the copyright and performing rights in the opera in the United Kingdom and throughout the British Dominions, including Canada. The plaintiff was also entitled to the substituted right provided for under s. 42 of the Act and such right was in force when the present action was taken.\nAPPEAL and Cross-Appeal from a judgment of Dumoulin J. of the Exchequer Court of Canada1, dismissing an action for infringement of copyright.\nR. Quoin, Q.C., and R. Quoin, Jr., for the plaintiff, appellant.\nG. F. Henderson, Q.C., and R. McKercher, for the defendant, respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nAbbott J.:\u2014The present action was brought by appellant alleging infringement of copyright by reason of the broadcasting on March 12, 1950, of a series of records over Radio Station CHLP then owned and operated by the respondent. The broadcast consisted of a major portion of the well-known opera \"Pell\u00e9as et M\u00e9lisande\", of which the appellant claims to be proprietor of both the copyright and the performing rights.\n[Page 651].\nThe relevant facts can be shortly stated. The opera In question, the lyrics of which were written by Maurice Maeterlinck and the music composed by Claude Debussy was first publicly performed at the Op\u00e9ra Comique in Paris on April 30, 1902. At that time, Maeterlinck was a citizen of and resident in Belgium and Debussy a citizen of and resident in France. The appellant firm has been engaged for many years in France in the business of acquiring copyright in and promoting the licensing of literary, dramatic and musical works and, depending upon the character of the work, grants licences itself or does so through agents delegated by it to grant licences and to collect royalties. It bases its title to copyright and performing rights in the said opera upon an assignment from the authors dated March 31, 1905. Debussy died in 1918 and Maeterlinck in 1949.\nIt is common ground that appellant did not register the work in question under, or otherwise comply with, the Canadian copyright legislation in force in Canada prior to January 1, 1924, and that it had therefore acquired no copyright or performing rights in Canada prior to that date, apart from any such rights to which statutes of the United Kingdom then in force in Canada might entitle it.\nThe learned trial judge2 found that the authors Maeterlinck and Debussy had validly assigned their copyright and performing rights to appellant's predecessors in title. There is ample evidence to support that finding and it should not be disturbed. He held however that while appellant was vested with the copyright to the work in question the present action must be dismissed because (1) appellant had assigned its rights to sue directly, to a society of authors, composers and publishers of music in France\u2014 known colloquially as SACEM\u2014and (2) because it came within the provisions of s. 48 of the Copyright Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 55, and had failed to comply with the requirements of that section.\nAppellant appealed from that judgment, limiting its appeal to two issues namely, the findings (1) that appellant's action failed because of the application of s. 48 of the Copyright Act and (2) that it had vested a third party with the right of action. The respondent cross-appealed.\nI shall deal first with the two issues raised in the main appeal. It was established in evidence that the authors Maeterlinck and Debussy were members of SACEM, that appellant had adhered to its statutes and by-laws, and that SACEM had authorized \"Canadian Publishers and Authors Association of Canada Limited\" a performing rights society doing business in Canada\u2014known colloquially as CAPAC\u2014to grant licences in Canada for works included in SACEM's repertoire. It was also established that in 1950 respondent had paid an annual fee to CAPAC which authorized respondent to broadcast all works included in the repertoire of that society. The Assistant General Representative of SACEM for the United States, Canada and Mexico, called as a witness, testified positively however, that \"Pell\u00e9as et M\u00e9lisande\" was not included in the repertoire of his society and that the society did not grant licences for the performing rights to that work. Aside from any other consideration, in the light of that evidence, I am unable with respect, to agree with the finding of the learned trial judge that, because of its arrangements with SACEM, appellant was precluded from suing respondent for infringement.\nThe learned trial judge also held that appellant came within the terms of s. 48 of the Copyright Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 55, relating to performing rights societies. That section reads in part as follows:\n48. (1) Each society, association or company that carries on in Canada the business or acquiring copyrights of dramatico-musical or musical works or of performing rights therein, and deals with or in the issue or grant of licences for the performance in Canada of dramatico-musical or musical works in which copyright subsists, shall, from time to time, file with the Minister at the Copyright Office lists of all dramatico-musical and musical works, in current use in respect of which such society, association or company has authority to issue or grant performing licences or to collect fees, charges or royalties for or in respect of the performance of its works in Canada.\nThere was no evidence that appellant \"carries on in Canada the business of acquiring copyrights of dramatico-musical or musical works or of performing rights therein\" and, with respect, the learned trial judge was in error, in my opinion, in holding that the section applied to appellant.\nThis disposes of the main appeal but by its cross-appeal respondent has appealed against the finding of the learned trial judge that appellant holds the copyright and performing rights to the opera in question.\nThe existence of such rights depends upon the interpretation and effect to be given to the Copyright Act, 1921, c. 24 (now R.S.C. 1952, c. 55) and in particular to sections 4, 42, 45 and 47 of that Act. Appellant's contention that it was entitled to copyright in the work in question under s. 4 of the Act, in my opinion, cannot be supported. That section reads in part as follows:\n4. (1) Subject to the provisions of this Act, copyright shall subsist in Canada for the term hereinafter mentioned, in every original literary, dramatic, musical and artistic work, if the author was at the date of the making of the work a British subject, a citizen or subject of a foreign country that has adhered to the Convention and the Additional Protocol thereto set out in the Second Schedule, or resident within Her Majesty's Dominions; and if, in the case of a published work, the work was first published within Her Majesty's Dominions or in such foreign country; but in no other works except so far as the protection conferred by this Act is extended as hereinafter provided to foreign countries to which this Act does not extend.\nReading the Act as a whole, it is clear, in my opinion, that s. 4 was intended to operate prospectively, and that it applies only to rights acquired on or after January 1, 1924, the date upon which the Act became effective. The scheme upon which the Act is drawn up is to deal with copyright law as it is to be under the Act when it comes into force, leaving for special treatment a subject which requires special treatment\u2014namely, the grafting into the new and comprehensive code of law of all works in respect of which copyright, performing rights and common law rights existed under the old law; see Coleridge-Taylor v. Novello & Co. Ltd.3 and Fox Canadian Law of Copyright, at p. 220. Such special treatment is provided by s. 42. That section and the First Schedule of the Act unconditionally preserved existing rights by providing\nWhere any person is immediately before the 1st day of January, 1924, entitled to any such right in any work as is specified in the first column of the First Schedule, or to any interest in such a right, he is, ns from that date, entitled to the substituted right set forth in the second column of that Schedule, or to the same interest in such a substituted right, and to no other right or interest, and such substituted right shall subsist for the term for which it would have subsisted if this Act had been in force at the date when the work was made, and the work had been one entitled to copyright thereunder.\nIn order to be entitled to the substituted right under s. 42 and the First Schedule, a right must have subsisted immediately prior to January 1, 1924.\nThe Canadian Copyright Act in force prior to January 1, 1924 (the Dominion Copyright Act, 1875, 38 Vic. c. 88, carried forward with some amendments into the Revised Statutes of Canada 1906 as chapter 70) did not deal with performing rights\u2014as distinct from copyright\u2014in dramatic, musical, or dramatic-musical works, and under the Canadian legislation in force in 1902 (the 1875 Act with amendments) copyright in dramatic or musical works existed only if such works were registered under the Act and notice given on the printed work. As I have said, it is common ground that no such formalities were ever complied with in Canada. However, certain Imperial Statutes to which I shall refer presently, did deal specifically with performing rights, as distinct from copyright.\nIt follows that any performing right which appellant may have held in Canada prior to January 1, 1924, could only have existed by virtue of such Imperial Statutes. The Imperial Statutes having particular relevance are the Dramatic Copyright Act, 1833, 3-4 Will. IV, c. 15, the Copyright Act, 1842, 5-6 Vic. c. 45, the International Copyright Act, 1886, 49-50 Vic. c. 33, and an Order-in-Council passed in 1887, under the last mentioned Act, adopting the Berne Convention.\nThe Dramatic Copyright Act, 1833, was the first statute to grant the exclusive right to perform dramatic compositions. It conferred upon the author of any dramatic piece or his assignee the sole liberty of representing it, or causing it to be represented, at any place or places of dramatic entertainment in any part of the United Kingdom or the British Dominions but it did not touch musical compositions. The performing rights in musical compositions were protected for the first time by the Copyright Act, 1842, which enacted that the provisions of the Dramatic Copyright Act, 1833, and the Copyright Act, 1842, should apply to musical compositions and that the sole liberty of representing or performing any dramatic or musical composition should endure and be the property of the author and his assigns for the term provided in the 1842 Act for the duration of copyright in books. That term was fixed as being the life of the author and seven years after his death or forty-two years, whichever should be the longer. Both the 1833 Act and the 1842 Act were made applicable to the British Dominions and called for registration at Stationers' Hall in London.\nPrior to 1911 the right of foreigners to obtain copyright protection in the United Kingdom depended upon various Copyright Acts (including the Acts of 1833 and 1842 to which I have referred) and two International Copyright Acts, namely the International Copyright Act, 1844, 7-8 Vic. c. 12 and the International Copyright Act, 1886. Both these latter Acts provided for coyright protection to foreigners upon their complying with certain registration requirements, and were made applicable to all British Dominions. The International Copyright Act, 1886, was enacted following the International Conference held in Berne in 1885, and it empowered the Crown, by Order-in-Council, to adhere to the Convention agreed to at that Conference. Both France and Belgium were also adherents to the Convention. On November 28, 1887, an Order-in-Council was passed giving effect to the Berne Convention, which (translated into English) appears as a Schedule to the Order. As a consequence, under the International Copyright Act, 1886, and the Order-in-Council of November 28, 1887, the Berne Convention itself and the subsequent Act of Paris, were made effective in Great Britain, became part of the municipal law, and, as such, have been interpreted by the Courts; Hanfstaengl v. Empire Palace4. The same result followed in the British Dominions (including Canada) to which the Act of 1886 and the Order-in-Council were made applicable.\nCounsel for respondent argued before us that notwithstanding the provisions of the International Copyright Act, 1886, and the Order-in-Council of 1887, registration was still required under the Copyright Act, 1842, and the Dramatic Copyright Act, 1833, and that such registration not having been made, no copyright existed under the said Acts. He relied for that proposition upon the opinion expressed by Sterling J. in Fishburn v. Hoilingshead5, but that decision was overruled by the Court of Appeal in Hanfstaengl v. American Tobacco Company6, which held that in the case of foreign works to which the International Copyright Act, 1886, and the Order-in-Council applied, registration was no longer required.\nThe Copyright Act, 1842, the Dramatic Copyright Act, 1833, and the International Copyright Acts, were repealed by the Copyright Act, 1911, 1-2 Geo. V, c. 46, a consolidating and amending Act covering the whole subject of copyright. The 1911 Act did not extend to a self-governing Dominion unless declared by the legislature of that Dominion to be in force therein, but it conferred authority upon a Dominion legislature, to repeal (subject to the preservation of all legal rights existing at the time of such repeal) any or all enactments passed by the Imperial Parliament (including the Act of 1911) so far as operative within such Dominion. Pursuant to that authority, the Canadian Copyright Act, 1921, 11-12 Geo. V, c. 24, which was in large part based on the Imperial Act of 1911, and which came into force on January 1, 1924, repealed (1) all the Imperial enactments relating to copyright so far as their application to Canada was concerned and (2) all prior Canadian legislation upon the subject, saving of course any legal rights existing at the time of such repeal.\nIn Routledge v. Low7, the Judicial Committee held that the Imperial Copyright Act, 1842, extended the protection of British copyright to all the British Dominions. Following the enactment of the Canadian Copyright Act in 1875, notwithstanding the fact that the Canadian Parliament had exercised its power under s. 91 of the British North America Act, 1867, to pass a statute relating to copyright, the Ontario Court of Appeal decided in Smiles v. Beljord8, that the Copyright Act, 1842, was also in force in Canada, and that decision was followed in Black v. Imperial Book Co.9. Appeal was taken to the Supreme Court of Canada in the Imperial Book Company case10, but this Court dismissed the appeal upon other grounds and expressly refrained from expressing an opinion one way or the other upon the question as to whether Smiles v. Belford was rightly decided. Since the enactment of the Copyright Act, 1921, this constitutional question has of course become one of diminishing importance. Smiles v. Belford, however, has been consistently followed in the Canadian courts, accepted by the text writers and, in my respectful opinion, it correctly stated the law.\nIt follows that in my opinion (i) the Dramatic Copyright Act, 1833, the Copyright Act, 1842, the International Copyright Act, 1886, the Order-in-Council passed under the latter Act in November 1887, and the terms of the Berne Convention itself, all applied in Canada prior to January 1, 1924, and (ii) that under their combined application, immediately before that date the appellant, as the successor in title to Maeterlinck and Debussy, was entitled to the copyright and performing rights in the opera \"Pell\u00e9as et M\u00e9lisande\" in the United Kingdom and throughout the British Dominions, including Canada.\nThere remains the question as to whether appellant became entitled to the substituted right provided for under s. 42 of the Copyright Act, 1921, now R.S.C. 1952, c. 55. On this point the decision of the Judicial Committee in Mansell v. Star Printing & Publishing Co. of Toronto Ltd11 is of little assistance. The artistic copyright in issue in that case, subsisted in the United Kingdom under the Fine Arts Copyright Act, 1862, 25-26 Vic. c. 68, which was never in force in Canada, and copyright in Canada could only have existed therefore by registration under the Canadian Act of 1906 which had not been done.\nIn Francis Day & Hunter v. Twentieth Century Fox Corporation12, however, the literay work concerned came under the Imperial Copyright Act, 1842, which was in force in Canada. The Judicial Committee was able to dispose of the controversy in that case upon another ground without deciding whether appellant was entitled to the substituted right under s. 42. However, it is to be observed that before dealing with that other ground Lord Wright at p. 197 after stating the arguments of counsel on this point, used the expression \"assuming, but not deciding, that the appellant company is entitled to the copyright in Canada which it claims\". I might add here that the record in the present case shows that appellant had complied with the requirements of the Copyright (Musical Compositions) Act, 1882, 45-46 Vic. c. 40, which their Lordships held in the Francis Day and Hunter case extended to Canada by necessary implication and effect although not in terms extended to this country.\nI am satisfied that the substituted right provided by s. 42 of the Act of 1921, does apply to copyright subsisting in Canada prior to January 1, 1924, by virtue of Imperial legislation in force in Canada prior to that date as well as to copyright subsisting by virtue of prior Canadian legislation, that in consequence appellant became entitled to that substituted right, and that such right was in force when the present action was taken.\nIn the result the appeal should be allowed and the cross-appeal dismissed. There would seem to be no necessity now to grant appellant the injunction asked for. No special damages were alleged or proved but appellant claimed the sum of $600 for what it describes as punitive damages. There appears to have been only one broadcast by respondent of the opera in question, and in the circumstances, I would award appellant damages in the sum of $600, the amount claimed in the action.\nAppellant is entitled to its costs in the Exchequer Court and on the appeal and cross-appeal to this Court.\nAppeal allowed and cross-appeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the plaintiff, appellant; Quain & Quain, Ottawa.\nSolicitors for the defendant, respondent; Gowling, Mactavish, Osborne & Henderson.

Sydney Halter (Plaintiffs) Respondents.\n1960: April 26, 27; 1960: June 13.\nPresent: Kerwin C.J. and Cartwright, Martland, Judson and Ritchie JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR BRITISH COLUMBIA\nTrusts and Trustees\u2014Will containing insurance trust declaration\u2014Whether to be regarded as separate documents\u2014Widow preferred beneficiary\u2014Direction to pay her annual sum out of insurance trust\u2014Whether vested capital interest given to widow\u2014Whether life interest only\u2014The Insurance Act, R.S.B.C. 1948, c. 164, s. 110.\nBy an insurance trust declaration, contained in his will, the testator designated his wife as preferred beneficiary of all his life and accident insurance policies, and therefore under s. 110(1) of the Insurance Act, a trust was created in her favour. The proceeds of the policies were to be held in a separate fund and a specified annual payment was to be made to the wife until the fund was exhausted. The wife received other benefits under the will which provided also for the drawing from the residue of the estate if there was not enough in the insurance fund to make the last annual specified payment. The will further provided for further annual payments to the wife for life out of the residue of the estate, once the insurance fund was exhausted.\nHeld: The wife acquired an immediate absolute interest in the insurance fund, and not merely a life interest.\nPer Kerwin C.J. and Judson J.: There was no contingency or limitation within the meaning of s. 110(3) of the Act. Whether or not the wife was entitled to receive all of the insurance money immediately upon the death of her husband, the ordinary rules as to payment of vested interests were not applicable. The case was to be determined under the Insurance Act. The provisions of the will and of the declaration were to be read separately, but the same conclusion would prevail in this case if the other clauses of the will were considered.\nPer Cartwright, Martland and Ritchie JJ.: Regard should be had to the wording of both documents. On the true construction of the will the testator did not attach any contingency or limitation to the designation of his wife. The direction to pay an annual specified sum did not deprive the wife of the right to demand the whole fund at once. The rule in Saunders v. Vautier (1841) Cr. Ph. 240, that when a vested interest has once been given restrictions postponing the enjoyment of the gift after the donnee has become sui juris are ineffective, was applicable. APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1], reversing a judgment of Brown J. Appeal dismissed.\nJ. R. Nicholson and J. Austin, for the defendants appellants.\nD. McK. Brown, for the plaintiffs, respondents.\nThe judgment of Kerwin C.J. and of Judson J. was delivered by\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE:\u2014The executors and trustees of the will of Isidor Jacob Klein, who, as will be explained, are also trustees under an insurance trust declaration contained in the will, appeal from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[2], DesBrisay C.J. and O'Halloran J.A. (Sidney Smith J.A. dissenting), which reversed in the main a judgment of Brown J. after the trial of an action in which the present respondents, the executors and trustees of the will of Bessie Klein (the widow of Isidor) were plaintiffs and the appellants were defendants.\nThe action was to recover the proceeds of certain insurance policies, including interest and accretions, effected by Isidor Jacob Klein on his life as follows:\nNew York Life Insurance Company\nNo. 7933984\n$ 25,000\nNo. 7057586-D\n2,034\nNo. 7057587-D\n3,078\nCanada Life Assurance Company\nNo. 284683\n15,000\nNo. 294637\n10,000\nSun Life Assurance Company of Canada\nNo. NW-10939\n5,000\nMutual Life Insurance Company of New York\nNo. 2768854\n5,000\nCrown Life Insurance Company\nNo. 319659\n5,000\nThe Mutual Life and Crown Life policies for $5,000 each were by their terms payable to the insured's wife, Bessie Klein; the other policies were payable to the insured's estate.\nMr. Klein died on June 14, 1955, having made his last will and testament dated March 1, 1955, whereby he appointed executors and trustees to whom he devised and bequeathed all his real and personal estate in trust. The clause providing for payment of his debts, funeral and testamentary expenses, succession and probate duties payable in respect of all gifts, devises and bequests and legacies concluded:\nand to pay and satisfy any and all succession and probate duties with regard to or occasioned by the proceeds of any insurance policies, the subject of the Insurance Trust Declaration hereinafter contained.\nThere was then a direction to transfer all personalty to his wife, to permit her to occupy his residence for life and to pay her the sum of $10,000. There were also certain charitable donations and gifts to three employees. The will then continued:\n(f) to hold and dispose of all the rest and residue of my estate for the following purposes:\u2014\n(i) If there be not sufficient left in my Insurance Trust Fund to make the last annual payment of Fifteen Thousand ($15,000.00) Dollars, as is specified in my Insurance Trust Declaration hereinafter contained, then in such case I DIRECT my trustees to draw from my residuary estate, either from income or capital if need be, a sum sufficient to augment the balance of Insurance Trust Fund monies up to the said sum of Fifteen Thousand ($15,000.00) Dollars to permit the said last annual payment.\n(ii) After the Insurance Trust Fund shall have been exhausted by the last of the annual payments of Fifteen Thousand ($15,000.00) Dollars as is hereinafter provided in my Insurance Trust Declaration, then upon such exhaustion my trustees shall pay to my wife during her life, by instalments or otherwise, all the income of the said residue of my estate up to but not exceeding an annual sum of Fifteen Thousand ($15,000.00) Dollars, but if such amount in any year payable to my wife shall fall below Ten Thousand ($10,000.00) Dollars my trustees shall pay out of capital a sum sufficient to pay her Ten Thousand ($10,000.00) Dollars in that year.\nIn clause (f) it was also stated that during the lifetime of the testator's wife his sister and two nieces were to receive annual sums for their respective lives.\nThe insurance trust declaration reads as follows:\nINSURANCE TRUST DECLARATION\nI HEREBY DECLARE AND DESIGNATE my wife, Bessie Klein, to be the preferred beneficiary within the meaning of the \"Insurance Act\" of British Columbia of the Life Insurance policies effected by me in the New York Life Insurance Company numbered 7933984 for $25,000.00; 7057586D for $2,034.00 and 7057587D for $3,078.00; in the Canada Life Assurance Company numbered 284683 for $15,000.00 and 294637 for $10,000.00; in the Mutual Life Insurance Company of New York numbered 2768854 for $5,000.00 and in the Sun Life Assurance Company of Canada numbered N.W. 10939 for $5,000.00 and in the Crown Life Insurance Company, Group G. 145 Certificate No. 4, for $5,000.00, and of all and any life and accident insurance policies taken out by me upon my life and payable to her in the event of my death; I HEREBY DIRECT that the proceeds of all the before mentioned policies are to be held in a separate trust fund to be called my Insurance Trust Fund, the Trustees thereof to be the Trustees hereinbefore named in this my Will who are hereby charged with the administration thereof; AND I DIRECT that my trustees pay to my wife, Bessie Klein, the sum of Fifteen Thousand ($15,000.00) Dollars per year out of the capital or accumulated revenue of the aforesaid Insurance Trust Fund; said year to commence upon the day of my death and the said payments of Fifteen Thousand ($15,000.00) Dollars per year to continue until the entire capital and income of the said fund is used up.\nIt will be noted that the trustees of the insurance trust fund are the same as the trustees of the will. By virtue of various renunciations probate of the will was issued to Montreal Trust Company and Tillie V. Lechtzier. It was not noticed that the renunciations did not apply to the insurance trust fund and therefore the proceeds of all insurance policies mentioned therein, including interest and accretions, were paid by the several companies to the appellants who, at the trial, by their counsel, agreed that all parties would be bound by the final judgment in these proceedings, and in fact the appellants are described not only as executors of the estate of Isidor Jacob Klein but also as \"trustees of the insurance trust fund declared in the last Will of the said Isidor Jacob Klein, deceased\".\nIn addition to referring to the trust declaration and the provisions of the will mentioned above, counsel for the appellants relied upon the fact that the testator appointed the same trustees for his will as for the fund and also to the fact that nothing was given by the will to the wife's relations. Bessie Klein, the wife of Isidor, died on January 9, 1956, having been paid by the appellants one payment of $15,000 on November 8, 1955.\nThe trial judge decided that the proceeds of what are known as the \"wife policies\", i.e., the two policies for $5,000 each, which, by their terms had been payable to the wife, should be paid by the defendants to the plaintiffs but that the action as to the proceeds of the other policies be dismissed. The plaintiffs' appeal to the Court of Appeal was allowed and the defendants' cross-appeal as to the two \"wife policies\" dismissed. The defendants do not now attack the disposition by the two Courts of the proceeds of the \"wife policies\".\nThe appeal is to be decided in accordance with the true meaning of the relevant provisions of the British Columbia Insurance Act, R.S.B.C. 1948, c. 164. Under s. 104(2), Bessie Klein, as the wife of Isidor, was a preferred beneficiary. By s. 77:\n\"Declaration\" means an instrument in writing, signed by the insured, attached to or endorsed on a policy, or an instrument in writing, signed by the insured, in any way identifying the policy or describing the subject of the declaration as the insurance or insurance fund or a part thereof or as the policy or policies of the insured or using language of like import, by which the insured designates or appoints a beneficiary or beneficiaries, or alters or revokes the designation or appointment of a beneficiary or beneficiaries, or apportions or reapportions, or appropriates or reappropriates, insurance-money between or among beneficiaries;\nBy s. 107(1), \"Subject\u2026.. to the provisions of this Part relating to preferred beneficiaries, the insured may designate the beneficiary by the contract or by a declaration\", and by subs. (2) it is enacted that, subject to subs. (1), a beneficiary or a trustee appointed pursuant to s. 132 may at the maturity of the contract enforce for his own benefit or as such trustee the payment of insurance money appointed to him by the declaration and in accordance with the terms thereof. Subsections (1) and (3) of s. 110 are important and read as follows:\n110. (1) Where the insured, in pursuance of the provisions of section 107, designates as beneficiary or beneficiaries a member or members of the class of preferred beneficiaries, a trust is created in favour of the designated beneficiary or beneficiaries, and the insurance-money, or such part thereof as is or has been apportioned to a preferred beneficiary, shall not, except as otherwise provided in this Part, be subject to the control of the insured, or of his creditors, or form part of the estate of the insured.\n***\n(3) The provisions of this section are subject to any vested rights of beneficiaries for value and assignees for value, to the provisions hereinafter contained relating to preferred beneficiaries, and to any contingency or limitation stated in the instrument by which the insured designates a preferred beneficiary: Provided that no provision in any instrument reserving to the insured the right to revoke or abridge the interest of a preferred beneficiary shall be effective so as to enable the insured to revoke or abridge that interest in favour of a person not in the class of preferred beneficiaries. By the insurance trust declaration Isidor Jacob Klein declared and designated his wife Bessie as the preferred beneficiary within the meaning of the Insurance Act and therefore under subs. (1) of s. 110 a trust was created in her favour. Under the circumstances there is nothing \"otherwise provided in this Part\" within the meaning of these words as used in s. 110(1), because the words in subs. (3) relied upon by counsel for the appellants \"the provisions of this section are subject\u2026.. to any contingency or limitation stated in the instrument\" have no application. There is no contingency or limitation. It is true that in the declaration the trustees are directed to pay to the wife $15,000 per year out of the capital or accumulated revenue of the trust fund. I agree with the Chief Justice of British Columbia that this direction does not have the effect of limiting Mrs. Klein's interest in the insurance money to a life interest. Counsel for the respondents submitted that Bessie Klein was not entitled to receive all of the insurance money immediately upon the death of her husband, pointing to the words underlined above in s. 107(2) \"and in accordance with the terms thereof\". Whether this be so or not, I agree with his contention that the ordinary rules as to payment of vested interests are not applicable. They, including the decision in Busch v. Eastern Trust Company[3], as explained in Browne v. Moody[4], can have no application to the present case which must be determined under the provisions of the British Columbia Insurance Act.\nNotwithstanding the argument of counsel for the appellants, in my view the provisions of the will and of the declaration must be read separately as if they appeared in different documents. However, even if one takes into consideration all the other clauses in the will, there is nothing in them to vary the proper construction of the declaration.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nThe judgment of Cartwright, Martland and Ritchie JJ. was delivered by\nCARTWRIGHT J:\u2014The facts and the terms of the will of the late Isidor Jacob Klein, hereinafter referred to as \"the testator\", including the \"Insurance Trust Declaration\" therein contained so far as they are relevant to the questions raised on this appeal are set out in the reasons of the Chief Justice.\nThe answer to the question which we have to decide appears to me to depend upon the true construction of the testator's will.\nIn my opinion, we should have regard not only to the words of the \"Insurance Trust Declaration\" but to those of the whole will, particularly clauses (i) and (ii) of paragraph (f) which are quoted in the reasons of the Chief Justice. In view of the differences of opinion on this point in the courts below and the arguments addressed to us upon it I think it proper to refer to a few authorities which appear to me to be applicable.\nIn Barton v. Fitzgerald[5], Lord Ellenborough C.J. says:\nIt is a true rule of construction that the sense and meaning of the parties in any particular part of an instrument may be collected ex antecedentibus et consequentibus: every part of it may be brought into action in order to collect from the whole one uniform and consistent sense, if that may be done.\nIn Hayne v. Cummings[6], Byles J. says:\nI apprehend it is a sovereign rule in the construction of all written documents, to give effect to the intention of the parties as expressed in the instrument itself, and to give effect if possible to every word, or at all events to every provision.\nIn In re Jodrell3[7], Lord Halsbury L.C. says:\nFor myself, I am prepared to look at the instrument such as it is; to see the language that is used in it; to look at the whole of the document, and not to part of it; and, having looked at the whole of the document, to see (if I can) through the instrument what was the mind of the testator. Those are general principles for the construction of all instruments\u2014and to that extent it may be said that they are canons of construction.\nEven if the \"Insurance Trust Declaration\" and the remainder of the will were to be regarded as separate documents it would be my opinion that both should be looked at since the will refers to and is in some respects dependant upon the terms of the Declaration. In Anderson's Case4[8], Jessel M.R. said at page 99:\nWhere there are two contemporaneous documents executed and assented to by the same persons at the same time (and these really are so substantially, and are therefore to be treated as contemporaneous documents), it appears to me that the ordinary rule applies, according to which contemporaneous documents are to be read together, so that if there is any ambiguity in one it may be explained by the other;\nIn the course of the full and able arguments addressed to us reference was made to a number of sections of the Insurance Act and some questions, as to the effect that these might have in varying circumstances, were debated which do not seem to require decision in this case.\nNo question is now raised as to the two policies in which the widow of the testator was named as beneficiary.\nAs to the remaining policies all of which were payable to the estate of the testator it is clear that he had the right to dispose of their proceeds either by will or by declaration in any way in which he saw fit. In particular if he saw fit to designate his wife as beneficiary he could in the instrument by which he so designated her have stated such contingency or limitation as he wished. He could, for example, have provided that she should receive $15,000 on his death if she were then living and $15,000 on each anniversary of his death on which she was still living, and that on her death any balance remaining should go to other persons or fall into the residue of his estate.\nIn my opinion on the true construction of the will the testator did not attach any contingency or limitation to the designation of his wife. The opening words of the \"Insurance Trust Declaration\" are as follows:\nI HEREBY DECLARE AND DESIGNATE my wife, Bessie Klein, to be the preferred beneficiary within the meaning of the \"Insurance Act\" of British Columbia of the Life Insurance policies effected by me\u2026 (here follow words identifying all the policies).\nThese words appear to me to be unequivocal words of absolute gift which, upon the declaration taking effect, gave the wife an immediate vested interest in the whole of the proceeds of the policies. These words are followed by a semi-colon and the clause continues:\nI HEREBY DIRECT that the proceeds of all the before mentioned policies are to be held in a separate trust fund to be called my Insurance Trust Fund, the Trustees thereof to be the Trustees hereinbefore named in this my Will who are hereby charged with the administration thereof; AND I DIRECT that my trustees pay to my wife, Bessie Klein, the sum of Fifteen Thousand ($15,000.00) Dollars per year out of the capital or accumulated revenue of the aforesaid Insurance Trust Fund; said year to commence upon the day of my death and the said payments of Fifteen Thousand ($15,000.00) Dollars per year to continue until the entire capital and income of the said fund is used up. No doubt the whole of the declaration is to be considered, but I am quite unable to construe the words last quoted as cutting down the absolute gift made in the opening words to a gift of an annuity payable contingently on the wife surviving from year to year until the fund is exhausted.\nIn my view, on the true construction of the whole clause, upon the death of the testator the legal title to the fund made up of the proceeds of the policies in question vested in the trustees and the beneficial title to the whole fund vested indefeasibly in the widow. The direction to pay the fund to the widow at the rate of $15,000.00 a year did not deprive her of the right to demand the whole fund at once, or at any time, had she seen fit to do so.\nIt has often been said that the difficulty in cases of this sort, where words of immediate gift are followed by a direction to pay at a time or times in the future, is to decide whether there is a substantive gift followed by a direction to pay, or whether the only gift is in the direction to pay. In the case at bar I have already stated my view that there is a clear gift in the opening words of the declaration which is not cut down by any other provision in the will.\nFrom reading the whole of the Declaration in the light of the provisions of clauses (i) and (ii) of paragraph (f) it is obvious that the testator did not intend or anticipate that his widow should receive immediate payment of the whole fund. His expressed intention is that she should receive it in annual instalments of $15,000.00. This intention is defeated not by reason of any difficulty in construction of the terms of the will but by the operation of the rule of law usually referred to as the rule in Saunders v. Vautier[9], which makes it clear that when a vested interest has once been given restrictions postponing the enjoyment of the gift after the donee has become sui juris are ineffective. I would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the defendants, appellants: Guild, Nicholson, Yule, Schmitt, Lane & Collier, Vancouver.\nSolicitors for the plaintiffs, respondents: Russell & DuMoulin, Vancouver.\n[1] (1960), 23 D.L.R.

Sideleau Mis-En-Cause.\n1960: June 2, 3; 1960: June 24.\nPresent: Taschereau, Fauteux, Abbott, Judson and Ritchie JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OP QUEEN'S BENCH, APPEAL SIDE, PROVINCE OF QUEBEC.\nContracts\u2014Building contract\u2014Extension to building\u2014Final cost\u2014Whether contract at fixed price\u2014Whether settlement of all claims\u2014Action to enforce builder's privilege\u2014Civil Code, art. 1690.\nBy a contract between the appellant and L, the latter undertook to build an extension or addition to the hotel owned by the appellant. L was furnished with a sketch and rough plan and specification. The contract stipulated the payment of $16,000 in instalments. L was to be paid 10 percent as his fee, but agreed, in the event that the contract was to run in excess of the $16,000, to waive this percentage charge on the excess, on condition that the appellant pay the installments as before. The eventual cost far exceeded the amount of $16,000. The appellant-paid the contract price and give two promissory notes to L for $3,000 each, paying both at maturity. He refused to pay the excess, and took the position that the contract was a contract at a fixed price within art. 1690 of the Civil Code, and furthermore that L had accepted the second promissory note in full and final settlement of all his claims.\nThe respondent, as trustee of the estate of L, a bankrupt, took an action to enforce a builder's privilege. The appellant took an action to have the registration of such privilege declared null and void. The respondent's action was allowed and the appellant's dismissed by the trial judge. These judgments were reversed by the Court of Appeal.\nHeld: Both appeals should be dismissed.\nThere was no evidence to support the contention that the second note was accepted by L in final settlement of all his claims. Moreover, no fee for L's services was included in the total payments made by the appellant. The sketch and plan furnished by the appellant could do no more than give a general idea of the extent and character of the work to be done, and it was obvious that the parties had contemplated that there would be changes and alterations and that the estimated cost would be exceeded. The contract was not undertaken at a fixed price and art. 1690 had therefore no application.\nAPPEALS from two judgments of the Court of Queen's Bench, Appeal Side, Province of Quebec1, reversing two judgments of Cliche J.

Respondent is the trustee of the estate of one Raoul Lamont, a bankrupt, who in April 1953 had entered into a contract with appellant to construct an extension or addition to a hotel owned by the latter at Coaticook, Quebec. The facts are fully set out in the judgment of Mr. Justice Taschereau in the Court below and I need refer to them only briefly.\nThe contract to which I have referred is dated April 18, 1953, and it reads as follows:\n18 avril 1953.\nContrat entre Mr. Charles Garceau de Coaticook, Que. pour une annexe \u00e0 l'Hotel \"Child\" de 40' x 80' d'une \u00e9tage de 14', fini tel que plans et devis que j'ai en mains et avec la coop\u00e9ration de Bernard Poitras et le Propri\u00e9taire. Ceci avec un pourcentage de 10% sur un montant de $16,000.00. S'il y a un exc\u00e9dent, je me charge de continuer le contrat sans aucune charge de pourcentage \u00e0 condition que M. Charles Garceau, propri\u00e9taire de l'Hotel Child se charge de payer la diff\u00e9rence de ce montant de $16,000.00 avec condition de $500.00 par mois jusqu'au r\u00e8glement de la dette finale. Condition de r\u00e8glement pour la premi\u00e8re\nsomme de $16,000.00\nPremier paiement de $5,000.00 le 30 avril 1953\nDeuxi\u00e8me paiement de $5,000.00 le 30 Mai 1953\nTroisi\u00e8me paiement de $5,000.00 le 30 Juin 1953.\nBalance de $1,000.00 sur r\u00e8glement au mois de $500.00 par mois et au m\u00eame condition s'il y a exc\u00e9dent du montant du contrat.\n(sign\u00e9) C. GARCEAU\n(sign\u00e9) RAOUL LAMONT\nConcurrently with the execution of this agreement appellant furnished Lamont with a coloured sketch and rough plan and specification of the proposed extension. This sketch and plan were both filed as exhibits and it is clear that the details of construction of the proposed building, contained in the said plan, are very meagre indeed.\nLamont started work on April 20, 1953, and the whole project was completed on July 17, 1953. It is common ground that the cost of the work substantially exceeded the amount of $16,000 mentioned in the written contract. The Court below found that the cost of the work done and materials furnished by Lamont (aside from any compensation for his own services) amounted to $32,340.98. There was ample evidence to support that finding and, in fact, the appellant made no attempt to challenge its accuracy.\nAppellant paid $16,000 in the manner specified in the contract and subsequent to the completion of the work he also paid suppliers of material to the extent of $1,478.77 and gave Lamont two promissory notes for $3,000 each, dated July 17, 1953, and July 24, 1953, respectively, both of which were paid at maturity. Total payments made by appellant therefore amounted to $23,478.77.\nAs I have said, appellant made no attempt to establish that the cost of the work done and materials supplied was not in excess of $30,000. Moreover, a report of Jean Julien Perrault, an architect who was appointed as an expert by the learned trial judge, established that the work done and materials furnished by Lamont had given an added value to the appellant's property of $30,900.\nIn his defence and at the trial appellant took the position (1) that the contract of April 18, 1953, was a contract at a fixed price within the meaning of art. 1690 of the Civil Code, that he had authorized and paid for additions and alterations to a total amount of $7,478.70 only, and was liable for no further amount and (2) that in taking the promissory note for $3,000 dated July 24, 1953, to which I have referred, Lamont had accepted it in full and final settlement of all his claims.\nAs to appellant's second ground of defence, I am satisfied that there is no evidence to support his contention that the note for $3,000 dated July 24, 1953, was accepted by Lamont in final settlement of all his claims. Lamont denied that this note was in full and final payment of his claim, his evidence on this point being as follows:\nQ. Maintenant, je vous repose la m\u00eame question parce qu'il y a un fait nouveau: Lorsque ce billet du vingt-quatre (24) juillet \"cinquantetrois\" ('53), PG-6, a \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9, est-ce qu'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 question que c'\u00e9tait en paiement final, qu'il ne vous devait plus rien?\nR. Non. Moi, j'ai demand\u00e9 \u00e7a pour qu'il me donne une chance pour passer \u00e7a \u00e0 ma banque pour que je paye d'autres cr\u00e9anciers.\nQ. Pour \u00e9viter la faillite?\nR. Pour \u00e9viter la faillite, justement.\nMoreover, it is to be observed that no fee for Lamont's services was included in the total payments of $23,478.70 made by appellant. Appellant obtained no final receipt from Lamont and the note for $3,000 dated July 24, 1953, bears no indication that it was given by appellant and accepted by Lamont in full and final settlement.\nThe question as to whether the contract in issue here comes within the provisions of art. 1690 of the Civil Code depends, of course, upon the interpretation and effect to be given to the agreement of April 17, 1953. In the Court below Mr. Justice Taschereau speaking for the Court held that it was not a contract at a fixed price under the terms of art. 1960 C.C. I share that view and there is little I can usefully add to what he has said in this respect.\nArticle 1690 C.C. contains an exception to the general rules as to proof and, as such, it must be strictly interpreted. Commenting on this article, Faribault in his \"Trait\u00e9 du Droit Civil du Qu\u00e9bec\", vol. XII, page 450, says:\nOn distingue le march\u00e9 \u00e0 forfait absolu ou pur et simple, et le march\u00e9 \u00e0 forfait relatif. Il est absolu lorsque le propri\u00e9taire ne s'est pas r\u00e9serv\u00e9 le droit ou le privil\u00e8ge de modifier les plans et devis durant le cours des travaux. Il n'est que relatif dans le cas contraire. L'article 1690 n'a d'application que si le contrat \u00e0 forfait est absolu: lorsque ce contrat est relatif, on doit appliquer les r\u00e8gles ordinaires de la preuve. Comme l'article 1690 est une exception \u00e0 la r\u00e8gle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de la preuve, il doit \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 restrictivement. Il n'a d'application que s'il existe un march\u00e9 \u00e0 forfait pur et simple, accompagn\u00e9 de plans et devis. Il ne peut s'appliquer si le contrat pr\u00e9voit une possibilit\u00e9 de modifications dans les plans et devis, ou si ces derniers font enti\u00e8rement d\u00e9faut.\nAs I have stated, the details contained in the sketch and plan furnished to Lamont when the contract was entered into are very meagre indeed. It is obvious that such a sketch and plan could do no more than give a general idea of the extent and character of the work to be done, and it is equally obvious, in my opinion, that both parties contemplated there would be changes and alterations and that the cost would exceed $16,000. The only feature of the contract which is clear and precise is that the contractor Lamont would be paid for his services an amount limited to $1,600, being 10 per cent of $16,000.\nThe contract in issue here, even if undertaken upon a plan and specifications within the meaning of those terms as used in art. 1690 C.C.\u2014as to which I have some doubt\u2014 was not, in my opinion, undertaken at a fixed price, and art. 1690 has therefore no application.\nFor the foregoing reasons and for those of Mr. Justice Taschereau in the Court below, with which I am in agreement, both appeals should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeals dismissed with costs.\nAttorney for the appellant: R. Bouchard, Coaticook.\nAttorneys for the respondent: Tremblay, Monk, Forget, Bruneau & Boivin, Montreal.\n1 [1960] Que. Q.B. 186.\n2 [1960] Que. Q.B. 186.\n"

The parties, as shareholders of the mise-en-cause company, entered into an agreement to acquire control of the company's shares. Each party undertook inter alia, (1) to vote for their election to the board of directors; (2) to ensure the election of the defendant R as president, of the defendant \u03a1 as vice-president and general manager, and of the plaintiff B as secretary-treasurer and assistant general manager; (3) to vote unanimously at all meetings of the company. The agreement further provided that on a breach of it by one of the parties, his shares were to be transferred to the others in equal parts. When the plaintiff was subsequently excluded from the management of the company, he sued for breach of contract. The sole defence was that the contract was contrary to public order. The trial judge dismissed the action. The judgment was reversed by the Court of Appeal.\nHeld (Taschereau and Fauteux JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be dismissed.\nPer Abbott, Judson and Ritchie JJ.: The agreement did not tie the hands of the parties in their capacity as directors so as to contravene any of the provisions of the Quebec Companies Act. It was no more than an agreement among shareholders owning or proposing to own the majority of the issue shares to unite upon a course of policy or action and upon officers whom they would elect. There was nothing illegal or contrary to public order. It was a well-known, normal and legal contract, frequently encountered in current practice. The clause specifying unanimity in voting had no reference to director's meetings, but to shareholders' meetings. No question of public order arose in a private arrangement of that kind.\nPer Taschereau and Fauteux JJ., dissenting: The requirement of the agreement to vote unanimously applied to directors meetings as well as to shareholders' meetings. Such binding of the parties in their capacities as directors was contrary to their duties as directors. It was contrary to the fiduciary relationship which directors have towards a company and which requires them to give their entire ability to the best interests of the company and its shareholders. This abdication of duties rendered the agreement invalid, and since the clause requiring the unanimous vote was not severable, the penalty was not enforceable.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench, Appeal Side, Province of Quebec1, reversing a judgment of Lajoie J.

Geoffrion, for the plaintiff, respondent.\nThe judgment of Taschereau and Fauteux JJ. was delivered by\nFauteux J. (dissenting):\u2014Les appelants se pourvoient \u00e0 l'encontre d'une d\u00e9cision majoritaire de la Cour d'Appel2 maintenant, contrairement au jugement de la Cour sup\u00e9rieure qui l'avait rejet\u00e9e, l'action intent\u00e9e contre eux par l'intim\u00e9 Bergeron. Cette action repose sur un contrat notari\u00e9 sign\u00e9 le 3 ao\u00fbt 1949 par les appelants et l'intim\u00e9. La question en litige est, comme il appert ci-apr\u00e8s, une pure question de droit touchant la l\u00e9galit\u00e9 de ce contrat dont la validit\u00e9 est ni\u00e9e par les appelants et affirm\u00e9e par l'intim\u00e9.\nA la date de cette convention, Ringuet, Bergeron et Pag\u00e9 d\u00e9tenaient, avec quatre autres actionnaires, tous les sept dans une \u00e9gale proportion, tout le capital-action \u00e9mis de la St. Maurice Knitting Mills Limited, compagnie incorpor\u00e9e par lettres patentes le 30 janvier 1947 sous le r\u00e9gime de la premi\u00e8re partie de la Loi des compagnies de Qu\u00e9bec.\nD\u00e9sireux de s'assurer le contr\u00f4le de l'entreprise de cette compagnie, les appelants et l'intim\u00e9 prenaient les uns envers les autres, dans ce contrat, divers engagements destin\u00e9s \u00e0 cette fin. C'est ainsi que chacune des parties \u00e0 la convention s'engageait, particuli\u00e8rement, \u00e0 ne pas disposer de ses actions sans le consentement de chacune des autres parties; \u00e0 acheter en parts \u00e9gales les actions qui pouvaient \u00eatre offertes par leurs h\u00e9ritiers respectifs ou par les autres actionnaires; \u00e0 voter leurs actions pour leur \u00e9lection au conseil d'administration; \u00e0 assurer, en permanence, l'\u00e9lection de Ringuet comme Pr\u00e9sident, Pag\u00e9 comme Vice-Pr\u00e9sident et G\u00e9rant-G\u00e9n\u00e9ral et l'intim\u00e9 comme Secr\u00e9taire-Tr\u00e9sorier et Assistant G\u00e9rant-G\u00e9n\u00e9ral; \u00e0 voter pour assurer des salaires d\u00e9termin\u00e9s \u00e0 chacune des parties au contrat; \u00e0 ne pas demander la modification de la pr\u00e9sente convention ni l'attaquer en justice ou autrement sans le consentement unanime des deux autres parties contractantes; \u00e0 voter unanimement, sur tout objet n\u00e9cessitant un vote, \u00e0 toutes assembl\u00e9es de la compagnie (clause 11) et \u00e0 accepter, comme sanction de toute violation du contrat, la perte de ses actions, au b\u00e9n\u00e9fice des deux autres parties contractantes (clause 12).\nIl convient de citer au texte les clauses 11 et 12 dont les dispositions sont particuli\u00e8rement invoqu\u00e9es au soutien de la proposition d'invalidit\u00e9 du contrat:\n11. Dans toutes assembl\u00e9es de ladite compagnie, les parties aux pr\u00e9sentes s'engagent et s'obligent \u00e0 voter unanimement sur tout objet qui n\u00e9cessite un vote.\nAucune des parties aux pr\u00e9sentes ne pourra diff\u00e9rer d'opinion avec ses co-parties contractantes en ce qui concerne le vote. Le vote pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rant du Pr\u00e9sident devra toujours \u00eatre en faveur des deux parties contractantes.\n12. Si une des parties ne se conforme \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente convention, ses actions seront c\u00e9d\u00e9es et transport\u00e9es aux deux autres parties contractantes en parts \u00e9gales et ce gratuitement. Telle est la sanction de la non ex\u00e9cution d'aucune des clauses de la pr\u00e9sente convention par l'une des parties contractantes.\nDans une seconde convention, ex\u00e9cut\u00e9e le 3 f\u00e9vrier 1950 par les appelants, l'intim\u00e9 et le mis-en-cause Jean, il fut pourvu \u00e0 l'admission de Jean dans le groupe form\u00e9 par les appelants et l'intim\u00e9 pour le contr\u00f4le de la compagnie, \u00e0 l'acquisition des actions d'un autre actionnaire et l'engagement, assurant les salaires fix\u00e9s \u00e0 la premi\u00e8re convention, fut r\u00e9it\u00e9r\u00e9. Cette seconde convention laisse subsister la premi\u00e8re qui seule contient la clause p\u00e9nale dont l'application est r\u00e9clam\u00e9e par la pr\u00e9sente action.\nDe la date du contrat en litige, soit du 3 ao\u00fbt 1949 \u00e0 1952, les parties \u00e0 ce contrat en observ\u00e8rent les termes. Mais en juin 1952, les appelants, \u00e0 des assembl\u00e9es du conseil d'administration et des actionnaires, cess\u00e8rent, au m\u00e9pris de leurs engagements, d'assurer l'\u00e9lection de l'intim\u00e9 au bureau de direction, d'assurer sa nomination au poste de secr\u00e9taire-tr\u00e9sorier et d'assistant g\u00e9rant-g\u00e9n\u00e9ral et de lui voter le salaire convenu. C'est alors que Bergeron poursuivit les appelants et invoquant ces violations du contrat du 3 ao\u00fbt 1949, demanda l'application de la sanction pr\u00e9vue \u00e0 l'article 12, soit le transfert \u00e0 son b\u00e9n\u00e9fice de toutes les actions d\u00e9tenues par Ringuet et Pag\u00e9.\nJean et la compagnie furent mis-en-cause, pour qu'ils puissent prendre connaissance du jugement \u00e0 intervenir et s'y conformer.\nLes faits all\u00e9gu\u00e9s au soutien de cette action sont admis par les d\u00e9fendeurs appelants qui plaident en droit l'invalidit\u00e9 de la convention.\nLa Cour sup\u00e9rieure rejeta l'action pour un motif auquel il n'y a pas lieu de s'arr\u00eater. Outre d'avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9cart\u00e9 par la Cour d'Appel, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 abandonn\u00e9 par les appelants.\nEn appel, M. le Juge en chef Galipeault interpr\u00e9ta l'obligation de voter unanimement, contenue en la clause 11, comme ne s'appliquant qu'aux assembl\u00e9es d'actionnaires et non \u00e0 celles des directeurs. Par inadvertance, il consid\u00e9ra, \u2014ce qui n'est pas, soit dit en toute d\u00e9f\u00e9rence,\u2014que les parties \u00e0 la seconde convention constituaient, \u00e0 la date d'icelle, tous et les seuls actionnaires de la compagnie. Avec ces vues, il conclut \u00e0 la validit\u00e9 de cette clause et partant du contrat. MM. les Juges Pratte et Owen, adoptant une interpr\u00e9tation diff\u00e9rente de cette clause, d\u00e9clar\u00e8rent que l'obligation touchant la solidarit\u00e9 du vote s'appliquait aussi bien aux assembl\u00e9es des directeurs qu'aux assembl\u00e9es des actionnaires. Partant de cette interpr\u00e9tation, M. le Juge Pratte jugea la clause contraire \u00e0 l'ordre public et la consid\u00e9rant comme l'une des conditions essentielles \u00e0 l'assentiment donn\u00e9 par les parties au contrat, il conclut que cette stipulation viciait la convention m\u00eame en laquelle elle se trouvait. M. le Juge Owen, d'autre part, indiqua qu'il inclinait \u00e0 partager l'opinion de son coll\u00e8gue sur l'invalidit\u00e9 de la clause en question mais \u00e9tant d'avis qu'il s'agit l\u00e0 d'une clause accessoire et non essentielle, il ne crut pas n\u00e9cessaire de d\u00e9terminer la question de validit\u00e9. Pour ces motifs, il conclut avec le Juge en chef au maintien du contrat et de l'action.\nJe crois que les conclusions auxquelles M. le Juge Pratte est arriv\u00e9 sur l'interpr\u00e9tation, l'ins\u00e9parabilit\u00e9 et l'invalidit\u00e9 de la clause 11 sont bien fond\u00e9es.\nInterpr\u00e9tation. Il se peut qu'en soi, isol\u00e9e du texte de la convention et consid\u00e9r\u00e9e exclusivement au regard de la Loi des compagnies, l'expression \"Dans toutes assembl\u00e9es de ladite compagnie \u2026\", apparaissant au d\u00e9but de la clause 11, puisse s'interpr\u00e9ter comme n'embrassant que les assembl\u00e9es d'actionnaires. L\u00e0 n'est pas la question. Il faut donner \u00e0 cette expression un sens conforme \u00e0 l'intention des parties au contrat o\u00f9 elle se trouve. Et pour ce, il faut tenir compte des r\u00e8gles d'interpr\u00e9tation et, particuli\u00e8rement, de celle \u00e9dict\u00e9e \u00e0 l'art. 1018 C.C. voulant que les clauses d'un contrat s'interpr\u00e8tent les unes par les autres en donnant \u00e0 chacune le sens qui r\u00e9sulte de l'acte entier. Les parties ont voulu assurer leur \u00e9lection comme officiers de la compagnie aussi bien que le traitement se rattachant \u00e0 ces fonctions. Cette intention ne pouvait \u00eatre r\u00e9alis\u00e9e que par les d\u00e9cisions du conseil d'administration. Aussi bien, pour donner effet \u00e0 leur volont\u00e9, elles ont stipul\u00e9 l'unanimit\u00e9 du vote \"dans toutes les assembl\u00e9es de ladite compagnie\" c'est-\u00e0-dire dans les assembl\u00e9es du conseil d'administration comme dans les assembl\u00e9es des actionnaires.\nIns\u00e9parabilit\u00e9.' De la lecture du contrat, il appara\u00eet \u00e9galement que chacune des parties a voulu se garantir contre toute contingence de nature \u00e0 emp\u00eacher la r\u00e9alisation de; l'intention commune et adopter les mesures les plus efficaces pour assurer le respect int\u00e9gral des engagements pris \u00e0 cette fin. Gomme dit M. le Juge Pratte, cette clause ne peut \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme une clause purement accessoire et n'ayant jou\u00e9 aucun r\u00f4le d\u00e9terminant dans la conclusion du contrat.\nInvalidit\u00e9. C'est au regard du contrat lui-m\u00eame et de la situation existant \u00e0 la date de son ex\u00e9cution que cette question doit \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9e. Si la convention \u00e9tait alors invalide, elle n'a pu \u00eatre subs\u00e9quemment valid\u00e9e par suite d'\u00e9v\u00e9nements subs\u00e9quents. Suivant la situation alors existante, il y avait, \u00e0 la date de ce contrat, sept actionnaires dans la compagnie, chacun, comme d\u00e9j\u00e0 indiqu\u00e9, d\u00e9tenant un nombre \u00e9gal d'actions et tous \u00e9tant \u00e9ligibles, en droit, et susceptibles d'\u00eatre \u00e9lus, en fait, au conseil d'administration. Les questions qui se posent sont de savoir si dans de telles circonstances, les parties au contrat pouvaient, comme elles l'ont fait, comme directeurs, s'engager d'avance, aveugl\u00e9ment et pour toujours, sous la sanction d'une peine extr\u00eamement s\u00e9v\u00e8re, \u00e0 ne prendre que des d\u00e9cisions agr\u00e9ables \u00e0 leurs co-contractants et \u00e0 renoncer pour toujours, \u00e0 moins que ceux-ci ne soient d'accord avec elles, \u00e0 partager l'opinion d'un autre directeur de la compagnie, m\u00eame s'il leur apparaissait que le bien de la compagnie exigeait qu'elles le fissent. Avaient-elles le droit d'ainsi irr\u00e9vocablement ali\u00e9ner la libert\u00e9 de choisir sans contrevenir \u00e0 leurs devoirs comme directeurs, \u00e0 la lettre ou du moins \u00e0 l'esprit de la Loi des compagnies?.\nSur la nature des devoirs d'un directeur de compagnie, il para\u00eet suffisant de r\u00e9f\u00e9rer \u00e0 la description qu'en donne Wegenast, 1931, The Law of Canadian Companies, et Masten & Fraser, Company Law of Canada, 4th ed. Le premier, aux pages 364 et 365, s'en exprime comme suit:\nThe simplest accurate description of the relationship of director is to call it a fiduciary relationship, that is to say, a relationship requiring the exercise of fidelity, having in view the purpose for which directors are appointed, as well as the statutory provisions under which the appointment is made.\nEt il ajoute, \u00e0 la page 366:\nThis, then, is what is meant when the directors are spoken of as trustees. The various powers committed to them as directors are held by them in trust, to be used, not for the benefit or aggrandisement of the directors as individuals, but in good faith for the company as a whole. Dans le second, on peut lire \u00e0 la page 580:\nIt is a director's duty to give his whole ability, business knowledge, exertion and attention to the best interests of the shareholders who have placed him in that position: Re Iron Clay Brick Mfg. Co. (1889) 19 O.R. 113, 123. Directors by reason of their fiduciary obligations in the exercise of their powers are bound to act with the utmost good faith for the benefit of the company: The Sun Trust Company Ltd. v. B\u00e9gin (1937) S.C.R. 305, at p. 307.\nDans Motherwell v. Schoof3, la Cour Supr\u00eame d'Alberta eut \u00e0 consid\u00e9rer la validit\u00e9 d'une convention faite par deux directeurs, aux termes de laquelle ils avaient, dans une clause, convenu qu'au cas de leur d\u00e9saccord sur toute question soulev\u00e9e au conseil d'administration, le conflit serait soumis aux d\u00e9cisions d'un arbitre et qu'ils voteraient conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 ces d\u00e9cisions. Dans une autre clause de la convention, ils se sont engag\u00e9s, comme directeurs, \u00e0 se nommer, l'un comme Pr\u00e9sident de la compagnie et l'autre comme G\u00e9rant de la compagnie. Sur la validit\u00e9 de la premi\u00e8re et de la deuxi\u00e8me de ces clauses, M. le Juge Clinton J. Ford exprima les vues suivantes aux pages 818 et 819:\nIn my opinion this contravenes s. 92 of the Dominion Companies Act, 1934, which empowers the directors to administer the affairs of the company in all things and to make or cause to be made for the company any description of contract which the company may by law enter into. The discretion of the directors to act in the administration of the affairs of the company is fettered by the agreement and, in so far as it does so, it cannot be valid. The attempt to bind the directors in their decision as to whom to appoint as president or manager or otherwise is also, in my opinion, invalid, as contrary to the provisions of the section above referred to and, also, to s. 90(d) of the Act.\nLes prescriptions de l'art. 80 de la Loi des compagnies de Qu\u00e9bec, applicables \u00e0 la compagnie mise-en-cause, supportent, je crois, la proposition d'invalidit\u00e9 d'une clause telle que la clause 11 ayant pour effet d'obliger, en certaines circonstances, l'une des parties contractantes \u00e0 virtuellement abdiquer ses pouvoirs vis-\u00e0-vis la compagnie, au b\u00e9n\u00e9fice de ses co-contractants. L'article 80 de la premi\u00e8re partie de la Loi des compagnies de Qu\u00e9bec \u00e9dicte que:\n80. Les affaires de la compagnie sont administr\u00e9es par un bureau de direction compos\u00e9 d'au moins trois membres. Le r\u00e8glement n\u00b0 8 des r\u00e8glements de la compagnie \u00e9dicte que:\nBY-LAW NO. 8 DIRECTORS\nThe affairs of the company shall be managed by a Board of seven (7) directors of whom four (4) shall form a quorum.\nDe telles dispositions ont un caract\u00e8re imp\u00e9ratif et prohibitif. Dans In Re Alma Spinning Company4, Jessel, M.R., eut \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer l'effet d'une semblable disposition et l'opinion \u00e0 laquelle il s'est arr\u00eat\u00e9 est exprim\u00e9e comme suit aux pages 685-686:\nThe words of the 35th article of association are these: \"The business of the company shall be conducted by not less than five, nor more than seven, directors.\" Very simple words. If there were no interpretation of them, I should hold them as equivalent to saying, there shall never be less than five nor more than seven directors. The words no doubt are, \"the business of the company shall be conducted\"; but they are meant to point out what the number of directors of the company shall be\u2014not merely by whom the business of the company shall be conducted. It was so decided in Kirk v. Bell 16 Q.B. 290, where the words were practically the same as we have here; and therefore, if I wanted a decision in point, there it is. The words there were\u2014instead of \"the business of the company shall be conducted by\"\u2014\"the management of the affairs of the company shall be entrusted to\" (which, of course, is the same thing) \"not less than five, nor more than seven, directors;\" and it was held that there must be at least five directors. I agree that that is the fair meaning of the clause.\nNow comes the question, that being the proper meaning of the clause, is it to be treated as directory only, or as obligatory? If there were no decision I should have said on principle that it could not be merely directory\u2014 it is a negative and an affirmative. The shareholders have entrusted the management of their business to a certain number of persons, not to any other number. They say, in effect, \"there shall not be less than five, nor more than seven, who shall manage our business; less than five shall not be the managers.\" If, in an ordinary case, persons appointed seven people to be their attorneys, and said, \"they shall conduct the business, not being less than five,\" would anybody say that if the attorneys were below five they could conduct the business? Is there any distinction between that case and this? Or take the case of a man going away and leaving his business to three clerks, and giving them power to act for him, and to draw bills, not less than two to act together\u2014could any one of them draw bills? I do not see the distinction on principle. The contract of this partnership, or quasi-partnership, is that the business shall be managed by not less than a certain number of persons: what right has a Court of Justice to say that it shall be managed by a less number, without the shareholders being consulted?\nL'article 80 de la Loi des compagnies de Qu\u00e9bec implique n\u00e9cessairement une prohibition que les affaires d'une compagnie soient conduites par moins d'un certain nombre de personnes et il est certain que si l'un des directeurs constituant ce minimum s'engage \u00e0 abdiquer, comme en l'esp\u00e8ce, en faveur d'un ou de plusieurs directeurs, son pouvoir de voter, son engagement constitue une violation de l'esprit, sinon de la lettre, de la disposition prohibitive.\nMais, dit-on de la part de l'intim\u00e9, il est de principe que les questions soumises au bureau de direction soient, en cas de conflit entre les directeurs, d\u00e9cid\u00e9es par un vote majoritaire et de cela on d\u00e9duit que la clause 11 n'est pas contraire \u00e0 ce principe qui continue d'\u00eatre appliqu\u00e9 lorsqu'il est donn\u00e9 effet \u00e0 la clause. Apr\u00e8s tout, ajoute-t-on, chacun des comparants n'a pas renonc\u00e9 \u00e0 la d\u00e9lib\u00e9ration, \u00e0 la discussion, au droit de faire triompher son opinion, avant de se ranger \u00e0 l'avis de la majorit\u00e9 qui, en principe, doit gouverner. Comme le signale M. le Juge Pratte, cependant, le principe de la d\u00e9cision par la majorit\u00e9 pr\u00e9suppose qu'il s'agisse d'une majorit\u00e9 r\u00e9alis\u00e9e par l'union de ceux qui ont une opinion commune. Il faut, en effet, que ceux qui donnent leur vote formant cette majorit\u00e9 soient libres de donner ce vote et que ce vote soit l'expression de leur opinion. Le directeur n'a pas, au conseil d'administration, un droit et un pouvoir limit\u00e9s \u00e0 une voix consultative. Ce qu'il a, c'est le droit, le pouvoir de voter suivant l'opinion qu'il s'est form\u00e9e sur la question \u00e0 d\u00e9cider.\nPour ces raisons qui sont, en substance, celles donn\u00e9es par M. le Juge Pratte, je maintiendrais l'appel avec d\u00e9pens tant en Cour d'Appel qu'en cette Cour et r\u00e9tablirais le dispositif du jugement de premi\u00e8re instance.\nThe judgment of Abbott, Judson and Ritchie JJ. was delivered by\nJudson J.:\u2014The respondent sued the appellants for a declaration that against each of them, he was entitled to certain shares of the St. Maurice Knitting Mills Limited registered in their names. In the Superior Court the learned trial judge dismissed the action. The Court of Queen's Bench (Appeal Side)5 allowed the appeal and maintained the action. The two unsuccessful shareholders now appeal to this Court. The action was brought on an agreement dated August 3, 1949, between the respondent and the appellants. At that time these parties and four other persons each held 50 shares of the St. Maurice Knitting Mills Limited, a company incorporated by letters patent under Part I of the Quebec Companies Act. These shares constituted all the issued capital stock of the company. The purpose of the agreement was to provide for the acquisition of 50 shares from one Frank Spain and the division of these shares among the parties. With these 50 shares divided among them the parties then had control of the company and they agreed, among other matters, to vote for their election to the Board of Directors; to ensure the election of the appellant Ringuet as president of the company, of the appellant Pag\u00e9 as vice-president and general manager, and of the respondent Bergeron as secretary-treasurer and assistant general manager of the company, all at stated and agreed salaries. They also agreed to vote unanimously at all meetings of the company and provided for a penalty for breach of the contract in the following terms:\n11. Dans toutes assembl\u00e9es de la dite Compagnie, les parties aux pr\u00e9sentes s'engagent et s'obligent \u00e0 voter unanimement sur tout objet qui n\u00e9cessite un vote. Aucune des parties aux pr\u00e9sentes ne pourra diff\u00e9rer d'opinion avec ses co-parties contractantes en ce qui concerne le vote. Le vote pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rant du Pr\u00e9sident devra toujours \u00eatre en faveur des deux parties contractantes.\n12. Si l'une des parties ne se conforme \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente convention, ses actions seront c\u00e9d\u00e9es et transport\u00e9es aux deux autres parties contractantes en parts \u00e9gales, et ce gratuitement.\nTel est la sanction de la non ex\u00e9cution d'aucune des clauses de la pr\u00e9sente convention par l'une des parties contractantes.\nTwo or three months later the parties also purchased the shares of another shareholder Robert Sevigny and divided them among themselves in accordance with the agreement. On the completion of this purchase, there remained only five shareholders in the company: the two appellants, the respondent, the mis-en-cause Gerard Jean, and Z\u00e9non Bachand. On February 3, 1950, the three parties to the first agreement entered into another agreement and included in this one the mis-en-cause Gerard Jean. The purpose of this agreement was to provide for the admission of Gerard Jean into the controlling group and for the acquisition of the shares of Z\u00e9non Bachand, the last of the minority shareholders. Two shares were issued from the treasury and the total issued shares were equally divided among the four individuals with the result that each held 88 shares. The contract of February 3, 1950, to which Jean was a party, contains no provision corresponding to clause 12 of the contract of August 3, 1949. It does not purport to replace or alter the earlier contract, which remains in full force and effect.\nFrom August 3, 1949 to June 14, 1952 the three parties to the first contract observed its terms. There had during this period been certain increases in salary which were properly authorized and fixed by mutual consent. On June 14, 1952 the appellant Maurice Pag\u00e9, at a directors' meeting, began to take steps to oust the respondent from the management of the company, and at a shareholders' meeting held on July 21, 1952, the appellants and Jean voted themselves in as a new board of directors. The respondent says that he had no notice of this meeting and did not attend. He was not nominated and no votes were cast for his election as director of the company. The new board of directors held a meeting following the shareholders' meeting. Ringuet was elected president, Pag\u00e9 was elected vice-president and Jean, secretary-treasurer. The respondent was thus completely excluded from the management of the company. He brought his action alleging that the appellants in failing to vote for his election to the board of directors and in not ensuring that he be appointed assistant general manager and secretary-treasurer, had violated the contract of August 3,. 1949, and that he was entitled to enforce the penalty provided in clause 12 of the agreement. He claimed a transfer of 88 shares from each defendant. The facts were admitted in the pleadings and the sole defence was that the contract was contrary to public order.\nThe Superior Court rejected the action on the very narrow ground that clause 12 had no application when one party was suing the other two. No opinion delivered in the Court of Queen's Bench accepted this interpretation of clause 12 and no attempt was made in this Court to support the judgment at trial on this ground. In the Court of Queen's Bench the learned Chief Justice and Mr. Justice Owen found for the respondent, with Mr. Justice Pratte dissenting. The Chief Justice found nothing illegal in the agreement and decided that it should be given its full effect. The ratio of the dissenting opinion is to be found in the distinction drawn between the rights of a shareholder and the obligations assumed on becoming a director. While majority shareholders may agree to vote their shares for certain purposes, they cannot by this agreement tie the hands of directors and compel them to exercise the power of management of the company in a particular way. This appears in the following extract from the reasons of Pratte J.:\nMais la situation des directeurs est bien diff\u00e9rente de celle des actionnaires. Le directeur est d\u00e9sign\u00e9 pas les actionnaires, mais il n'est pas \u00e0 proprement parler leur mandataire; il est un administrateur charg\u00e9 par la loi de g\u00e9rer un patrimoine qui n'est ni le sien, ni celui de ses codirecteurs, ni celui des actionnaires, mais celui de la compagnie, une personne juridique absolument distincte \u00e0 la fois de ceux qui la dirigent et de ceux qui en poss\u00e8dent le capital actions. En cette qualit\u00e9, le directeur doit agir en bonne conscience, dans le seul int\u00e9r\u00eat du patrimoine confi\u00e9 \u00e0 sa gestion. Cela suppose qu'il a la libert\u00e9 de choisir, au moment d'une d\u00e9cision \u00e0 prendre, celle qui lui para\u00eet la plus conforme aux int\u00e9r\u00eats sur lesquels la loi lui impose le devoir de veiller.\nThere can be no objection to the general principle stated in this passage, but, in my view, it was not offended by this agreement. However, the conclusion of Pratte J. was that a director who has bound himself as this contract bound the parties has rendered himself incapable of doing what the law requires of him and that clause 11 requiring unanimity at all meetings had that effect. He also held that clause 11 was not severable and that therefore the agreement was invalidated in its entirety.\nOwen J. agreed that the undertaking of unanimity at directors' meetings which he considered was required by clause 11 might be contrary to public order but that it was not necessary to decide this since the clause was severable from the other provisions of the agreement to which he gave full effect. The defendants had failed to comply with other clauses in the contract\u2014the voting of Bergeron's salary, the election of Bergeron as a director of the company and his appointment as secretary-treasurer and assistant general manager.\nThe point of the appeal is therefore whether an agreement among a group of shareholders providing for the direction and control of a company in the circumstances of this case is contrary to public order, and whether it is open to the parties to establish whatever sanction they choose for a breach of such agreement. Did the parties of this agreement tie their hands in their capacity as directors of the company so as to contravene the requirements of the Quebec Companies Act, which provides (s. 80) that \"the affairs of the company shall be managed by a board of not less than three directors\"? I agree with the reasons of the learned Chief Justice that this agreement does not contravene this or any other section of the Quebec Companies Act. It is no more than an agreement among shareholders owning or proposing to own the majority of the issued shares of a company to unite upon a course of policy or action and upon the officers whom they will elect. There is nothing illegal or contrary to public order in an agreement for achieving these purposes. Shareholders have the right to combine their interests and voting powers to secure such control of a company and to ensure that the company will be managed by certain persons in a certain manner. This is a well-known, normal and legal contract and one which is frequently encountered in current practice and it makes no difference whether the objects sought are to be achieved by means of an agreement such as this or a voting trust. Such an arrangement is not prohibited either by law, by good morals or public order.\nIt is important to distinguish the present action, which is between contracting parties to an agreement for the voting of shares, from one brought by a minority shareholder demanding a certain standard of conduct from directors and majority shareholders. Nothing that can arise from this litigation and nothing that can be said about it can touch on that problem. The fact that this agreement may potentially involve detriment to the minority does not render it illegal and contrary to public order. If there is such injury, there is a remedy available to the minority shareholder who alleges a departure from the standards required of the majority shareholders and the directors. The possibility of such injurious effect on the minority is not a ground for illegality.\nI think that this litigation can be decided on the simple ground that clause 11 has no reference to directors' meetings. Clause 11 refers to meetings of the company, that is, shareholders' meetings, and not to meetings of the board of directors. On this point I agree with the Chief Justice, who stated his opinion in the following terms:\nAu surplus, y a-t-il quelque chose qui r\u00e9pugne \u00e0 la loi, \u00e0 l'ordre public et aux bonnes m\u0153urs qu'un groupe d'actionnaires s'entendent pour contr\u00f4ler et diriger une compagnie, pour devenir ses administrateurs, ses principaux officiers? Il n'\u00e9tait s\u00fbrement pas besoin d'un contrat \u00e9crit pour pareille entente qui intervient chaque jour dans le monde des compagnies, \u00e9tant notoire qu'un grand nombre d'entre elles sont contr\u00f4l\u00e9es par un groupe d'actionnaires qui souvent m\u00eame ne repr\u00e9sentent pas la majorit\u00e9 des actions.\nL'engagement des co-contractants \u00e0 voter unanimement leurs actions dans les assembl\u00e9es de la compagnie ne saurait lui-m\u00eame, \u00e0 mon avis, \u00eatre invalide; apr\u00e8s tout, chacun des comparants n'a pas renonc\u00e9 \u00e0 la d\u00e9lib\u00e9ration, \u00e0 la discussion, au droit de faire triompher son opinion avant de se ranger \u00e0 l'avis de la majorit\u00e9 qui en principe doit gouverner.\nI have the greatest difficulty in seeing how any question of public order can arise in a private arrangement of this kind. The possibility of injury to a minority interest cannot raise it. If this were not so, every arrangement of this kind would involve judicial enquiry. Minority rights have the protection of the law without the necessity of invoking public order. This litigation is between shareholders of a closely held company. The agreement which the plaintiff seeks to enforce damages nobody except the unsuccessful party to the agreement. No public interest or illegality is involved.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs, Taschereau and Fauteux JJ. dissenting.\nAttorneys for the defendants, appellants: Desilets, Crete & Levesque, Grand'Mere.\nAttorneys for the plaintiff, respondent: Geoffrion & Prud' Homme, Montreal.\n1 [1958] Que.

It was admitted that none of these compounds entered into the company's final product except as an impurity.\nThe trial judge held that the company was not exempt from sales tax under s. 5(h) of the Act. The Court of Appeal held that the company was exempt and that the limitation of claims for exemption imposed by regulation 3-11 was invalid. The Crown appealed to this Court.\nHeld (Cartwright J. dissenting in part): The appeal should be dismissed.\nPer Curiam: The proviso in regulation 3-11, making the allowance of the exemption conditional upon an application being made by the purchaser within six months after the purchase in respect of which the exemption is claimed, was ultra vires. The commodities in question were exempt by virtue of the opening words of s. 5 of the Act.\nPer Kerwin C.J. and Abbott, Martland and Judson JJ.: On the assumption that the words \"transformation or manufacture of a product\" applied to the use of both catalysts and direct agents, the company was entitled to the exemption for the reason that catalysts and direct agents did not stand in relation to the final product \"by contact or temporary incorporation\" as required by s. 5(h) of the Act. The word \"product\" was not confined to the commercial products of a business.\nPer Cartwright J., dissenting in part: The comma after the word \"catalyst\" was to be considered and the company was entitled to the exemption in regard to the substances which were used as catalysts. However, the company was not entitled to the exemption in regard to the substances which were used as \"direct agents\", because it was clear that they did not come in contact with and were not at any stage incorporated temporarily or otherwise with the wood-pulp. APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1], reversing a judgment of Maclean J. Appeal dismissed, Cartwright J. dissenting in part.\nW. G. Burke-Robertson, Q.C., for the appellant.\nC. C. Locke, for the respondent.\nThe judgment of Kerwin C.J. and of Abbott, Martland and Judson JJ. was delivered by\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE:\u2014In the operation of its pulp mills in British Columbia the respondent, Alaska Pine and Cellulose Limited, uses catalysts in its fire boxes and catalysts and direct agents in its boilers. By leave of this Court Her Majesty the Queen in the right of the Province of British Columbia appeals from the judgment of the Court of Appeal[2] for that province and the two points involved are: (1) Whether under the Social Services Tax Act, R.S.B.C. 1948, c. 333, as amended, the company is exempt from the assessment for taxes on the purchase of these articles; (2) Even if so exempt, whether the company lost its right to exemption because it failed to comply with reg. 3-11 of the Lieutenant-Governor in Council promulgated in purported exercise of the powers conferred by s. 5(h) of the Act.\nSubsection (1) of s. 3 of the Act, as amended, reads:\n3. (1) Every purchaser shall pay to Her Majesty in right of the Province at the time of making the purchase a tax at the rate of five per centum of the purchase price of the property purchased.\nSection 5(h) provides:\n5. The following classes of tangible personal property are specifically exempted from the provisions of this Act:\u2014\n***\n(h) Such tangible personal property by way of chemical, animal, mineral, or vegetable matter as the Lieutenant-Governor in Council may determine by regulation, used as a catalyst, or as a direct agent for the transformation or manufacture of a product by contact or temporary incorporation, or such tangible personal property as is used for the purpose of being processed, fabricated, or manufactured into, attached to, or incorporated into other tangible personal property for the purpose of retail sale;\nRegulation 3-11 reads:\n3-11. Tangible personal property by way of chemical, animal, mineral, or vegetable matter purchased by manufacturers and used as a catalyst or as a direct agent for the transformation or manufacture of a product by contact or temporary incorporation is exempt from the application of the tax; provided, however, that the exemption allowed by this regulation is conditional upon application being made by the purchaser within six months after the purchase of the tangible personal property in respect of which the exemption is claimed. The term \"direct agent\", as used in section 5(h) of the Act and in this regulation, shall mean only such chemical, animal, mineral, or vegetable matter as is used or consumed directly to produce a reaction or combination of materials comparable to that resulting from the use of a catalyst.\nIt might be here noted that counsel for the appellant, in connection with the second point, relies on subs. (1) of s. 32 of the Act and particularly the parts underlined:\n32. (1) For the purpose of carrying into effect the provisions of this Act according to their true intent and of supplying any deficiency therein, and for the purpose of relaxing the strictness of the law relative to the incidence or the collection of the tax thereunder, in cases where, without relaxation, great public inconvenience or great hardship or injustice to persons or individuals could not be avoided, the Lieutenant-Governor in Council may make such regulations as are considered necessary or advisable.\nWhile the matter was not explained in detail, it appears from exhibit 8, which is a letter from the company to the Commissioner (the official appointed to administer the Act) that the catalysts and direct agents were purchased by the company from Alchem Ltd. of Burlington, Ontario. This exhibit is among the papers sent to the Court but is not printed in the appeal case. Presumably to take care of such a situation subs. (3) of s. 3 enacts:\n3. (3) Every person residing or ordinarily resident or carrying on business in the Province who brings into the Province or who receives delivery in the Province of tangible personal property acquired by him for value for his own consumption or use, or for the consumption or use of other persons at his expense, or on behalf of, or as the agent for, a principal who desires to acquire such property for the consumption or use by such principal or other persons at his expense, shall immediately report the matter in writing to the Commissioner and supply to him the invoice and all other pertinent information as required by him in respect of the consumption or use of such property, and furthermore, at the same time, shall pay to Her Majesty in right of the Province the same tax in respect of the consumption or use of such property as would have been payable if the property had been purchased at a retail sale in the Province.\nApparently under s. 25 of the Act an inspection of the company's records was had and a calculation made of the taxes claimed to be due. The Commissioner assessed the company for the amount of the taxes so calculated. By subs. (2) of s. 25 the same right to appeal was conferred as exists under ss. 14 and 15. Section 14 provides for an appeal to the Minister of Finance, which the company took without success, and s. 15 for an appeal from the Minister's decision to a judge of the Supreme Court of the Province, which the Company also took to no avail.\nThe latter appeal came before MacLean J. Not all the taxes assessed against the company were involved in that appeal but there was in issue before him an assessment relating to the company's purchase of certain lumber. On a further appeal to the Court of Appeal no objection was taken to that part of his judgment. The company had been assessed the sum of $4,333.96, including interest, in respect of the only articles before the Court of Appeal, i.e., catalysts and direct agents. No evidence had been called on behalf of the present appellant before MacLean J. and counsel admitted that all the substances in question were either catalysts or direct agents. The company agrees that none of the boiler treatment compounds or combustion catalysts actually entered into the company's wood pulp\u2014the company's final product\u2014except as an impurity. It also agreed that no application for an exemption was filed by the company pursuant to the provisions of s. 3-11 of the regulations. The legality of reg. 3-11 will be considered later.\nAs to the first point, MacLean J. held in construing s. 5(h) of the Act that the comma following the word \"catalyst\" before the phrase \"or as a direct agent for the transformation or manufacture of a product by contact or temporary incorporation\" was misplaced and that the clause should be read as restricting the exemption of catalysts to those that are used for the transformation or manufacture of a product, by a contact or temporary incorporation, as in the case of direct agents. In the Court of Appeal Davey J.A., with whose judgment O'Halloran J.A. agreed, was inclined to doubt whether that was so. As he points out, a catalyst is a term of art with a well understood meaning in chemistry, i.e., a material substance which alters the speed of a chemical reaction, the catalyst itself undergoing no change in composition as a result of the reaction. This is according to the evidence of Dr. Wright, Head of the Division of Chemistry of the British Columbia Research Council. The same witness testified that the term \"direct agent\" is not one ordinarily used in the science and lacks a precise meaning. Davey J.A. did not rest his judgment on the matter of punctuation but assumed that the words \"transformation or manufacture of a product\" applied to the use of both catalysts and direct agents.\nProceeding on that basis MacLean J. had held that \"product\" meant only a commercial product of a business, i.e., in the case of the company, wood pulp. For the reasons given by Davey J.A. I agree that \"product\" is not confined to the commercial products of a business and I have nothing to add to his elaboration of the subject. It is apparent, therefore, that I am unable to concur with Sheppard J.A. who agreed with the conclusion of MacLean J. that the company's claim for exemption failed,\u2014but for the reason that catalysts and direct agents do not stand in relation to the product, the wood pulp, \"by contact or temporary incorporation\" as required by s. 5(h) of the Act.\nThe three Members of the Court of Appeal were in agreement that the proviso in Reg. 3-11, \"provided, however, that the exemption allowed by this regulation is conditional upon application being made by the purchaser within six months after the purchase of the tangible personal property in respect of which the exemption is claimed.\", was ultra vires the Lieutenant-Governor in Council. I agree with that conclusion on the sole ground that the commodities in question are exempt by virtue of the opening words of s. 5 of the Act: \"The following classes of tangible personal property are specifically exempt from the provisions of this Act\". If my understanding of the manner in which the assessment arose is correct, the company did not pay the taxes at the times of purchase, I am unable to agree with the submission of counsel for the appellant with respect to this point. His argument that the six months' limitation was imposed simply as a means of determining the class is answered by the fact that the class is fixed by the terms of s. 5 of the Act. His second contention was that the Lieutenant-Governor in Council had power to impose what counsel described as a six months' limitation on applications for exemption by virtue of the opening and concluding clauses of s. 32(1) of the Act, as underlined earlier in these reasons, because the taxes are payable at the time of purchase and because some limitation was merely a deficiency which the Lieutenant-Governor in Council is authorized to supply. In this particular case the company paid the taxes only as a result of the assessment by the Commissioner, approved by the Minister, and, in any event, the Lieutenant-Governor in Council was not authorized to take away a right conferred by the statute.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nCARTWRIGHT J. (dissenting in part):\u2014The questions raised on this appeal and the relevant provisions of the statute and the regulations are set out in the reasons of the Chief Justice.\nI agree with the conclusion reached by the Chief Justice and by all the members of the Court of Appeal that the proviso in reg. 3-11, making the allowance of the exemption set out in s. 5(h) of the Act conditional upon an application being made by the purchaser within six months after the purchase in respect of which the exemption is claimed, was ultra vires of the Lieutenant-Governor in Council.\nThe facts are not in dispute. It is agreed that all the substances in respect of which exemption is claimed are either catalysts or direct agents. In the course of its manufacturing operations the respondent generates steam to operate its pulp mill. The catalysts are used in the fireboxes to aid in the combustion of soot and to produce a cleaner fire. The direct agents are used in the boilers to inhibit corrosion and prevent scaling. None of the catalysts or direct agents enter into the wood pulp and the steam generated does not come in contact with the wood pulp.\nIt is not questioned that the tax demanded is payable unless the respondent is relieved from liability by the exemption contained in s. 5(h), and the appeal turns on the construction of that clause.\nIn construing the clause it is my opinion that we should have regard to the punctuation and particularly to the comma following the word \"catalyst\". The ratio decidendi of those cases which held that punctuation in a Statute ought not to be regarded was that statutes as engrossed on the original roll did not contain punctuation marks. We were informed by counsel that in British Columbia statutes are presented to the Legislature for passing and are passed punctuated as they appear in the copies printed by the Queen's Printer; consequently the foundation of the earlier decisions has been removed.\nIn my opinion the following statement of Lord Shaw of Dunfermline in Houston v. Burns[3], which was the case of a will, is equally applicable to the construction of statutes; he said at page 348:\nPunctuation is a rational part of English composition, and is sometimes quite significantly employed. I see no reason for depriving legal documents of such significance as attaches to punctuation in other writings.\nReading the words of clause (h) of section 5 in their grammatical and ordinary sense with the assistance of the punctuation their meaning does not seem to me to be doubtful; two separate classes of tangible personal property of the kind included in the opening words, \"Such tangible personal property by way of chemical, animal, mineral, or vegetable matter as the Lieutenant-Governor in Council may determine by regulation\", are exempt; these classes are (i) such property used as a catalyst, and (ii) such property used as a direct agent for the transformation or manufacture of a product by contact or temporary incorporation.\nIt follows that in my opinion the respondent is entitled to the exemption claimed in regard to the purchase of the substances which were used as catalysts.\nThe case of the other substances with which we are concerned is more difficult. It is conceded that these substances are \"direct agents\" but it is contended for the appellant that they are not used \"for the transformation or manufacture of a product by contact or temporary incorporation\". It is argued that in the facts of the case at bar the word \"product\" must mean the wood pulp which is produced by the operations of the respondent and it is clear that the direct agents do not come in contact with and are not at any stage incorporated temporarily or otherwise with the wood-pulp. This argument found favour with MacLean J., who rejected the argument that the boiler sludge produced as a result of the action of the direct agents could be regarded as a product in the following words:\nThis would require one to give a strained and unnatural meaning to the word \"product\" appearing in the context which it does. The whole clause is obviously concerned with exemptions for manufacturers, and I think that the \"product\" of this appellant is wood pulp, and not boiler sludge.\nSheppard J.A. would have affirmed the judgment of the learned Judge of first instance on this point on the ground that even if the sludge might be regarded as a product (a question which he found it unnecessary to decide) the direct agents became an integral part of the sludge and could not be said to stand in relation to it \"by contact or temporary incorporation\".\nThe majority in the Court of Appeal in rejecting the view of MacLean J., dealt with the matter as follows:\nOn that aspect of the case the learned Judge held that \"product\" in that context means only a commercial product of a business\u2014in this case, wood pulp.\nWith deference I cannot agree. In my opinion \"product\" as there used is not confined to the commercial products of a business. If it were \"transformation\" would be part of the manufacturing process and would be included in the word \"manufacture\". In that sense it would be redundant.\nI find support for that view in the fact that the second part of clause (h) specifically restricts the exemption thereby allowed to personal property manufactured into or attached to other personal property for the \"purpose of retail sale\".\nThe last words clearly indicate that under the second part of clause (h) the end product must be a commercial product. But those restricting words are conspicuously absent in the first part of the clause. The omission is, I think, intentional, because the products there meant are the products of manufacturing processes regardless of the stage at which they are produced, beginning, middle, or end, or whether they are waste or commercial.\nWhat that part of the clause requires for exemption is that the substance be used to transform or manufacture any product of the processes used regardless of whether the product be waste or commercial. \"Transformation\" relates to waste products, and \"manufacture\" refers to commercial products.\nWith respect it appears to me that in the concluding words of clause (h):\u2014\nor such tangible personal property as is used for the purpose of being processed, fabricated, or manufactured into, attached to, or incorporated into other tangible personal property for the purpose of retail sale. the emphasis is not on the distinction between waste products and commercial products but on the distinction between property intended for retail sale and property intended for other purposes such as, for example, wholesale sale.\nOn this branch of the matter I am in agreement with the reasoning of MacLean J. that to interpret the word \"product\" in clause (h), as including boiler sludge would be to give it an unnatural meaning. If that meaning had been intended some such word as \"substance\" would have been more appropriate than the word \"product\". In view of my agreement with MacLean J. on this point it becomes unnecessary for me to examine the ground upon which Sheppard J.A. proceeded.\nFor the above reasons I would allow the appeal in part and direct that the judgments below be set aside and that judgment be entered declaring that the respondent is entitled to the exemption claimed in respect of its purchases of catalysts but is not entitled to the exemption claimed in respect of its purchases of direct agents. As success has been divided I would direct that there should be no order as to costs in the courts below or in this Court.\nAppeal dismissed with costs, CARTWRIGHT J. dissenting in part.\nSolicitor for the appellant: G.

The plaintiff company undertook to construct a road for the defendant. Time was stated to be of the essence. Slow progress was made by the plaintiff with the work, and in order to complete the work on time, the road was shortened and also built to grades lower than originally agreed upon. Eventually, the plaintiff ceased all work under the contract, and contending that the defendant was in default under the contract in refusing to entertain a claim for substantial deficiencies in payments due, treated the contract as terminated by the defendant. The plaintiff claimed the deficiencies and the defendant claimed compensation for breach of the contract. The trial judge maintained the action, but this judgment was reversed by the Court of Appeal.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nThe terms of the written contract applied throughout to the work performed by the plaintiff. Conclusive evidence proved that the plaintiff had not completed the work to the satisfaction of the engineer by the time it abandoned the work, nor was it shown that it had been released of its obligation to complete the whole length of the road. The alleged breach of contract by the defendant was not established. The plaintiff was not entitled to quantum meruit but only to contract unit prices; and the defendant was entitled to damages for breach of contract by virtue of the plaintiff\u2019s refusal to complete the work.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1], reversing a judgment of Wells J. Appeal dismissed.\nA.L. Flemming, Q.C., and Meredith Flemming, Q.C., for the plaintiff, appellant.\nR.F. Wilson, Q.C., R.L. McDonald, Q.C., and C.E. Woollcombe, for the defendant, respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nLOCKE J.:\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Appeal of Ontario[2] by which the appeal of the present respondent from the judgment of Wells J. was allowed, the judgment at the trial set aside and the cross-appeal of the present appellant dismissed.\nOn April 9, 1954, the appellant, therein described as the contractor, and the respondent entered into an agreement for the construction of approximately 8\u00bd miles of a road from a designated point on Provincial Highway no. 105 westerly to Station 450 of the said road. The respondent was at the time in the course of constructing an electric generating station at Manitou Falls on the English River, and the proposed road was to provide access to this undertaking. Prior to the making of the contract the appellant had been invited to tender for the work and had been furnished with a form of the contract which would be made if the tender made was accepted, the general specifications which would be applicable, drawings which indicated the location and a profile of the proposed road, and further detailed information as to the proposed work.\nIn view of the contention of the contractor that the nature of the location for the proposed road had been misrepresented to it, certain of the terms of the tender that was made dated February 13, 1954, and which was accepted are to be considered.\nThe tender recited that the appellant had visited the location of the road, examined the documents above referred to, and was fully informed as to the nature of the work and the conditions relating to its performance and understood that the quantities tendered for were approximate only and subject to either increase or decrease.\nThe instructions to the tenderers which were in the appellant\u2019s possession before the tenders were made contained the information that tenderers were required to examine the condition\u2019s at the site before submitting their tender and that the road was urgently required and the completion date should be September 1, 1954.\nThe documents described as instructions to tenderers, information for tenderers, which contained the above mentioned statements, the general specifications with accompanying drawings and the standard specifications of the respondent as enumerated in the agreement, were by their terms to be read with and form part of the contract.\nBy para. 6 of the contract the contractor agreed to construct the road on or before September 1, 1954, in strict accordance with the contract and to the approval of the engineer, and to do all work under the direction of the engineer whose directions as to the construction and meaning of the exhibits were declared to be final.\nThe respondent agreed to determine the contract price for the work on the basis of the schedule of unit prices, which were those proposed by the appellant in its tender, applied to the quantities of the several works items actually performed, as computed by the engineer, in accordance with the drawings and specifications. In dealing with the main claim of the appellant, the prices which apply are those for earth excavation (including borrow) of .50 cts. per cubic yard and rock excavation of $1.75 per cubic yard.\nPara. 8 of the contract stated that the contractor agreed that it was fully informed regarding all of the conditions affecting work to be done and labour and materials to be furnished for the completion of the work, that this information was secured by personal investigation and research and not from the commission or its estimates, and that it will make no claim against the commission based on any estimate or representation of the commission or the engineer, or any representative of either.\nPara. 11 reads:\nThe Commission, without invalidating the Contract, may make changes by altering, adding to or deducting from the work subject to adjustments for compensation or extension of time as may be agreed between the parties hereto.\nPara. 13 obligated the contractor to prosecute the work with all skill and diligence so as to complete the same in accordance with the contract and declared that if the contractor did not, in the opinion of the engineer, carry on the work with sufficient diligence and speed to ensure completion in accordance with the contract, the commission might terminate the agreement and at its option complete the work in such manner as it should think fit, the contractor to be liable for any loss sustained by the commission by reason of the contractor\u2019s failure to complete the work.\nPara. 16 provided that any loss or damage arising out of the nature of the work, or from any unforeseen circumstances in the prosecution of the work or any unusual obstructions or difficulties, should be sustained and borne by the contractor at his own cost.\nPara. 21 provided that the decision of the engineer should control as to the interpretation of the drawings and specifications during the execution of the work and that he should be the sole judge of the work, material and plant, both as to quality and quantity, and that his decision on all questions of dispute relating to any of these matters should be final. The general specifications forming part of the contract provided that payment for compaction should be included in the tendered unit price for earth excavation.\nThe standard specifications for general grading operations made applicable to the contract provided by para. 18 that \u201cearth excavation shall include the removal of all material that does not come under the classification of rock.\u201d Para. 21 provided, inter alia, that back-fill material, if specified, should be paid for at the contract unit price for the material used. Para. 28 provided that all rock excavated should be used for rock embankment construction and material from earth cuts or earth borrow should be used for earth embankment, if approved by the engineer. Para. 43 provided in part:\nPayment for earth and rock embankment construction shall be included in the contract unit prices per cubic yard for excavation\u2026 In addition, payment will be made for:\n(c) Borrow material at the contract unit price per cubic yard for earth or rock excavation for the material actually used in embankments.\nThe cross section of the proposed road shown upon the plan submitted to the contractor showed that it was to be constructed of what may properly be described as three courses, the lower course being described in the cross section as being of earth or rock-fill. Above this, there was to be placed 12 inches of selected granular base B material and, above that, 6 inches of 5\/8 inch crushed gravel. The top course was to be given what was described as Bituminous Surface Treatment, in accordance with designated specifications. The granular base course was defined in the standard specification as being selected from deposits of pit\u2011run gravel, sand or other granular materials which have a physical structure not affected by water and elements, and the Class B mentioned, it was said, might be used directly from the pit without processing if the material conformed with the specification requirements which were then stated in para. 7.\nIncluded in the information supplied to the tenderers was a statement that an extensive body of material suitable for road construction had been located by the commission near the junction of the proposed access road and the provincial highway and that no other areas in the vicinity of this section of the road had been investigated up to the time the information was furnished.\nThe appellant\u2019s tender was made during the winter, at a time when the area in which the proposed road was to be constructed was covered with snow. While the profile plan which was exhibited to the appellant indicated the nature of the ground at various places along the course of the proposed road, this was information which the commission had obtained by enquiry and was not, by the terms of the tender and the contract, guaranteed to be accurate. In the result, not long after the appellant commenced its work, it was found that this information was in many respects quite inaccurate. There was, however, close to the point of the commencement of the road, the large deposite of suitable granular material referred to, from which the great majority of the material of this nature used in the construction of the road throughout its course was obtained. The evidence appears to me to justify the conclusion that, in the main, the material from this source was suitable for the selected granular base course required by the contract and the specification.\nThe form of tender supplied by the commission for use by proposed tenderers also contained estimates of, inter alia, the quantities of the various kinds of material to be excavated, the estimated extent of the muskeg excavation being 8,000 cubic yards. These estimates, which were described as such, turned out to be quite inaccurate and a very much greater quantity of material was excavated from muskegs than the estimate indicated.\nBy the terms of the contract the appellant agreed to construct the road westerly to Station 450 of the said road. Its course was shown upon a drawing which was made part of the contract. The profile plan referred to in the tender showed the proposed levels of the road and the location of these stations, they being 100 feet apart. Whether their location was marked on the ground along the proposed right-of-way is not stated.\nDonald Murphy, the president of the appellant company, was in active charge and direction of the work from the outset. For the respondent, P.G. Campbell, the resident engineer for the construction work at Manitou Falls, was appointed the project manager in connection with the construction of the road. W.G. Baggs, a professional engineer employed by the respondent, was appointed as the divisional engineer in charge of the construction and was in constant touch with the work throughout.\nAccording to Murphy, when the work had progressed to a point between Stations 25 and 35, it was necessary to excavate and back-fill a considerable area of muskeg and, upon the direction of Baggs, granular material brought from the borrow pit above mentioned was used for this purpose. It was Murphy\u2019s contention, advanced at this time and never abandoned by him, that under the terms of the contract the appellant was entitled to be paid for granular material used, either as back-fill, embankment or otherwise, in connection with the work, at the price stipulated in the agreement for the selected granular base course which was .68 cts. per ton, or approximately $1.02 per cubic yard. Baggs, on the other hand, said that the only material that would be paid for at this rate was that used for the course 12 inches in depth described as selected granular course in the plan and the agreement, and that all other granular material used would be paid for only as earth excavation for which the price of .50 cts. per cubic yard was payable.\nThe claim advanced by Murphy on behalf of the appellant was based upon a term of para. 21 of the standard specification which said:\nBack-fill material if specified will be paid for at the contract unit price for the material used.\nSince the engineer directed that granular material should be used, it was contended that the price for that material agreed upon for the selected granular base course was applicable. This contention was made on behalf of the appellant at the trial and in the Court of Appeal and, in both Courts, it was found that as there was no contract unit for granular material or gravel as such, apart from the 12 inches of selected granular base course, when used elsewhere it must be deemed to come under the heading of earth excavation, payment for which was provided for in para. 7 of the contract. By the terms of para. 43 of the specification above mentioned this payment included placing the material as part of the road construction. By a tender in writing dated June 7, 1954, the appellant offered to supply 14,000 tons of 5\/8 inch crushed gravel to be delivered to a 4.8 mile stretch of the road, and 4,000 tons to be stock-piled at the gravel pit area \u201cG\u201d which was close to the point where the road commenced, at prices which were stated. This offer was accepted in writing by the respondent on July 20, 1954, and this material which was required for the top course of the road was laid by the appellant up to Station 95.\nSlow progress was made by the contractor with the work. This was undoubtedly due in part to the fact that the terrain encountered was less favourable for road construction than Murphy had anticipated and to bad weather. By July 21st, when they were working at about Station 95, less than 2 miles from the point of commencement, Campbell wrote to Murphy pointing out that the agreement required the work to be completed by September 1, 1954, that he had repeatedly drawn to the contractor\u2019s attention that it was behind schedule and that when asked how it was proposed to improve the speed of the work no satisfactory answer had been given. The letter stated that the project manager had recommended to his superiors that the commission itself take over the completion of the last 1\u00bd miles of the road and carry out the work by its construction department. Apparently, Murphy raised no objection to this.\nAt a meeting at Dryden, held on or about July 22nd, Campbell informed Murphy that he proposed to reduce the grade of the road and gave him a written memorandum as to the changes to be made between Stations 103 and 145. The purpose of this, according to Campbell, was to reduce the quantities of materials to be moved so that the work might be completed on time. Apparently, an extension of time for completing the work was discussed at this meeting as on the same date Murphy wrote to Campbell confirming a discussion of the subject and saying that it was expected to have the road completed by September 15 to the full width but not to the profile grade. Murphy did not object to the commission taking over the part of road indicated and the work continued.\nAccording to Murphy, he was instructed by Baggs not to put any more of the 5\/8 inch crushed material on the road past Station 95. He was indefinite as to the date when this occurred, saying that it was either in the first or second week of August. Campbell denied that any such instructions were given. Baggs was not asked as to this but a letter written by him to D. Ganton, the superintendent of the appellant company, on August 9, 1954, in which he drew the superintendent\u2019s attention to various matters connected with the work which he considered required attention, was put in evidence and included the following statement:\nBefore placing 5\/8 inch crushed gravel between Sta. 95 plus 00 and Sta. 145 plus 00 the road surface is to be brought to final grade as indicated on my Memo to you re \u201cList of grades to be adhered to and considered as profile grade\u201d.\nThe list of grades referred to were those shown in the memorandum which had been given to Murphy on July 22nd. Murphy acknowledged having seen this letter at the time and the instructions appear to be completely inconsistent with his statement that work of laying this material had been stopped.\nAs the progress made with the work continued to be unsatisfactory and as Murphy contended that the work already done had not been paid for in accordance with the agreement, a meeting was arranged between him and some of the senior officials of the commission and one of its solicitors in Toronto early in August. Murphy was represented by a solicitor at these meetings but there is a conflict of evidence as to what was actually agreed upon. It is, however, common ground that the parties agreed that the commission should take over the 1\u00bd miles of the road above mentioned and the appellant be released of any obligation as to that portion of the work and that the time of completion be extended to September 15th.\nThe work which had commenced in April had then been in the main completed to Station 185, though the top course of 5\/8 inch crushed gravel had not been laid past Station 95, and an equal distance of the road remained to be completed. In view of the urgency of having a usable road for hauling freight by September 15th, further changes in the work were then directed by Campbell. On August 17, he wrote to Murphy in the following terms:\nIn view of the importance of having a road through to the powersite by September 15th, we have requested you to concentrate on placing fill, only to a depth required to carry your haulage equipment; thus providing us with a road bed of reasonable grades, over which we can haul freight. Since this material will be placed as common fill and will in most cases be of sufficient depth to meet our requirements for a finished road bed, some method of paying you for the top 12 inches of this fill, as selected granular base course, will have to be agreed upon.\nWe are prepared to pay you for a volume of selected granular base course 12 inches thick and 29 1\/2 feet wide over the total length of the road from Sta. 0 plus 00 to 370 plus 00. This volume to be converted to a weight basis by applying a factor of 3,600 pounds per cubic yard of material compacted in the road bed.\nPlease study this proposal and advise if you are in agreement with this method of determining the quantity of material to be paid for as selected granular base course.\nFurther instructions as to this work were given by Baggs in a letter to the superintendent of the appellant which read in part:\nIt is requested that your company concentrate on placing fill only to a depth required to carry your haulage equipment. From Sta. 193 plus 00 to 370 plus 00, except for several muskeg and rock excavations, the road is strictly a fill proposition, and grades should be kept to at least sub-grade, and where possible, lower. In order to do this, it will be necessary that the road bed, before fill is placed, be well drained, and in a reasonably dry condition. This can only be made possible by paying particular attention to lateral and offtake ditches.\nThis letter was dated August 20, 1954.\nNo written reply was made to either of these letters. The appellant, however, proceeded with the work, using granular material where fill was required for the lower course and, the appellant contends, placed the 12 inch granular base course to Station 370. This road which was referred to by the parties as a \u201cskin\u201d road from Station 185 was lower than the grade shown upon the profile, this being accomplished by lowering the lower course required by the original contract. This portion of the road as constructed was apparently sufficient to carry the trucks which brought the material for the construction.\nIn spite of this change which very materially reduced the amount of work to be done by the contractor, Station 370 was not reached until about September 22nd.\nMurphy then took the attitude for the first time that the work to be performed by the appellant had been completed. On September 28, 1954, the appellant wrote to Campbell saying that since the base road was completed the appellant would no longer require the services of a machine which it had rented from the commission. The reasons assigned by the appellant for declining to carry out the terms of the written agreement must be carefully considered. On September 11, 1954, Murphy had written to the general manager of the respondent stating that the monthly estimates made on the instruction of the respondent\u2019s engineer upon which payments were made differed so materially from the work actually done that the appellant found its credit jeopardized and unless the matter was remedied the appellant would be unable to continue. There was enclosed with this letter a statement purporting to show the difference between the various materials actually placed in the road according to the appellant\u2019s figures, and those allowed by the engineer for the months May to August inclusive. According to this statement, while payment had been made by the respondent for 16,180 tons of granular material in June, the appellant had placed 52,430 tons on the road and in the other months very large discrepancies were shown. As to the granular material, it is admittedly the fact that in preparing these figures all granular material placed upon the road, whether or not it formed part of the granular base course, was treated as material for which the appellant was entitled under the contract to payment at the rate of $1.02 per ton instead of .50cts., as contended by the engineers. This contention was based upon an interpretation of the contract which the learned trial judge and the Court of Appeal have held to be erroneous.\nOn October 1, 1954, Murphy wrote to J.R. Montague, the director of engineering of the respondent at Toronto, in response to a request that he state what were the appellant\u2019s claims. In this letter it was stated that the appellant\u2019s contension was that all quantities of granular material used as backfill sections over critical material (meaning material unsuitable for use as fill), all through cuts of critical material, all back-fill of muskeg excavation and all fill through wet sections must be classified as granular base course and paid for at the contract unit price for such material.\nOn October 7, 1954, J.H. Amys, Q.C., who had attended the meeting with the Hydro Commission above mentioned as solicitor for the appellant, wrote to the respondent saying that Campbell had declined to have the quantities of selected granular base course material calculated in accordance with an agreement that he had made with Murphy and that the appellant took the attitude that the commission had defaulted in its obligations under the contract and that such default justified it in treating the contract as terminated by the Hydro-Electric Power Commission of Ontario. The reference to the agreement said to have been made between Campbell and Murphy as to the measurements of granular material was one which they had agreed upon early in the work but which Campbell had thereafter decided was unsuitable as a means of accurately determining the quantities and declined to carry into effect.\nOn the day following, a letter was sent to the respondent in the name of the appellant company saying that, as the commission had refused to entertain its claim for substantial discrepancies due under the contract which, it was said, amounted as of September 30th to approximately $100,000, the appellant treated the contract as terminated by the commission and that such termination justified the appellant in ceasing further work under the contract. The contract referred to at the end of this letter was described as being Manitou Falls Generating Station Access Road Construction Contract. The only contract that answered that description was that of April 9, 1954.\nThe cause of action set up in the statement of claim was that in the course of attempting to carry out the contract of April 9, 1954, the parties had found that the drawings did not describe the road required by the defendant for the purposes of its enterprise, that the plaintiff had been verbally requested by the defendant to construct a shorter road at the general location indicated in the written contract, but in conformity with the actual conditions found on the terrain rather than with those shown on the drawings, and that payments were to be made as the work progressed and that it was an implied term that the plaintiff would be paid a reasonable price for its materials and labour. It was further alleged that:\nThe plaintiff proceeded with the said work which the defendant accepted but the defendant did not carry out its undertaking to make payments as the work progressed and as a result the plaintiff was obliged to stop work on the road. In respect of the cause of action thus pleaded the defendant claimed the sum of $457,245.14 for breach \u201cof contract on building the road\u201d, or alternatively on a quantum meruit basis.\nIn response to a demand for particulars the plaintiff said that the request to construct a shorter road had been made by Campbell on or about July 21, 1954. As to the allegation that the defendant had accepted the road, the plaintiff said that the defendant had taken over and used the work done by the plaintiff in the Fall of 1954, thereby accepting it.\nThe defence denied that the plaintiff had been requested to construct a shorter road and set up the terms of the contract and the documents incorporated in it as an answer to the claim. It was further denied that the defendant had accepted the road and alleged that as the plaintiff had failed to carry out the work required the defendant had been compelled to complete such work at an expense of $17,925.07. This amount, while claimed originally as a counterclaim, was later added to the statement of defence by way of set off.\nThe learned trial judge found, as has been stated, that for the granular material used in the construction of the road other than for the granular base course 12 inches in depth, the appellant was entitled to be paid .50 cts. per cubic yard, being the price specified in the contract for earth excavation. The claim pleaded that a new contract had been substituted for that of April 9, 1954, was rejected and the plaintiff was found entitled to recover for the work performed up to Station 186 in accordance with the prices fixed by the written contract. Wells J. however, considered that the situation was different in respect to the work done from Station 186 to Station 370. Referring to the letter of August 17, 1954, above quoted, the learned judge found that the directions there given did not amount to an abandonment of the contract but that the effect of it was to take away from the contractor for the remaining portion of the road what were referred to as the two most valuable items of the contract, namely, the laying of the \u215d inch crushed gravel and the laying of the selected granular base course from Station 186. Pointing out that while paragraph 11 of the contract permitted the respondent to make changes by altering, adding to or deducting from the work, the right was \u201csubject to adjustments for compensation or extension of time as may be agreed between the parties hereto\u201d, and it was said that this implied that proper compensation should be made and that no such adjustments were ever made. The reasons continue:\nThe failure to make such compensation was, in my view, a serious breach of the contract by the defendant Commission, and, in view of such breach and failure, the plaintiff was, in my view, entitled to stop work as he did. He would have, I think, been entitled to do it earlier.\nIn these circumstances the learned judge considered that the amount of the compensation should be calculated and that this could be done only by requiring the defendant to pay for what had been done as on a quantum meruit. It was further held that there was not any \u201cclear understanding with Mr. Murphy, and I accept his evidence and that of his witnesses that so far as they understood their work was through when the skin road was put through and the road finally trimmed and cleaned up.\u201d It was, accordingly, not necessary to consider the claim of the present respondent to set off against any moneys owing to the appellant its costs of completing the road in accordance with the written contract.\nThe trial judge further allowed the plaintiff company to amend by claiming a number of sums as extras to which I will make reference later.\nThe unanimous judgment of the Court of Appeal was given by Laidlaw J.A. It was found that the terms of payment prescribed by the written contract applied throughout and directed that the judgment at the trial be set aside. Upon the vital question as to the basis upon which the appellant was entitled to payment for granular material used other than for the 12 inch granular base course, in agreement with the trial judge, it was held that the price applicable was .50 cts. per cubic yard under the terms of the contract and that the changes made, first at Station 95 and thereafter at Station 186, did not make the work of construction radically different from that which was undertaken by the appellant under the contract. After pointing out that the reduction in grade was made by reducing the dept of the earth and rock-fill only and that the necessity for this reduction was occasioned by the urgent need of the respondent to have the whole length of the road in a usable state by September 15th as agreed, the learned judge said that the reductions thus made were an accommodation to and for the advantage of the appellant since, in the event of non-completion of the road on or before September 15th, the respondent might have exercised its contractual right to declare the contract forfeited and have proceeded to hold the appellant liable in damages for breach of contract. Upon the evidence the learned judge concluded that the appellant knew that, after placing the earth and rock-fill and building the base course overlying it from Station 186 to Station 370, the respondent expected that at a later date the surface course of \u215d inch crushed stone would be laid by the appellant in accordance with the contract and that both parties fully understood that the contract continued in force and effect notwithstanding the reduction in the grade.\nFor the reasons given in the judgment at the trial and in the Courth of Appeal, I agree that under the terms of the contract the granular material used, other than for the base granular course, was to be paid for at the rate fixed for earth excavation, including \u201cborrow\u201d, that is .50 cts. per cubic yard. The pit run gravel that was used was borrow material. I also agree with the learned judges of the Court of Appeal that the terms of the written contract applied throughout to the work performed by the appellant.\nThe contract made between the parties dated April 9, 1954, was executed under their respective corporate seals. The contractor, as I have pointed out, agreed to construct a road in accordance with the specifications and that all phases of the work should be performed to the satisfaction of the engineer on or before September 1, 1954. Time was declared to be material and of the essence of the contract.\nIn order to succeed it was necessary for the appellant to establish that in some manner it had been released of its obligation to complete the road throughout its length, including the construction of the lower course and the granular base course from Station 186 to Station 370, and the laying of the top course and the application of the bituminous surface treatment from Station 95 to the end of the road, to the satisfaction of the engineer. That the appellant had not completed this work to the satisfaction of the engineer on October 8, 1954, when it abandoned the work, is conclusively proven by the evidence. With great respect I disagree with the finding at the trial that the respondent was then in default under the contract and that the appellant was entitled to elect to treat such contract as repudiated by the respondent.\nI find nothing in the evidence to support a contention that the appellant was released of its said obligation under this contract. The letters referred to directing the work to be done forthwith between Stations 186 and 370 did not say that the contractor was relieved of its obligation to lay the top course upon the road from Station 95 to Station 370 and to apply the bituminous surface treatment, or that the work was not to be carried out to the satisfaction of the engineer. The reason for the orders then given by the engineer are made apparent by the evidence. The road was urgently needed by September 15th for transporting freight to the large construction works being carried on at Manitou Falls and less than one month of the new time stipulated for completion remained and half of the road remained to be constructed. At that time the appellant had spent four months upon the first half of the road and even that work was not completed.\nThe learned trial judge, after considering the evidence, found that when these instructions were given to Murphy it was not made clear to him that he was to do anything more than comply with the directions then given. I would not so interpret the evidence but, even if this were correct, it does not assist the position of the appellant. The written contract still remained in force, the grade between Stations 186 and 370 had not been completed to the satisfaction of the engineer and the top course had not been laid past Station 95. It was not necessary for the engineer to point out to the appellant or its officers its obligations under the contract.\nThis covenant of the appellant remaining unfulfilled, the respondent was entitled to insist upon its performance unless in some manner it was estopped by the actions of the engineer from doing so. As to this there is no plea of estoppel in the appellant\u2019s pleadings and estoppel must be pleaded. I may add that if there were such a plea, any such contention, in my opinion, is untenable upon this evidence. I have carefully examined the evidence of the witnesses Murphy, Campbell and Baggs and the correspondence affecting the matter and, having done so, I share the view expressed by Laidlaw J.A. that both parties understood that the written contract continued in force throughout and that Murphy knew that, after completing what has been referred to as the skin road, the engineer expected that the remainder of the work would be completed forthwith. There is evidence in the record of a discussion in the cookhouse of the appellant company on September 21, 1954, between Murphy and C.T. Enright, the roads supervisor of the respondent commission, at which time Enright says that Murphy stated that he would keep his entire crew working full time until he had got the skin road through to Station 370, at which time he would give his men a holiday of four days and then he would come back and finish up the road, but that one of the conditions for coming back was that he would get \u201ca revision of prices on certain materials.\u201d Baggs was present and heard this statement by Murphy and gave evidence to the same effect. The latter, when asked about it, admitted that he had been there and talked to Enright but said that he did not remember saying that they would not do any further work unless they were paid. The judgment at the trial, dealing with this conversation, says that Murphy denied this but this, with respect, was inaccurate since he merely said that he did not remember making the statement. While referring to the fact that Baggs had given evidence to this effect, no mention was made of the fact that Enright also had sworn to it. The statement in the letter of October 8, 1954, above referred to, that the appellant was justified in \u201cceasing further work under the contract\u201d, is completely inconsistent with the idea that at that time Murphy considered the work to be done had been completed.\nIt will be seen that the reason assigned by the appellant for treating the contract as repudiated by the respondent and itself discharged from doing further work was not the reason upon which that action was justified in the judgment at the trial. The letter of September 11, 1954 complained that the monthly payments that were being made were not in accordance with the contract, the complaint being based upon the respondent\u2019s refusal to pay for the granular material in accordance with Murphy\u2019s construction of the agreement. The letter of October 1st from Murphy to the director of engineering of the respondent made it perfectly clear that this was the complaint and the letters of October 7th and 8th based the appellant\u2019s refusal to do further work on the alleged fact that approximately $100,000 was owing to the appellant for the work already done, this referring to the same matter.\nThese letters contain no complaint that the effect of the instructions given by the engineers in August was to deprive the contractor of the profitable work of laying the granular base course and the top course of the road. There was good reason for this since this work had not been taken away from the appellant, though the time for completing it was deferred. As the evidence discloses, the appellant repudiated the contract upon grounds which have been held to be and are untenable and the usual consequences must follow.\nApart from the claims made in respect of the construction of the road, the appellant claimed an amount for supplying certain 5\/8 inch crushed gravel under the terms of the contract of July 20, 1954. That contract fixed a price for 14,000 tons of this material to be delivered to a 4.8 mile stretch of the road at $1.78 per ton, and 4,000 tons to be stock piled at a specified gravel pit for which the price was .97 cts. per ton.\nIn addition, the appellant claimed to recover under a further contract dated July 31, 1954 for 2,938 tons of crushed gravel concrete aggregate and 8,582 tons of concrete sand which it claimed to have delivered. The statement of defence denies that the appellant had delivered any of the 5\/8 inch crushed gravel under the contract of July 20, but admitted that the plaintiff had delivered material under the contract of July 31 to a total slightly in excess of that claimed, in respect of which it was admitted that the appellant was entitled to a credit of $9,247.39.\nThe price provided for the 5\/8 inch crushed gravel, other than that which was to be stock piled, included the delivery of this material on to the road and this had not been done, the appellant contending that it had been stopped from doing so. This fact was found against it in the judgment at the trial. In dealing with this claim, Wells J. directed that there be a reference to the Master to determine the amount payable in respect of the 5\/8 inch crushed gravel less a fair and reasonable amount to be deducted from the contract price for the haulage of such part of the said material as should have been delivered by the plaintiff. In respect of the claim for the material produced under the contract of July 31st, the Master was directed to give credit to the plaintiff in the amount of $9,192.04, a sum less than the amount admitted as payable in the statement of defence.\nThe judgment of the Court of Appeal, as entered, directed the Master to enquire as to the amount of the credit to be allowed for the 5\/8 inch crushed gravel referred to, being the cost to the plaintiff of producing such material, plus a reasonable percentage of such cost as profit. No mention was made of the credit to be allowed in respect of the material covered by the contract of July 31.\nNo objection was made to the form of this reference to the Master and, as the amount of the credit to which the appellant is admittedly entitled on the pleadings is not in question and will be taken into account by the Master, I think it unnecessary to amend the judgment of the Court of Appeal in this respect.\nIn addition to these claims, the appellant was permitted by the judgment at the trial to claim various amounts as extras and the pleadings were amended to claim certain sums should it be held that the appellant was not entitled to be paid as on the basis of a quantum meruit for its entire claim.\nAs to all of these claims I agree with the reasons for judgment of Mr. Justice Laidlaw and am of the opinion that they are properly dealt with in the judgment of the Court of Appeal.\nI would dismiss this appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the plaintiff, appellant: Flemming, Smoke & Burgess, Toronto.\nSolicitors for the defendant, respondent: Day, Wilson, Kelly, Martin & Campbell, Toronto.\n[1] [1958] O.W.N. 349, 14 D.L.R.

This tax was in addition to any other tax imposed on land by any other Act. The plaintiff company owns iron ore mineral claims in an area declared to be a producing area in respect of iron ore, and is engaged in the business of mining iron ore which it sells exclusively for export.\nContemporaneously with the passing of this Act, the Legislature enacted the Iron Bounty Act, 1957 (B.C.), c. 9, which permitted the payment of a bounty in respect of certain classes of iron charged directly to a steel furnace from ore smelted within the province. The highest bounty was to be paid in respect of iron ore mined within the province and on which tax had been paid. There is no smelter on the west coast of the province.\nThe trial judge held that the Act was ultra vires, but this judgment was reversed by the Court of Appeal.\nHeld: The Act was invalid as imposing an export tax.\nThe true nature of an impugned statute is not necessarily to be determined alone from its language, and where other statutes of the Legislature on related subjects have been passed prior to or contemporaneously with it, their history and evidence as to their effect may properly be considered in determining what is the true nature of the statute. Reference re Alberta Legislation, [1939] A.C. 117.\nThe true nature and purpose of the legislation was not the raising of revenue for provincial purposes under head 2 of s. 92 of the B.N .A. Act. Its purpose was to encourage manufacturing activities in the province by the imposition of such a high rate of taxation upon iron ore in place as to either impede or render economically impossible the export of the ore, under the business conditions prevailing in 1958. The evidence showed that the properties in question, if taxed at that rate, could not be operated profitably unless a smelter were established thus enabling the recovery of the tax and a bounty of $5 in addition. It was significant that the Iron Bounty Act, passed contemporaneously, increased the maximum bounty from $3 to $5, thus pointing out to those engaged in iron mining, which had been singled out from other mining activities and subjected to a tax at this extraordinary rate, a way by which they could recoup themselves. The real nature of the tax was, therefore, an export tax, and as such, it was indirect and ultra vires of the Legislature. Reference re Alberta Legislation, [1939] A.C. 117; McDonald Murphy Lumber v. A.G. for British Columbia, [1930] A.C. 357, applied. C.P.R. v.

Arnup, Q.C., and A. B. Ferris, for the plaintiff, appellant.\nM. M. McFarlane, Q.C., and G.S. Cumming, for the defendant, respondent.\nE. R. Pepper, for the Attorney-General of Ontario, intervenant.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nLOCKE J.:\u2014In this action the present appellant asked for a declaration that the Mineral Property Taxation Act, being Chapter 60 of the Statutes of British Columbia for 1957, and certain regulations made under powers vested in the Lieutenant-Governor in Council of the Province by the said statute are ultra vires, and further for a declaration that the appellant is not liable to make certain returns demanded of it under the provisions of the regulations.\nSullivan J., by whom the action was tried, held the Act to be ultra vires. While it necessarily followed from this finding that the regulations based upon the statute were also beyond the powers of the Lieutenant-Governor in Council, this fact was declared in the formal judgment entered and it was further found that the demands referred to in the statement of claim were unauthorized and the appellant not liable to pay any tax in respect of iron or concentrates or other iron products under the Act. This judgment, in so far as it declared the statute itself to be ultra vires the Legislature, was set aside by the Court of Appeal but Davey and Sheppard JJ. A., a majority of the Court, were of the opinion that s. 4 of the regulations passed was invalid.\nThe Act in question by s. 3 provides that the Lieutenant-Governor in Council may from time to time by order declare that any portion of the province designated in such order constitutes a producing area for the purpose of the Act, and by such order or by a separate order designate the mineral or minerals in respect of which the portion of the province therein designated is constituted a producing area.\nSection 4 provides that every owner of land including minerals therein or of minerals within a producing area is liable for and shall pay annually to the Minister of Finance for the use of Her Majesty in the right of the province a tax computed on the value of the minerals mentioned, and declares that \"the Minister for the raising of a revenue for provincial purposes shall levy annually on every such owner\" the said tax. The section provides that the tax shall be paid at such annual rate as the Lieutenant-Governor in Council may from time to time prescribe, not exceeding 10 per cent, of the value of the minerals as assessed under the Act, and that such taxes are due and payable on the 2nd day of July of the year in which the taxation roll on which they are shown has been prepared.\nSection 5 provides that the assessor shall assess annually at their fair value all such minerals situate in a producing area and shall enter a description of the property assessed upon the assessment roll.\nSection 8 provides that all taxes assessed or imposed by virtue of the Act shall be in addition to any other tax imposed on land by any other Act.\nBy s. 9, Parts VIII, IX, X and XI of the Taxation Act, R.S.B.C. 1948, c. 332, are deemed to be incorporated in the Act and are expressly made applicable to the provisions thereof.\nBy s. 10 the Lieutenant-Governor in Council is authorized to make such regulations, not inconsistent with the spirit of the Act, as are considered necessary or advisable, and such regulations shall have the same force and effect as if incorporated in it. Section 12 provides that, where under any Act of the Legislature an owner has paid to the Crown a royalty on any mineral or minerals, the amount paid by the owner on account of such royalty shall be deemed pro tanto as payment on account or in full of the tax payable under the Act.\nAt the same session of the Legislature the Iron Bounty Act was passed as chap. 9. By this Act the Minister of Mines, with the approval of the Lieutenant-Governor in Council, is permitted to enter into an agreement with any person whereby the Crown will pay to that person out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund a bounty on each ton of 2,000 lbs, of pig-iron, sponge-iron or fluid-iron charged directly to a steel furnace from ore smelted within the province. The statute restricts the payment of bounty to 100,000 tons of iron in any one year, or more than 1,000,000 tons of iron in the aggregate.\nThe maximum bounty which may be made payable under such an agreement is $5 per ton for ore mined within the province and on which a royalty or a tax under the Mineral Property Taxation Act has been paid to the Crown: $3 per ton on iron from ore mined within the province on which neither a royalty nor a tax under the said Act has been paid to the Crown, and $2 per ton on iron from ore mined out of the province.\nBy an order in council approved on October 30, 1957, regulations made pursuant to the provisions of the Act were approved. These declared an area comprised of Vancouver Island and adjacent islands included within the meaning divisions of Alberni, Nanaimo and Victoria, to be a producing area. The expression \"mineral\" where used in the regulations was declared to mean naturally occurring compounds of iron which are or may be used in the production of metallic iron, and \"ore\" to mean a natural mineral or mineral aggregate containing iron in such quantity, grade and chemical combination as to make extraction of the iron practicable. The information required from the owners of such minerals in a producing area referred to in s. 6 of the Act was specified, and it was directed that it should be given to the assessor on or before November 15 of each year commencing with the year 1957. A formula was prescribed for determining the assessed value of such mineral in the producing area and the annual rate of taxation was declared to be 8 per cent, of the assessed value as so ascertained. The assessor was directed to prepare the assessment roll, commencing with the assessment roll for the calendar year 1958, and that this should be done in each subsequent year.\nAmendments were made to these regulations for the year 1959, describing in more detail the information to be given to the assessor, the nature of which it is unnecessary to consider in dealing with the questions to be determined.\nThe appellant is incorporated under the laws of British Columbia and owns certain Crown granted lands and mineral claims on Texada Island, which lies off the West coast of the province between the mainland and Vancouver Island. It is thus included in the producing area declared by the order in council. The company was in the year 1957 engaged in the business of mining iron ore which was concentrated at the site and, at the relevant times, was sold in this form for export principally to Japan and Germany. No sales were being made in Canada. There was not during the period of these operations, and there is not now, a smelter for the treatment of iron ore on the West coast of British Columbia and, accordingly, no means whereby pig-iron, sponge-iron, fluid-iron or steel could be produced from the appellant's ore.\nIt was shown by the evidence of Allen D. Christensen, the president of the appellant company, that the iron content of the ore in the appellant's mine was only sufficient to yield a very narrow margin of profit on the available export market. During the year 1957 the average sale price had been $6.90 a ton of concentrates. The average cost of production at the property at the time of the hearing in June of 1958 was stated as being $6.75 to $6.80 a ton. It is the contention of the appellant that if the tax of 8 per cent, upon the assessed value of the property was added to the cost of production, the operation could not have been carried on at a profit and, presumably, would have been shut down in the year 1958, in the absence of an available smelter in the province where the ores produced could have been treated. If there had been such a smelter in the year 1958, with the assistance of the maximum bounty under the Iron Bounty Act it may be safely assumed that the operation would have been profitable. The appellant alleges that the purpose of the impugned legislation was to impose an export tax on iron ore or concentrates sold for export from the province and that such tax is an indirect tax. It is further said that the tax imposed by the Mineral Property Taxation Act is a tax upon the ore rather than upon the land from which it is mined and, as such and in the ordinary course, is added to the sale price of the commodity and, accordingly, is indirect.\nThe true nature of this legislation is not to be determined alone from the language of the statute and, as was done in this Court in the reference Re Alberta Statutes[2] and by the Judicial Committee on the appeal[3], where other statutes of the Legislature passed prior to and contemporaneously with the Act dealing with the taxation of banks were considered, statutes such as the Iron Bounty Act, the Taxation Act and the history of each of these statutes and evidence as to the effect of the legislation upon iron mining in the province may properly be considered in determining what is its true nature.\nFor more than forty years the Legislature of British Columbia has endeavoured by legislation to encourage the establishment of a smelter for the treatment of iron ore and the necessary facilities for the production of steel at the West coast. The first of the Iron Bounty Acts was c. 11 of the Statutes of 1918, which permitted the Lieutenant-Governor in Council to enter into an agreement for the payment of a bounty on pig-iron in a lesser amount than that provided by the statute of 1957. Later statutes provided for the payment of bounty on both pig-iron and steel in varying amounts.\nOther legislation with the same end in view was introduced into the Taxation Act of the province in 1922. Chapter 75 of the statutes of that year repealed and replaced the Taxation Act, R.S.C. 1911, c. 222, and by s. 83 provided that, in addition to all other taxes imposed by the said Act or any other Act, there should be assessed, levied and collected quarterly from every owner of a mine a tax of .37 1\/2 cts. per ton upon all iron ore removed from the property, but that the tax should not apply in respect of iron ore mined and used in the province as a flux for the smelting of ores or other metals. This section appeared as s. 47 in R.S.C. 1948, c. 332, and, with the remainder of the sections contained in Part III of the Taxation Act, was repealed by the Mineral Property Taxation Act in 1957. We are informed, however, that no attempt was ever made to enforce payment of the tax imposed by the Taxation Act. Apparently, the reason for this, at least from and after the year 1929, was that by the decision of the Supreme Court of British Columbia in the case of McDonald Murphy Lumber Company v. Attorney General for British Columbia[4], a tax apparently considered to have been of a similar nature imposed upon timber cut within the province was held to be ultra vires. The decision of Morrison C.J. was upheld by the judgment of the Judicial Committee[5].\nIn that case s. 58 of the Forest Act 1924 imposed a tax upon all timber cut within the province, except that upon which a royalty was payable, but provided that in the case of timber used or manufactured in the province there should be a rebate of almost the entire amount of the tax. The Act prohibited the export of any timber without an accompanying certificate that the tax due in respect of it had been paid. It was contended by the paintiff in that action that the legislature was invalid on the ground that the tax imposed was an export tax and so fell within the category of duties of customs and excise which Parliament had exclusive power to impose by virtue of s. 122 of the British North America Act and, further, that it was indirect taxation and therefore not within the legislative power of the province under head 2 of s. 92. It was shown in evidence that the insignificant part of the tax imposed which was not rebated had not in practice been collected by the province, which appeared to demonstrate, if further demonstration was needed, that the true nature of the levy was an export tax. While, as the record in this case shows, it was also contended that the legislation trespassed upon the jurisdiction of Parliament under head 2 of s. 91 as being in relation to the regulation of trade and commerce, that question was not dealt with. At the trial of this action Sullivan J. considered the earlier legislation in arriving at the conclusion that the statute itself was invalid as being an attempt, under the guise of imposing a direct tax upon an interest in land, to regulate or restrain the export of ore and concentrates from the province. While that learned judge, in the course of his judgment, referred to certain statements purporting to have been made by the Premier of the Province and the Minister of Mines to the effect that the legislation was designed to discourage the export of iron ore so that eventually an integrated steel industry could be established in the province, he made it clear that he came to his conclusion without reference to this. That such statement had been made was not proven at the trial and had the evidence been tendered it would, no doubt, have been rejected as inadmissible.\nIn the Court of Appeal, O'Halloran J. A. found that the tax being upon the minerals in place was a direct tax and referred to the decision of this Court in Canadian Pacific Railway v. Attorney General of Saskatchewan[6]; as determining that question. That learned judge said in part:\nThis Court is now relieved of the necessity of examining the many constitutional decisions wherein an ultra vires indirect tax has been held to exist where the subject matter upon which the tax was imposed was not a tax upon land, since the Supreme Court of Canada in the above mentioned Saskatchewan case (1952) 2 S.C.R. 231, applied to substantially similar legislation (the similarity will be examined later), the reasoning of the Judicial Committee in the Esquimalt and Nanaimo Railway case above mentoned.\nAnd again:\nThe first accepted principle is that if a Statute is found in its pith and substance to be land tax, then the Court is no longer concerned with whether it has many of the indicia of an indirect tax (which it might if it were not a land tax), or of an excise or export tax in the sense that is described in a variety of high constitutional decisions wherein the tax under consideration was not a land tax.\nA passage from the judgment of the Judicial Committee in Attorney General of British Columbia v. Esquimalt and Nanaimo Railway[7], is then referred to, in which Lord Greene said in part:\nTheir Lordships think an intention must not in the absence of clear words, be ascribed to a responsible Legislature of enacting a provision which would be a deliberate and unworthy sham. Concluding that the true nature of the Mineral Property Taxation Act was taxation upon an interest in land, O'Halloran J. A. found the statute to be intra vires.\nSheppard J.A. was of the opinion that the true nature of the taxation was a direct tax upon the minerals in situ and neither a tax on the income derived from it nor on the commodities produced. He considered, therefore, that it was distinguishable from such cases as that of The King v. Caledonian Collieries Ltd.[8], where the tax was a levy upon the gross revenue received by the owner from the sale of coal from his mine. While mentioning the decision of the Judicial Committee in the McDonald Murphy Lumber Company case, he did so only to point to that part of the judgment of Lord MacMillan, at p. 365 of the report, where it is said that a tax levied on personal property, no less than a tax levied on real property, may be a direct tax where the taxpayer's personal property is selected as the criterion of his ability to pay, but that a tax like the one in question, levied on a commercial commodity on the occasion of its exportation, cannot be described as a tax whose incidence is, by its nature, such that normally it is finally borne by the first payer, and is not susceptible of being passed on.\nI am unable, with great respect, to agree with the conclusions of these judgments.\nThe question to be determined is not whether a tax upon minerals in the ground is a tax upon land and prima facie a direct tax, a proposition which no one would contest, but rather is whether the Mineral Property Taxation Act is an enactment in the exercise of the provincial power to raise a revenue for provincial purposes by direct taxation, or legislation the true nature of which is to impose an export tax upon the export of ore and concentrates from the Province and an indirect tax and which trespasses upon the legislative authority of Parliament as to the regulation of trade and commerce.\nThe argument in the Saskatchewan case was confined to the question as to whether the tax was indirect and, in my opinion, the decision, other than upon that aspect of the matter, does not touch the issues to be decided here. It is to be remembered that in the Saskatchewan case the taxation imposed upon lands found to be within a producing area was at a rate not exceeding 10 mills on the dollar of the assessed value. The present legislation authorizes an annual tax of 10 per cent, of the assessed value, or ten times the rate which might be imposed in Saskatchewan, a material matter to be considered. This point is not mentioned in the judgments delivered in the Court of Appeal. The extent of the tax imposed was one of the decisive matters that were considered in holding the Bank Taxation Act of Alberta invalid, both in the judgments of this Court delivered by Sir Lyman Duff[9] and of the Judicial Committee on the appeal[10].\nIn the Alberta case, that the Bank Taxation Act was ultra vires as being in relation to banks and banking was considered to have been made clear by the fact that the taxation while in form direct was so excessive as to be in effect prohibitive, and that to operate a bank in the province, created under Dominion power, would have been financially impossible.\nNo one would seriously contend, since the judgment of the Judicial Committee in Bank of Toronto v. Lambe[11], that it was not within provincial powers under head 2 of s. 92 to impose direct taxes upon banks operating within the province for the purposes mentioned, but that was not the question. Sir Lyman Duff said (p. 127) that the question there to be determined was as to whether it was an enactment in exercise of the provincial power to raise a revenue for provincial purposes by direct taxation, or was it legislation which in its true character related to the incorporation of banks and banking. The answer to this question, he said, was to be found by ascertaining the effect of the legislation in the known circumstances to which it was to be applied.\nThere were at the time of the enactment of the Act here in question three small iron mines operating, or which had recently operated, in the producing area containing Vancouver and Texada Islands and, apparently, none elsewhere in the province. Of these three the property of the appellant had been operating since 1952 and, up to the time of the trial in June of 1958, some 1,600,000 tons of iron concentrates had been produced from the ore in the claims. According to the evidence of A. D. Christensen, the price realized over this six year period had fluctuated between $6.90 and $8.40 a ton and, as stated, during 1957 had averaged approximately $6.90. These were all apparently marginal properties and one of them on Vancouver Island had been shut down at the end of 1956. One of them was described by this witness as a \"break even proposition.\"\nIt is stated in the factum of the appellant that the tax at the rate of 8 per cent, would amount to .55 cts. a ton\u2014presumably a ton of concentrates\u2014but this appears to have been calculated by taking 8 per cent, either of the average cost of production or the selling price, which is not the manner contemplated by the Act. It was, however, shown that in the assessment notice sent by the Provincial assessor to the appellant for the year 1958 the minerals were valued for assessment purposes at $973,200. A tax at the rate levied for the year 1958 would on this basis amount to something in excess of $77,000. If fixed at the maximum rate authorized by the Act it would exceed $97,000. While there is no evidence as to the tonnage of ore or concentrates produced during the year 1957, if it be assumed that the mine production was substantially the same for the years 1952 to 1957 inclusive, the average annual production would be approximately 265,000 tons. Taking the assessor's figure for the year 1958 and assuming the tonnage to be the same, the tax levied would amount to something over .29 cts. a ton which, in view of the scant margin of profit, would be prohibitive. To impose taxation at this rate upon the appellant's operation and upon the operation on Vancouver Island which was currently showing no profit would, presumably, result in both of these mines being shut down.\nSince 1896, mines and minerals in British Columbia have been regarded for the purpose of taxation as a separate class of property and, since 1897 and until the passing of the Mineral Property Taxation Act of 1957, the assessment and taxation thereof have been regulated either under the Assessment Act or the Taxation Act.\nThe rate of tax imposed upon all persons operating mines by s. 8 of c. 46 of the Statutes of 1896 was 1 per cent, of the assessed value of the ore removed during the taxation year. This tax at the same rate was continued by s. 10 of the Assessment Act, R.S.B.C. 1897, c. 179. In the revision of 1911 the same tax at the rate of two per cent, was imposed by s. 155 of the Taxation Act, R.S.B.C. 1911, c. 22, on the assessed value of the ore mined, other than coal, during the taxation year. The tax on coal was fixed at .10 cts. per ton shipped, exported or delivered. The Taxation Act, R.S.B.C. 1924, c. 254, by s. 79 imposed a tax of 2 per cent, on the income from, or the output of, a mine (other than a gold mine) of 2 per cent, and a tax at the same rate on coal. By s. 59 of the Taxation Act, R.S.B.C. 1936, c. 282, the tax on the output of any mine (not excluding a gold mine) was continued at 2 per cent, on the assessed value of the ore removed during the taxation year, or a tax on the owner's income from the mine under the Income Tax Act, whichever tax was greater in amount. The special tax on iron ore of 37 1\/2 cts. a ton above mentioned, which was first imposed in 1922, was continued by s. 62 of the Taxation Act, in the revision of 1936. The same rate of 2 per cent, upon the output or the owner's income from the mine under the Income Tax Act was continued in s. 44 of c. 332 of R.S.B.C. 1948, and this formed part of the Part III of the Act which was repealed in 1957 by the statute under consideration.\nIn comparing the quantum of these taxes which have been imposed upon minerals since 1896 and those imposed upon iron ore by the Act in question, it is to be remembered that the taxes imposed by these earlier Taxation Acts were upon the assessed value of the ore removed in the taxation year, while the annual taxation imposed under the Mineral Property Taxation Act is upon the assessed value of all of the minerals on the property, a very different matter.\nWhile there are very extensive mining activities carried on in British Columbia, it is significant that in administering the Act the order in council has been restricted to iron ore alone. Gold, silver, lead, zinc, copper and various other precious and base metals are mined, but none of these minerals in place have been subjected to any taxation under the Act in question. The very high rate of the tax authorized, which would in ten years' time impose in the aggregate an amount of tax equal to the assessed value of the minerals, indicates, in my opinion, that the true nature and purpose of the legislation is something other than the raising of revenue for provincial purposes under head 2 of s. 92. Section 8 of the Act expressly provides that the taxation imposed under it shall be in addition to any other tax imposed on land by any other Act, but the iron mines alone bear this heavy additional burden.\nIt appears to me to be clear that the section which imposed the tax of 37 1\/2 cts. per ton on iron ore removed from the premises of a mine in 1922, but exempted such ore as was mined and used in the province as a flux in the smelting of ores and other metals, was passed with the same end in view as was s. 58 of the Forest Act which was found to be ultra vires in the McDonald Murphy Lumber Company case. Both were designed to encourage manufacturing activities in British Columbia by imposing what was found to be in the case concerning s. 58 a tax on export. That this was the true nature and purpose of the tax imposed by the amendment of 1922 appears to have been recognized by the provincial taxation authorities, as no attempt was ever made to enforce it.\nIn my opinion, the impugned legislation which repealed s. 44 of the Taxation Act seeks to accomplish the same purpose indirectly by the imposition of such a high rate of taxation upon iron ore in place as to, under the conditions prevailing in 1958, either impede or render impossible from a business standpoint the export of the ore or concentrates produced from the only iron mines in the province. Upon the evidence it would appear that the properties cannot be operated profitably if taxation at the rate either authorized or levied in respect of the year 1958 be imposed, unless a smelter be established at the West coast and the appellant thus enabled to recover the tax and a very substantial bounty in addition. If there were such a smelter, the appellant would apparently qualify for the maximum bounty of $5 per ton if it paid the tax under the Mineral Property Taxation Act.\nIt is not without significance that the Iron Bounty Act of 1927, passed contemporaneously with the Mineral Property Taxation Act, increased the maximum bounty which might have been paid under c. 32 of R.S.B.C. 1948 from $3 to $5 per ton. To those engaged in iron mining which had been singled out from other mining activities and subjected to a tax at this extraordinary rate it was thus pointed out the means by which they could recoup themselves.\nSince the Judicial Committee based their finding that s. 58 of the Forest Act was ultra vires on the ground that the real nature of the tax was an export tax and the further ground that, as such, it was indirect, it was apparently regarded as unnecessary to deal with the question as to whether it was also invalid as infringing upon the exclusive power of Parliament to legislate in relation to the regulation of trade and commerce. For the same reason, it is not necessary for the determination of this appeal to deal with that issue.\nI would allow this appeal and direct that judgment be entered declaring that the Mineral Property Taxation Act, being c. 60 of the Statutes of British Columbia for 1957, is ultra vires the legislature of that province.

PROVINCE OF QUEBEC.\nSurety\u2014Bond or guarantee policy\u2014Sale of stolen car by licensed dealer\u2014Bond issued to associates doing business under a firm name\u2014Dissolution of partnership\u2014Business continued under same name by one. of the partners\u2014Claim by owner of amount paid to recover possession of car from third party\u2014Whether guarantor liable\u2014The Motor Vehicles Act, R.S.Q. 1941, c. 142, s. 21.\nCertain automobiles were sold by their purchasers to H.P. Automobile Co., a licensed dealer, in defiance of the fact that they were still the property of the plaintiff. H.P. Automobile Co. resold them to third parties, thereby dealing in stolen property. The plaintiff, in order to recover its property, had to indemnify the third parties, and subsequently sued the defendant as guarantor under a bond or guarantee policy covering H.P. Automobile Co. under s. 21 of the Motor Vehicles Act.\nOriginally, H.P. Automobile Co. was owned by two partners doing business under that name. Together they had applied for and received from the defendant a bond or guarantee policy under s. 21. The partnership was subsequently dissolved, but one of the partners continued alone under the firm name, and it was he who had acquired and resold the plaintiff's automobiles.\nThe trial judge allowed the action, but this judgment was reversed by a majority in the Court of Appeal. The defendant argued in this Court that, following the dissolution of the partnership, both the licence and the guarantee policy had become obsolete with the consequence that neither the policy nor s. 21 of the Act could be invoked by the plaintiff.\nHeld: The appeal should be allowed and the action maintained.\nPer Curiam: By the terms of the guarantee policy furnished to the provincial Treasurer, the defendant and the two partners bound themselves and their successors, and stipulated that this obligation would remain until the licence was terminated. Although the defendant had reserved to itself the right to cancel its undertaking by given written notice to the provincial Controller of Revenue, not only had it not done so, but it had renewed it for another year. The defendant was, therefore, bound vis-\u00e0-vis the provincial Treasurer for the duration of a definite period, and could not, in the circumstances of this case, disengage itself of that obligation by invoking a contingency which s. 21 and the terms of the guarantee policy do not recognize as having that effect. To hold otherwise would render the provisions of s. 21 illusory and would produce results irreconcilable with the true object of the special provision making an exception to the common law in matters concerning motor vehicles.\nPer Martland J.: There is nothing in the Act which would suggest that a licence issued to two or more persons carrying on a business should cease to have effect merely on the death or withdrawal from business of one of them. In this case, the cancellation might have been justified, but it was not, in fact, made. Since the defendant must have intended to give a bond which would comply with s. 21, that bond remained effective so long as one of the partners, by virtue of the existence of the dealer's licence, continued to be enabled to act as a dealer.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench, Appeal Side, Province of Quebec1, reversing a judgment of Salvas J.

Sur la raison d'\u00eatre et l'objet de l'art. 21, le savant Juge ajoute:\nThe subject of purchase, sale and other dealings, in motor vehicles has been accorded a special code and the reasons behind that action, taken in the interest of public order, are not far to seek. The legislature was bringing under control a business of huge dimensions involving property of high value but exposed in a special manner to all sorts of fraudulent trafficking.\nPour assurer ce contr\u00f4le, la L\u00e9gislature a assujetti le droit de faire le commerce des v\u00e9hicules automobiles \u00e0 l'obtention d'un permis. Ce permis de commer\u00e7ant, comme d'ailleurs les autres permis pr\u00e9vus par la m\u00eame loi, vaut au maximum pour un an et expire le dernier jour de f\u00e9vrier suivant imm\u00e9diatement la date de son \u00e9mission, sujet au droit du Ministre de l'annuler, en suspendre les effets et en exiger la remise au d\u00e9partement. Pour l'obtenir, le commer\u00e7ant doit d\u00e9poser entre les mains du Tr\u00e9sorier provincial un cautionnement souscrit \u00e0 l'endroit de ce dernier et garantissant au propri\u00e9taire d'un v\u00e9hicule automobile vol\u00e9, vendu par un commer\u00e7ant licenci\u00e9, le remboursement du prix que ce propri\u00e9taire a pay\u00e9 \u00e0 tout acheteur de ce v\u00e9hicule pour en recouvrer la possession sur revendication comme chose vol\u00e9e. La dur\u00e9e de ce cautionnement correspond \u00e0 la dur\u00e9e de la licence et il ne peut y \u00eatre mis fin avant la date d'expiration de la licence ou celle de son annulation ou suspension par le Ministre. Ce cautionnement demeure en la possession du Tr\u00e9sorier provincial que la loi constitue en quelque sorte fiduciaire du public acheteur.\nLe public, d'autre part, est incit\u00e9 \u00e0 n'acheter que d'un commer\u00e7ant licenci\u00e9; et c'est la sanction de la disposition que l'acheteur qui fait affaires avec un commer\u00e7ant non licenci\u00e9 perd les droits accord\u00e9s sous le droit commun \u00e0 celui qui ach\u00e8te une chose vol\u00e9e d'un \"commer\u00e7ant trafiquant en semblables mati\u00e8res.\" En somme, et comme il a \u00e9t\u00e9 not\u00e9 par cette Cour dans Home Fire and Marine Insurance Company v. Baptist4 et Industrial Acceptance Corporation v. Couture, supra, la L\u00e9gislature a, par les dispositions de l'art. 21, ajout\u00e9, d'une part, au droit commun en accordant une protection additionnelle au propri\u00e9taire d\u00e9poss\u00e9d\u00e9 par le vol et soustrait, d'autre part, au droit commun en enlevant \u00e0 celui qui ach\u00e8te, d'un commer\u00e7ant non licenci\u00e9, une chose vol\u00e9e, le droit d'exiger du propri\u00e9taire la revendiquant comme vol\u00e9e, le remboursement du prix qu'il a pay\u00e9.\nL'article 21 prescrit enfin que la licence du commer\u00e7ant doit \u00eatre affich\u00e9e en \u00e9vidence dans son \u00e9tablissement et que, dans tout contrat de vente, r\u00e9f\u00e9rence soit faite au num\u00e9ro et \u00e0 la date d'expiration de cette licence. Cette publicit\u00e9 de la licence manifeste, pour le public, la l\u00e9gitimit\u00e9 de l'\u00e9tablissement; et ces r\u00e9f\u00e9rences au contrat donnent \u00e0 l'acheteur de bonne foi l'assurance de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 de ses droits.\nAux termes de l'obligation souscrite \u00e0 l'endroit du Tr\u00e9sorier provincial, l'intim\u00e9e et les deux associ\u00e9s de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Hilaire Paquette Automobile Cie se sont, comme d\u00e9j\u00e0 indiqu\u00e9, engag\u00e9s conjointement et solidairement et ont, de la m\u00eame fa\u00e7on, engag\u00e9 leurs successeurs respectifs. Ils ont stipul\u00e9 que cette obligation demeurait tenante jusqu'\u00e0 l'expiration ou l'annulation ou suspension de la licence. Il est vrai que l'intim\u00e9e s'\u00e9tait r\u00e9serv\u00e9 le droit d'annuler son engagement en donnant un avis \u00e9crit de soixante jours au Contr\u00f4leur du revenu provincial \u00e0 Qu\u00e9bec. Il suffit de dire que non seulement l'intim\u00e9e n'a jamais annul\u00e9 cette obligation, mais qu'elle l'a renouvel\u00e9e, lors de son expiration, pour une autre ann\u00e9e. L'intim\u00e9e s'est ainsi engag\u00e9e vis-\u00e0-vis le Tr\u00e9sorier provincial pour toute la dur\u00e9e d'un temps bien d\u00e9fini et, dans les circonstances de cette cause, ne peut se d\u00e9gager de son obligation en invoquant, comme moyen d'extinction de cette obligation, une contingence que les dispositions de l'art. 21 et les termes du cautionnement souscrit ne reconnaissent pas comme ayant cet effet. Il est bien \u00e9vident que l'acceptation des pr\u00e9tentions de l'intim\u00e9e rendrait illusoire cet article sp\u00e9cial de la loi relativement au commerce des v\u00e9hicules automobiles, et emp\u00eacherait l'accomplissement de son objet et l'ex\u00e9cution de ses prescriptions suivant leurs v\u00e9ritables sens, esprit et fin. Retenir ces pr\u00e9tentions aurait pour r\u00e9sultat d'assujettir la valeur du cautionnement d\u00e9pos\u00e9 entre les mains du Tr\u00e9sorier provincial \u00e0 des contingences qu'il serait au pouvoir de celui qui est tenu de le fournir de faire na\u00eetre \u00e0 sa guise. Et pour satisfaire ad\u00e9quatement \u00e0 l'obligation implicite qu'il a comme fiduciaire, le Ministre serait dans la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 de v\u00e9rifier constamment et quotidiennement au bureau d'enregistrement des raisons sociales de tous les districts judiciaires de la province s'il y a eu des modifications aux enregistrements des raisons sociales au nom desquelles les permis de commer\u00e7ants ont \u00e9t\u00e9 octroy\u00e9s. Dans une telle vue de la loi, la fin pour laquelle ce cautionnement est requis ne pourrait \u00eatre atteinte et l'acheteur de bonne foi perdrait, sans raison valide, les droits qu'il avait sous le droit commun.\nPartageant les vues exprim\u00e9es par M. le Juge Salvas, de la Cour sup\u00e9rieure, et par M. le Juge Martineau, dissident en Cour d'Appel, je maintiendrais l'appel avec d\u00e9pens tant en Cour d'Appel qu'en cette Cour, et r\u00e9tablirais le jugement de premi\u00e8re instance.\nAu cours de l'audition, les procureurs ont inform\u00e9 cette Cour que la question ici consid\u00e9r\u00e9e se pr\u00e9sente dans trois autres appels inscrits \u00e0 cette Cour. La pr\u00e9sente et ces trois autres causes portent les num\u00e9ros 6311, 6312, 6313 et 6314 des dossiers de la Cour d'Appel de Qu\u00e9bec. Les procureurs ont d\u00e9clar\u00e9 accepter que la d\u00e9cision rendue dans la pr\u00e9sente instance s'appliquerait dans ces trois autres causes.\nMartland J.:\u2014I agree with the reasons of my brother Fauteux and with his proposed disposition of this appeal. I merely wish to add the following comments:\nOn March 16, 1954, there was issued to Hilaire Paquette and to Marcel De Blois, who were together carrying on business under the firm name of Hilaire Paquette Automobile Co., a dealer's licence pursuant to s. 21 of the Motor Vehicles Act, which was their authority to deal in motor vehicles in the Province of Quebec. On June 5, 1954, De Blois withdrew from the business. Thereafter the business continued to be carried on, under the same firm name, by Hilaire Paquette. The licence was never cancelled.\nThe respondent contended that the licence was automatically terminated upon the dissolution of the partnership between Paquette and De Blois. There is, however, nothing in the Act which would suggest that, where a dealer's licence has been issued to two or more persons carrying on a business together, the licence shall automatically cease to have effect in the event of the death or withdrawal from business of one of them, if the others continue to carry on the business thereafter. I agree with Martineau J. that, while the dissolution of the partnership in this case might have justified the cancellation of the licence by the Minister, it was not, in fact, cancelled. In the absence of such cancellation, in my view the licence remained effective to enable the existing business, of which Paquette was named in the licence as an owner, to be continued by him until the licence expired on February 28, 1955, pursuant to s. 23 of the Act.\nThe respondent contends that the bond which it had issued was discharged when the partnership between Paquette and De Blois was dissolved. While generally a surety for the conduct of a partnership will be discharged from liability if the firm is changed, that is not always the case. The question is as to the intention with which the bond was given, by the surety. This intention, in respect of the present type of bond, must be ascertained having in mind the provisions of s. 21 of the Motor Vehicles Act, pursuant to which it was issued as a prerequisite to the granting of the dealer's licence.\nThe provisions of that section, inter alia, provide:\nNo surety may terminate the security before the last day of February following the date of the issue of the guarantee policy; and the licence shall cease to be in force from the moment that the security ceased to exist.\nThe purpose of the bond, which was given in favour of The Honorable the Treasurer of the Province of Quebec, was to guarantee to the owner of a stolen motor vehicle, sold by a licensed dealer, reimbursement of the price which such owner has paid to the buyer of the stolen motor vehicle in order to recover possession of it. The respondent must have intended to give a bond which would comply with s. 21, which would enable a dealer's licence to be issued to the applicants for the bond and which would provide the required guarantee during such time as dealings in motor vehicles occurred pursuant to the authority of the licence which was issued. This being so, in my opinion, not with-standing the dissolution of the partnership between Pa- quette and De Blois, the bond remained effective so long as Paquette, by virtue of the existence of the dealer's licence, continued to be enabled to act as a dealer in motor vehicles.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nAttorneys for the plaintiff, appellant: Desjardins, Ducharme & Choquette, Montreal.\nAttorneys for the defendant, respondent: L\u00e9tourneau, Quinlan, Forest, Desch\u00eanes & Emery, Montreal.\n1 [1960] Que.

Imperial Oil Co., [1960] S.C.R. 735\nDate: 1960-10-04\nThe Minister of National Revenue Appellant;\nand\nImperial Oil Limited Respondent.\n1960: March 25, 28, 29; 1960: October 4.\nPresent: Kerwin, C.J., Taschereau, Locke, Cartwright, Martland, Judson and Ritchie JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE EXCHEQUER COURT OF CANADA.\nTaxation\u2014Income tax\u2014Determination of base on which depletion allowance calculated\u2014Whether profits should be treated on an individual well basis\u2014Whether losses of loss producing wells must be deducted from profits of profitable producing wells\u2014Whether unrelated drilling, exploration and other costs deductible\u2014Whether deduction of \"unrealized profits\" should be allowed\u2014Income Tax Act, 1948 (Can.), c. 52, s. 11 (1) (b)\u2014Income Tax Regulations, s. 1201 as amended by Order in Council 4443, August 29, 1951\u2014Income Tax Amendment Act, 1949 2nd Sess. (Can.), c. 25, s. 53 (1).\nIn computing its income for 1951, the respondent oil company claimed that the depletion allowance to which it was entitled under s. 11(1) (b) of the Income Tax Act and s. 1201 of the Income Tax Regulations was $13,023,666.59. The company contended that, under the decision of this Court in Home Oil Ltd. v. Minister of National Revenue, [1955] S.C.R. 733, for the purpose of computing the profits to establish the base on which the allowance is to be calculated, the profits from each of its wells should be treated individually.\nThe Minister set the allowance at $790,067.36, and arrived at the base on which this amount was calculated by deducting from the profits of profitable wells (1) losses of loss wells, (2) unrelated drilling, exploration and other costs, and (3) unrealized profits in supply, manufacturing and marketing inventories.\nThe Exchequer Court allowed a deduction only for losses of loss wells. The Minister, in appealing this decision, sought to have his assessment confirmed in full, and the respondent cross-appealed, claiming that a deduction of losses on loss wells should not have been allowed. Held (Cartwright, Martland and Ritchie JJ. dissenting in part): The appeal should be allowed, and the cross-appeal should be dismissed. The Minister's notice of re-assessment should be affirmed.\nPer Kerwin C.J. and Taschereau, Locke and Judson JJ.: Subsections 1 and 4 of s. 1201 of the Regulations, when read together, make it plain that the losses of the company's loss producing wells must be deducted from the profits of its profitable producing wells in computing the allowance to which it is entitled. Subsection 4, which defines what are the profits referred to in subs. 1 in cases where the taxpayer operates more than one well, is within the authority of s. 11(1) (b) of the Act.\nRegulation 1201, as redrafted in 1951, legislated away not only the well by well basis for the determination of profits, but also the limitation on the application of the old subs. 4, now subs. 5, to the deduction of items, referred to in s. 53 of the Act, in relation only to the profitable wells. Section 53 items, required to be deducted from reasonably attributable profits, are not now required to be related to the profitable wells mentioned in subs. 1. If they have been deducted in computing the taxpayer's taxable income, they must be deducted in computing the allowance, whether related or unrelated to the aforementioned wells. Home Oil Ltd. v. Minister of National Revenue, [1955] S.C.R. 733, distinguished.\nThe respondent's argument that s. 11(3) of the Act supported its submission that Regulation 1201 still required the application of the Home Oil judgment on unrelated costs was rejected.\nAs the producing department of the company was not, in fact, a separate entity for tax purposes, the respondent was not entitled to so consider it, nor to include the \"unrealized profit\" in supply, manufacturing and marketing inventories as part of the \"profits\" of that department.\nPer Cartwright and Ritchie JJ., dissenting in part: The aggregate of the profits from all wells operated by the taxpayer cannot be determined for the purpose of subs. 4 until the profits of each have been computed, and as \u00a1subs. 5 requires a deduction to be made in computing these profits, it follows that s. 53 costs, specified in subs. 5, must be deducted in respect of each well.\nIt would make the provisions of subs. 4 quite purposeless if all the s. 53 costs were required to be deducted in computing the profits of each of a number of wells, and as subs. 5 requires the deduction to be made both \"in computing the profits \u2026\" and \"for the purpose of this section\" it can only be complied with by deducting, in computing the profits of each well, such of the s. 53 costs as can be related thereto.\nPer Martland J., dissenting in part: The computation of profits for the purpose of s. 1201 has to be made on an individual well basis. Subsection 5 requires that in computing the profits attributable to the production of oil or gas from operating wells, account must be taken of any amounts expended for exploration and drilling in relation to such wells, which have been included in the aggregate of costs deducted by the taxpayer in computing income under the authority of s. 53. APPEAL from a judgment of Thorson P., of the Exchequer Court of Canada1, allowing the respondent's appeal from its 1951 income tax assessment. Appeal allowed in toto and cross-appeal dismissed, Cartwright, Martland and Ritchie JJ. dissenting in part.\nC. F. H. Carson, Q.C., T. Sheard, Q.C., A. Findlay, Q.C., T. Z. Boles and G. W. Ainslie, for the appellant.\nA. S. Pattillo, Q.C., A. J. Macintosh, J. G. MacDonell, for the respondent.\nThe Chief Justice:\u2014This appeal by the Minister of National Revenue and cross-appeal by Imperial Oil Limited from the judgment of the Exchequer Court2 raise a question as to the proper deductions to be made by the company in computing its income for the 1951 taxation year under no. 1201 of the Regulations passed pursuant to s. 11(1) (b) of the Income Tax Act, 1948 (Can.), c. 52, as amended.\nBecause of the nature of some of the arguments advanced on behalf of the parties, it might be recalled that s. 3 of the Act provides that the income of a \"taxpayer\" for a taxation year is his income for the year from all sources. Section 12(1) enacts that in computing income no deductions shall be made in respect of (b):\n(b) an outlay, loss or replacement of capital, a payment on account of capital or an allowance in respect of depreciation, obsolescence or depletion except as expressly permitted by this Part\nSection 11(1) (b), as enacted by c. 25 of the Statutes of 1949, provides:\n11. (1) Notwithstanding paragraphs (a), (b) and (h) of subsection (1) of section 12, the following amounts may be deducted in computing the income of a taxpayer for a taxation year\n* * *\n(b) such amount as an allowance in respect of an oil or gas well, mine or timber limit, if any, as is allowed to the taxpayer by regulation\nSubsection (3) of s. 11, as enacted by s. 4 of c. 25 of the Statutes of 1949, provides:\n11. (3) Where a deduction is allowed under paragraph (b) of subsection (1) in respect of an oil or gas well, mine or timber limit operated by a lessee, the lessor and lessee may agree as to what portion of the allowance each may deduct and, in the event that they cannot agree, the Minister may fix the portions. The power to make the relevant regulations is conferred by s. 106(1)(a) of the Act:\n106. (1) The Governor in Council may make regulations (a) prescribing anything that, by this Act, is to be prescribed or is to be determined or regulated by regulation\nSection 1200 of the Regulations, which is in Part XII, headed \"Deduction in Respect of Oil Wells, Gas Wells and Certain Mines\", reads:\n1200. For the purposes of paragraph (b) of subsection (1) of section 11 of the Act there may be deducted in computing the income of a taxpayer for a taxation year amounts determined as hereinafter set forth in this Part.\nThis section of the Regulations is the same for the taxation year 1951 as for the years 1949-50. Some of the problems now arising were considered by this Court in Home Oil Limited v. Minister of National Revenue3 with reference to the taxation years 1949-50, but, as s. 1201 of the Regulations, which was there under discussion, is different from the section as it is to be applied to the 1951 taxation year, the two versions should be considered together and they appear conveniently opposite each other in the reasons of Mr. Justice Judson.\nI agree with his conclusions and reasons and merely add these remarks to emphasize\n(a) The new Regulation 1201 has the effect of making the decision of this Court in the Home Oil case inapplicable;\n(b) In view of s. 3 of the Act, referred to above, and generally because a company cannot sell to itself, the practice of Imperial Oil Limited, even if warranted by sound accounting principles, cannot prevail against the rule;\n(c) In connection with the item of $19,992,588.33 \"Unrelated drilling, exploration and other costs\", while one witness for the company was not certain, I am satisfied that under s. 53 of the Act the company deducted this item in computing its taxable income.\nI have considered the decision of the House of Lords in Sharkey v. Wernher4, relied upon by counsel for the company, but I am unable to see that it is of any assistance in the present matter. While the reasons of the learned President indicated that he disallowed the appeal of the company as to losses of loss wells, the formal order merely states \"that the said appeal be and the same is hereby allowed.\" The judgment of the Exchequer Court should be set aside, the appeal of the Minister allowed, the cross-appeal of the company dismissed and the Minister's notice of re-assessment affirmed. The Minister is entitled to his costs in the Exchequer Court and in this Court.\nThe judgment of Taschereau, Locke and Judson JJ. was delivered by\nJudson J.:\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Exchequer Court5 which allowed the appeal of the respondent company from its 1951 income tax assessment with costs. The company claimed that it was entitled under Regulation 1201 of the Regulations passed pursuant to s. 11(1) (b) of the Income Tax Act to an allowance of 113,023,666.59 for the year 1951. The Minister, in a notice of re-assessment, allowed only $790,067.36, and the company appealed. The same issues are also involved in appeals from the assessments for the 1952 and 1953 taxation years but, by agreement, the trial in the Exchequer Court was limited to the appeal for the year 1951. The company's contention is that for the purpose of computing its profits to establish the base on which the allowance under s. 11(1) (b) is to be calculated, the profits from each well should be treated individually. On two out of three issues in this appeal, the company's submissions are the same as those of the appellant company in Home Oil Limited v. Minister of National Revenue6.\nIn that case, however, the Court had to consider Regulation 1201 as it applied to the taxation years 1949 and 1950, but by Order-in-Council P.C. 4443, dated August 29, 1951, Regulation 1201 in force in 1949 and 1950 was revoked and a new Regulation 1201 in the precise form set out below was substituted for it and made applicable to the 1951 taxation year. Consequently, the main problem is to determine to what extent the decision in the Home Oil case is affected by the change in the regulation. I set out now s. 11(1) (b) of the Act and the old and new Regulation 1201, the old one applicable to the taxation years 1949 and 1950 and the new one to the year 1951:\n11. (1) Notwithstanding paragraphs (a), (b) and (h) of subsection (1) of section 12, the following amounts may be deducted in computing the income of a taxpayer for a taxation year\n(b) such amount as an allowance in respect of an oil or gas well, mine or timber limit, if any, as is allowed to the taxpayer by regulation.\nFor 1949 and 1950\nFor 1951\n1201. (1) Where the taxpayer operates an oil or gas well or where the taxpayer is a person described as the trustee in subsection (1) of section 73 of the Act, the deduction allowed for a taxation year is 33\u2153 per cent of the profits of the taxpayer for the year reasonably attributable to the production of oil or gas from the well.\n1201. (1) Where the taxpayer operates an oil or gas well the deduction allowed for a taxation year is 33\u2153 per cent of the profits of the taxpayer for the year reasonably attributable to the production of oil or gas from the well.\n(2) Where a person, other than the operator of an oil or gas well and the person described as the trustee in section 73 of the Act, has an interest in the proceeds from the sale of the products of the well or an interest in income from the operation of the well, the deduction allowed for a taxation year is 25 per cent of the amount in respect of such interest included in computing his income for the year.\n(2) Where a person, other than the operator has an interest in the proceeds from the sale of the products of an oil or gas well or an interest in income from the operation of the well, the deduction allowed for a taxation year is 25 per cent of the amount in respect of such interest included in computing his income for the year.\nFor 1949 and 1950\nFor 1951\n(3) Where an amount received in respect of an interest in the income from the operation of a well is a dividend or is deemed by section 73 of the Act to be a dividend, no deduction shall be allowed under subsection (2) of this section.\n(3) Where an amount received in respect of an interest in the income from the operation of a well is a dividend or is deemed by the Act to be a dividend, no deduction shall be allowed under this section.\n(4) Where the taxpayer operates more than one oil or gas well, the profits referred to in subsection one shall be the aggregate of the profits minus the aggregate of the losses of the taxpayer for the year reasonably attributable to the production of oil or gas from all wells operated by the taxpayer. For 1949 and 1950\nFor 1951\n(4) In computing the profits reasonably attributable to the production of oil or gas for the purpose of this section a deduction shall be made equal to the amounts, if any, deducted from income under the provisions of section 53 of chapter 25 of the Statutes of 1949, Second Session, in respect of the well.\n(5) In computing the profits reasonably attributable to the production of oil or gas for the purpose of this section a deduction shall be made equal to the amounts, if any, deducted in computing the taxpayer's income for the taxation year under the provisions of section 53 of Chapter 25 of the Statutes of 1949, Second Session.\nThere are two differences between the old and the new regulation of importance in this appeal: First, subs. (4) is entirely new; second, subs. (5) of the new regulation is subs. (4) of the old with the words \"in respect of the well\" omitted at the end of the paragraph.\nSubsection (4) of the old and subs. (5) of the new regulation both refer to a deduction under s. 53 of c. 25, Statutes of 1949, Second Session. Section 53, so far as relevant, is as follows:\n53.

It did make a deduction in arriving at this figure for drilling, exploration and other costs related to the particular wells but, as may be expected, these costs were of minor significance for these producing wells in the taxation year 1951.\nAs is apparent from the table set out above, the Minister made three further deductions from the figure of $39,070,-999.79:\n(1) He deducted losses from loss wells, claiming that Regulation 1201(4) required this. The profits were not to be calculated having regard only to the profitable wells. On this point, and on this point alone, the judgment of the Exchequer Court sustains the Minister's assessment.\n(2) The Minister deducted, in addition to the related drilling, exploration and other costs, unrelated costs of this character, claiming that this was required by Regulation 1201(5). The judgment of the Exchequer Court rejected this deduction on the ground that these expenditures were not reasonably attributable to the production of oil or gas in 1951 from any of the company's producing wells.\n(3) The Minister deducted $8,642,196.84 because this amount represented unrealized profits of the company which had been regarded by the company as actual profits for the purpose of making the calculation of profits under Regulation 1201. This figure relates only to oil delivered by the producing department of the company to other departments and still unsold by the company at the end of the year 1951. The company included this amount in its calculation for corporate purposes of the \"profits\" of the producing department, but did not include this amount in its calculation of the company's profits or of the company's taxable income. The judgment of the Exchequer Court rejects the Minister's deduction and allows this purely notional computation of profits for the purpose of the allowance under Regulation 1201.\nThe Minister, in this appeal, seeks to have his assessment confirmed in full. The company cross-appeals, claiming that a deduction should not have been allowed in the Exchequer Court of the losses on loss wells. These are the three issues before this Court. I would allow the appeal and confirm the assessment in full and dismiss the cross-appeal.\nI will deal with the deductions made by the Minister under Regulation 1201 in the same order as they appear in the statement: (a) losses of loss wells; (b) unrelated drilling, exploration and other costs; (c) the unrealized inventory profit. The first two deductions were also considered in the Home Oil case. The third is new. (a) Losses of Loss Wells, $8,066,012.55.\nThe question now is whether the company, notwithstanding the addition of subs. (4) to Regulation 1201, is still entitled to have its allowance computed on the basis solely of the profits from its profitable producing wells without deduction of its losses of its loss producing wells. This question was decided in the company's favour in the Home Oil case, in the absence of anything in the regulation corresponding to subs. (4). The judgment under appeal holds that this deduction must now be made. With this decision I agree. When subss. (1) and (4) are read together, words could not be plainer. However, the company still contends that the Home Oil judgment and the statute limit the scope of any regulation that may be made and compel the making of the allowance, if one is to be made, on the basis of the individual well. Consequently, it is argued, subs. (4) of the 1951 regulation, in purporting to require the deduction of the aggregate of losses reasonably attributable to the production of oil or gas from all wells operated by the taxpayer from the profits referred to in subs. (1), is not authorized by the Statute and is ineffective. This argument was rejected in the following passage of the reasons for judgment of the learned President7.\nThe power to enact a regulation determining the amount of the deductible allowance permitted by Section 11(1) (b) of the Act and the base for its computation was granted in the broadest terms and I cannot see any limitation of it such as counsel suggests. The section of the Act does not specify what the base for the computation of the allowance should be or its amount. Thus, it was permissible to fix the profits reasonably attributable to the production of oil or gas as the base for the computation of the allowance and 33\u2153 per cent of such base as its amount, as subsection (1) did. But it was also permissible to define such profits for application in cases where a taxpayer operated more than one well and some of the wells were loss producing, even if such definition altered the base fixed by subsection. (1), as subsection (4) did. It contains a statutory definition of the profits referred to in subsection (1) for use in the cases stated in it. I see no objection to such a definition for use in the circumstances specified. In my opinion, subsection (4) is within the authority of Section 11 (1) (b) of the Act. That being so, it is unnecessary to consider the question of its severability.\nI agree with this in full and have nothing to add. It completely disposes of the cross-appeal, which fails and must be dismissed with costs.\n(b) Unrelated drilling, exploration and other costs, $19,992,588.88.\nThese costs, in this amount, were not related to the production of oil or gas from any of the company's wells during the year 1951. The Home Oil case, on the old wording of the regulation, had decided that these costs were not to be deducted from the \"reasonably attributable\" profits under subs. (1). The basis of the decision in the Home Oil case is that unless s. 53 items are related to a profit producing well, they are not to be taken into account in determining the allowance under the regulation because wells are to be dealt with on an individual basis. Subsection (1) required a well by well treatment and the old subs. (4) required only the deduction of s. 53 items \"in respect of the well\". Therefore, unrelated s. 53 items disappeared from the computation. The judgment under appeal holds that this is still the law and that this is so notwithstanding the new subs. (4) and the deletion of the words \"in respect of the well\". In my respectful opinion, there is error in this conclusion, for I think that Regulation 1201 now requires the following procedure in determining the base for the allowance to be granted to a taxpayer who operates more than one oil or gas well:\n(1) Determine the profits or losses of each producing well in the normal manner by ascertaining the difference between the receipts reasonably attributable to the production of oil or gas from the well and the expenses of earning those receipts. At this point no s. 53 items are deductible for these are of a capital nature.\n(2) Determine the aggregate of the profits of the profitable wells and the aggregate of the losses of the loss wells and deduct the aggregate of the latter from the aggregate of the former.\n(3) Deduct from the amount of profits remaining, the exploration and drilling costs deducted under s. 53 in computing the taxpayer's income.\nThe judgment under appeal took the first and second steps but not the third. In spite of the scope of subs. (5), widened, in my opinion, by the deletion of the words \"in respect of the well\", and the addition of the new subs. (4), the Exchequer Court held, as did this Court in the Home Oil case, that s. 53 items were to be applied on a well by well basis and only in so far as they related to the profitable wells dealt with in subs. (1). To me, this is reading into the new regulation a limitation which I cannot find. To arrive at this result the assessor must first assume that subss. (1) and (5) are to be read together to the exclusion of subs. (4). If this is done, the problem is indeed one of well by well. But this is not an adequate statement of the problem because it ignores the presence of the new subs. (4). Where the taxpayer operates more than one well, the profits referred to in subs. (1) (i.e. the reasonably attributable profits) are to be computed in a new way\u2014the aggregate of profits from the profitable wells minus the aggregate of the losses from the loss wells. Then subs. (5) comes into play.\nIt is this computation, made under the combined operation of subss. (1) and (4), which gives the profits reasonably attributable to the production of oil or gas for the purpose of subs. (5). Subsection (5) says, in computing the \"reasonably attributable profits for the purpose of this section\", not for the purpose of subs. (1) of this section. For the purpose of this section has already required the application of subss. (1) and (4) before we get to subs. (5). The reasonably attributable profits mentioned in subs. (5) are not on a well by well basis, taking only profitable wells, but on the composite basis as required by subs. (4). Then all s. 53 items must be deducted\u2014not, as formerly, only those \"in respect of the well\".\nTherefore, what the new 1951 regulation did was to legislate away not only the well by well basis for the determination of profits, as the learned President has already found, but also the limitation on the application of the old subs. (4), now subs. (5), to the deduction of s. 53 items in relation only to the profitable wells. The error in the judgment under appeal may be stated also in a slightly different way. Under the new formula supplied by the new regulation, the s. 53 items are not required to be reasonably attributable to the production of oil or gas from the wells mentioned in subs. (1). It is only the profits which have to be \"reasonably attributable\" and these \"reasonably attributable\" profits are to be computed in a defined way and from them a defined deduction must be made. It is, therefore, in my opinion, fundamental error in the judgment under appeal to arrive at \"reasonably attributable\" profits for the purpose of applying subs. (5) by considering only subss. (1) and (5) to the exclusion of subs. (4).\nSection 53 items, required to be deducted from reasonably attributable profits, newly defined, are not now required to be related items. If they have been deducted in computing the taxpayer's taxable income\u2014and there is no compulsion to do this\u2014then they must be deducted in computing the allowance under Regulation 1201, whether related or unrelated to profitable wells mentioned in subs. (1).\nThat, I think, is all that is meant when subs. (5) speaks of \"the amounts, if any\" deducted under s. 53 of the Act. It simply means that whatever amounts the taxpayer deducts for determining taxable income must be deducted under Regulation 1201. The presence of these words in subs. (5), far from reinforcing the company's submission on the construction of the new regulation, seems to me to be entirely consistent with the Minister's submission and to support the assessment. A taxpayer who deducts these s. 53 items in one place for the purpose of determining taxable income, must do so in another for the purpose of determining the allowance under Regulation 1201.\nThe company also appeals to s. 11(3) of the Act in support of its submission that Regulation 1201 still requires the application of the Home Oil judgment on unrelated costs. This point was not dealt with in the reasons delivered in the Exchequer Court. Section 11(3) provides:\n(3) Where a deduction is allowed under paragraph (b) of subsection (1) in respect of an oil or gas well, mine or timber limit operated by a lessee, the lessor and lessee may agree as to what portion of the allowance each may deduct and, in the event that they cannot agree, the Minister may fix the portions.\nThe argument is that the subsection authorizes only one allowance, which must be divided between lessor and lessee. Regulation 1201, in fact, grants what appear to be separate allowances to the lessor and lessee and there is no occasion, therefore, for the allowance to be divided under s. 11(3) of the Act. If the regulation made under s. 11(1) (b) had granted an allowance to a lessee in such terms that the drilling and exploration costs incurred by the lessee on other lands in which the lessor had no interest were permitted to reduce the allowances in respect of the well on the lessor's lands, the regulation would have operated unfairly.\nAs the regulation stands, if the operator of a well is a lessee, he is granted an allowance under subss. (1), (4) and (5). The lessor of the land on which the well is operated is granted a quite different allowance under subs. (2). Under the latter subsection the lessor is entitled to an allowance equal to 25 per cent of the amount in respect of his interest in the proceeds from the sale of the products of the well on his land included in computing his income for the year.\nIn my opinion, the separate allowances given by Regulation 1201, first, to the operator, and then to a person other than the operator, are authorized by the wide scope of s. 11 (1)(b).\nWith the making of this regulation, the need for the application of s. 11(3) of the Act to oil or gas wells disappears. If, on the other hand, there is no statutory authorization for dealing with the allowance between operator and non-operator, as both the old and the new regulation do, there is no allowance at all given to anybody and that is the end of the litigation.\n(c) Increase in unrealized profit in supply, manufacturing and marketing inventories \u2026 $8,642,196.84\nThis question is new and did not arise in the Home Oil litigation. The Minister claimed that the amount of $8,642,196.84 was not part of the profits of the taxpayer for the year reasonably attributable to the production of oil or gas from all wells of the company operated within the meaning of subs. (4) of Regulation 1201 and that the company was not entitled to include it in determining the base for its allowance. The appellant's submission is that although it may have been convenient for the company for its own corporate purposes to treat the producing department as a separate entity and to include this unrealized profit as part of the profits of the producing department, in fact, the producing department was not a separate entity and for tax purposes the company was not entitled to treat the producing department as a separate entity. The judgment of the Exchequer Court correctly, of course, drew a distinction between the company's taxable income, which was not under consideration in the case, and the profits from the production of oil or gas \"reasonably attributable to the well\". However, on a well by well basis of accounting, which the Exchequer Court adopted as the proper one, the inventory \"had all moved out from the well to some other department as if it had been sold and was no longer in its hands. This was the opinion of the accountancy witnesses based on the assessment made. What happened to the inventory in the hands of other departments and how it affected the computation of the appellant's taxable income as a whole is outside the scope of the present inquiry\". It is apparent that the judgment of the Exchequer Court did treat the producing department as a separate entity for the purpose of Regulation 1201.\nIn my opinion, this was error. It may have been convenient for the company for its own corporate purposes to treat the producing department as a separate entity and to include this \"unrealized profit\" as part of the \"profits\" of the producing department. In fact, the producing department was not a separate entity for tax purposes and, therefore, the company was not entitled to treat the producing department in this way. If it makes any difference, and I do not think that it does, all the accountancy witnesses based their opinion in resisting the claim for deduction on the assumption that the producing department could be treated as a separate entity. No such assumption could be made in law. No company makes an actual profit merely by producing oil. There is no profit until the oil is sold. International Harvester Co. of Canada v. Provincial Tax Commission8. Laycock v. Freeman, Hardy & Willis Ltd.9.\nThe judgment of the Exchequer Court should be set aside, the appeal of the Minister allowed, the cross-appeal of the company dismissed and the Minister's notice of reassessment affirmed. The Minister is entitled to his costs in the Exchequer Court and in this Court.\nThe judgment of Cartwright and Ritchie JJ. was delivered by\nRitchie J. (dissenting in part):\u2014This appeal involves the construction to be placed on s. 1201 of the Income Tax Regulations in its amended form as passed by Order-in-Council P.C. 4443 dated August 29, 1951, but before embarking on any close analysis of the provisions of this section it is important to determine under what authority and for what purpose it was enacted.\nThis Order-in-Council was expressed as being passed \"by virtue of the powers conferred by section 106 of The Income Tax Act\", the relevant part of which reads as follows:\n106. (1) The Governor-in-Council may make regulations\n(a) prescribing anything that, by this Act, is to be prescribed or is to be determined or regulated by regulation,\nBy s. 11(1)(b) of The Income Tax Act, 1948, it is provided:\n11. (1) Notwithstanding paragraphs (a), (b) and (h) of subsection (1) of section 12, the following amounts may be deducted in computing the income of a taxpayer for a taxation year\n* * *\n(b) such amount as an allowance in respect of an oil or gas well, mine or timber limit, if any, as is allowed to the taxpayer by regulation; The Governor-in-Council expressly confined the relevant sections of the Regulations by which it exercised this authority to the requirements of the enabling legislation by enacting s. 1200 which reads:\nFor the purposes of paragraph (b) of subsection (1) of section 11 of the Act there may be deducted in computing the income of a taxpayer for a taxation year amounts to be determined as hereinafter set forth in this Part.\nPursuant to this authority and in furtherance of these purposes, s. 1201 of the Regulations was originally passed by P.C. 6471 of December 22, 1949, and subsequently amended by P.C. 4443 hereinbefore referred to in which latter form it was in force during the taxation period in question. Subsection (1) of s. 1201 reads as follows:\n1201. (1) Where the taxpayer operates an oil or gas well the deduction allowed for a taxation year is 33\u2153 per cent of the profits of the taxpayer for the year reasonably attributable to the production of oil or gas from the well.\nThis subsection, taken alone, is clearly effective to fulfil the purposes of s. 11(1) (b) in the case of a taxpayer who operates a single oil or gas well and it not only establishes once and for all the percentage to be allowed by way of deduction under s. 1201 but also fixes \"profits \u2026 reasonably attributable to the production of oil or gas from the well\" as the primary ingredient in the computing of the base amount upon which such percentage is to be calculated.\nUnder ss. 11(1) (b) and 106(1) the method of calculating the allowance to be allowed is left to be dealt with entirely by regulation, and in my opinion it is within the ambit of the authority created by these sections for the Governor-in-Council to provide that when a number of wells are operated by one taxpayer he shall be required, in calculating the amount of his allowance, to make a deduction from the aggregate of the aforesaid profits from each well, equal to the aggregate of the losses from loss wells, provided always that in computing the reasonably attributable profits from the aggregate of which the deduction is to be made, the producing wells are dealt with individually. In my view this is the effect of subs. (4) of s. 1201 which was first introduced by the amendment to the Regulations (P.C. 4443) and which was inserted between subs. (3) and the present subs. (5) which, in its old form, was subs. (4). Section 1201(4) reads as follows:\n(4) Where the taxpayer operates more than one oil or gas well, the profits referred to in subsection one shall be the aggregate of the profits minus the aggregate of the losses of the taxpayer for the year reasonably attributable to the production of oil or gas from all wells operated by the taxpayer.\nIt is to be observed that the word \"profits\" occurs twice in this subsection, and in my opinion it must bear the same meaning in both places so that the words \"aggregate of the profits\" must mean \"aggregate of the profits referred to in subsection one\" (i.e., the profits of the taxpayer for the year reasonably attributable to the well).\nThe word \"aggregate\" is defined in the Oxford English Dictionary as meaning \"Collected into one body; formed by the collection of many units into one, association.\" Other dictionary definitions are in slightly different language but all indicate that in its primary sense and meaning the word implies a plurality of units whose total amount it represents.\nIt is upon \"the profits reasonably attributable to the production of oil or gas from the well\" that a taxpayer operating a single well is entitled to a deduction of 33\u2153 per cent in computing his income tax, and it appears to follow from the above that in the case of a taxpayer operating more than one well it is these same profits which must be computed and then aggregated to find the profits reasonably attributable to all the wells which he operates from which he is required to deduct the aggregate of the losses from loss wells in order to determine the amount on which he is entitled to the 33\u2153 per cent deduction.\nIt seems to me, therefore, that the first question facing the operator of one or more oil or gas wells who seeks a deduction under this section must be how he is to compute the profits reasonably attributable to the production of oil or gas from each well, and in this regard he is at once faced with the mandatory provisions of s. 1201(5) which read as follows:\n(5) In computing the profits reasonably attributable to the production of oil or gas for the purpose of this section a deduction shall be made equal to the amounts, if any, deducted in computing the taxpayer's income for the taxation year under the provisions of section 53 of Chapter 25 of the Statutes of 1949, Second Session. The relevant deduction is specified by the said s. 53 to be\n\u2026 the aggregate of the drilling and exploration costs, including all general and geological and geophysical expenses incurred by it (the corporate taxpayer) directly or indirectly on or in respect of exploring or drilling for oil or natural gas in Canada.\nIt is noteworthy that provision is made under s. 1201 for two different kinds of deduction, both of which are to be made in respect of \"profits reasonably attributable to the production of oil or gas\". The one under subs. (4) (i.e., losses of loss wells) is to be made after the profits from all wells operated by the taxpayer have been computed and aggregated, whereas the other under subs. (5) is to be made \"in computing\" these same profits for the purpose of the section.\nAs I take the view that the aggregate of these profits from all wells cannot be determined for the purpose of subs. (4) until the profits of each have been computed and as subs. (5) requires a deduction to be made \"in computing\" these profits, it follows that I am of opinion that the s. 53 costs specified in subs. (5) must be deducted in respect of each well.\nIt was strongly urged on behalf of the appellant that the procedure to be followed in determining the base for the allowance granted by the Regulation to a taxpayer that operates more than one oil or gas well is as follows:\n1. Determine the profits or losses of each producing well in the normal manner by ascertaining the difference between the receipts reasonably attributable to the production of oil or gas from the well and the expenses of earning those receipts.\n2. Determine the aggregate of the profits of the profitable wells and the aggregate of the losses of the loss wells and deduct the aggregate of the latter from the aggregate of the former.\n3. Deduct from the amount of profits remaining, the exploration and drilling costs deducted under s. 53 in computing the taxpayer's income.\nThe difficulty which this reasoning presents to me is that, as I understand the provisions of subs. (5), a taxpayer is not permitted \"to determine (i.e. compute) \u2026 the profits of each producing well in the normal manner\" for the purpose of this section (1201) if he has deducted under s. 53, in computing his income tax, any sums which are reasonably attributable to the production of oil or gas from such well. On the contrary he is expressly required by subs. (5) to make the deduction of s. 53 costs \"in computing the profits reasonably attributable to the production of oil or gas for the purpose of this section\" and in my opinion these words carry the deduction there referred to back to the very first step which the taxpayer is required to take in making his calculation under subss. (1) and (4), namely, the computation of the reasonably attributable profits of each well.\nThe reasoning advanced on behalf of the appellant would require the taxpayer to compute the \"profits reasonably attributable to the production of oil or gas from each well\" without reference to the deduction for which provision is made in subs. (5) and would require him to deduct the s. 53 costs from the aggregate of such profits minus losses from loss wells without regard to whether or not such costs are reasonably attributable to the production of oil or gas from a well. I am of opinion, on the other hand, that whenever it is necessary for the purposes of s. 1201 for a taxpayer to compute the profits reasonably attributable to the production of oil or gas from a well, he is required to work out the amount, if any, of his s. 53 costs which is reasonably attributable to the production of oil or gas from that well, and if there is no such amount he is not required to make any such deduction. Although the calculating of the amount of such a deduction in reference to each well may appear at first glance to present difficulties, it is nonetheless apparent that the respondent's auditors have not found such difficulties insurmountable because they have made the appropriate deduction in compiling the \"profits of profitable wells\" for the purpose of presenting this claim.\nThe terms of s. 1201 have been hereinbefore considered without reference to the case of Home Oil Company Limited v. Minister of National Revenue10, because that case was decided under Regulation 1201 before the enactment of subs. (4) and before the concluding words \"in respect of the well\" had been deleted from subs. (5).\nThe Home Oil case was thus decided when s. 53 costs were the only deduction authorized by the Regulation and before subs. (4) had made provision for the deduction of losses of producing wells from the aggregate of \"the profits reasonably attributable to the production of oil or gas from the well\". The Court was, therefore, only directly concerned with the question of whether the s. 53 costs could be deducted as a lump sum in computing \"the profits of the well\" or whether the latter expression required a separate ascertainment for each profitable well. The decision of this Court, that the section then before it did not authorize such a deduction and that such profits should be separately ascertained, in my opinion applies with equal force to the amended Regulation, and the following observation of Rand J., speaking on behalf of the Court at p. 736, applies directly to the question at issue:\nThe allowance under s. 53 is an overall allowance related to total income for a specific purpose; the ascertainment of profits for the purpose of Regulation No. 1201 is on the basis of reasonable relation to the source of income and for a different purpose; and I am unable to agree that the total allowance under s. 53 can be said to be made \"in respect of\" the profitable wells.\nAs has been observed, in the original Regulation 1201 as passed by P.C. 6471 of December 22, 1949, there was no provision equivalent to the present subs. (4), and the only express language used in that Regulation requiring that s. 53 costs were to be deducted on a well-to-well basis consisted of the last four words of the then subs. (4) (now subs. (5)), namely, the words \"in respect of the well\".\nAs the terms of the new subs. (4) in my view require the profits reasonably attributable to each well to be computed separately before they can be aggregated, and as under subs. (5) the s. 53 deductions must be made in computing those profits, it seems to me to follow that \"the purpose of this section\" as a whole (s. 1201) cannot be fulfilled unless the deductions for which provision is made in subs. (5) are made \"in respect of the well\", and it is, therefore, no longer necessary to employ those words in that subsection in order to convey the meaning that the deduction is to be made on a well-to-well basis.\nIt would make the provisions of subs. (4) quite purposeless if all the s. 53 costs were required to be deducted in computing the profits of each of a number of wells and as subs. (5) requires the deduction to be made both \"in computing the profits\u2026\" and \"for the purpose of this section\" it seems to me that it can only be complied with by deducting , in computing the profits of each well, such of the s. 53 costs as can be related thereto. To deduct all the s. 53 costs from the aggregate of the profits of all the wells is to leave this deduction out of account \"in computing the profits\" which have been aggregated and to deduct all the same costs from each well is to defeat \"the purpose of this section\", but if these costs are related to the individual wells and deducted in computing the profits of each, then it appears to me that the language of subs. (5) has been applied in such manner as to comply with the overall purpose of the Regulation and of the statute as interpreted by the Home Oil case.\nMy opinion as to the applicability of the above quotation from the decision of Rand J. in the Home Oil case to the present circumstances is based in some degree on the reasons last recited, but it is to be remembered also that there has been no material change in s. 11(1) (b) of the Income Tax Act since that decision was rendered, and that what was there said concerning the meaning and purpose of that subsection has lost none of its force by reason of the change in the Regulation.\nIn the present case the respondent claimed its allowance under s. 1201 for the year 1951 on the basis, first, that the aggregate losses from loss wells could not properly be deducted from the aggregate profits because subs. (4) was ultra vires the authority conferred by s. 11(1) (b), secondly, that the s. 53 deduction could only be made to the extent that the costs therein specified were reasonably attributable to the production of oil or gas from each well, and lastly, that there should be added to the profits reasonably attributable to each well an amount of unrealized profits based on notional sales, from the respondent's producing department to other of its departments, of oil not actually sold by the company during the taxation year.\nThe learned President of the Exchequer Court, in the course of the decision from which this appeal is asserted, held that subs. (4) of s. 1201 made valid and effective provision for the deduction of the aggregate of reasonably attributable losses from the aggregate of reasonably attributable profits in computing the allowance authorized by s. 11(1) (b). From this finding the Imperial Oil Company has entered a cross-appeal. I am of opinion that this cross-appeal should be dismissed and I agree with the views expressed by the learned President of the Exchequer Court when he said:\nThe power to enact a regulation determining the amount of the deductible allowance permitted by section 11(1) (b) of the Act and the base for its computation was granted in the broadest terms and I cannot see any limitation of it such as counsel suggests.\nAs I have indicated, the provisions of subs. (4) do not appear to me to run contrary to the purposes of the section as a whole or of s. 11(1) (b) of the Income Tax Act because in my view subs. (4) requires the profits of each producing well to be separately computed. As the identity of each well is thus preserved as a unit in the aggregate amount which constitutes the basic ingredient of the calculation required by the subsection, I am of opinion that the allowance for which it provides is made \"in respect of an oil well\" and therefore intra vires.\nAs to the deduction under subs. (5) of s. 1201, the learned President has held that this is required to be made on a well-to-well basis. From this finding the Minister has appealed. For the reasons hereinbefore stated as well as those stated by the learned President, I am of opinion that the appeal from this finding should be dismissed.\nThe learned President further held that the unrealized profits reasonably attributable to each well should be taken into account for the purposes of s. 1201 and the Minister has appealed from this finding also. To agree with this finding requires the acceptance of the proposition that \"the producing department\" of the respondent is a separate entity and involves the recognition of the existence of a profit where there has been no actual sale. As I am unable to view the existence of \"the producing department\" as a separate entity in a realistic light, and as I feel that no profit exists for the purpose of this section until the oil is sold, I am unable to agree with the finding of the learned President in this regard and to this extent would allow the appeal.\nIn the result, I am of opinion that the amount of the deductible allowance to which the respondent was entitled in 1951 under s. 11(1) (b) of the Act and s. 1201 of the Regulations is $7,454,263.47 being 33\u2153 per cent. of the base of $22,362,790.40 which has been calculated by deducting the unrealized profits and the losses of loss wells from the profits of profitable oil wells as claimed by the company.\nI would, therefore, allow the appeal in part and dismiss the counterclaim with costs to follow the event in both cases.\nMartland J. (dissenting in part):\u2014The relevant facts are set out in the reasons of my brother Judson and do not require repetition. I am in agreement with his conclusions in respect of the cross-appeal and in respect of the contention by the appellant that the amount of $8,642,196.84, respecting increase in unrealized profits in supply, manufacturing and marketing inventories, was not part of the respondent's profits reasonably attributable to the production of oil or gas from all the wells of the company, so as to entitle the respondent to include it in determining the base for its allowance.\nI have, however, reached a different conclusion in respect of the item of unrelated drilling, exploration and other costs in the amount of $19,992,588.33.\nRegulation 1201 must be read in the light of ss. 12(1) (b) and 11 of the Income Tax Act. The former provides:\n* * *\n12. (1) In computing income, no deduction shall be made in respect of\n* * *\n(b) an outlay, loss or replacement of capital, a payment on account of capital or an allowance in respect of depreciation, obsolescence or depletion except as expressly permitted by this Part,\nThe relevant portions of s. 11 are:\n11. (1) Notwithstanding paragraphs (a), (b) and (h) of subsection (1) of section 12, the following amounts may be deducted in computing the income of a taxpayer for a taxation year\n* * *\n(b) such amount as an allowance in respect of an oil or gas well, mine or timber limit, if any, as is allowed to the taxpayer by regulation,\n* * *\n(3) Where a deduction is allowed under paragraph (b) of subsection (1) in respect of an oil or gas well, mine or timber limit operated by a lessee, the lessor and lessee may agree as to what portion of the allowance each may deduct and, in the event that they cannot agree, the Minister may fix the portions. The deduction in computing income permitted by Regulation 1201 is clearly a depletion allowance, as was stated by Rand J., who delivered the unanimous judgment of this Court in Home Oil Company Limited v. Minister of National Revenue11:\nThat this allowance is made to offset the wasting capital resource is clear from the language of s. 12(b) which speaks of \"depreciation, obsolescence or depletion\", and if its purpose is not to be defeated, the producing wells must be dealt with individually.\nSection 11(1) (b) refers to an allowance in respect of an oil or gas well. Section 11(3) makes provision for the portions of the allowance permitted which a lessor and a lessee may respectively deduct where an oil or gas well is operated by a lessee. This, to my mind, contemplates the determination of the depletion allowance on a well by well basis and this was the conclusion reached by this Court in the Home Oil case.\nSubsection (1) of Regulation 1201 now under consideration reads as follows:\n1201. (1) Where the taxpayer operates an oil or gas well the deduction allowed for a taxation year is 33\u2153 per cent of the profits of the taxpayer for the year reasonably attributable to the production of oil or gas from the well.\nIt is similar in effect to the subsection which was under consideration in the Home Oil case and speaks of \"profits of the taxpayer for the year reasonably attributable to the production of oil or gas from the well\", which contemplates the determination of profits for each individual well of the taxpayer.\nSubsection (4) of Regulation 1201 did not apply in the taxation years under consideration in the Home Oil case. It reads as follows:\n(4) Where the taxpayer operates more than one oil or gas well, the profits referred to in subsection one shall be the aggregate of the profits minus the aggregate of the losses of the taxpayer for the year reasonably attributable to the production of oil or gas from all wells operated by the taxpayer.\nWhen this subsection refers to the \"aggregate\" of profits and the \"aggregate\" of losses reasonably attributable to the production of oil or gas from all wells operated by the taxpayer it must mean the aggregate of the profits and the aggregate of the losses attributable to the individual oil or gas wells from which oil or gas production was obtained. It is speaking of an aggregate of individual items. Consequently the computation must still be made on a well by well basis, but subs. (4) added a new feature to the Regulalation in that losses on a per well basis in respect of wells operated at a loss had also to be computed and the aggregate of those losses had to be deducted from the aggregate of the profits earned by the individual profitable wells.\nSubsection (5) reads as follows:\n(5) In computing the profits reasonably attributable to the production of oil or gas for the purpose of this section a deduction shall be made equal to the amounts, if any, deducted in computing the taxpayer's income for the taxation year under the provisions of section 53 of Chapter 25 of the Statutes of 1949, Second Session.\nIt commences with the words \"In computing the profits reasonably attributable to the production of oil or gas for the purpose of this section \u2026\" As above indicated, the computation of profits for the purpose of the section has to be made on an individual well basis. Subsection (1) refers to the profits from the well. Subsection (4) contemplates the obtaining of an aggregate of the profits resulting from the operation of the profitable wells and an aggregate of the losses resulting from the operation of the loss producing wells. When, therefore, subs. (5) refers to the computation of profits reasonably attributable to the production of oil or gas, it is speaking of a computation which has to be made on an individual basis for each well operated by the taxpayer. It calls for \"a deduction of the amounts, if any, deducted in computing the taxpayer's income for the taxation year under the provisions of s. 53 of c. 25 of the Statutes of 1949, Second Session.\" In my view this is a requirement that the taxpayer, in respect of each individual well which he operated to produce oil or gas, must make a deduction of the amount, if any, in relation to that well which he had deducted in computing his income for the taxation year under s. 53 of c. 25 of the Statutes of 1949, Second Session.\nThe relevant portion of s. 53 provides as follows:\n53. (1) A corporation whose principal business is production, refining or marketing of petroleum, petroleum products or natural gas or exploring or drilling for petroleum or natural gas may deduct in computing its income, for the purposes of The Income Tax Act, \u2026 (a) the aggregate of the drilling and exploration costs, including al] general geological and geophysical expenses, incurred by it, directly or indirectly, on or in respect of exploring or drilling for oil or natural gas in Canada\n(i) during the taxation year, and\n(ii) during previous taxation years, to the extent that they were not deductible in computing income for a previous taxation year,\nThe deduction which may be made by a corporation which comes within the provisions of this subsection is an aggregate of costs incurred by it for drilling and exploring for oil or natural gas in Canada. The purpose of the subsection is clearly to provide an incentive for oil and gas exploration and for the drilling of wells for the production of those substances. Exploration costs may be incurred without wells necessarily being drilled in the area explored. Drilling costs may be incurred which result only in dry holes.\nThe purpose of s. 11(1) (b) of the Act is to provide a depletion allowance in respect of a wasting asset, one such asset being oil or gas produced from an operating well. Under Regulation 1201, in the case of an oil or gas well, such allowance is determined on the basis of a percentage of the profits reasonably attributable to the production of oil or gas from such a well.\nAs I see it, the purpose of subs. (5) of Regulation 1201 is to require that, in computing the profits attributable to the production of oil or gas from operating wells, account must be taken of any amounts expended for exploration and drilling in relation to such wells, which have been included in the aggregate of costs deducted by a taxpayer in computing income under the authority of s. 53.\nConsiderable stress was laid in argument on behalf of the appellant upon the fact that, when the new subs. (5) of Regulation 1201 was enacted to replace the former subs. (4), the words \"in respect of the well\", which appeared at the end of subs. (4), were eliminated. It was contended that the meaning of this subsection was thereby altered substantially so as to require the deduction of all drilling and exploration costs which had been claimed by a corporation under s. 53, whether such costs related to wells which it operated or not. I do not agree that the deletion of those words has that result. It is my view that the words were omitted from the new subs. (5) so as to make it conform with the provisions introduced into Regulation 1201 by the new subs. (4). That subsection for the first time introduced the element of a deduction of losses from loss producing wells where \u00e0 taxpayer operated more than one well. It involved aggregating profits from profitable wells and losses from loss producing wells. Consequently, where subs. (4) has application, consideration now has to be given to s. 53 expenditures in relation to all wells operated by the taxpayer, whether profitable or loss producing, and the words \"in respect of the well\" were no longer apt for that purpose.\nI agree with the disposition of this appeal proposed by my brother Ritchie.\nAppeal allowed and cross-appeal dismissed with costs, Cartwright, Martland and Ritchie JJ. dissenting in part.\nSolicitor for the appellant: A.

On July 7, 1950, one K, an agent of the respondent company F, visited the plaintiff M at the latter's farm-house and persuaded him to sign a document entitled \"Minerals Lease\", by which M granted and leased his mineral rights to F in return for shares in the company and certain royalty rights.\nIn June 1955, M executed a petroleum and natural gas lease to one L in respect of the same lands which had been the subject matter of the minerals lease to F. L. was engaged in a \"top leasing\" programme, whereby the top leases obtained would take effect upon the termination of the prior existing leases. It was implicit in this programme that steps would be taken to set aside the existing prior leases. An action was commenced by M and L seeking a declaration that the lease to F was \"non est factum, illegal and void\". It was alleged (1) that the obtaining of the mineral lease was a part of a fraudulent scheme by F and its promoters to deprive farmers of their mineral rights; (2) that the mineral lease was void, based on the plea of non est factum; (3) that it was rendered void by virtue of certain provisions of The Securities Act, R.S.S. 1940, c. 287, as amended. The action was dismissed at trial and that judgment was sustained by the Court of Appeal on equal division.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nAs found by the learned trial judge, there was nothing in the evidence to support the appellant's first submission.\nThe finding of the learned trial judge, affirmed in the Court of Appeal, that the plea of non est factum was not established on the evidence, should not be disturbed. Prudential Trust Co. Ltd. v. Forseth, [1960] S.C.R. 210, and Prudential Trust Co. Ltd. v. Olson, [1960] S.C.R. 227, referred to.\nWith respect to the third submission, the respondents were afforded no protection by s. 20 of the Act, and their further contention that the transaction involved was not a trading in a security within the meaning of s. 2(10) of the Act was rejected.\nF was registered as a broker under the Act for the purpose of trading in its own securities. A trade in which it was itself a party was, under s. 3(3)(c), one in which registration was not required and consequently was not the kind of trade which, under clause (a) or clause (c) of s. 3 (1), required the registration of K as a salesman. There was, therefore, no breach of s. 3(1) of the Act.\nThe purpose of s. 17a of the Act is not to prevent trading of an unauthorized kind, but is intended to prevent persons in their own residences from being sought out by stock salesmen. A breach of the section, in relation to a transaction otherwise lawful, results, not in preventing the contract from being valid, but in the incurring of a penalty by the person who is in breach of it. The breach of s. 17a by K, therefore, did not result in the agreement here in question being rendered void. Mellis v. Shirley Local Board, 16 Q.B.D. 446, applied; McAskill v. The Northwestern Trust Co., [1926] S.C.R. 412, referred to.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan1, affirming a judgment of Graham J. Appeal dismissed.\nL. McK. Robinson, Q.C., for the plaintiffs, appellants. E. J. Moss and C. A. Lavery, for Freeholders Oil Co. Ltd., defendant, respondent.\nE. C. Leslie, Q.C., and W. M. Elliott, for Canada Permanent Trust Co., defendant, respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nMartland J.:\u2014The respondent, Freeholders Oil Company Limited (hereinafter referred to as \"Freeholders\"), was incorporated under the laws of the Province of Saskatchewan on January 4, 1950. One of the objects stated in its memorandum of association was\nTo acquire lands and mineral rights from the freeholders owners thereof and to pool the same for and on their behalf and to vest control over their disposition in the owners of lands and mineral rights for the purpose of equitably distributing the rights and benefits over the same among members of the Company;\nThe articles of association provided that each member should have one vote on a poll at shareholders' meetings and not one vote for each share held by such member.\nFreeholders proceeded to acquire mineral rights from land owners, some of whom had not previously granted leases of their petroleum and natural gas rights and some of whom had already granted such leases to other lessees. With respect to the former class, Freeholders would obtain the grant of a mineral lease of the minerals within, upon or under the lessor's lands for a term of 99 years, renewable at Freeholders' option. The consideration paid by Freeholders for such a lease consisted of the allotment to the lessor of one fully paid share in its capital stock for each acre of land involved. It also covenanted to pay and deliver to the lessor an undivided 20 per cent of the benefits or proceeds received by Freeholders from any disposition made by it of such minerals.\nWith respect to the latter class, Freeholders would take from the land owner an assignment of the royalties payable to him under his existing lease, together with the grant to Freeholders of a 99 year mineral lease running from the date of the assignment, which, however, would only take effect upon the termination of the existing lease. The consideration from Freeholders for such an assignment consisted of a covenant for the allotment of one fully paid share in its capital stock for each acre of land involved, of which one-half of the shares would be allotted forthwith and the other one-half only when the mineral lease to Freeolders should take effect. Freeholders was to have the right to deal with and dispose of the assigned royalties, but covenanted to pay to the assignor 20 per cent of the benefits received by Freeholders from such disposition.\nOn the same date that Freeholders was incorporated its promoters also incorporated Western Royalties Limited (hereinafter referred to as \"Western\"). By an agreement made between the two companies dated April 20, 1950, Western agreed to act as manager of Freeholders for a period of five years and to pay the cost of organizing, managing and operating Freeholders during that period up to a sum not exceeding $10,000 in each year. In consideration of its services, Western was to receive an undivided 30 per cent interest in all mineral rights and royalties acquired by Freeholders. Freeholders agreed that if it earned a profit of not less-than $250,000 in the five year period it would reimburse Western for its expenditures up to a total of $50,000.\nIn brief, therefore, the plan was that Freeholders would be the recipient of mineral rights and royalties acquired on its behalf. Western would provide the initial capital and management. Freeholders would be in a position to dispose of the mineral rights which it acquired. Western would have a 30 per cent undivided interest therein. The individuals who leased or assigned to Freeholders would each be entitled to 20 per cent of the proceeds of the disposition of those mineral rights which each had leased or assigned. The remaining 50 per cent would belong to Freeholders, in which company each lessor or assignor to it would have acquired a share interest. Essentially the scheme was one for the pooling of mineral rights and royalty rights, with Western receiving a 30 per cent interest in such rights in compensation for its provision of capital and the furnishing of management services.\nThe campaign for the acquisition of mineral rights and royalties for Freeholders was completed by August 1950. By that time it had acquired leasehold interests in some 23,000 acres and assignments of royalties in respect of previously leased lands of approximately 613,000 acres.\nOn August 9, 1951, Prairie Oil Royalties Company Limited (hereinafter referred to as \"Prairie\") was caused to be incorporated in Saskatchewan by Lehman Brothers, investment bankers, of New York. It entered into an agreement of the same date with Western to acquire Western's 30 per cent interest in the mineral rights and royalties to which Western was entitled under its agreement with Freeholders. A price of $3.00 per acre was paid in respect of lands subject to mineral leases to Freeholders and $1.50 per acre in respect of lands the subject of assignment agreements to Freeholders. The purchase price was paid as to 75 per cent in cash and as to 25 per cent in the form of fully paid shares of the capital stock of Prairie. The necessary capital for Prairie was raised by the sale of its shares, chiefly to clients of Lehman Brothers.\nIn order to effect this sale of mineral interests a trust agreement was made between Freeholders and the respondent Canada Permanent Trust Company (hereinafter refererd to as \"the Trust Company\"), approved by Western and Prairie, whereby Freeholders assigned all its various mineral interests to the Trust Company, which agreed to hold the same in trust as to an undivided 30 per cent for Prairie and the remainder for Freeholders. The Trust Company agreed to issue three trust certificates in the form provided in the agreement, one for an undivided 30 per cent interest to Western and two respectively for an undivided 50 per cent interest and an undivided 20 per cent interest to Freeholders. Provision was made for the conversion of the latter certificate into certificates for individual parcels of land, which Freeholders could deliver to the individual land owners from whom it had acquired mineral rights.\nThe present case arose in respect of one of the mineral leases granted to Freeholders by Edwin Meyers (hereinafter referred to as \"Meyers\") on July 7, 1950, which related to the mines, minerals and mineral rights (referred to as \"minerals\") within, upon or under the North \u00bd of Section 5, Township 6, Range 11, West of the 2nd Meridian in the Province of Saskatchewan. The document was entitled \"Minerals Lease\" and by it Meyers granted and leased to Freeholders the minerals, together with the exclusive right and privilege to explore, drill for, win, take, remove, store and dispose of them, to have and enjoy the same for a term of 99 years, renewable at Freeholders' option. The consideration was 320 fully paid shares of the capital stock of Freeholders, to be allotted by it to Meyers. Clause 1 of the minerals lease provided:\n1. Payment to Lessor:\nThe Lessee shall have the full and absolute right to deal with, dispose of and make such agreements in relation to the said minerals, or any part thereof, as it shall from time to time deem advisable; Provided that the Lessee shall pay or deliver to the Lessor an undivided twenty (20%) per cent. of the benefits or proceeds received by the Lessee from any such agreement or disposition whether the same consist of a cash consideration or a royalty interest under a drilling lease or other contract for the production of any minerals; and in the event that the Lessee should receive a royalty interest the Lessee shall secure the issue and delivery to the Lessor of a Trust Certificate covering the said twenty (20%) per cent. interest in such form as the management of the Lessee shall designate, which interest shall be subject to the terms and conditions of the said Certificate and of this Agreement.\nMeyers did not receive the share certificates for his 320 shares until December 11, 1951. On May 15, 1953, after consulting a solicitor, he filed a caveat against the lands in question, in which he alleged that the lease had been obtained by fraud and misrepresentation. Freeholders did not receive any notice of this caveat. Subsequently Meyers attended three shareholders' meetings of Freeholders, one in November 1953, and two in December 1954.\nAt the time the lease was granted in 1950 oil had not been discovered in the area in which Meyers' lands were situated. By 1955 there had been substantial development in that area and oil had been discovered in close proximity to Meyers' land.\nIn 1955 the appellant Bandy Lee (hereinafter referred to as \"Lee\") commenced a \"top leasing\" programme in that area. A top lease is one which takes effect upon the termination of a prior existing lease. It was implicit in Lee's programme that steps would be taken to set aside the existing prior leases. Meyers consulted another solicitor, who was acting on behalf of Lee, and then executed a petroleum and natural gas lease dated June 9, 1955, to Lee in respect of the same lands which had been the subject matter of the minerals lease to Freeholders. On the 27th of the same month he sent a letter of repudiation to Freeholders in respect of the mineral lease to it, which repudiation was not accepted by Freeholders. On December 17 of the same year Meyers and Lee commenced action against the two respondents, seeking a declaration that the lease to Freeholders was \"non est factum, illegal and void\". Meyers died in December of the following year and the appellant Leslie Meyers is his sole executor.\nThe action was dismissed at the trial and that judgment was sustained by the Court of Appeal of Saskatchewan on an equal division.\nThree main submissions were made by the appellants: (1) that the obtaining of the mineral lease was a part of a fraudulent scheme by Freeholders and its promoters to deprive farmers of their mineral rights; (2) that the mineral lease was void, based on the plea of non est factum; (3) that it was rendered void by virtue of certain of the provisions of The Securities Act, R.S.S. 1940, c. 287, as amended.\nA great deal of evidence was tendered at the trial with reference to the first submission, which it is not necessary for me to review here. The learned trial judge found nothing in the evidence to support this submission. This claim was not supported by any of the judgments in the Court of Appeal and the detailed submission on this point presented by counsel for the appellants has failed to persuade me that the learned trial judge should have reached any other conclusion than that which he did.\nWith respect to the second point, the question of fact is as to what was stated to Meyers by Knox, the agent of Freeholders who obtained for it the execution of the minerals lease by Meyers. The appellants contend that Knox fraudulently misrepresented to Meyers the nature of the instrument which he was being asked to sign. This the respondents deny.\nIt is common ground that Knox visited Meyers at the latter's farm on July 7, 1950. It is also common ground that prior to this visit three other oil companies had sought to obtain leases from Meyers and in each case he had refused to make an agreement. His evidence was taken de bene esse before the trial. He alleged two main points on which he said that Knox had misrepresented the nature of the instrument. The first was in respect of the matter of the royalty payable under the document by Freeholders to Meyers. The evidence at the trial was that the prevailing rate of royalty payable under petroleum and natural gas leases being granted to oil companies was 12 \u00bd per cent. According to Meyers, Knox represented to him that under the terms of the mineral lease which he was being asked to sign he would receive royalties at the rate of 20 per cent. In fact, of course, the minerals lease to Freeholders did not provide for a 20 per cent royalty, but provided for payment to Meyers of 20 per cent of the benefits or proceeds received by Freeholders on a disposition by it of the minerals. If Freeholders subleased the minerals, under the prevailing form of petroleum and natural gas lease, to an oil company, Meyers would only receive 20 per cent of the royalty payable to Freeholders under such sublease.\nThe second major misrepresentation alleged was as to the term of the lease. Meyers testified that Knox had led him to believe that, except as to the matter of royalty and as to payment of a consideration in the form of Freeholders' shares, the minerals lease submitted to him was similar to the so-called \"standard\" lease of the oil companies and he, therefore, concluded that it would be for a ten year term and not for a term of 99 years, subject to renewal.\nKnox gave evidence that prior to working for Freeholders he had not had previous experience in negotiating mineral agreements. He only worked for Freeholders for about a month and then terminated his employment because of his lack of success in obtaining agreements. He only negotiated about 15 agreements for Freeholders. He recalled that he was furnished with a supply of yellow forms, green forms and white forms, which were respectively the assignment agreement form, the mineral lease form and the prospectus of Freeholders. He was instructed to furnish to each party whom he visited a copy of the prospectus and, in the ordinary course of events, he would have left a prospectus with Meyers, although he did not specifically remember either Meyers or the interview with him. On this point Meyers, when asked whether he had received a copy of the Freeholders prospectus, failed to give any answer. Knox stated that he did not misrepresent the agreement to anyone. He testified that in the few cases where he was able to negotiate agreements the parties whom he approached were anxious to sign up immediately. His practice, so far as he could recall, was to explain in a general way that Freeholders was a pooling arrangement and that shares would be allotted in return for the execution of the agreement. He would then deliver a copy of the prospectus, with the form of agreement, to the persons whom he interviewed. He said that he did not in any way prevent them from reading the forms and he endeavoured to answer any questions that might be put as fully as he could. He said that he did not know anything about the forms of lease of other oil companies, or the length of the term of such leases. The only leases he had ever seen were those of Freeholders.\nThe learned trial judge accepted Knox's evidence and decided that the appellants had failed to discharge the onus of establishing fraud or misrepresentation on his part in the securing of the agreement. This finding was sustained by the Court of Appeal on an equal division.\nCulliton J. A., who delivered the judgment of the Court of Appeal dismissing the appeal, after referring to the principles relating to the position of an appeal court with reference to findings of fact made by a trial judge, said:\nLearned counsel for the appellants argued that these principles did not apply to the learned trial judge's findings in this case. This argument was based on the contention that the only direct evidence as to the actual circumstances surrounding the execution of the lease was the de bene esse evidence of Meyers. It was argued that because of this the appeal court was in just as good a position to determine the effect and weight to be given to this evidence and the inferences to be drawn therefrom as was the trial judge. I cannot agree with this view. It seems apparent to me that in determining the truth or veracity of the de bene esse evidence, one of the dominant factors must be the credence to be given to the evidence of Knox, Broughton and Hardy, all of whom appeared before the trial judge, as well as the conduct and attitude of Meyers as disclosed in other evidence. In no other way could the de bene esse evidence be properly assessed.\nThe principles to which Culliton J.A. referred were considered in two recent cases in this Court: Prudential Trust Company Limited v. Forseth2, and Prudential Trust Company Limited v. Olson, reported in the same volume at p. 227. The situation in the present case is similar to that in the Olson case, except that in the present appeal there have been concurrent findings of fact.\nI do not consider that the circumstances of this case are such as to warrant a reversal of the findings of fact made by the learned trial judge. There was sufficient evidence to warrant them. In addition to the evidence of Knox, there were matters on which the learned trial judge could properly rely in reaching the conclusion which he did. There is the fact that no complaint was made by Meyers regarding the minerals lease until the filing of his caveat in May 1953, which complaint at that time was not made to Freeholders, but was merely stated in the caveat filed. After the filing of the caveat he attended three shareholders' meetings of Freeholders in 1953 and in 1954 and made no complaint as to fraud or misrepresentation at any of those meetings, even though he did speak at one of them. His only complaint was as to delay on the part of the company in drilling. He did not attempt to repudiate the minerals lease until 1955, after he had already effected another lease to Lee. By then the situation regarding oil development in his area had greatly changed. The likelihood of oil production on his own land then made the lease with Lee a more attractive proposition than the pooling arrangement with Freeholders. In addition, there is the evidence of Broughton and Hardy, which the learned trial judge apparently accepted. Broughton, the president of Freeholders, and Hardy, a field man employed by Freeholders who had known Meyers for 25 years, visited Meyers at his farm in 1955, subsequent to the granting by Meyers of his lease to Lee. They testified that at that time Meyers made no complaint in respect of any of the provisions of the minerals lease to Freeholders, other than to say that he wanted a new lease with a 12 \u00bd per cent royalty and a drilling commitment. There was no suggestion that he had been misled into executing the lease to Freeholders and the conversation was quite friendly in tone. Meyers made no reference to the granting of the lease to Lee.\nIn my view, therefore, the finding of the learned trial judge, affirmed in the Court of Appeal, that the plea of non est factum was not established on the evidence should not be disturbed. The third submission of the appellants is that the agreement between Meyers and Freeholders was void under the provisions of The Securities Act. The relevant facts in this connection are that Freeholders was registered under that Act as a broker (non-brokerage), but that Knox was not registered as a salesman under the Act. The minerals lease was executed by Meyers in his house on his farm. The Registrar of Securities, who was also the Registrar of Joint Stock Companies, was consulted by representatives of Freeholders before its operations commenced. In his opinion those operations were outside the provisions of the statute because they were, in essence, acquisitions of mineral interests and not an offer of securities to the public. For this reason he did not think that Freeholders required a licence under the Act but he did permit the issuance of a licence to Freeholders. He was fully informed of its intended method of operation and consented to the non-registration of its agents. He also consented to their calling at residences in connection with the carrying out of their duties.\nThe relevant sections of The Securities Act applicable at the times material to this action are the following:\n2. In this Act, unless the context otherwise requires, the expression:\n* * *\n8. \"Security\" includes:\n(a) any document, instrument or writing commonly known as a security;\n(b) any document constituting evidence of title to or interest in the capital, assets, property, profits, earnings or royalties of any person or company;\n(c) any document constituting evidence of an interest in an association of legatees or heirs;\n(d) any document constituting evidence of an interest in an option given upon a security; and\n(e) any document designated as a security by the regulations.\n* * *\n10. \"Trade\" or \"trading\" includes any solicitation or obtaining of a subscription to, disposition of, transaction in, or attempt to deal in, sell or dispose of a security or interest in or option upon a security, for valuable consideration, whether the terms of payment be upon margin, installment or otherwise, and any underwriting of an issue or part of an issue of a security, and any act, advertisement, conduct or negotiation directly or indirectly designated as \"trade\" or \"trading\" in the regulations. R.S.S. 1930, c. 239, s. 2.\n* * *\n3. (1) No person shall:\n(a) trade in any security unless he is registered as a broker or salesman of a registered broker; (b) act as an official of or on behalf of a partnership or company in connection with a trade in a security by the partnership or company, unless he or the partnership or company is registered as a broker;\n(c) act as a salesman of or on behalf of a partnership or company in connection with a trade in a security by the partnership or company, unless he is registered as a salesman of a partnership or company which is registered as a broker;\nand unless such registrations have been made in accordance with the provisions of this Act and the regulations; and any violation of this section shall constitute an offence.\n* * *\n(3) Registration shall not be required in respect of any of the following classes or trades or securities:\n* * *\n(c) a trade where one of the parties is a bank, loan company, trust company or insurance company, or is an official or employee, in the performance of his duties as such, of His Majesty in the right of Canada or any province or territory of Canada, or of any municipal corporation or public board or commission in Canada, or is registered as a broker under the provisions of this Act;\n* * *\n17a. (1) No person shall call at any residence and:\n(a) trade there in any security; or\n(b) offer to trade there or at any other place in any security; with the public or any member of the public.\n* * *\n(4) A violation of this section shall constitute an offence.\n* * *\n20. No action whatever, and no proceedings by way of injunction, mandamus, prohibition or other extraordinary remedy shall lie or be instituted against any person, whether in his public or private capacity, or against any company in respect of any act or omission in connection with the administration or carrying out of the provisions of this Act or the regulations where such person is the Attorney General or his repre\u00adsentative or the registrar, or where such person or company was proceeding under the written or verbal direction or consent of any one of them, or under an order of the Court of King\u2019s Bench or a judge thereof made under the provisions of this Act. R.S.S. 1930, c. 239, s. 16.\nThe contention of the appellants is that the negotia\u00adtion of the minerals lease by Knox, who had not been registered as a salesman, was a breach of subs. (1) of s. 3 and was also a breach of s. 17a of the Act, the consequence of which was that the agreement was rendered void.\nThe learned trial judge decided that the respondents were protected by the provisions of s. 20, on the ground that the verbal consent by the Registrar of Securities respecting Freeholders\u2019 operations resulted in its receiving the protec\u00adtion afforded by that section. This view of the effect of s. 20 was not adopted in the Court of Appeal. Culliton J. A. reached his conclusions upon the assumption, without so finding, that the transaction in question did come within the provisions of the Act. Both of the judges who dissented were of the opinion that s. 20 did not take Freeholders\u2019 operations outside the application of the statute. I agree with their view as to the meaning and effect of that section for the reasons stated in the judgment of Gordon J. A., as follows:\nI am glad to say that I have little doubt as to its meaning. It was passed for the protection of those persons who administer the Act and those who act upon the orders of the attorney-general or his representa\u00adtive when such orders are issued \u201cin connection with the administration or carrying out of the provisions of this Act or the regulations.\u201d With every respect I do not think that it empowers the attorney-general or his representative to issue orders violating the express provisions of the Act.\nI do not think there could be the slightest doubt as to the meaning of this section if the words \u201cor against any company\u201d had been deleted and that protection would then have been confined to those people administering the Act.\nIn my view the words, \u201cor against any company\u201d were only added to give protection to those companies that might be ordered to do or not to do certain things by the attorney-general or his representative under the provisions of sec. 15 of the Act.\nThe respondents further contended that the transaction involved here was not a trading in a security at all, within the meaning of the Act, because, in essence, it was an agree\u00adment for the acquisition of mineral rights to which the issuance and allotment of shares of Freeholders to Meyers was only incidental. However, the agreement itself con\u00adtains, in para. 16, a subscription by Meyers for shares of Freeholders in the following terms:\n16. Application for Shares:\nThe Lessor hereby subscribes for and agrees to take up 320 shares with a nominal or par value of One Dollar ($1.00) per share in the capital stock of the Lessee, and tenders in full payment for the said shares the within lease, duly executed and hereby requests that the said shares be allotted to the Lessor and that such shares be issued as fully paid and non-assessable and that a certificate for the said shares be issued in the name of the Lessor as herein set out.\nThis subscription was obtained by Knox as a result of his negotiations with Meyers and there was, therefore, in my opinion, the \u201cobtaining of a subscription\u201d for a security within the definition of the words \u201ctrade\u201d and \u201ctrading\u201d in subs. 10 of s. 2 of the Act. The respondents further rely upon clause (c) of subs (3) of s. 3 of the Act, which has already been quoted. The effect of this clause was not considered in the Courts below, but it is my view that it does have application in this case. Freeholders was registered as a broker under the Act for the purpose of trading in its own securities. A trade in which it was itself a party, as it was here, was, therefore, one in which registration was not required and consequently was not the kind of trade which, under clause (a) or clause (c) of subs. (1) of s. 3, required the registration of Knox as a salesman. In my view, therefore, there was no breach of s. 3(1) of The Securities Act.\nSection 3(3) (c) does not, however, assist the respondents in connection with the application of s. 17a. That section is not concerned with registration and it applies equally to registered salesmen as well as to those who are not registered. It forbids any person to call at a residence and there to trade in securities and it makes such conduct an offence under the Act. There was, therefore, in my opinion, a breach of this section by Knox. The question then is as to what is the effect of that breach upon the agreement between Freeholders and Meyers. Does it render that contract void, or does it only involve liability on the part of Knox to a penalty in view of the provisions of subs. (4)?\nThe determination of the effect of the breach of a statutory provision upon a contract is often a difficult one and must, of course, depend upon the terms and the intent of the provision under consideration. In some cases the statute clearly forbids the making of a certain kind of contract. In such a case the contract cannot be valid if it is in breach of the provision. An example of this kind is found in the provisions of the Manitoba Sale of Shares Act, which was considered by this Court in McAskill v. The Northwestern Trust Company3. Section 4 of that Act provided:\nIt shall hereafter be unlawful for any person or persons, corporation or company, or any agent acting on his, their or its behalf, to sell or offer to sell, or to directly or indirectly attempt to sell, in the province of Manitoba, any shares, stocks, bonds or other securities of any corporation or company, syndicate or association of persons, incorporated or unincorporated, other than the securities hereinafter excepted, without first obtaining from the Public Utility Commissioner, hereinafter styled \"the commissioner,\" a certificate to the effect hereinafter set forth and a license to such agent in the manner hereinafter provided for. Section 6, in part, read:\nIt shall not be lawful for any person or any such company, either as principal or agent, to transact any business, in the form or character similar to that set forth in section 4, until such person or such company shall have filed the papers and documents hereinafter provided for.\nThe Court held in that case that a sale of shares made by a company which had failed to comply with the statutory provisions was void and not voidable.\nSection 16 of The Securities Act, itself, contains an express provision whereby, in the circumstances therein defined, a contract by a customer of a broker shall be void, at the option of such customer.\nOn the other hand, some statutes have been construed as only imposing a penalty, where the Act provides for one, although that is not necessarily the result of a penalty provision being incorporated in the Act. Lord Esher posed the question which must be determined in Melliss v. Shirley Local Board4, as follows:\nAlthough a statute contains no express words making void a contract which it prohibits, yet, when it inflicts a penalty for the breach of the prohibition, you must consider the whole Act as well as the particular enactment in question, and come to a decision, either from the context or the subject-matter, whether the penalty is imposed with intent merely to deter persons from entering into the contract, or for the purposes of revenue, or whether it is intended that the contract shall not be entered into so as to be valid at law.\nIn the present case I have come to the conclusion that it was not the intention of s. 17a of The Securities Act to render completely void a trade in securities because it is made at a residence. The general intent of the statute is to afford protection to the public against trades in securities by persons seeking to trade who have not satisfied the Registrar as to their proper qualification so to do. For that reason the registration provisions of s. 3 are incorporated in the Act. But s. 17a is not a part of this general pattern, because it applies to registered brokers and salesmen as well as to those who are not registered. As I see it, its purpose is not to prevent trading of an unauthorized kind, but is intended to prevent persons in their own residences from being sought out there by stock salesmen. It is the place at which the negotiations occur which is important in this section and not the character of the negotiations themselves. It seeks to deter salemen from attempting to make contracts, which otherwise may be quite proper, at a particular place. This being so, it is my opinion that a breach of s. 17a, in relation to a transaction otherwise lawful, results, not in preventing the contract from being valid, but in the incurring of a penalty by the person who is in breach of it.\nI do not think, therefore, that the breach of s. 17a resulted in the agreement in question here being rendered void.\nIn my opinion the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the plaintiffs, appellants: W.

The accused appealed to this Court. Held (Locke, Cartwright and Ritchie JJ. dissenting) : The appeal should be dismissed.\nPer Kerwin W. and Taschereau, Fauteux, Abbott and Judson JJ.: Sec\u00adtion 63 of The Securities Act is not criminal law within head 27 of s. 91 of the British North America Act, 1.867, as it is not a provision the pith and substance of which is to prohibit an act with penal consequences. It is merely incidental to the main purpose and aim of the enactment, which is to regulate the security business.\nThere is no repugnancy between s. 63 of the Act and s. 343 of the Criminal Code, as the purposes of the two enactments are entirely different. Lymburn v. Mayland, [19321 A.C. 318, Provincial Secretary of Prince Edward Island v. Egan, [19411 S.C.R. 396, O'Grady v. Spading, [19601 S.C.R. 804, Regina v. Yolles, [19591 O.R. 206, and Regina v. Dodd, [19571 O.R. 5, referred to.\nPer Abbott, Martland and Judson JJ.: There is no conflict between s. 63(1)(d) and (e) of the Act and s. 343 of the Code. The latter provision makes it an offence to make, circulate or publish a prospectus known to be false in a material particular with intent to induce persons to become shareholders in a company. Section 63(1)(d) and (e), on the other hand, is designed to penalize a person who, required as he is, by the provisions of the Act, to furnish full, detailed information about the company whose securities are sought to be sold, is knowingly responsible for incorporation in that material of information which is false.\nThe matter of the provincial legislation is not so related in substance to s. 343 of the Code as to be brought within the scope of criminal law in the sense of s. 91 of the British North America Act. The Provincial Secretary of Prince Edward Island v. Egan, supra, and Lymburn v. Mayland, supra, referred to.\nPer Locke J., dissenting: By s. 343 of the Code Parliament has declared to be criminal and has provided the penalty for the publishing of false statements, whether written or oral, which are known to be false in. a material part with the intent to induce others to purchase securities, and by s. 406 has also rendered criminal an attempt to do so.\nAs the whole purpose of The Securities Act is the protection of the public from relying upon false information when purchasing securities, and that of s. 63 to declare criminal the act of making fraudulent misstatements in a prospectus designed for the purpose of inducing such purchases, there is in essence no difference between the offences created and those prohibited by the Code.\nTherefore the offences dealt with in s. 63 of the Act trespass upon the exclusive jurisdiction of Parliament in this field and are accordingly ultra vires. Lymburn v. Mayland, supra, and Tennant v. Union. Bank of Canada, [18941 A.C. 31, referred to.\nPer Cartwright J., dissenting: The difference between s. 38(1) and (9) of the Act and s. 343 of the Code, in that under the latter it would be necessary to establish not only that the accused had been knowingly responsible for the making of a material false statement in. the pros\u00adpectus, but also, that this was done with intent to induce persons, whether ascertained or not, to become shareholders in the company, is apparent rather than real. Having regard to the presumption that a person intends the natural consequences of his acts, proof of the allegations in any of the counts in the information would constitute a prima facie case under s. 343(1) (a) of the Code. Moreover, there is no realistic distinction between making a statement with intent that it shall be relied upon by persons before they become shareholders, as provided for in s. 68(1), and making a statement \"with intent to induce\" those persons to become shareholders.\nBy the combined effect of ss. 38, 47, 47a and 63(1) of the Act the Province has attempted to punish by fine, imprisonment, or both, a course of conduct which is so similar to that condemned by s. 343 of the Code as to create an inconsistency or conflict, with the result that the Dominion legislation must prevail. Rex. v. Nat. Bell Liquors, [1922] 2 A.C. 218, and Lymburn v. Mayland, supra, referred to.\nPer Ritchie J., dissenting : The impugned provisions of the Act have the combined effect, when read in the context of the statute as a whole, of creating an offence which is substantially the same as that for which provision is made in s. 343 of the Code.\nAlthough the specific \"intent to induce persons ... to become shareholders of the Company\" which is required under s. 343 of the Code is not expressly stated to be one of the ingredients of the offences created by the combined effect of s. 63(1)(d) and (e), and s. 38(1) and (9) of the Act, it is nevertheless implicit in the latter provisions that such an intent must form a part of the offences thereby created.

Tremblay, Q.C., for the Attorney General of Quebec.\nThe judgment of Kerwin C. J. and of Taschereau, Fauteux, Abbott and Judson JJ. was delivered by\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE:\u2014By leave of this Court Lyle Francis Smith appeals from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario' reversing the judgment of Hughes J. and quashing the order of prohibition granted by the latter. That order prohibited His Worship Magistrate J. P. Pren\u00adtice or such other justices as might be in Magistrate's Court in the City of Toronto from further proceeding to hear the charges against the appellant wherein he is charged with offences under subss. (1) and (9) of s. 38 of The Securities Act, R.S.O. 1950, c. 351, contrary\u2014 to s. 63 thereof. The learned judge of first instance pointed out that it was not contended that the Act as a whole was invalid and, in fact, any such contention could not hope to succeed in view of the decision of the Judicial Committee in Lymburn v. Mayland[2]. If subss. (1) and (9) of s. 38 of the Act are valid, there can be no question that the Provincial Legisla\u00adture had power by s. 63 to make it an offence to fail to comply with those provisions.\nThe general aim of the Act is to regulate the security business (there being a wide definition of \"security\") and this is accomplished by the setting-up of The Ontario Securities Commission, with power to it to supervise the trading in securities by regulation and also power to super\u00advise the trading in securities during a primary distribution by requiring the filing of a prospectus. It is sufficient for the disposition of this appeal to indicate that subs. (1) of s. 38 prohibits a person or company from trading in any security issued by a mining company, where such trade would be in the course of a primary distribution to the public of such security, until there has been filed with the Commission a prospectus containing a full, true and plain disclosure relating to the security. Subsection (9) compels the filing of an amended prospectus where a change occurs during the period of primary distribution to the public in any material fact contained in any prospectus. Section 63 reads:\n63. (1) Every person, including any officer, director, official or employee of a company, who is knowingly responsible for,\n(a) any fictitious or pretended trade in any security;\n(b) any course of conduct or business which is calculated or put forward with intent to deceive the public or the purchaser or the vendor of any security as to the nature of any transaction or as to the value of such security;\n(c) the making of any material false statement in any application, information, statement, material or evidence submitted or given to the Commission, its representative, the registrar or any person appointed to make an investigation or audit under this Act, under this Act or the regulations;\n(d) the furnishing of false information in any report, statement, return, balance sheet or other document required to be filed or furnished under this Act or the regulations; (e) the commission of any act or failure to perform any act where such commission or failure constitutes a violation of any provision of this Act or the regulations; or\n(f) failure to observe or comply with any order, direction or other requirement made under this Act or the regulations,\nshall be guilty of an offence and on summary conviction shall be liable to a penalty of not more than $2,000 or to imprisonment for a term of not more than one year or both.\n(2) Subsection 1 shall be deemed to apply, mutatis mutandis, to any company save that the money penalties may be increased in the discretion of the magistrate to a sum of not more than $25,000.\n(3) Every person or company is a party to and guilty of an offence under this Act,\n(a) that actually commits the offence;\n(b) that does or omits an act for the purpose of aiding another person or company in the commission of the offence;\n(c) that abets another person or company in the commission of the offence; or\n(d) that counsels or procures another person or company to commit the offence.\n(4) Every person or company that counsels or procures another person or company to be a party to an offence under this Act of which that other person or company is afterwards guilty is a. party to that offence, although it may be committed in a way different from that which was counselled or procured.\n(5) Every person or company that counsels or procures another person or company to be a party to an offence under this Act is a party to every other offence under this Act which that other person or company commits in consequence of such counselling or procuring and which the person or company counselling or procuring knew, or ought to have known, to be likely to be committed in consequence of such counselling or procuring.\nThis section is not criminal law within Head 27 of s. 91 of the British North America Act, 1867, as it is not a provi\u00adsion the pith and substance of which is to prohibit an act with penal consequences. It is merely incidental to the main purpose and aim of the enactment. The words of Lord Atkin, speaking for the Judicial Committee in Lymburn v. Mayland[3], at p. 324, are particularly apt:\nThere was no reason to doubt that the main object sought to be secured in this part of the Act is to secure that persons who carry on the business of dealing in securities shall be honest and of good repute, and in this way to protect the public from being defrauded.\nThere is no repugnancy between s. 63 of The Securities Act and s. 343 of the Criminal Code. The latter reads:\n343. (1) Every one who makes, circulates or publishes a prospectus, statement or account, whether written or oral, that he knows is false in a material particular, with intent (a) to induce persons, whether ascertained or not, to become share-holders or partners in a company,\n(b) to deceive or defraud the members, shareholders or creditors, whether ascertained or not, of a company,\n(c) to induce any person to entrust or advance anything to a com\u00adpany, or\n(d) to enter into any security for the benefit of a company, is guilty of an indictable offence and is liable to imprisonment for ten years.\n(2) In this section, \"company\" means a syndicate, body corporate or company, whether existing or proposed to be created.\nThe purposes of the two enactments are entirely different. Counsel for the appellant argued that the word \"knowingly\" in subs. (1) of s. 63 of the Ontario Act indicated that the Legislature was encroaching upon the field of criminal law in its widest sense. However, it is not the same conduct being dealt with by the two legislative bodies. The word \"knowingly\" is really in ease of the provisions of The Securities Act. I agree with the submission of counsel for the respondent that the main purpose of the provincial enactment is to ensure the registration of persons and com\u00adpanies before they are permitted to trade in securities, coupled with what is essentially the registration of the securities themselves before the latter may be traded in the course of a primary distribution to the public. Par\u00adliament undoubtedly had power 'to enact s. 343 of the Criminal Code, but a prospectus may in one aspect and for one purpose be the subject of valid provincial legislation, while, in another aspect and for another purpose, it may be the subject of valid federal legislation: Provincial Sec\u00adretary of Prince Edward Island v. Egan[4]. Since the Prov\u00adincial Legislature has power to prescribe certain information to be supplied to the Commission and since the Legislature has power to provide for punishment of infractions, the enactments of the Legislature and of Parliament may co-exist. The remarks of Lord Atkin at pp. 326-327 of the report in Lymburn v. Mayland[5], mentioned by Hughes J., cannot apply to the problem before us:\nThe penal provisions of s. 14 have been subsequently incorporated into the Criminal Code of the Dominion by 20 & 21 Geo. 5, e. 11 (Canada), s. 5, which now presumably occupies the field so far as the criminal law is concerned. As appears from the reasons for judgment of Judson J. in O'Grady v. Sparling[6], with which I agree, the decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario in Regina v. Yolles[7] was approved, while the previous decision of that Court in Regina v. Dodd[8] was not.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs, but there should be no costs to or against the Attorney General of Canada or to or against the Attorney General of any of the Provinces.\nLOCKE J. (dissenting) :\u2014The question to be determined in this appeal is as to whether subss. (b), (d) and (e) of s. 63 of The Securities Act, R.S.O. 1950, c. 351, trespasses upon a field which is occupied by legislation duly enacted by Parliament under head 27 of s. 91 of the British North America Act.\nIt was not contended before Hughes J., nor was it contended before this Court, that the Securities Act, other than in respect of the penal provisions of s. 63, was ultra vires. The decision of the Judicial Committee in Lymburn v. Mayland[9] need not be considered, therefore, except that portion of the judgment delivered by Lord Atkin dealing with the criminal provisions of the Alberta legislation which are referred to at p. 327 of the report. To the extent that this is relevant to the present matter, it appears to be con\u00adtrary to the view advanced by the respondents in the present appeal.\nIt is necessary to determine the real object and purpose of s. 63, considered in its context, and it is of some assistance in arriving at a conclusion to examine the history of the legislation. The section reads in part:\nEvery person, including any officer, director, official or employee of a company, who is knowingly responsible for,\n(b) any course of conduct or business which is calculated or put forward with intent to deceive the public or the purchaser or the vendor of any security as to the nature of any transaction or as to the value of such security;\n(d) the furnishing of false information in any report, statement, return, balance sheet or other document required to be filed or furnished under this Act or the regulations; (e) the commission of any act or failure to perform any act where such commission or failure constitutes a violation of any provision of this Act or the regulations;\nshall be guilty of an offence and on summary conviction shall be liable to a penalty of not more than $2,000 or to imprisonment for a term of not more than one year or both.\nIn 1928, by c. 34, the legislature enacted the Security Frauds Prevention Act. The purpose of the legislation is indicated by its title; it was the protection of the public against fraud and fraudulent acts by brokers and other persons offering securities for sale of the nature defined in s. 2. Brokers and salesmen were prohibited by s. 3 from trading in securities unless they were registered in accordance with the requirements of the Act and applicants for registration were required to furnish bonds for the protec\u00adtion of persons dealing with them. Fraud was defined as including, inter alia, any intentional misrepresentation by word, conduct, or in any manner, of any material fact, either present or past, and any intentional omission to disclose any such fact, and generally any course of conduct or business calculated or put forward with intent to deceive the public or the purchaser of any security as to the value of such security. Section 16 of this Act provided that every person violating any provision of the Act or the regulations designated as an offence, or who does any fraudulent act not punishable under the provisions of the Criminal Code should be liable upon conviction under the Summary Con\u00advictions Act to a money penalty and to imprisonment.\nThe provisions of this statute and its name were changed and added to by various amendments between the years 1928 and 1950, when it appeared under the name of The Securities Act in the Revised Statutes of Ontario. Various amendments made since that date do not affect the present consideration.\nUnder the Act as it now is, brokers, investment dealers as defined, and persons issuing securities\u2014an expression defined to include bonds, debentures and shares\u2014are prohibited from trading unless they are registered with the Ontario Securities Commission, a body constituted under the provisions of the Act. Trading is defined as including any attempt to deal in, sell or dispose of a security for valuable consideration. Sections 38, 39 and 40 require respectively that before the securities of a mining company, an industrial company or an investment company may be offered for sale to the public, a prospectus signed by the directors or promoters of such companies giving the informa\u00adtion detailed in these sections must be accepted for filing by the commission. Part XI of the Act, consisting of sec\u00adtions 49 to 62, both inclusive, under the heading \"Provisions relating to Trading in Securities Generally\", contains further provisions designed for the protection of the public. These are followed by Part XII of the Act which includes s. 63 and it appears under 'the general heading \"Offences and Penalties\".\nSection 68(1) of the Act reads in part:\nWhere a prospectus has been accepted for filing by the Commission under this Act, every- purchaser of the securities to which the prospectus relates shall be deemed to have relied upon the representations made in. the prospectus whether the purchaser has received the prospectus or not and, if any material false statement is contained in the prospectus, every person who is a director of the company issuing the securities at the time of the issue of the prospectus, and every person who, having authorized such naming of him, is named in the prospectus as a director of the com\u00adpany ... shall be liable to pay compensation to all persons who have purchased the securities for any loss or damage such persons may have sustained.\nThe other provisions contained in Part XIII of the Act deal with general matters which are not relevant to the matters to be considered.\nIt will be seen from the foregoing that, as the original name of the Act implied, the purpose of this legislation is the protection of the public who purchase securities from fraudulent statements or acts which might induce such purchases. Sections 1 to 62 of the Act, both inclusive, to some of which reference has been made, contain provisions designed to ensure that the statements made by brokers and others engaged in the sale and distribution of shares, bonds, debentures or other securities, whether the same be in writing in the form of a prospectus or oral, relating to the security offered for sale shall be the truth and in accordance with the facts and provide the machinery designed to accomplish this purpose.\nI agree with my brother Cartwright that if the subject matter of the punishment of persons who induce others to purchase securities by false or fraudulent statements had not been dealt with in the Criminal Code, s. 63 of The Securities Act would be intra vires the legislature under head 15 of s. 92.\nThe punishment of directors or other persons who induce others to become members of a company by false or fraud\u00adulent statements has long been treated as an offence to be punished by fine or imprisonment. Section 84 of the Larceny Act, 24-25 Vict. (Imp.), e. 96, read:\nWhosoever, being a Director, Manager, or Public officer of any Body Corporate or Public Company, shall make, circulate, or publish, or concur in making, circulating, or publishing, any written Statement or Account which he shall know to be false in any material Particular, with Intent to deceive or defraud any Member, Shareholder, or Creditor of such Body Corporate or Public Company, or with Intent to induce any Person to become a Shareholder or Partner therein ... shall be guilty of a Misdemeanor, and being convicted thereof shall be liable, at the Discretion of the Court, to any of the Punishments which the Court may award as herein-before last mentioned.\nIn substantially this form these provisions were enacted as s. 85 of the Statutes of Canada for 1869 (c. 21). It appears that s. 343 of the Criminal Code replaces these provisions of the earlier legislation. That section reads in part:\nEvery one who makes, circulates or publishes a prospectus, statement or account, whether written or oral, that he knows is false in a material particular, with intent\n(a) to induce persons, whether ascertained or not, to become share-holders or partners in a company,\nis guilty of an indictable offence and is liable to imprisonment for ten years.\n(b) It will be seen that the offence described in s. 63 (1) (b) of The Securities Act if made with the intent, inter alia, to induce persons to become shareholders of a company is an offence under this section and is punishable as such.\nSection 406 of the Criminal Code reads in part:\nExcept where otherwise expressly provided by law, the following provisions apply in respect of persons who attempt to commit or are acces\u00adsories after the fact to the commission of offences, namely,\nevery one who attempts to commit or is an accessory after the fact to the commission of an indictable offence for which, upon conviction, an accused is liable to imprisonment for fourteen years or less, is guilty of an indictable offence and is liable to imprisonment for a term that is one-half of the longest term to which a person who is guilty of that offence is liable. In my opinion subss. (b), (d) and (e) directly trespass upon the field occupied by s. 343 of the Criminal Code. The requirement that the prospectus must be filed with the Commission is not, as has been said, merely to enable that body to determine whether or not the security may be offered for sale to the public\u2014that is of course one of the reasons\u2014but also to place on record a statement of the facts affecting the value of the security upon the faith of which purchasers are by virtue of s. 68 deemed to have purchased, whether or not they have read the prospectus or become aware of its terms. The application to the Commis\u00adsion to file the prospectus is a necessary step on the part of the trader to enable him to offer the security to the pub\u00adlic for sale and is made by him for this and for no other purpose.\nThe section does not purport to deal with innocent misrepresentations; it is only directed against persons who are knowingly responsible for the making of the false state\u00adments and this can only refer to fraudulent conduct on the part of the person charged. In the present matter the language of charges 1, 2 and 3 is that Smith was knowingly responsible for the furnishing of false information in a document.\nSince the whole purpose of the Act is the protection of the public from relying upon false information when purchasing securities, and that of s. 63 to declare criminal the act of making fraudulent misstatements in a prospectus designed for the purpose of inducing such purchases, there is in essence no difference between the offences created and those prohibited by s. 343 of the Criminal Code. The person applying to file a false prospectus must be taken to be aware of the terms of s. 68 of The Securities Act and is either publishing or attempting to publish the document within the meaning of s. 343 for the purpose and with the intent of inducing others to purchase the security offered upon the faith of the false statements.\nIn the present matter, as appears from the information, the prospectus was that of a mining company and was received for filing by the Commission and a receipt issued. The statements were, therefore, published and were so published with the intent to induce others to purchase the securities. Whether any of the securities were sold on the faith of the prospectus we are not informed.\nAccepting the statements in the information as being correct, while the appellant was not charged that he pub\u00adlished the prospectus with the intent to induce any person to become a shareholder in the company as must have been done had the charge been laid under s. 343 of the Criminal Code, he was charged with the very conduct which that section is designed to prohibit. If the publishing of the false prospectus to the Commission for the purpose and with the intent above mentioned was not in itself sufficient to constitute the offence referred to in s. 343, it was, in my opinion, an attempt to commit that offence within the meaning of s. 406 of the Code which I have mentioned above.\nIn Tennant v. Union Bank of Canada[10], Lord Watson, in discussing an apparent conflict between the Mercantile Amendment Act of Ontario and the Bank Act, said:\nStatutory regulations with respect to the form and legal effect, in Ontario, of warehouse receipts and other negotiable documents, which pass the property of goods without delivery, unquestionably relate to property and civil rights in that province; and the objection taken by the appellant to the provisions of the Bank Act would be unanswerable if it could be shewn that, by the Act of 1867, the Parliament of Canada is absolutely debarred from trenching to any extent upon the matters assigned to the provincial legislature by sect. 92. But sect. 91 expressly declares that, \"not-withstanding anything in this Act\", the exclusive legislative authority of the Parliament of Canada shall extend to all matters coming within the enumerated classes; which plainly indicates that the legislation of that Parliament, so long as it strictly relates to these matters, is to be of paramount authority.\nHere Parliament, under the powers vested in it by head 27 of s. 91, has declared to be criminal, and provided the penalty for, the publishing of false statements, whether written or oral, which are known to be false in a material part with the intent to induce others to purchase securities, and by s. 406 has also rendered criminal an attempt to do so. The offences dealt with in s. 63 in The Securities Act, for the reasons above stated, trespass upon the exclusive jurisdiction of Parliament in this field and are accordingly, in my opinion, ultra vires. No one could, of course, suggest that there is any doubt as to the jurisdiction of Parliament in the matter and it is not within the powers of the Legisla\u00adture to deal with offences of the same nature by penal legislation to supplement or vary the penalties prescribed by the Code.\nAs the report shows, the main question considered by the Judicial Committee in Lymburn v. Mayland[11] was as to whether the Security Frauds Prevention Act, apart from its criminal provisions, was intra vires, and it is only at the conclusion of the reasons delivered that any mention is made of s. 20 which made it an offence to commit any fraudulent act not punishable under the Criminal Code. Considering the Act as a whole, Lord Atkin said that there was no ground for holding that the Act was a colourable attempt to infringe upon the exclusive legislative power of the Dominion as to criminal law. There is, of course, in the present matter no such contention advanced by the appellant. As to s. 20 the judgment reads (p. 327) :\nIt is said that this encroaches on the exclusive legislative power of the Dominion as to criminal law. Having regard to the wide definition of \"fraudulent act\" above referred to, it may well be that this argument is well founded. But so far as the section is invalid it appears to be clearly severable.\nThis appears to indicate, without deciding the point, that the section in question was beyond provincial powers, a conclusion inconsistent with the arguments addressed to us in this matter on behalf of the respondent.\nI have had the advantage of reading, and I agree with, the judgment to be delivered by my brother Cartwright in this matter and would allow this appeal, set aside the order of the Court of Appeal and restore the order of Hughes J.\nCARTWRIGHT J. (dissenting) :\u2014This appeal is brought, pursuant to leave granted by this Court, from a unanimous judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[12], quashing an order of prohibition made by Hughes J. directed to His Worship Magistrate Prentice or such other Justices as might be in Magistrate's Court in the City of Toronto prohibiting them from further proceeding with an informa\u00adtion charging the appellant with offences under The Securities Act, R.S.O. 1950, c. 351, hereinafter referred to as \"the Act\". The information in question contained the following four counts:\n(1) That Lyle Francis Smith, formerly of the City of Toronto in the County of York, being a director of Canadian All Metals Explorations Limited, between the 13th day of January, 1955, and the 13th day of April, 1955, in the County of York and elsewhere in the Province of Ontario, was knowingly responsible for the furnishing of false information in a docu\u00adment, namely a prospectus for Canadian All Metals Explorations Limited dated the 4th day of March, 1955, submitted to the Ontario Securities Commission by Canadian All Metals Explorations Limited, pursuant to subsection 1 of Section 38 of The Securities Act, and for which a receipt was issued by the Registrar of the Ontario Securities Commission on. April 12th, 1955, which prospectus was required to be filed pursuant to subsection 1 of Section 38 of The Securities Act, contrary to the provisions of Section 63 of The Securities Act, R.S.O. 1950, c. 351, and Amendments thereto.\n(2) AND FURTHER that the said LYLE FRANCIS SMITH, being a director of Canadian All Metals Explorations Limited, between the 12th day of April, 1955, and the 28th day of September, 1955, in the County of York in the Province of Ontario was knowingly responsible for the furnish\u00ading of false information in a document, namely, an Amendment dated the 8th day of September, 1955, to the prospectus of Canadian All Metals Explorations Limited dated the 4th day of March, 1955, submitted to the Ontario Securities Commission pursuant to subsection 9 of Section 38 of The Securities Act, and for which a receipt was issued by the Registrar of the Ontario Securities Commission on the 27th day of September, 1955, which Amendment was required to be filed pursuant to subsection 9 of Section 38 of The Securities Act, contrary to the provisions of Section 63 of The Securities Act, R.S.O. 1950, c. 351, and Amendments thereto.\n(3) AND FURTHER that the said LYLE FRANCIS SMITH being a director of Canadian All Metals Explorations Limited, between the 12th day of April, 1955 and the 15th day of October, 1955, in the County of York and elsewhere in the Province of Ontario was knowingly responsible for the furnishing of false information in a document, namely an Amendment dated the 3rd day of October, 1955, to the prospectus of Canadian All Metals Explorations Limited dated the 4th day of March, 1955, submitted to the Ontario Securities Commission, pursuant to subsection 9 of Sec\u00adtion 38 of The Securities Act, and for which a receipt was issued by the Registrar of the Ontario Securities Commission on October 14th, 1955, which Amendment was required to be filed pursuant to subsection 9 of Section 38 of The Securities Act, contrary to the provisions of Section 63 of The Securities Act, R.S.O. 1950, c. 351 and Amendments thereto.\n(4) AND FURTHER that the said LYLE FRANCIS SMITH, being a director of Canadian All Metals Explorations Limited, between the 13th day of January, 1955, and the 14th day of February, 1956, in the County of York and elsewhere in the Province of Ontario, was knowingly respon\u00adsible for failure to perform certain acts where such failure constituted a violation of subsection 1 of Section 38 of The Securities Act, R.S.O. 1950, c. 351, and Amendments thereto, in that the said LYLE FRANCIS SMITH, being a director of Canadian All Metals Explorations Limited, between the 13th day of January, 1955, and the 14th day of February, 1956, in the County of York and elsewhere in the Province of Ontario, was knowingly responsible for trading by Canadian All Metals Explorations Limited, on its own account, in securities issued by a mining company, namely Canadian All Metals Explorations Limited, where such trading was in the course of a primary distribution to the public of such securities, without filing with the Ontario Securities Commission, and without obtaining a receipt therefor from the Registrar of the Ontario Securities Commission, a prospectus containing full, true and plain disclosure relating to the securi\u00adties issued by the said Canadian All Metals Explorations Limited and setting forth the information required to be given by clauses (i), (j), (o), (q), and (u) of subsection 1 of Section 38 of The Securities Act contrary to Sub-Section 1 of Section 38 and Section 63 of The Securities Act, R.S.O. 1950, chapter 351 and amendments thereto.\nSection 38 (1) of the Act, which is referred to in counts (1) and (4) of the information, is as follows:\n38(1) No person or company shall trade in any security issued by a mining company either on his or its own account or on behalf of any other person or company where such trade would be in the course of a primary distribution to the public of such security until there has been filed with the Commission a prospectus, and a receipt therefor obtained from the registrar, which prospectus shall be dated and signed by every person who is, at the time of filing, a director or promoter of the mining company issuing the security or an underwriter or optionee of such security, and which prospectus shall contain a full, true and plain disclosure relating to the security issued and shall set forth.\n(There follow 23 clauses lettered from (a) to (w), several of which contain sub-clauses, setting out in detail the mat\u00adters required to be disclosed)\nClauses (i), (j), (o), (q) and (u), which are referred to in count (4) of the information are as follows:\n(i) the shares sold for cash to date tabulated under each class of shares as follows:\n(i) the number of shares sold, separately listed as to price,\n(ii) the total cash received for the shares sold, and\n(iii) the commissions paid on the sale of the shares;\n(j) the particulars of securities, other than shares, sold for cash to date as follows:\n(i) the securities sold,\n(ii) the total cash received for the securities sold, and\n(iii) the commissions paid on the sale of the securities;\n(o) the details of future development and exploration plans of the management showing how it is proposed to expend the proceeds from current sales of securities;\n(q) the amount and general description of any indebtedness to be created or assumed, which is not shown in a balance sheet filed with the Commission, and also particulars of the security, if any, given or to be given for such indebtedness;\n(u) any other material facts not disclosed in the foregoing; Section 38(9) of the Act, which is referred to in counts (2) and (3) of the information, is as follows:\n(9) Where a change occurs during the period of primary distribution to the public in any material fact contained in any prospectus, financial statement or report accepted for filing under this section, which is of such a nature as to render such prospectus, financial statement or report misleading, an amended prospectus, financial statement or report shall be filed within twenty days from the date the change occurs but, subject to any direction of the Commission, the amended prospectus shall be required to be signed only by the signatories to the original prospectus and where any change in directors, promoters, underwriters or optionees has occurred since the filing of the original prospectus the decision of the Commission as to who shall be required to sign the amended prospectus or as to any like matter shall be final.\nSection 63 of the Act, which is referred to in all of the counts, is set out in the reasons of the Chief Justice.\nIt is clear that each count charges an offence created by the Act, that in count (1) by the combined effect of s. 38(1) and s. 63(1) (d), those in counts (2) and (3) by the com\u00adbined effect of s. 38(9) and s. 63(1) (d), and that in count (4) by the combined effect of s. 38(1) and s. 63(1)(e); and the questions are (i) whether, in the absence of con\u00adflicting legislation by Parliament, it is within the power of the Legislature to create these offences, and (ii) whether the provisions creating them are so far in conflict with existing provisions of the Criminal Code as to be inoperative. The question whether the provisions of the Act other than those mentioned in this paragraph are intra vires of the legislature arises only in connection with Mr. Thomson's argument that certain provisions of s. 63 other than those contained in s. 63(1) (d) and (e) are ultra vires and that the section is inseverable.\nIt was decided in Rex v. Nat Bell Liquors[13], that where a provincial Act imposes penalties for enforcing a law of the Province made in relation to any matter coming within any of the classes of subjects enumerated in s. 92 of the British North America Act, proceedings to enforce such penalties are proceedings in a criminal cause in the sense in which the word \"criminal\" is used in what is now s. 40 of the Supreme Court Act, although the provincial Act creating the offence is not legislation in relation to \"the criminal law\" in the sense in which that term is used in head 27 of s. 91 of the British North America Act.\nThe appellant does not contend that the Act as a whole is invalid. Viewed in the constitutional aspect it does not differ essentially from the Security Frauds Prevention Act, 1930, of Alberta, the validity of which was asserted by the Judicial Committee in Ly'inburn v. Mayland[14].\nIn my opinion, it was rightly conceded that the provisions of s. 38 with which we are concerned are prima facie within the powers of the legislature. Their effect is (i) to prohibit persons from trading in any security issued by a mining company where such trade would be in the course of a primary distribution to the public until there has been filed with the Commission a prospectus containing full, true and plain disclosure of certain specified information, and a receipt therefor has been obtained from the Registrar, and (ii) to require the filing of an amended prospectus where a material change occurs during the period of primary dis\u00adtribution. These provisions are an integral part of a law providing for the regulation of the sale of securities in the province with a view to protecting the public from being defrauded; one of their purposes and effects is to ensure that the 'Commission shall receive true factual information of the sort necessary to enable it to perform this function of regulation; but, as is pointed out by Hughes J., by virtue of ss. 47 and 47a of the Act, the prospectus required by s. 38(1) to be filed with the Commission will find its way in the form in which it is filed into the hands of members of the public who have been invited to buy the shares of the mining company involved, and consequently, another of the purposes and effects of s. 38(1) read with ss. 47 and 47a is to require that prospective purchasers shall be given a copy of a true prospectus.\nThe main arguments of the appellant are (i) that those provisions of the Act the combined effect of which is to create the four offences with which the appellant is charged are inoperative because they are in conflict with the provisions of s. 343 of the Criminal Code; and (ii) that provisions of s. 63 other than clauses (d) and (e) of subs. (1) are invalid and, whether or not they are severable, disclose the intention of the Legislature to invade the field of the criminal law reserved to Parliament by head 27 of s. 91.\nAs to the first of these arguments, it will be observed that the offences with which the appellant is charged may be briefly described as follows:\n(1), being knowingly responsible for the furnishing of false information in a prospectus filed with the Com\u00admission the filing of which was required by s. 38(1) of the Act;\n(2) and (3), being knowingly responsible for furnishing false information in two documents amending the said prospectus filed with the Commission the filing of which was required by s. 38(9) of the Act;\n(4), being knowingly responsible for trading by the mining company on behalf of which the prospectus was filed in securities issued by it when such trading was in the course of a primary distribution to the public of such securities without filing with the Commission a true prospectus as required by s. 38(1).\nAs to count (4) it is obvious from reading the other counts that what is alleged against the appellant is not that no prospectus had been filed when the trading took place but that the prospectus and amendments which were filed contained false information.\nIt may well be that on an application for prohibition the Court cannot interpret the meaning of an ambiguous count by reference to the other counts in the same information. If what is intended to be charged in count (4) is that the appellant was knowingly responsible for trading in the man\u00adner described when no prospectus had been filed at all other considerations would arise and it is my tentative view that it would be intra vires of the Legislature to make it an offence to trade under such circumstances. It is also, I think, questionable whether an application for prohibition was the appropriate remedy as the learned Magistrate would seem to have had jurisdiction to decide the question whether the provisions of the Act on which the four counts are based were ultra vires of the Legislature. However, these procedural matters were not raised before us and all counsel sought a decision on the constitutional questions which were so fully dealt with in the courts below. I propose therefore to deal with the case on the assumption that the meaning of count (4) is that which I have indicated in the preceding paragraph of these reasons.\nIn approaching the question whether the alleged conflict exists, it is necesary [sic] to consider what are the essential mat\u00adters which the prosecution would have to establish to prove the commission of the offences charged.\nAs to count (1) these would be:\u2014(i) that a prospectus was filed with the Commission for Canadian All Metals Explorations Limited, hereinafter referred to as \"the Com\u00adpany\"; (ii) that the company was a mining company; (iii) that the prospectus contained false information; and (iv) that the appellant was knowingly responsible for furnishing the false information.\nAs to counts (2) and (3) the matters to be proved would be the same as in the case of count (1) mutatis mutandis having regard to the fact that the false informa\u00adtion was contained not in an original prospectus but in amendments thereto.\nAs to count (4) the matters to be proved would be:\u2014(i) that the company was a mining company; (ii) that the company had traded on its own account in securities issued by it in the course of the primary distribution to the public of such securities; (iii) that at the time of such trading there had not been filed a prospectus containing full, true and plain disclosure of the matters required to be disclosed by the clauses of s. 38(1) specified in the count; and (iv) that the appellant was knowingly responsible for the mat\u00adters stated in (ii) and (iii).\nThe relevant portions of s. 343 of the Criminal Code are as follows :\n343. (1) Every one who makes, circulates or publishes a prospectus, statement or account, whether written or oral, that he knows is false in a material particular, with intent\n(a) to induce persons, whether ascertained or not, to become share-holders ... in a company, ...\nis guilty of an indictable offence and is liable to imprisonment for ten years.\nTo make a case under this section based on the facts which are alleged against the appellant, it would be neces\u00adsary for the prosecution to allege in the information and to prove not only that the person charged had been knowingly responsible for the making of a material false statement in the prospectus, but also, that this was done with intent to induce persons, whether ascertained or not, to become share-holders in the company; in the case of none of the four counts with which the appellant is charged would it be necessary for the prosecution to prove the existence of such an intention; the existence of this difference is one of the primary reasons which brought the Court of Appeal to the conclusion that the legislation creating the offences with which the appellant is charged is not in conflict with s. 343 of the Criminal Code.\nThis difference appears to me to be apparent rather than real. Subsections (1) and (9) of s. 38 of the Act are concerned with one activity only, i.e., the trading in securities issued by a mining company where such trade would be in the course of a primary distribution to the public of such securities; the subsections only come into operation when some person or company proposes to endeavour to make such a distribution; they require the person or company so proposing to file a true prospectus as specified; it is difficult to imagine a situation in which any person or company would proceed to file a prospectus under s. 38 unless it intended to attain the end of having members of the public purchase the shares to which the prospectus relates, that is to say, intended to induce persons, probably as yet unascertained, to become shareholders in a company. Having regard to the presumption that a person intends the natural consequences of his acts it would seem that proof of the allegations contained in any of the counts in the information would constitute a prima facie case under s. 343(1) (a) of the Criminal Code.\nMoreover, s. 68(1) of the Act provides in part as follows:\nWhere a prospectus has been accepted for filing by the Commission under this Act, every purchaser of the securities to which the prospectus relates shall be deemed to have relied upon the representations made in the prospectus whether the purchaser has received the prospectus or not ....\nThere does not appear to me to be any realistic distinction between making a statement with intent that it shall be relied upon by persons before they become shareholders in the company and making a statement \"with intent to induce\" those persons to become shareholders. The other primary reason on which the judgment of the Court of Appeal appears to me to be based is expressed as follows by Porter C.J.O.:\nThe object of this section (i.e. s. 343 of the Criminal Code) is different from that of the sections of The Securities Act in issue here. The objective of this section of the Criminal Code is to make a criminal offence of fraud upon shareholders and certain other persons in certain dealings with com\u00adpanies. The provincial sections are confined to information to be supplied to the Securities Commission to carry out in part the general purpose of the Securities Act, viz., to regulate the manner in which the business of selling securities should be conducted, and to prevent frauds upon the public. The pith and substance of these sections of The Securities Act is to assure full disclosure prior to dealings with the public.\nWith respect, I find myself unable to agree with this view, because as is pointed out by Hughes J., when s. 38 is read in the context of the rest of the Act and particularly ss. 47 and 47a, it is plain that the detailed information which s. 38 requires shall be truthfully given is intended and, indeed, required to be placed before those members of the public to whom the shares are offered. I can find no escape from the conclusion expressed by Hughes J. in the following passage :\nI think it is clear, taking into account the meaning of the word pros\u00adpectus and the effect of Sections 38(1), 47 and 47a taken together with 63(1) that the Province has attempted to punish by fine, imprisonment or both a course of conduct which is so similar to that condemned by Sec\u00adtion 343 of the Criminal Code of Canada as to create an inconsistency or conflict. The Dominion legislation must therefore prevail and, as a result, I find that it is not within the competence of the Legislature of Ontario to create the offences contemplated by the application of Section 63(1) (d) and (e) to the provisions of Section 38(1) and (9) of The Securities Act...\nIf the judgment of the Court of Appeal stands, it will bring about the result that a person who is alleged to have committed the offence described in s. 343(1) (a) of the Code may, at the option of the Crown, be charged on the same facts not under the Code but under the Act and thereby be deprived of the right to be tried by a jury.\nThe agreement with the view of Hughes J. which I have expressed above renders it unnecessary for me to deal with the second main argument of Mr. Thomson, as to the pro-visions of s. 63 of the Act other than clauses (d) and (e) of subs. (1). I think it desirable, however, to say that in my opinion any provisions of s. 63 which may be found to be in conflict with provisions of the Criminal Code would be severable from the remainder of the section. I wish also to make it clear that I share the opinion of Hughes J. and of the Court of Appeal that the impugned provisions of the Act standing alone would be valid. It is only because of my agreement with the view of Hughes J. that they conflict with the provisions of s. 343 of the Criminal Code that I reach the conclusion that they are inoperative to create the offences with which the appellant is charged.\nIn the result, I would allow the appeal, set aside the order of the Court of Appeal and restore the order of Hughes J.; the appellant is entitled to recover his costs in the Court of Appeal and in this Court from the informant; I would make no order as to the costs of the Attorneys General.\nThe judgment of Abbott, Martland and Judson JJ. was delivered by\nMARTLAND J.:\u2014The circumstances which gave rise to this appeal are set forth in the reasons of the Chief Justice and of my brother Cartwright. The question in issue is as to whether or not it was within the competency of the Legislature of Ontario to create the offences contemplated by the application of s. 63(1) (d) and (e) to the provisions of s. 38(1) and (9) of The Securities Act, R.S.O. 1950, c. 351. There is no need for me to repeat here those provisions.\nThere would appear to be unanimity of view that the provisions of s. 38 of that Act are prima facie within the powers of the Legislature. The sole issue is as to whether the paragraphs of s. 63 above mentioned are in conflict with the provisions of s. 343 of the Criminal Code so as to make them inoperative.\nThe Securities Act exists to regulate the securities busi\u00adness. This is achieved through two main forms of control, the first of which is directed towards the persons or com\u00adpanies selling the securities and the second of which is directed to the securities being sold.\nTrading in securities without registration is prohibited by s. 6 of the Act. The duty to grant registration and the power to refuse, suspend or cancel such registration are im\u00adposed upon and vested in the Commission by s. 7 and s. 8 of The Securities Act. Trading in securities in the course of a primary distribu\u00adtion of such securities to the public is prohibited by ss. 38, 39 and 40 of The Securities Act unless certain prerequisites, which vary somewhat depending on whether the company whose securities are being offered is a mining, industrial or investment company, are first completed in accordance with the relevant section. Each of the sections requires that a prospectus first be submitted to the Commission making \"full, true and plain disclosure\" relating to the securities which it is proposed to offer containing the information stipulated in the section. The Commission, under s. 44 of The Securities Act, in its discretion, may accept the pros\u00adpectus submitted to it for filing and direct the Registrar to issue the receipt referred to in ss. 38, 39 and 40, unless it appears that one of the circumstances set out in s. 44 exists. In such a case it is implicit that the Commission is under a duty not to accept the material and forthwith to give the notice provided for by s. 45. The equivalent of s. 8, which provides for suspension or cancellation of existing registrations, is s. 46 which empowers the Com\u00admission, where it discovers that any of the circumstances in s. 44 exist following the issuance of a receipt for the prospectus by the Registrar, to order that all trading in the primary distribution to the public of the securities to which the prospectus relates shall cease.\nThus control is exercised through the registration of persons and companies before they are permitted to trade in securities coupled with what is essentially the registration of the securities themselves before the securities may be traded in the course of a primary distribution to the public.\nThe important feature of ss. 38, 39 and 40 is that, in addition to requiring that a prospectus filed with the Commission shall contain a true, full and plain disclosure relating to the securities proposed to be issued, it is also required that the prospectus shall set forth the specific, detailed information required in each of these sections and shall be accompanied by certain additional material, in\u00adcluding financial statements. Unless the material required by these sections is filed with and accepted by the Com\u00admission, there can be no lawful trading in the securities in question in the course of a primary distribution. If the material required to be furnished to the Com\u00admission under these sections is accepted by it and a receipt issued, then, and only then, ss. 47 and 47a come into operation and require that a copy of the prospectus and of the financial statements filed with the Commission shall come into the hands of the members of the public who are invited to buy the securities involved. This requirement is not only to compel the furnishing to such persons of a prospectus which is true, but also that it must be one which gives the detailed information regarding the affairs of the company which is required to be furnished to the Commission itself under ss. 38, 39 and 40.\nThe scheme of these sections of the act is, therefore, to prevent trading in securities in the course of primary distri\u00adbution until the Commission has received all the informa\u00adtion required by the Act and has accepted such material for filing, and then to ensure that persons who are asked to subscribe for such securities shall have all the information which the Commission itself has received.\nThe purpose of these sections is, of course, defeated if the information is untrue and, in my opinion, the Legislature has the power to require that this information shall be true and to penalize persons who furnish false information, or who fail to comply with the requirements of the Act.\nIt does not appear to me that there is a conflict between s. 63(1) (d) and (e) and s. 343 of the Criminal Code. The latter provision makes it an offence to make, circulate or publish a prospectus known to be false in a material particular with intent to induce persons to become share-holders in a company. This section deals with a false statement in a material particular deliberately made in order to persuade someone to subscribe for shares in a company. The section, of course, has nothing to say as to what the contents of a prospectus must be.\nSection 63(1) (d) and (e), on the other hand, is designed to penalize a person who, required as he is, by the provi\u00adsions of the Act, to furnish full, detailed information about the company whose securities are sought to be sold, is knowingly responsible for the incorporation in that material of information which is false. A good deal of that informa\u00adtion might never be incorporated in a prospectus at all unless the Act had required it. Paragraph (d) is not limited to falsity of the prospectus \"in a material particular\", but applies to any information required to be furnished under the Act. It affects any one who is knowingly responsible for the furnishing of the information, whether he personally is interested in the marketing of the securities or not; for example, the engineer, geologist or prospector who furnishes the report on the property of a mining company under subs. (2) of s. 38, or the auditor who furnishes a report pursuant to subs. (8a) of that section.\nThe test to be applied in cases of this kind is that which was stated by Duff C. J. in The Provincial Secretary of the Province of Prince Edward Island v. Egan[15]:\nIn. every case where a dispute arises, the precise question must be whether or not the matter of the provincial legislation that is challenged is so related to the substance of the Dominion criminal legislation as to be brought within the scope of criminal law in the sense of section 91. If there is repugnancy between the provincial enactment and the Dominion enactment, the provincial enactment is, of course, inoperative.\nFor the reasons already given, I do not think that the matter of the provincial legislation in question here is so related in substance to s. 343 of the Criminal Code as to be brought within the scope of criminal law in the sense of s. 91 of the British North America Act. I do not think there is repugnancy between s. 63(1) (d) and (e) of The Securities Act and s. 343 of the Criminal Code. The fact that both provisions prohibit certain acts with penal consequences does not constitute a conflict. It may happen that some acts might be punishable under both provisions and in this sense that these provisions overlap. However, even in such cases, there is no conflict in the sense that compliance with one law involves breach of the other. It would appear, therefore, that they can operate concurrently.\nI do not think that the views expressed by Lord Atkin in Lymburn v. Mayland[16], with reference to s. 20 of The Security Frauds Prevention Act, 1930 (Alta.), c. 8, are adverse to the conclusion which I have reached.\nSection 20(1) of that Act provided, in part, as follows:\n20. (1) Every person who violates any provision of this Act or the Regulations designated as an offence, or who does any fraudulent act not punishable under the provisions of The Criminal Code of Canada, shall be liable upon summary conviction thereof to a penalty ... . Referring to this section, at p. 327 of the report, Lord Atkin said:\nIt is said that this encroaches on the exclusive legislative power of the Dominion as to criminal law. Having regard to the wide definition of \"fraudulent act\" above referred to, it may well be that this argument is well founded. But so far as the section is invalid it appears to be clearly severable.\nIt will be noted that the portion of s. 20 to which he directed his attention was not that which imposed a penalty for the violation of the Act, or of the Regulations, but the general provision relating to \"any fraudulent act not punishable under the provisions of The Criminal Code of Canada\". This wide provision might, as he indicated, have gone beyond the imposing of a penalty for enforcing a provincial law. The provisions of s. 63(1) (d) and (e) of the Ontario Act do not offend in that way.\nIn my opinion, therefore, the appeal should be dismissed with costs, but there should be no costs to or against the Attorney General of Canada nor the Attorneys General of any of the provinces.\nRITCHIE J. (dissenting) :\u2014I agree with Hughes J. and with the views expressed in the reasons for judgment of Locke and Cartwright JJ. which I have had the benefit of reading that although the impugned provisions of the Ontario Securities Act would be valid if they stood alone, they have the combined effect when read in the context of the statute as a whole of creating an offence which is sub\u00adstantially the same as that for which provision is made by s. 343 of the Criminal Code and to that extent they are inoperative. In this respect this case is, in my opinion, basically different from that of O'Grady v. Sparling[17].\nI am also of opinion that although the specific \"intent to induce persons... to become shareholders of a company\" which is required under the provisions of s. 343 of the Criminal Code is not expressly stated to be one of the ingredients of the offences created by the combined effect of s. 63(1) (d) and (e), s. 38(1) and s. 38(9) of The Securities Act, it is nevertheless implicit in the latter provisions that such an intent must form a part of the offences thereby created. This factor, in my view, distinguishes the present case from that of Stephens v. The Queen[18]. The provisions of ss. 63(1), 38(1), 38(9) and 68(1) of The Securities Act and ss. 343 and 406 of the Criminal Code are set out in the reasons of other members of this Court.\nThe first three counts of the information here in question which are fully reproduced in the reasons of Cartwright J. all charge the appellant with being\n... knowingly responsible for the furnishing of false information in a document ... submitted to the Ontario Securities Commission ... pursuant to\ns. 38 of The Securities Act \"and for which a receipt was issued by the Registrar of the Ontario Securities Com\u00admission.\" (The italics are mine.)\nIt seems to me that under the provisions of The Secu\u00adrities Act, whether the document be a prospectus as charged in the first count or an amendment to a prospectus as charged in the second and third counts, the information furnished to the Commission in such a document takes on a very different character and significance after it has been accepted for filing and a receipt therefor has been issued by the Registrar than it bore before it was so accepted.\nBefore the prospectus or amendment is accepted for filing by the Commission, although it is true that the information therein contained is being furnished for the purpose and with the intention of qualifying the shares or other securities to which it relates for trading by way of primary distribution to the public, it is nevertheless only being furnished to the Commission and not, at this stage, to the public, and if the Commission becomes aware that any of it is false it can refuse to file the prospectus in which case no trading in the securities can take place and the public will not be exposed to the consequences of being misled by the information (see Securities Act, ss. 44 and 45).\nAfter the prospectus has been accepted for filing by the Commission the information therein contained ceases to be simply a matter between the person who supplies it and the Commission and it becomes information which is re\u00adquired to be delivered to, and deemed to be relied upon by, all persons before they become shareholders in the company to which it relates (see ss. 47 and 47(a) referred to in the judgment of Hughes J. and s. 68(1) of The Securities Act). It is to be observed that the document which is required by ss. 47 and 47(a) to be delivered to every purchaser of shares before confirmation of sale is \"a copy of the pro\u00adspectus or amended prospectus, whichever 'is the last filed with the Commission\" (the italics are mine) and the open\u00ading words of s. 68(1) state clearly that it is only in cases \"where a prospectus has been accepted for filing by the Commission\" (the italics are mine) that \"every purchaser of the securities to which the prospectus relates shall be deemed to have relied upon the representations made in the prospectus...\".\nIn considering the true meaning and effect to be attached to the language of s. 38(1) of The Securities Act which is reproduced in the decision of Cartwright J., it is worthy of note that the words \"trade\" or \"trading\" as used in the statute include \"any solicitation for or obtaining of a subscription to... a security for valuable consideration...\" (see Securities Act, s. 1(t)).\nIt is to be noted that the \"false information\" referred to in the present charges is information required to be furnished pursuant to ss. 38(1) and 38(9) of The Securities Act, and in my view the particulars required by these sec\u00adtions are material particulars, at least in the sense that no trading can take place in the securities to which they relate unless they are so furnished. The second and third counts lodged against the appellant each relate to \"an amendment\" submitted pursuant to s. 38(9) and it is pointed out that under the terms of that subsection such an amendment only becomes necessary\nWhere a change occurs during the period of primary distribution to the public in any material fact contained in any prospectus, financial statement or report accepted for filing\u2026.\nThe present appellant is not merely charged with being \"knowingly responsible for the furnishing of false informa\u00adtion submitted to the Ontario Securities Commission\" and it is not necessary to express an opinion as to the validity of such a charge.\nWhat the appellant is here charged with is being know\u00adingly responsible for the furnishing of false information in a prospectus and amendments submitted pursuant to s. 38(1) or s. 38(9) for which a receipt was issued by the Registrar indicating that it had been accepted for filing and, in my opinion, this, in effect, means that he is charged with being responsible for having knowingly made a ma\u00adterial false statement which is to be used for soliciting other persons to become shareholders of the company to which it relates and which is to be relied upon by all purchasers of such shares.\nAs this offence seems to me to be in substance the same as that of making\n... a statement ... that he knows is false in a material particular, with intent ... to induce persons ... to become shareholders in a company\nand as this is the language of s. 343 of the Crimnal [sic] Code, I am of opinion, as I have indicated, that there is a direct conflict between the impugned provisions of the provincial statute and those of the Criminal Code and that it is not within the competence of the Legislature of Ontario to create the offences here in question.\nIn reaching this conclusion, I am mindful of the language used by Sir Lyman Duff in Provincial Secretary of Prince Edward Island v. Egan', where he said:\nIt is, of course, beyond dispute that where an offence is created by competent Dominion legislation in exercise of the authority under sec\u00adtion 91(27), the penalty or penalties attached to that offence, as well as the offence itself, become matters within that paragraph of section 91 which are excluded from provincial jurisdiction.\nI would allow the appeal and restore the order of Hughes J.\nAppeal dismissed with costs, Locke, Cartwright and Ritchie JJ. dissenting.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Langille & Thomson, Toronto.\nSolicitor for the respondent: H.

The accused being charged under s. 55(1) of the Manitoba Highway Traffic Act with driving without due care and attention moved for an order of prohibition on the ground that s. 55(1) was ultra vires because it was legislation in relation to criminal law, and also, because the subject-matter of the section fell within the paramount jurisdiction of Parliament, which had occupied the field by the enactment of s. 221 of the Criminal Code. The motion was dismissed at trial, and this dismissal was affirmed on appeal. Pursuant to the granting of special leave the accused appealed to this Court.\nHeld (Locke and Cartwright JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be dismissed.\nPer Kerwin C.J. and Taschereau, Fauteux, Abbott, Martland, Judson and Ritchie JJ.: A provincial enactment does not become a matter of criminal law merely because it consists of a prohibition and makes it an offence for failure to observe the prohibition. Section 55(1) of The Highway Traffic Act has for its true object, purpose, nature or character the regulation of traffic on highways and is valid provincial legislation.\nThere is no conflict or repugnancy between this section and s. 221 of the Criminal Code. The provisions of the two sections deal with different subject-matters and are for different purposes; s. 55(1) is highway legislation dealing with regulation and control of traffic on highways, and s. 221 is criminal law dealing with \"advertent negligence\". Even though a particular case may be within both provisions that does not mean that there is conflict so as to render s. 55(1) suspended or inoperative.\nParliament has defined \"advertent negligence\" as a crime under ss. 191(1) and 221(1) of the Code. It has not touched \"inadvertent negligence\", which is dealt with under the provincial legislation in relation to the regulation of highway traffic.\nRegina v. Yolles, [1959] O.R. 206, approved; Lord's Day Alliance of Canada v. Atty.-Gen. of British Columbia et al., [1959] S.C.R. 497, applied; Andrews v. Director of Public Prosecutions, [1937] A.C. 576; Provincial Secretary of P.E.L v. Egan, [1941] S.C.R. 396; Quong-Wing v. The King, (1914) 49 S.C.R. 440; McColl v. Canadian Pacific Railway Co., [1923] A.C. 126; R. v. Corry 26 Alta. L.R. 390; R. v. Dodd, [1957] O.R. 5, R. v. Mankow, (1959) 28 W.W.R. 433; R. v. Stephens, (1959-60) 30 W.W.R. 145, referred to.\nPer Locke and Cartwright JJ., dissenting: While the types of negligence dealt with in the two enactments differ, the true nature and character of the legislation contained in s. 55(1) of the Act does not differ in kind from the legislation contained in ss. 191(1) and 221(1) of the Code. Each enactment makes negligence a crime although one deals with inadvertent negligence and the other with advertent negligence. The provisions of s. 55(1), if enacted by Parliament as part of the Criminal Code, would clearly be a law in relation to the criminal law within the meaning of head 27 of s. 91 of the British North America Act. The impugned sub-section differs generically from those provisions of the Act prescribing detailed rules of conduct.\nThere is no room for the view that s. 55(1) is intra vires because it operates in an otherwise unoccupied field, for the field which the impugned legislation seeks to enter is one reserved exclusively for Parliament by head 27 of s. 91. Assuming that s. 55(1) has a provincial aspect, which in fact it does not have, the view that it would be valid under the \"overlapping doctrine\" until Parliament occupies the field in which it operates cannot be accepted, for Parliament has by necessary implication fully occupied the field. Parliament has expressed that a certain kind or degree of negligence shall be punishable as a crime, and it follows that it has decided that no less culpable kind or degree of negligence shall be so punishable. The provincial legislature cannot remedy what it regards as defects or omissions in the criminal law as enacted by Parliament.\nRegina v. Yolles, supra; Provincial Secretary of P.E.I. v.

The King, [1917] A.C. 630, referred to.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba1, dismissing an appeal from the judgment of Williams C.J.K.B. Appeal dismissed, Locke and Cartwright JJ. dissenting.\nH. P. Blackwood, Q.C., and S. Paikin, Q.C., for the appellant.\nG. E. Pilkey, for the respondent.\nW. R. Jackett, Q.C., and S. Samuels, for the Attorney General of Canada.\nW. J. Wilson, Q.C., for the Attorney General for Alberta.\nL. H. McDonald, for the Attorney General for Saskatchewan.\nW. G. Burke-Robertson, Q.C., for the Attorney-General of British Columbia.\nE. Pepper, for the Attorney-General for Ontario.\nThe judgment of Kerwin C. J. and of Taschereau, Fauteux, Abbott, Martland, Judson and Ritchie JJ. was delivered by\nJudson J.:\u2014The appellant, being charged under s. 55(1) of the Manitoba Highway Traffic Act with driving without due care and attention, moved for prohibition on the ground that the section was beyond the powers of the provincial legislature because it was legislation in relation to criminal law, and also, because the subject-matter of the section fell within the paramount jurisdiction of the Parliament of Canada, which had occupied the field by the enactment of s. 221 of the Criminal Code.\nThe motion for prohibition was dismissed by the Chief Justice of the Court of Queen's Bench, who adopted the reasoning of the majority of the Ontario Court of Appeal in Regina v. Yolles2. This dismissal was affirmed on appeal3, Adamson C.J.M. dissenting. The appellant now appeals pursuant to special leave granted by this Court.\nSection 55(1) of The Highway Traffic Act, R.S.M. 1954, c. 112, reads:\nEvery person who drives a motor vehicle or a trolley bus on a highway without due care and attention or without reasonable consideration for other persons using the highway is guilty of an offence.\nThe relevant sections of the Criminal Code are ss. 191(1) and 221(1), as follows:\n191(1) Everyone is criminally negligent who\n(a) in doing anything, or\n(b) in omitting to do anything that it is his duty to do, shows wanton or reckless disregard for the lives or safety of other persons.\n221(1) Everyone who is criminally negligent in the operation of a motor vehicle is guilty of\n(a) an indictable offence and is liable to imprisonment for five years, or\n(b) an offence punishable on summary conviction.\nIt is at once apparent that the problem is precisely the same as the one under consideration in Regina v. Yolles4. In the first instance, in Regina v. Yolles the corresponding Ontario legislation was held to be ultra vires. The Court of Appeal, by a majority judgment, held that it was valid provincial legislation in relation to the administration and control of traffic upon highways within the province and not legislation in relation to criminal law, and further, that it was not repugnant to, nor in conflict with s. 221(1) of the Criminal Code.\nThe central point of this appeal is the appellant's submission that whenever Parliament chooses to attach penal consequences to negligence of whatever degree, then any provincial legislation relating to negligence with penal consequences attached to it must be legislation in relation to criminal law. This submission assumes a complete identity of subject-matter which in my opinion does not exist. It is also founded, in part at least, upon a theory of the existence of a \"general area\" or \"domain\" of criminal law which has been considered and rejected by this Court.\nThere is a fundamental difference between the subject-matter of these two pieces of legislation which the appellant's argument does not recognize. It is a difference in kind and not merely one of degree. This difference has been recognized and emphasized in the recent writings of Glanville Williams on Criminal Law, para. 28, p. 82, and by J. W. C. Turner in the 17th edition of Kenny's Outlines of Criminal Law. I adopt as part of my reasons Turner's statement of the difference to be found at p. 34 of Kenny:\nBut it should now be recognized that at common law there is no criminal liability for harm thus caused by inadvertence. This has been laid down authoritatively for manslaughter again and again. There are only two states of mind which constitute mens rea, and they are intention and recklessness. The difference between recklessness and negligence is the difference between advertence and inadvertence; they are opposed and it is a logical fallacy to suggest that recklessness is a degree of negligence. The common habit of lawyers to qualify the word \"negligence\" with some moral epithet such as \"wicked\", \"gross\", or \"culpable\" has been most unfortunate since it has inevitably led to great confusion of thought and of principle. It is equally misleading to speak of criminal negligence since this is merely to use an expression to explain itself.\nThe appellant argues that negligence of any degree may form the essential element of a criminal offence. As an abstract proposition I would not question this provided the criminal offence, in a federal state, is defined by the proper legislative authority. But it does not follow that the provincial legislature, in dealing with this subject-matter in the exercise of its regulatory power over highway traffic, is enacting criminal law.\nThe appellant says that the history of the common law shows that inadvertent negligence was sufficient to support a charge of manslaughter and that consequently, when penal consequences are attached to inadvertent negligence under a provincial highway code, the legislation is necessarily in relation to criminal law. This is the proposition stated by McRuer C.J.H.C. in the Yolles case5 in these terms:\nWhat the provincial legislature has done is to attempt to revive the old common law offence of causing death by mere negligence by extending it to all cases of careless driving of vehicles on a highway, whether death ensues or not.\nI doubt whether the existence of such a common law offence can be deduced from the dicta of early 19th century judges sitting at nisi prius, as found in the scanty reports of the time. The question must have been what was meant and what meaning was conveyed by the trial judge when he used an elastic word such as \"negligence\" in relation to the facts of the case. Most of the cases quoted by McRuer C.J.H.C. are collected in 9 Hals., 1st ed., p. 582, note (1) where they are referred to as cases of manslaughter owing to negligent driving and riding. In the second edition, 9 Hals., 2nd ed., p. 441, note (m), they are referred to as illustrations of manslaughter by reason of \"gross\" negligence in driving, riding or navigation, and in the third edition, as illustrations of manslaughter occasioned by \"criminal\" negligence (10 Hals., 3rd ed., 717, note (h)).\nI think that the same doubt is expressed in Andrews v. Director of Public Prosecutions6. In any event, there is no such common law offence now in England and it is not to be found in the criminal law of Canada. The Criminal Code confines its definition of crime in ss. 191(1) and 221(1) to a certain kind of conduct. This is not the kind of conduct referred to in the provincial legislation, nor is the provincial legislation dealing with another degree of the same kind of conduct aimed at by the Criminal Code.\nWhat the Parliament of Canada has done is to define \"advertent negligence\" as a crime under ss. 191(1) and 221(1). It has not touched \"inadvertent negligence\". Inadvertent negligence is dealt with under the provincial legislation in relation to the regulation of highway traffic. That is its true character and until Parliament chooses to define it in the Criminal Code as \"crime\", it is not crime. The power of a provincial legislature to enact legislation for the regulation of highway traffic is undoubted. (Provincial Secretary of the Province of Prince Edward Island v. E gan7). The legislation under attack here is part and parcel of this regulation. Rules of conduct on highways have been established by similar legislation in every province and the careless driving section is no different in character from the specific rules of the road that are laid down.\nMuch of the argument addressed to us was that there was something about the subject-matter of this legislation, careless driving on highways, which made it inherently criminal law. I do not understand this argument in relation to the subject-matter of negligence on highways. What meaning can one attach to such phrases as \"area of criminal law\" or \"domain of criminal law\" in relation to such a subject-matter? A provincial enactment does not become a matter of criminal law merely because it consists of a prohibition and makes it an offence for failure to observe the prohibition; (Quong-Wing v. The King8). On this subject-matter there can be no such area defined either by the common law or by the statutory treatment of the subject in the United Kingdom and in Canada. In mentioning statute law, I have in mind 1938, c. 44, s. 16, Statutes of Canada, which did introduce into the Criminal Code as s. 285(6) something resembling the provincial legislation in question here, but it is not now in the Criminal Code.\nThe only approach to the problem, it seems to me, is that stated in the Lord's Day Alliance case9.\nIn constitutional matters there is no general area of criminal law and in every case the pith and substance of the legislation in question must be looked at. (per Kerwin C.J. at p. 503)\nRand J., at p. 508, stated:\nInto this branch of his argument Mr. Brewin injected the idea of a \"domain\" of criminal law which, as I understood it, was in some manner a defined area existing apart from the actual body of offences at a particular moment; and that it was characterized by certain distinguishing qualities. Undoubtedly criminal acts are those forbidden by law, ordinarily at least if not necessarily accompanied by penal sanctions, enacted to serve what is considered a public interest or to interdict what is deemed a public harm or evil. In a unitary state the expression would seem appropriate to most if not all such prohibitions; but in. a federal system distinctions must be made arising from the true object, purpose, nature or character of each particular enactment. This is exemplified in Attorney General for Quebec v. Canadian Federation of Agriculture [1951] A.C. 179, [1950] 4 D.L.R. 689, in which certain prohibitions with penalties enacted by Parliament against certain trade in margarine were held to be ultra vires as not being within criminal law.\nBeyond or apart from such broad characteristics, of no practical significance here, which describe an area by specifying certain elements inhering in criminal law enactments, no such \"domain\" is recognized by our law. The language of Lord Blanesburgh in the Manitoba case refers to \"domain\" as the body of present prohibitions, the existing criminal law, and nothing else. The same view expressed in Proprietary Articles Trade Asociation v. Attorney General for Canada [1931] A.C. 310 at 324; 55 C.C.C. 241; 2 D.L.R. 1; 1 W.W.R. 552, by Lord Atkin will bear repeating: (per Rand J. at p. 508.)\nMy conclusion is that s. 55(1) of the Manitoba Highway Traffic Act has for its true object, purpose, nature or character the regulation and control of traffic on highways and that, therefore, it is valid provincial legislation.\nNor do I think that it can be said to be inoperative because it is in conflict with s. 221 of the Criminal Code. There is no conflict between these provisions in the sense that they are repugnant. The provisions deal with different subject-matters and are for different purposes. Section 55(1) is highway legislation dealing with regulation and control of traffic on highways, and s. 221 is criminal law dealing with negligence of the character defined in the section. Even though the circumstances of a particular case may be within the scope of both provisions (and in that sense there may be an overlapping) that does not mean that there is conflict so that the Court must conclude that the provincial enactment is suspended or inoperative; McColl v. Canadian Pacific Railway Company10, per Duff J. There is no conflict or repugnancy between s. 55(1) of the Manitoba Highway Traffic Act and s. 221 of the Criminal Code. Both provisions can live together and operate concurrently.\nThe problem here seems to me to be the same in principle as that raised by the side-by-side existence of provincial legislation dealing with the duty to remain at or return to the scene of an accident for certain defined purposes, and s. 221(2) of the Criminal Code dealing with failure to stop at the scene of an accident \"with intent to escape civil or criminal liability\". The supposed conflict between these two pieces of legislation has been considered in three provinces. The first decision was R. v. Corry11, which held that the provincial legislation was in relation to the regulation of traffic and not the punishment of crime. In Ontario this decision appears to have been overlooked in Regina v. Dodd12, where it was held that the corresponding Ontario legislation was in conflict with and repugnant to the Criminal Code. The Corry case has, however, been followed in R. v. Mankow13 and in R. v. Stephens14, both Courts being of the opinion, as I am in the present case, that the two pieces of legislation differed both in legislative purpose and legal and practical effect, the provincial Act imposing a duty to serve bona fide provincial ends not otherwise secured and in no way conflicting with s. 221(2) of the Criminal Code.\nI would dismiss the appeal. There should be no order as to costs.\nThe judgment of Locke and Cartwright JJ. was delivered by\nCartwright J. (dissenting):\u2014This appeal is brought, pursuant to special leave granted by this Court, from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba15 dismissing an appeal from the judgment of Williams C.J.K.B. who had dismissed the appellant's application for an order of prohibition; Adamson C.J.M., dissenting, would have allowed the appeal.\nThe sole question for decision is whether s. 55(1) of The Highway Traffic Act, R.S.M. 1954, c. 112, is intra vires of the legislature; it reads:\n55(1) Every person who drives a motor vehicle or a trolley bus on a highway without due care and attention or without reasonable consideration for other persons using the highway is guilty of an offence.\nA penalty for the offence created by s. 55(1) is prescribed by s. 124. The judgment of Williams C.J.K.B. was delivered shortly after that of the Court of Appeal for Ontario in Regina v. Yolles16, in which that Court by a majority consisting of Porter C.J.O., Gibson and Lebel JJ.A. had reversed the answer given by McRuer C.J.H.C. to a question submitted in a stated case holding that s. 29(1) of The Highway Traffic Act, R.S.O. 1950, c. 167, as amended, was ultra vires of the legislature. Roach and Schroeder JJ.A., dissenting, were of opinion that the subsection was ultra vires and would have dismissed the appeal.\nWilliams C.J.K.B., and Schultz and Tritschler JJ.A. who formed the majority in the Court of Appeal for Manitoba in brief reasons adopted and followed the reasoning of the majority of the Court of Appeal for Ontario in Yolles' case, except that Tritschler J.A., who wrote the reasons of the majority, noted his disagreement with the earlier judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario in Regina v. Dodd17.\nAdamson C.J.M. after examining a number of authorities reached the conclusion that the impugned sub-section was ultra vires of the legislature as being in pith and substance criminal law and further that it was in pari materia with and in conflict with the Criminal Code; he expressed his agreement with the reasoning of McRuer C.J.H.C. and of Roach and Schroeder JJ.A. in Yolles' case.\nSection 29(1) of The Highway Traffic Act of Ontario which was dealt with in Yolles' case reads as follows:\n29(1) Every person is guilty of the offence of driving carelessly who drives a vehicle on a highway without due care and attention or without reasonable consideration for other persons using the highway and shall be liable to a penalty of not less than $10 and not more than $500 or to imprisonment for a term of not more than three months, and in addition his licence or permit may be suspended for a period of not more than one year.\nI agree with Williams C.J.K.B., and indeed it is common ground, that, so far as the question raised on this appeal is concerned, there is no difference in substance between s. 55(1) of the Manitoba Act and s. 29(1) of the Ontario Act; we cannot allow this appeal unless we are prepared to overrule the judgment of the Court of Appeal in Yolles' case. I find the reasons of Adamson C.J.M. in the case at bar and those of Roach J.A. in Yolles' case so satisfactory and convincing that I would be content simply to adopt them, but in view of the differences of opinion in the courts of Manitoba and of Ontario and in this Court and in deference to the full and able arguments addressed to us I propose to add some observations of my own.\nI trust that it is not an over-simplification to say that the essence of the reasons of the majority in the Court of Appeal in Yolles' case may be summarized in the following propositions:\n(i) Section 29(1) is legislation in relation to the regulation of highway traffic.\n(ii) It has been decided by this Court, notably in Provincial Secretary of P.E.I. v. Egan18 and in O'Brien v. Allen19, that the field of regulation of highway traffic within a province is wholly provincial.\n(iii) That consequently s. 29(1) is prima facie within the powers of the legislature.\n(iv) That s. 29(1) is not in conflict with any existing legislation of Parliament.\nIt will be convenient to examine first the second of these propositions. The expressions used in the reasons in Egan's case, wide though they are, do not assert an unlimited power in the legislatures to control all activities upon the highways. All that the case actually decided was that the legislature had power to require persons driving motor vehicles on highways in the province to obtain a provincial licence and to enact that such licence should be automatically suspended upon the holder being convicted of driving a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor or drugs, which was an offence under the Criminal Code. The reasons stress the circumstance that the impugned provincial legislation did not create an offence (see pages 415 and 417).\nThe caution necessary to be observed in applying the Egan case in differing circumstances is expressed by Duff C.J. in the following passage at pages 400 and 401:\nA very different question, however, is raised by the contention that the matters legislated upon by the enactments of the Provincial Highway Traffic Act in question have, by force of section 285(7) of the Criminal Code, been brought exclusively within the scope of the Dominion authority in relation to criminal law. We are here on rather delicate ground. We have to consider the effect of legislation by the Dominion creating a crime and imposing punishment for it in effecting the suspension of provincial legislative authority in relation to matters prima facie within the provincial jurisdiction. I say we are on delicate ground because the subject of criminal law entrusted to the Parliament of Canada is necessarily an expanding field by reason of the authority of Parliament to create crimes, impose punishment for such crimes, and to deal with criminal procedure. If there is a conflict between Dominion legislation and Provincial legislation, then nobody doubts that the Dominion legislation prevails. But even where there is no actual conflict, the question often arises as to the effect of Dominion legislation in excluding matters from provincial jurisdiction which would otherwise fall within it. I doubt if any test can be stated with accuracy in general terms for the resolution of such questions. It is important to remember that matters which, from one point of view and for one purpose, fall exclusively within the Dominion authority, may, nevertheless, be proper subjects for legislation by the Province from a different point of view, although this is a principle that must be \"applied only with great caution\". (Attorney-General for Canada v. Attorney General for Alberta [1916] 1 A.C. 588 at 596.)\nThe case of Attorney General for Ontario v. Winner20, involved questions different from those in the case at bar but the following statements in the judgment of their Lordships delivered by Lord Porter make it clear that the provincial power over highways is not unlimited; at page 576:\nTheir Lordships are not concerned to dispute either the provincial control of the roads or that it has the right of regulation, but there nevertheless remains the question of the limit of control in any individual instance and the extent of the powers of regulation.\nIt would not be desirable, nor do their Lordships think that it would be possible, to lay down the precise limits within which the use of provincial highways may be regulated. Such matters as speed, the side of the road upon which to drive, the weight and lights of vehicles are obvious examples, but in the present case their Lordships are not faced with considerations of this kind, nor are they concerned with the further question which was mooted before them, viz., whether a province had it in its power to plough up its roads and so make inter-provincial connections impossible. So isolationalist a policy is indeed unthinkable.\nand at page 579:\nWhatever provisions or regulations a province may prescribe with regard to its roads it must not prevent or restrict inter-provincial traffic. As their Lordships have indicated, this does not in any way prevent what is in essence traffic regulation, but the provisions contained in local statutes and regulations must be confined to such matters. The power of the legislature to make laws in relation to its roads must, of course, be derived from s. 92 of the British North America Act and cannot extend to the making of a law which is in pith and substance in relation to a matter coming within the classes of subjects enumerated in s. 91.\nTurning now to the first of the propositions set out above it is necessary to consider what is the true nature and character of the impugned subsection. Is it a law in relation to the regulation of highway traffic, or is it in pith and substance a law in relation to \"the criminal law\" within the meaning of that phrase as used in head 27 of s. 91 of the British North America Act?\nIn the course of such an inquiry reference is usually made to the following passage in the judgment of the Judicial Committee delivered by Lord Atkin in P.A.T.A. v. Attorney General for Canada21:\n\"Criminal law\" means \"the criminal law in its widest sense\": Attorney-General for Ontario v. Hamilton Street Ry. Co. (1903) A.C. 524. It certainly is not confined to what was criminal by the law of England or of any Province in 1867. The power must extend to legislation to make new crimes. Criminal law connotes only the quality of such acts or omissions as are prohibited under appropriate penal provisions by authority of the State. The criminal quality of an act cannot be discerned by intuition; nor can it be discovered by reference to any Standard but one: Is the act prohibited with penal consequences? Morality and criminality are far from co-extensive; nor is the sphere of criminality necessarily part of a more extensive field covered by morality\u2014unless the moral code necessarily disapproves all acts prohibited by the State, in which case the argument moves in a circle. It appears to their Lordships to be of little value to seek to confine crimes to a category of acts which by their very nature belong to the domain of \"criminal jurisprudence\"; for the domain of criminal jurisprudence can only be ascertained by examining what acts at any particular period are declared by the State to be crimes, and the only common nature they will be found to possess is that they are prohibited by the State and that those who commit them are punished.\nThere is nothing in this passage (which occurs in the course of a judgment rejecting the argument that Parliament can exercise exclusive legislative power under s. 91 (27) only where the subject matter of a questioned enactment \"by its very nature belongs to the domain of criminal jurisprudence\") to suggest that the Court is unable in the case of a piece of actual or proposed legislation to determine whether or not it is in pith and substance a law in relation to the, criminal law within the meaning of that phrase as used in s. 91(27). That is the very task which the Court is called upon to perform.\nIn the reasons of my brother Judson, which I have had the advantage of reading, he refers with approval to passages in Glanville Williams on Criminal Law (1953) and in the 17th Edition of Kenny's Outlines of Criminal Law in which the distinction is drawn between \"inadvertent negligence\" and \"advertent negligence\". At page 82 of his work Glanville Williams says:\nResponsibility for some crimes may be incurred by the mere neglect to exercise due caution, where the mind is not actively but negatively or passively at fault. This is inadvertent negligence. Since advertent negligence has a special name (recklessness), it is convenient to use \"negligence\" generally to mean inadvertent negligence. If it is said that such-and-such a crime can be committed negligently, this means that the crime can be committed by inadvertent negligence; and the reader will understand that the crime can a fortiori be committed recklessly.\nIn the law of tort negligence has an objective meaning. It signifies a failure to reach the objective standard of the reasonable man, and does not involve any inquiry into the mentality of the defendant. The same rule prevails in criminal law, in those spheres where negligence is recognised at all.\nIn my opinion the effect of s. 55(1) is to enact that a person who in driving a vehicle on a highway fails to reach the objective standard of the reasonable man in regard to the use of due care and attention or in regard to having reasonable consideration for other persons using the highway is guilty of an offence and subject to punishment.\nIn determining whether such a provision falls within s. 91(27) rather than within any of the heads of s. 92 we are entitled to consider its apparent purpose and effect and in doing this we must take into account any general knowledge of which the Court would take judicial notice.\nFor some years the increasing frequency of accidents on highways resulting in death, personal injury and damage to property has been a matter of grave public concern, and efforts to reduce the number of such accidents have occupied the attention of Parliament and of the provincial legislatures.\nBy the combined effect of sections 191(1) and 221(1) of the Criminal Code Parliament has made it a crime to be negligent in the operation of a motor vehicle provided that, whether the negligence consists of omission or commission, the person charged shows wanton or reckless disregard for the lives or safety of other persons; it is not a necessary element of this crime that the negligence charged shall cause injury or damage. To use the terminology of Glanville 'Williams, Parliament has enacted that \"advertent negligence\" in the operation of a motor vehicle is a crime. No counsel has questioned the competency of Parliament to enact these sections; it could not be successfully questioned. The application of these sections is not limited to the operation of motor vehicles on highways but it is obvious that in the vast majority of cases in which a charge is laid thereunder it will arise out of a highway accident.\nWe may, I think, take judicial notice of the fact that while many highway accidents resulting in death or injury are caused by \"advertent negligence\", very many are caused by \"inadvertent negligence\". Should Parliament in its wisdom decide that to stem the rising tide of death and injury it was advisable to make inadvertent negligence in the operation of a motor vehicle a crime as well as advertent negligence in such operation it would, in my opinion, clearly be enacting criminal law within the meaning of head 27 of s. 91. I did not understand any counsel to suggest that Parliament lacked the power to enact as part of the Criminal Code a provision identical with s. 55(1) should it see fit to do so. I think it clear that Parliament has such power and that if it saw fit to enact the provision contained in s. 55(1) that provision would in no sense be legislation merely ancillary or necessarily incidental to the exercise of the powers conferred upon Parliament by s. 91 (27) ; it would be an integral part of the criminal law.\nIn my opinion, while the types of negligence dealt with differ, the true nature and character of the legislation contained in s. 55(1) of the Manitoba Act does not differ in kind from that of the legislation contained in sections 191(1) and 221(1) of the Criminal Code. Each seeks to suppress in the public interest and with penal consequences negligence in the operation of vehicles, each is designed for the promotion of public safety, each seeks to prevent substantially the same public evil, each belongs to the subject of public wrongs rather than to that of civil rights, each makes negligence a crime although one deals with inadvertent negligence and the other with advertent negligence. In my view the impugned sub-section differs generically from those provisions of The Highway Traffic Act prescribing detailed rules of conduct such as rates of speed, rules of the road, traffic signals, lights, equipment and so on; on this branch of the matter I have nothing to add to what has been said by Roach J.A.\nIf I am right in my conclusion that the provisions of the impugned sub-section if enacted by Parliament as part of the Criminal Code would clearly be a law in relation to the criminal law within the meaning of head 27 of s. 91, that would seem to be an end of the matter; the true nature and character of an enactment is to be discerned by a consideration of its meaning, purpose and effect, and does not depend upon whether it is enacted by Parliament or by a provincial legislature. The statement of Lord Watson in Union Colliery Company of British Columbia v. Bryden22 has been repeatedly followed:\nThe abstinence of the Dominion Parliament from legislating to the full limit of its powers, could not have the effect of transferring to any provincial legislature the legislative power which had been assigned to the Dominion by s. 91 of the Act of 1867.\nIt may well be that a growing public danger makes it desirable that inadvertent negligence in driving a motor vehicle should be made a crime. I do not express any opinion on this question which is one of public policy to be decided by Parliament. I think it clear that Parliament alone has the constitutional authority to so enact.\nIn my opinion there is no room in this case for the view that s. 55(1) is intra vires because it operates in an otherwise unoccupied field, for the field which the impugned legislation seeks to enter is one reserved exclusively for Parliament by head 27 of s. 91. This is a field which the provincial legislature is forbidden to enter whether or not Parliament has occupied any part of it.\nThere are two further matters which I wish to mention.\nIn the penultimate paragraph of his reasons Tritschler J.A. expresses the view that it is now easier to declare s. 55(1) intra vires of the legislature than it would have been had the provision formerly contained in s. 285(6) of the old Criminal Code still been in force. That sub-section read as follows:\n(6) Every one who drives a motor vehicle on a street, road, highway or other public place recklessly, or in a manner which is dangerous to the public, having regard to all the circumstances of the case, including the nature, condition, and use of the street, road, highway or place, and the amount of traffic which is actually at the time, or which might reasonably be expected to be, on such street, road, highway or place, shall be guilty of an offence. \u2026\nThe validity of this view depends on the \"overlapping doctrine\", which is accurately defined in Varcoe on The Distribution of Legislative Power in Canada, 1954, at p. 47, as follows:\nThere can be a domain in which provincial and Dominion legislative powers may overlap, in which case, a statute enacted pursuant to either power will be intra vires if the field is clear, but if the field is not clear and two statutes meet, the Dominion statute must prevail.\nAssuming, contrary to the opinion that I have already expressed, that s. 55(1) has a provincial aspect and so would be valid until Parliament occupies the field in which it operates, it is necessary to consider whether Parliament has done so. In my opinion Parliament has fully occupied the field.\nFor the purpose of reducing the number of automobile accidents occuring on the highways throughout Canada, Parliament has decided to attach penal consequences to negligence in the course of a particular specified activity, i.e., the operation of a motor vehicle. The provisions of the Criminal Code now in force attach those consequences to advertent negligence in such operation; when s. 285(6) of the old Code was in force it was arguable that the words therein contained, \"or in a manner which is dangerous to the. public having regard to all the circumstances of the case\" had the effect of attaching penal consequences to inadvertent negligence; be this as it may, it is clear that Parliament has the power to attach penal consequences to inadvertent negligence and to enact as a part of the Criminal Code the very provisions contained in s. 55(1).\nIn my opinion when Parliament has expressed in an Act its decision that a certain kind or degree of negligence in the operation of a motor vehicle shall be punishable as a crime against the state it follows that it has decided that no less culpable kind or degree of negligence in such operation shall be so punishable. By necessary implication the Act says not only what kinds or degrees of negligence shall be punishable but also what kinds or degrees shall not.\nThe matter may be tested in this way: suppose that Parliament in the new Code had enacted the provisions of s. 55(1) of The Highway Traffic Act as sub-section (2) of s. 221; in such circumstances the field which s. 55(1) seeks to enter would clearly be fully occupied by valid Dominion legislation; suppose then that a few years later Parliament repealed the said sub-section thereby indicating its view that the inadvertent negligence described in the repealed subsection should cease to be punishable as an offence against the State; could it be said that upon such repeal a provincial legislature could enact the repealed sub-section as part of its Highway Traffic Act? In my opinion it could not, and it appears to me that the result of holding otherwise would be to defeat the intention of the framers of the British North America Act that power to legislate as to the criminal law should be committed exclusively to Parliament. It is not within the power of the provincial legislature to remedy what it regards as defects or to supply what it regards as unwise omissions in the criminal law as enacted by Parliament.\nIt appears to me to be self-evident that the exclusive legislative authority in relation to the criminal law given to Parliament by s. 91(27) must include the power to decide what conduct shall not be punishable as a crime against the state as well as to decide what conduct shall be so punishable, and this may be the reason that there is little authority precisely on the point; it has however been touched on by the Judicial Committee in the case of Toronto Railway v. The King23. The members of the Board were Viscount Haldane, Lord Dunedin, Lord Atkinson, Lord Parker of Waddington, Lord Parmoor, Lord Wrenbury and Sir Arthur Channell; Viscount Haldane who delivered the judgment said at page 639:\nTheir Lordships think that it was competent to the Parliament of Canada under s. 91, sub-s. 27, of the British North America Act, 1867, which enables it exclusively to legislate as to criminal law, including procedure in criminal matters, to declare that what might previously have constituted a criminal offence should no longer do so, although a procedure in form criminal was kept alive.\nThe other matter to which I wish to refer is a submission in the argument of counsel for the Attorney General of Canada to the effect that had s. 55(1) read as follows:\n(1) Every person who drives a motor vehicle or a trolley bus on a highway shall do so with due care and attention and with reasonable consideration for other persons using the highway.\n(2) Every person who fails to comply with subsection (1) is guilty of an offence.\nthere would be no question of its validity. As to this argument it is my view that the validity of an impugned enactment depends not on the precise verbal form in which it is expressed but on the meaning of the words the legislature has used and the purpose and effect of the enactment. The question is one of substance. Had the impugned sub-section been enacted in the form suggested I would have been equally of opinion that it was invalid. Were it otherwise a law in relation to the crime of theft could, by careful draftsmanship, be made to read as a law dealing with the civil right to the possession of personal property and a law in relation to highway robbery could be framed as a regulation of highway traffic.\nFor the above reasons and for those given by Adamson C.J.M. in the case at bar and by Roach J.A. in Yolles' case with which I have already expressed my full agreement I am of opinion that s. 55(1) of The Highway Traffic Act, R.S.M. 1954, c. 112, is ultra vires of the Legislature of the Province of Manitoba.\nI would allow the appeal with costs throughout, set aside the judgments below and direct that an order of prohibition issue. I would make no order as to the costs of the Attorneys-General who intervened.\nRitchie J.:\u2014I agree with Judson J. that s. 55(1) of the Manitoba Highway Traffic Act is valid provincial legislation enacted for the regulation and control of traffic on the highways of that province and that there is a fundamental difference between the subject-matter dealt with in that section and any behaviour which is proscribed as criminal by the provisions of the Criminal Code. I would, accordingly, dismiss this appeal.\nAppeal dismissed without costs, Locke and Cartwright JJ. dissenting.\nSolicitor for the applicant, appellant: H. P.

On appeal it was decided, by a majority, that the section was intra vires. The Court of Appeal granted the accused leave to appeal to this Court, where it was determined that the Court of Appeal lacked jurisdiction so to do. A constitutional question being involved, leave to appeal was granted by this Court.\nHeld (Locke and Cartwright JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be dismissed.\nPer Kerwin C.J. and Taschereau, Fauteux, Abbott, Martland, Judson and Ritchie JJ.: The two pieces of legislation (s. 147(1) of the Act and s. 221(2) of the Code) differ in legislative purpose and in legal and practical effect. The section in the Act was enacted for provincial purposes by creating a duty to stop, render assistance and give information, whereas the section of the Code creates an offence to omit certain acts if done with a specified intent. Regina v. Dodd, [1957] O.R. 5, overruled; Regina v. Yolles, [1959] O.R. 206, approved; O'Grady v. Sparling, [1960] S.C.R. 804; Rex v. Corry, 26 Alta. L.R. 390; Regina v. Mankov, 28 W.W.R. 433, referred to. Per Locke and Cartwright JJ., dissenting: Where Parliament has, in the valid exercise of its exclusive power under head 27 of s. 91 of the British North America Act to make laws in relation to the criminal law, enacted that a certain course of conduct shall be punishable as an offence against the state provided it is accompanied by a specified intent, it is not within, the power of the Legislature to enact that the very same course of conduct shall be punishable as an offence whether or not that specified intent exists.\nThe whole subject-matter of the charge against the appellant has been drawn by Parliament within the ambit of the criminal law with the effect of suspending the provincial legislative authority in relation to that subject-matter.\nProvincial Secretary of P.E.I. v. Egan, [1941] S.C.R. 396: Regina v. Dodd, supra, referred to.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba1, reversing the judgment of Philp Sr. Co. Ct. J. Appeal dismissed, Locke and Cartwright JJ. dissenting.\nNo oral argument was presented, as this case was to be decided at the same time and in the same way as the case of O'Grady v. Sparling, [1960] S.C.R. 804.\nThe judgment of Kerwin C.J. and of Taschereau, Fauteux, Abbott, Martland, Judson and Ritchie JJ. was delivered by\nThe Chief Justice:\u2014The appellant, William E. Stephens, was convicted in magistrate's court in the City of Winnipeg, in the Province of Manitoba, on the 4th day of September 1958, for that he at the City of Winnipeg, on the 7th day of August, A.D., 1958,\ndid unlawfully operate a motor vehicle on Furby St., and being involved in an accident fail to remain at the scene of the accident, fail to render all reasonable assistance and fail to give in writing to the parties sustaining loss or injury his name and address and the number of his driver's licence contrary to the provisions of the Highway Traffic Act 147-1 in such case made and provided.\nHe appealed to the County Court of Winnipeg and His Honour Judge Philp without hearing any evidence decided on a motion by counsel for Stephens that s. 147(1) was ultra vires the Provincial Legislature and set aside the conviction. On an appeal against this order to the Court of Appeal1 for Manitoba, Tritschler J.A., with whom Schultz J.A. agreed, decided (Chief Justice Adamson dissenting) that the section was intra vires. The order of the Court was that the appeal should be allowed and the matter remitted to the Senior County Court Judge for the County Court of Winnipeg to hear the evidence and dispose of the charge.\nThe Court of Appeal granted Stephens leave to appeal to this Court. After notice to the parties we determined that that Court had no jurisdiction so to do. Stephens was prosecuted in accordance with The Summary Convictions Act, R.S.M. 1954, c. 254, s. 7 of which provides for the application of certain named sections of the Criminal Code of Canada. The 1954 Revised Statutes of Manitoba and the new Criminal Code of Canada came into force on the same day but whether one refers to the sections of the old Code or of the new Code the result is the same. No power is given to a provincial Court of Appeal to grant leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada from its judgment setting aside a conviction of a non-indictable offence. That power is conferred upon this Court and then only in respect of a question of law or jurisdiction. A constitutional question is involved in the present case and although, as will appear later, the point is now determined by what the majority of this Court holds in O'Grady v. Sparling2, we granted leave so that the matter might be disposed of at the same time as the last mentioned case and Smith v. The Queen3.\nSection 147(1) of the Manitoba Highway Traffic Act, under which the charge against Stephens was laid, reads:\n147. (1) Where an accident occurs on a highway, the driver, owner, or other person in charge of a vehicle, street car or trolley bus that is in any manner, directly or indirectly, involved in the accident shall\n(a) remain at or immediately return to the scene of the accident; and\n(b) render all reasonable assistance; and\n(c) give in writing to any one sustaining loss or injury or to any peace officer or to a witness his name and address, and also the name and address of the registered owner of the vehicle and the number of the driver's licence, and the registration number of the motor vehicle or such of the information as is requested.\nWe were advised that this provision originated in an amendment to the Act in 1930 by s. 61(1) of c. 19 of the Statutes of that year. Subsection (2) of s. 221 of the new Criminal Code requires consideration:\n221.................................................................................................................................\n(2) Every one who, having the care, charge or control of a vehicle that is involved in an accident with a person, vehicle or cattle in charge of a person, with intent to escape civil or criminal liability fails to stop his vehicle, give his name and address and, where any person has been injured, offer assistance, is guilty of\n(a) an indictable offence and is liable to imprisonment for two years, or\n(b) an offence punishable on summary conviction.\nThis subsection originated in an amendment to the Criminal Code by s. 2 of c. 13 of the Statutes of 1910.\nJudge Philp, with whom Chief Justice Adamson agreed, considered that s. 147(1) of the Manitoba Highway Traffic Act and s. 221(2) of the new Criminal Code were in pari materia and that, therefore, the former could not stand. As indicated earlier the point is really determined by the judgment of this Court in O'Grady v. Sparling4, as the reasons of Judson J., which are those of the majority, referred to Regina v. Dodd5, a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario relied upon by the County Court Judge in this case. It is pointed out in O'Grady v. Sparling that the problem there in question was the same \"as that raised by the side-by-side existence of provincial legislation dealing with the duty to remain at or return to the scene of an accident for certain defined purposes, and s. 221(2) of the Criminal Code dealing with failure to stop at the scene of an accident 'with intent to escape civil or criminal liability' \". Judson J. continues by considering the Dodd case, Rex v. Corry6, Regina v. Mankow7, a decision of the Alberta Court of Appeal, and the decision of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba in the present case. It suffices to reiterate that the two pieces of legislation differ in legislative purpose and in legal and practical effect. The County Judge in this case considered that (a), (b), (c) of s. 147(1) of the Manitoba Highway Traffic Act referred to something that had happened after an accident and that all infractions against the rules of driving, for negligence, and other provisions for prevention of accidents and injuries to persons and property, were over and completed prior to the time of the alleged offences as charged. He states further that there was no degree of care such as in Regina v. Yolles8, a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario. While we had refused leave to appeal to this Court because Yolles had been found not guilty on another ground, his counsel took part in the argument of the present appeal.\nHere the County Judge considered that what was in question in s. 147(1) of the Manitoba Highway Traffic Act was one act (a) \"remain at \u2026 the scene of the accident\"; (b) \"render \u2026 assistance\"; (c) \"give in writing \u2026 information\". However, I agree with Tritschler J.A. that the section of the Manitoba Act was enacted for provincial purposes by creating a duty to stop, render assistance and give information, while the section of the Code creates an offence to omit certain acts if done with a specified intent. The result is that the decision of the Ontario Court of Appeal in Regina v. Dodd9 is overruled and that of the same Court in Regina v. Yolles10 approved.\nThe appeal should be dismissed.\nThe judgment of Locke and Cartwright JJ. was delivered by\nCartwright J. (dissenting):\u2014The charge against the appellant and the proceedings in the courts below are set out in the reasons of the Chief Justice.\nThe question to be decided is stated in the written argument of the Attorney-General for the Province of Manitoba as follows:\nThe issue on this appeal is whether or not the matter of Section 147(1) of The Highway Traffic Act R.S.M. 1954 Cap. 112 is so related to the substance of Section 221(2) of the Criminal Code as to be brought within the scope of the criminal law and so rendered ultra vires or inoperative.\nI think it clear that s. 147(1) would be intra vires of the legislature if there were no legislation of Parliament dealing with similar subject matter and I do not understand the appellant to argue the contrary. The question before us is that stated by Duff C.J. in Provincial Secretary of P.E.I. v. Egan11:\nWe have to consider the effect of legislation by the Dominion creating a crime and imposing punishment for it in effecting the suspension of provincial legislative authority in relation to matters prima facie within the provincial jurisdiction. The inquiry in the case at bar is directed to the specific charge brought against the appellant. It will be observed that to substantiate the charge the prosecution would have to prove (i) that the appellant was operating a motor vehicle that was involved in an accident on Furby Street causing loss or injury, (ii) that he failed to remain at the scene of the accident, (iii) that he failed to render all reasonable assistance, and (iv) that he failed to give in writing to the parties sustaining loss or injury his name, address and driver's licence number.\nIf the charge against the appellant had been laid under s. 221(2) of the Criminal Code instead of under s. 147(1) of The Highway Traffic Act, it would have been necessary for the prosecution to prove not only the matters set out above but also that the failure of the accused was accompanied by the intent to escape civil or criminal liability. This is a substantial difference which is somewhat lessened in practice by the terms of subsection (3) of section 221 of the Code making proof of the objective fact of the failures mentioned prima facie evidence of the existence of the guilty intent.\nIt is not, and could not successfully be, argued that the enactment of s. 221(2) and (3) is not a valid exercise of the exclusive power conferred on Parliament by head 27 of s. 91 of the British North America Act. The question before us may therefore be stated in the following terms. Where Parliament has, in the valid exercise of its exclusive power under head 27 of section 91 to make laws in relation to the criminal law, enacted that a certain course of conduct shall be punishable as an offence against the state provided it is accompanied by a specified intent, is it within the power of the Legislature to enact that the very same course of conduct shall be punishable as an offence whether or not that specified intent exists? With the greatest respect for all those who have, in this and other cases, expressed a different view I am of opinion that so long as section 221 (2) of the Code continues in force, the Legislature has no such power, and I am in agreement with the conclusion reached in the case at bar by the learned Chief Justice of Manitoba and by the learned County Court Judge and also with the conclusion reached by Laidlaw J.A. in delivering the unanimous judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario in Regina v. Dodd12.\nThe whole subject-matter of the charge against the appellant has, in my opinion, been drawn by Parliament within the ambit of the criminal law with the effect of suspending the provincial legislative authority in relation to that subject-matter.\nI would allow the appeal, set aside the order of the Court of Appeal and restore the order of the learned County Court Judge setting aside the conviction and directing the return of the fine, costs and security paid by the appellant.\nRitchie J.:\u2014I agree with the Chief Justice that s. 147(1) of the Manitoba Highway Traffic Act is valid legislation enacted for provincial purposes and that the subject-matter with which it deals is substantially different from the offence defined in s. 221 of the Criminal Code in that the specific intent required under the latter section forms no part of the offence created by the provincial statute.\nI would accordingly dismiss this appeal.\nAppeal dismissed without costs, Locke and Cartwright JJ. dissenting.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Yanofsky & Pollock, Winnipeg.\nSolicitor for the respondent: Gordon E.

C, an adjuster, inspected the site and had the plaintiff sign an unsworn statement. Later on, having had no word from the defendant, the plaintiff consulted a lawyer who wrote to the defendant. The lawyer received from C a letter in which C disclosed that he had a mandate and complete discretion to deal with the matter, and asked the lawyer to have the plaintiff fill out the enclosed form of proof of loss and to return it to him. The form was duly filled out by the plaintiff and mailed by the lawyer himself. The defendant denied having received it. The plaintiff sued and the action was maintained by the trial judge. This judgment was reversed by a majority judgment of the Court of Appeal. The plaintiff appealed to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be allowed and the action maintained.\nBy virtue of the law governing this insurance contract, the insurer had the right to require delivery of the proofs of loss, but he also had the right to modify this requirement. In the present case, this is exactly what happened when C, the insurer's adjuster, informed the insured's lawyer that he had a mandate and complete discretion in the matter and elected to use the postal service for the return of the proofs of loss. The lawyer's obligation ended when he complied with that invitation. Magann v.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by\nFauteux J.:\u2014Par suite d'un incendie d\u00e9clar\u00e9 vers 6 heures a.m. le 2 f\u00e9vrier 1952, \u00e0 Arntfield, province de Qu\u00e9bec, l'immeuble en lequel se trouvait l'appelant, ainsi que les meubles y contenus, furent compl\u00e8tement d\u00e9truits. En l'occurrence, l'appelant \u00e9chappa de justesse et dut, apr\u00e8s avoir saut\u00e9 d'un \u00e9tage sup\u00e9rieur au sol, \u00eatre, semi-conscient et \u00e0 peine v\u00eatu, recueilli par des voisins.\nTous ces biens, propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de l'appelant et valant, l'immeuble $40,000 et les meubles $3,220.45, \u00e9taient alors et depuis 1950, assur\u00e9s par l'intim\u00e9e contre le risque d'incendie pour les sommes de $8,000 et $2,000 respectivement.\nLe fait de la totalit\u00e9 de cette perte fut rapport\u00e9 \u00e0 la compagnie et constat\u00e9 sur place, quelques jours plus tard, par l'enqu\u00eateur Francis S. Callaghan, qu'elle d\u00e9l\u00e9gua sur les lieux. Ce dernier questionna l'assur\u00e9 sur les causes possibles du sinistre, r\u00e9digea et lui fit signer une d\u00e9claration. Ceci fait, l'appelant, qui para\u00eet peu instruit et \u00e9tait, de toutes fa\u00e7ons, ignorant de la proc\u00e9dure \u00e0 suivre aux fins de sa r\u00e9clamation, demanda \u00e0 Callaghan ce qui lui restait \u00e0 faire. Ce \u00e0 quoi celui-ci r\u00e9pondit: \"Just wait, the company will let you know.\"\nL'appelant et sa famille quitt\u00e8rent Arntfield pour aller prendre r\u00e9sidence dans Ontario, dans la r\u00e9gion de Niagara Falls. Il eut, le mois suivant celui de l'incendie, la visite d'un autre enqu\u00eateur, un certain Wilson, venant soi-disant de Toronto et ce, sur les instructions de sup\u00e9rieurs dont l'identit\u00e9 ne para\u00eet pas avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9e \u00e0 l'appelant. Wilson, comme l'avait fait Callaghan, questionna l'appelant et lui fit signer une d\u00e9claration.\nAu d\u00e9but d'avril, l'appelant eut \u00e0 consulter un avocat au sujet d'une r\u00e9clamation de taxes scolaires. A Me Wilfred C. LaMarsh, de Niagara Falls, auquel il s'adressa, il apprit le fait de l'incendie, la perte subie, la notification de la compagnie, les enqu\u00eates conduites par Callaghan et Wilson, ainsi que les d\u00e9clarations qu'on lui avait fait signer. Des informations alors re\u00e7ues, Me LaMarsh ne put former l'assurance qu'\u00e0 l'occasion de la premi\u00e8re ou de la seconde visite d'enqu\u00eateurs, une preuve formelle de perte avait \u00e9t\u00e9 produite par l'appelant. C'est alors qu'il adressa la lettre qui suit \u00e0 la compagnie intim\u00e9e:\nLaMARSH & LaMARSH\nBarristers, Solicitors, Notaries Public, etc.\nTelephone 124\n1881 Ferry Street, Niagara Falls,\nONTARIO.\nAvril 3, 1952.\nThe Canadian Mercantile Insurance Co.\nSt. Hyacinthe,\nQuebec.\nDear Sirs:\nBy your Policy No. 19935 expiring November 19th, 1955, you insured Bob Milhinkovich of Arntfield, Quebec, for $8,000 on building and $2,000 on contents in connection with a Hotel, Restaurant and Bowling Alley in Arntfield.\nThere was a loss by fire of these premises early in February. Milhinkovich, who now lives outside Niagara Falls, Ontario, was in Arntfield at the time of the fire and is uncertain whether or not the investigation of the fire at that time and, subsequently, by a man who came to their home here from Toronto, whose name they believe to be Mr. Wilson, constitutes a claim under the policy.\nWill you kindly advise me whether you have received Proof of Loss with respect to this claim and, if not, will you send papers forward so that a proper claim may be made. If the Proofs of Loss have been made, kindly advise me when and what the disposition of the claim by your Company is.\nYours truly,\nLaMarsh & LaMarsh\n(sgd) W. C. LaMarsh\nWCL\/vr\nPour toute r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 cette lettre adress\u00e9e par lui directement \u00e0 la compagnie intim\u00e9e, Me LaMarsh recevait, quelque quinze jours plus tard, une lettre de l'enqu\u00eateur Callaghan dont le texte, ci-apr\u00e8s reproduit, d\u00e9nonce en termes non \u00e9quivoques, le mandat non qualifi\u00e9 et l'enti\u00e8re discr\u00e9tion que lui donne l'intim\u00e9e pour prendre charge de l'affaire et comporte, en outre, les instructions de Callaghan relativement au retour des formules de preuve de perte qu'il annexa \u00e0 sa lettre: ROUYN, QUE.\nApril 14th, 1952.\nLaMarsh & LaMarsh,\nBarristers & Solicitors,\n1881 Ferry Street,\nNiagara Falls, Ont.\nAttn Mr. W.

S. CALLAGHAN\nFSC\/md\nEncl.\nSur r\u00e9ception de cet envoi, Me LaMarsh invita l'appelant \u00e0 son bureau o\u00f9 ce dernier et son \u00e9pouse se rendirent apr\u00e8s leurs heures de travail et l'heure de fermeture du bureau de leur avocat. Les formules envoy\u00e9es ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 compl\u00e9t\u00e9es par l'appelant, avec l'assistance de son \u00e9pouse et son avocat, furent sign\u00e9es et asserment\u00e9es par lui, puis conform\u00e9ment aux instructions de Callaghan, plac\u00e9es dans une enveloppe adress\u00e9e \u00e0 ce dernier et d\u00fbment affranchie, et le soir m\u00eame, mise \u00e0 la poste par Me LaMarsh personnellement.\nPar la suite, l'appelant et son \u00e9pouse communiqu\u00e8rent p\u00e9riodiquement avec leur avocat pour s'enqu\u00e9rir du r\u00e8glement de la r\u00e9clamation et apprendre de lui qu'il \u00e9tait sans nouvelles. De son c\u00f4t\u00e9, l'intim\u00e9e \u00e9crivait, le 17 septembre, \u00e0 Callaghan pour se plaindre de n'avoir re\u00e7u, en l'affaire, aucune communication de son bureau depuis le 31 mai, et lui demander de l'informer, par retour du courrier, des d\u00e9veloppements. Ce \u00e0 quoi Callaghan r\u00e9pondit qu'il avait envoy\u00e9 les formules de preuve de perte \u00e0 l'avocat LaMarsh en lui demandant de les compl\u00e9ter et les lui retourner, mais qu'il n'avait depuis entendu parler de rien. Ni la compagnie intim\u00e9e ni son enqu\u00eateur ne jug\u00e8rent qu'il \u00e9tait \u00e0 propos de communiquer avec l'avocat LaMarsh pour s'assurer si, en r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la lettre qu'il avait adress\u00e9e, le 3 avril, \u00e0 la compagnie intim\u00e9e, il avait re\u00e7u la lettre du 14 avril et les formules y incluses que Callaghan lui avait adress\u00e9es par la poste. On pr\u00e9f\u00e9ra garder le silence. Eventuellement, deux jours avant que ne soit \u00e9coul\u00e9e l'ann\u00e9e durant laquelle s'\u00e9tait produit l'incendie, un avocat de Montr\u00e9al, saisi du soin des int\u00e9r\u00eats de l'assur\u00e9, prit action contre la compagnie intim\u00e9e, pour lui r\u00e9clamer $10,000.\nL'intim\u00e9e admit au d\u00e9but de l'audition en Cour sup\u00e9rieure, comme d'ailleurs devant cette Cour, le contrat et le montant de l'assurance, la totalit\u00e9 de la perte subie, le caract\u00e8re accidentel du sinistre, la perte de $40,000 en r\u00e9sultant, et le droit de l'appelant de lui r\u00e9clamer les sommes de $8,000 et $2,000, pour la perte de l'immeuble et des meubles, respectivement. Pour seule et unique d\u00e9fense, l'intim\u00e9e plaida que l'action \u00e9tait pr\u00e9matur\u00e9e, all\u00e9guant au soutien de ce moyen, dans un amendement fait \u00e0 l'issue de l'enqu\u00eate, qu'elle n'avait pas re\u00e7u les formules de preuve de perte.\nLa Cour sup\u00e9rieure, acceptant le t\u00e9moignage de Me LaMarsh, consid\u00e9ra que ces formules, dont copie \u00e9tait d\u00e9pos\u00e9e en preuve, avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 compl\u00e9t\u00e9es, sign\u00e9es et asserment\u00e9es, puis remises au service des postes dans une enveloppe affranchie, \u00e0 l'adresse de Callaghan. L'intim\u00e9e fut donc condamn\u00e9e \u00e0 payer \u00e0 l'appelant la somme de $10,000.\nPar une d\u00e9cision majoritaire, la Cour d'Appel2 cassa ce jugement. En substance et s'appuyant sur les clauses 13 et 17 de l'art. 240 du c. 299, S.R.Q. 1941 et sur l'art. 2478 C.C., on jugea que l'assur\u00e9 ne pouvait\u2014sauf renonciation expresse ou tacite de la part de la compagnie intim\u00e9e\u2014poursuivre cette derni\u00e8re sans lui avoir remis ces preuves de perte; que l'affirmation de Me LaMarsh quant \u00e0 la mise \u00e0 la poste de la lettre adress\u00e9e au repr\u00e9sentant autoris\u00e9 de la compagnie ne pouvait faire preuve \"de la remise (delivery)\" des formules de preuve de perte \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e ou \u00e0 son repr\u00e9sentant si, en effet, ceux-ci, comme ils en ont t\u00e9moign\u00e9, ne les ont jamais re\u00e7ues. On consid\u00e9ra \u00e9galement que l'assur\u00e9 ne pouvait invoquer une renonciation expresse ou tacite de la part de la compagnie sans l'avoir all\u00e9gu\u00e9e dans ses proc\u00e9dures. Suivant la loi r\u00e9gissant le contrat d'assurance intervenu entre les parties, l'assureur avait droit d'exiger la remise (delivery) des preuves de perte. Cette position, il pouvait la modifier ou autoriser un agent nomm\u00e9 par lui \u00e0 ce faire. Et voil\u00e0 bien, \u00e0 mon avis, ce qui s'est produit en l'esp\u00e8ce. Me LaMarsh n'avait pas \u00e0 questionner le mandat et l'enti\u00e8re discr\u00e9tion qu'en sa lettre du 3 avril, Callaghan lui d\u00e9non\u00e7ait avoir re\u00e7us de la compagnie. Dans l'ex\u00e9cution de ce mandat et l'exercice de cette discr\u00e9tion, Callaghan invitait virtuellement, par sa lettre, Me LaMarsh \u00e0 lui retourner les formules par le service des postes, interm\u00e9diaire dont lui-m\u00eame s'\u00e9tait servi pour les lui envoyer. A cela s'arr\u00eatait l'obligation de Me LaMarsh et, \u00e0 cette obligation, il s'est conform\u00e9.\nDans Magann v. Auger3, cette Cour, pour r\u00e9soudre une question de juridiction territoriale, eut \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer l'endroit o\u00f9 s'\u00e9tait form\u00e9 un contrat, enti\u00e8rement n\u00e9goci\u00e9 par correspondance, par la pr\u00e9cision du moment o\u00f9 s'\u00e9tait fait l'accord des volont\u00e9s. Apr\u00e8s examen de la doctrine en France, M. le Juge Taschereau, rendant le jugement pour la Cour, vint \u00e0 la conclusion que la loi du Qu\u00e9bec, sur la question, \u00e9tait la m\u00eame qu'en Angleterre, qu'il n'\u00e9tait pas n\u00e9cessaire pour la perfection du contrat que l'acceptation de l'offre soit parvenue \u00e0 la connaissance de celui qui l'avait faite, et que le contrat s'\u00e9tait form\u00e9 au moment et au lieu o\u00f9 l'acceptation, de l'offre faite par la poste, avait elle-m\u00eame \u00e9t\u00e9 mise \u00e0 la poste. On consid\u00e9ra, ainsi que s'en exprime subs\u00e9quemment M. le Juge en chef Anglin dans Charlebois v. Baril4, que celui qui fait une offre en utilisant le service des postes constitue ce service comme son agent pour recevoir l'acceptation et la lui transmettre. C'est l\u00e0 le principe sur lequel se fonde juridiquement la d\u00e9cision. La livraison tardive ou la perte subs\u00e9quente de la lettre manifestant l'accord des volont\u00e9s n'affecte en rien la validit\u00e9 du principe et de son jeu. Ceci on l'affirme et en donne la raison dans Household Fire Insurance Co. v. Grant5, dans les termes suivants:\nAs soon as the letter of acceptance is delivered to the post office, the contract is made as complete and final and absolutely binding as if the acceptor himself had put his letter into the hands of a messenger sent by the offerer himself as his agent to deliver the offer and receive the acceptance.\nDans Henthorn v. Fraser6, Lord Herschell formule la r\u00e8gle comme suit:\nWhere the circumstances are such that it must have been within the contemplation of the parties that, according to the ordinary usages of mankind, the post might be used as a means of communicating the acceptance of an offer, the acceptance is complete as soon as it is posted.\nEt on trouve, sur la question, le commentaire ci-apr\u00e8s dans Anson's Law of Contract, 21e \u00e9d., \u00e0 la page 47:\nOne of the more obvious consequences of this rule is that the offeror must bear the risk of the letter of acceptance going astray. Indeed, it is sometimes said that there is a general rule that where the offeror either expressly or impliedly indicates the mode of acceptance, and this, as a means of communication, proves to be nugatory or insufficient, he does so at his own risk.\nSans doute il ne s'agit pas ici de la formation d'un contrat mais d'une modification, sugg\u00e9r\u00e9e et accept\u00e9e, aux conditions de son ex\u00e9cution. Appr\u00e9ci\u00e9e dans l'arri\u00e8re-plan de toutes les circonstances particuli\u00e8res \u00e0 cette cause, la lettre de Callaghan \u00e0 Me LaMarsh permettait raisonnablement \u00e0 ce dernier de consid\u00e9rer que l'assureur \u00e9tait satisfait que les preuves de perte soient confi\u00e9es au service des postes, auquel il s'en remettait enti\u00e8rement pour en obtenir livraison. Le silence et l'inaction de la compagnie intim\u00e9e et de son mandataire, tous deux notoirement notifi\u00e9s par avocat de la volont\u00e9 de l'assur\u00e9 d'exiger l'ex\u00e9cution du contrat, aussi bien que la nature de l'unique moyen plaid\u00e9 en d\u00e9fense \u00e0 l'action, sont, dans le cas qui nous occupe, incompatibles avec la bonne foi qui doit pr\u00e9sider \u00e0 l'ex\u00e9cution de ce contrat d'assurance.\nComme M. le Juge St-Jacques, dissident en Cour d'Appel, je suis d'avis que le dispositif du jugement de premi\u00e8re instance est bien fond\u00e9.\nQuant au motif de proc\u00e9dure invoqu\u00e9, comme d\u00e9j\u00e0 mentionn\u00e9, par l'un des Juges de la majorit\u00e9, je ne crois pas, en toute d\u00e9f\u00e9rence, qu'il y ait lieu de le retenir. Au para. 8 de la d\u00e9claration, le demandeur a suffisamment indiqu\u00e9 \u00e0 la compagnie d\u00e9fenderesse les faits dont il entendait se pr\u00e9valoir pour inf\u00e9rer en droit la renonciation de la compagnie \u00e0 s'en tenir rigidement \u00e0 la loi r\u00e9gissant le contrat en ce qui concerne la production des preuves de perte. Ces faits, l'intim\u00e9e en connaissait tous les d\u00e9tails; c'\u00e9tait les siens ou, et \u00e0 son enti\u00e8re connaissance, ceux de son agent. L'intim\u00e9e n'a fait d'ailleurs aucune objection \u00e0 la preuve de ces faits.\nJe maintiendrais l'appel, r\u00e9tablirais le jugement de premi\u00e8re instance, avec d\u00e9pens, tant en cette Cour qu'en Cour d'Appel.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nAttorneys for the plaintiff, appellant: Garmaise & McNally, Rouyn-Noranda.\nAttorney for the defendant, respondent: Philippe Pothier, St. Hyacinthe.\n1 [1959] Que.

The first of a series of questions submitted for the consideration of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia, in a case stated for the opinion of the Court, asked if the Public Utilities Commission of that Province was right in deciding \"that no one of the matters and things referred to in clauses (a) and (b) of subsection (1) of Section 16 of the \"Public Utilities Act\" should as a matter of law be given priority over any other of those matters or things and that, if a conflict arises among these matters or things, it is the Commission's duty to act to the best of its discretion.\"\nThe question was answered in the affirmative. The appellant appealed from that portion of the judgment of the Court of Appeal which comprised this answer.\nHeld (Kerwin C.J. dissenting): The appeal should be allowed.\nPer Locke J.: There is an absolute obligation on the part of the Commission on the application of the utility to approve rates which will produce the fair return to which the utility has been found entitled, and the obligation to have due regard to the protection of the public is also to be discharged. It is not a question of considering priorities between \"the matters and things referred to in clauses (a) and (b) of subsection (1) of s. 16\", but consideration of these matters is to be given by the Commission in the light of the fact that the obligation to approve rates which will give a fair and reasonable return is absolute.\nPer Cartwright, Martland and Ritchie JJ.: The combined effect of the two clauses referred to is that the Commission, when dealing with a rate case, has unlimited discretion as to the matters which it may consider as affecting the rate, but it must when actually setting the rate, meet the requirements specifically mentioned in clause (b), i.e., the rate to be imposed should be neither excessive for the service nor insufficient to provide a fair return on the rate base. These two factors should be given priority over any other matters which the Commission may consider.\nAlthough there is no priority directed by the Act as between these two matters, there is a duty imposed on the Commission to have due regard to both of them, and accordingly there must be a balancing of the interests concerned.\nPer Kerwin C.J., dissenting: The statute does not require that any weight be given to the matters and things referred to in the two clauses after they have been considered, and therefore the weight to be assigned is a question of fact for the Commission to decide in each instance.\nAPPEAL from a portion of a judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1], comprising the answer to the first of five questions submitted to it by the Public Utilities Commission. Appeal allowed, Kerwin C.J. dissenting.\nJ. W. de B. Farris, Q.C., A. Bruce Robertson, Q.C., and R. R. Dodd, for the appellant; J. A. Clark, Q.C., for The Public Utilities Commission of British Columbia, respondent;\nT. P. O'Grady, for The Corporation of The City of Victoria, The Corporation of The District of Oak Bay, The Corporation of the District of Saanich and Corporation of The Township of Esquimalt, respondents;\nR. K. Baker, for City of Vancouver, respondent.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE (dissenting):\u2014Pursuant to s. 107 of the Public Utilities Act of British Columbia, R.S.B.C. 1948, c. 277, the Public Utilities Commission stated a case for the opinion of the Court of Appeal for that Province. The case was stated in respect of five questions but we are concerned only with Question 1 as, by order of this Court, British Columbia Electric Railway Company, Limited was granted leave to appeal only from that portion of the judgment of the Court of Appeal comprising the answer given thereto. That question is as follows:\n1. (a) Was the Commission right in deciding as appears in the said Reasons for Decision of 14th July, 1958, that no one of the matters and things referred to in clauses (a) and (b) of subsection (1) of Section 16 of the \"Public Utilities Act\" should as a matter of law be given priority over any other of those matters or things and that, if a conflict arises among these matters or things, it is the Commission's duty to act to the best of its discretion?\n(b) If the answer to question (1) (a) is \"No\", what decision should the Commission have reached on the point?\nThe Court's answer to Question 1 reads:\nThe Commission was right in deciding as appears in its Reasons for Decision of 14th July, 1958 that no one of the matters and things referred to in clauses (a) and (b) of subsection (1) of Section 16 of the Public Utilities Act R.S.B.C. 1948, chapter 277 should as a matter of law be given priority over any other of those matters or things and that, if a conflict arises among these matters or things, it is the Commission's duty to act to the best of its discretion.\nAt the conclusion of the argument the judgment of the Court of Appeal appeared to me to be correct and further consideration has confirmed me in that view. Reasons were given by Sheppard J.A. on behalf of himself and the other four members of the Court who heard the argument on the stated case. I adopt all that he said and would have nothing to add were it not for an argument presented on behalf of the appellant. Section 16(1)(a) and (b) read as follows:\n16. (1) In fixing any rate:\u2014\n(a) The Commission shall consider all matters which it deems proper as affecting the rate:\n(b) The Commission shall have due regard, among other things, to the protection of the public from rates that are excessive as being more than a fair and reasonable charge for services of the nature and quality furnished by the public utility; and to giving to the public utility a fair and reasonable return upon the appraised value of the property of the public utility used, or prudently and reasonably acquired, to enable the public utility to furnish the service:\nMr. Farris submitted that the Court of Appeal had not taken into consideration the words in (1) (b) \"The Commission shall have due regard\u2026\u2026.and to giving to the public utility a fair and reasonable return upon the appraised value of the property of the public utility used, or prudently and reasonably acquired, to enable the public utility to furnish the service:\". However, I am satisfied upon a review of the reasons of Sheppard J.A., relevant to Question 1, and particularly of the extract transcribed below, which is the substance of his reasoning upon the matter, that he did consider and apply these words. The extract reads:\nA further inquiry is what weight should be given to the matters required to be considered by Sec. 16 (1) (b) and particularly to the \"fair and reasonable return\". Under Sec. 16 (1) (b), the Commission is required to consider \"the protection of the public\" and the \"giving to the public utility a fair and reasonable return\". Although clauses (a) and (b) of Sec. 16 (1) require certain matters to be considered, they do not state what weight is to be assigned by the Commission. Consequently, the Statute requires only that the Commission consider the matters falling within Sec; 16 (1) (a), namely, \"all matters which it deems proper as affecting the rate\" and those falling within Sec. 16 (1) (b), namely, \"the protection of the public\" and \"a fair and reasonable return\" to the Utility. But the Statute does not require more, and does not require any weight to be given to these matters after they have been considered. Hence the weight to be assigned is outside any statutory requirement and must be a question of fact for the Commission in each instance.\nFurthermore, as Mr. Clark pointed out, the Commission when dealing with the electric rates applications, had, under heading \"III.\u2014A Fair Return\", discussed that subject; and that in their reasons for decision with reference to the transit fares applications the Commission speaks \"of the misunderstanding which arose from the recent decision on electric rates\"; and that later, in the same paragraph, they said: \"The 6.5% rate remains the standard of the fair and reasonable return to which the Commission has due regard\".\nThe appeal should be dismissed but there should be no costs.\nLOCKE J.:\u2014The sections of the Public Utilities Act, R.S.B.C. 1948, c. 277, which must be considered in deciding the first question are quoted in the reasons of my brother Martland which I have had the advantage of reading.\nThe real question might have been stated more clearly had it asked whether as a matter of law a duty rested upon the Commission to approve rates which would produce for the appellant a fair and reasonable return upon the appraised value of the property used or prudently and reasonably acquired by it to enable it to furnish the service described in the Act when the fact as to what constituted a fair return had previously been determined by the Commission. This is the matter to be determined.\nSome assistance in interpreting the sections of the Act is to be obtained by an examination of the earlier legislation dealing with the control of rates charged for electrical power in British Columbia.\nThe first statutory provision dealing with the matter appears in the Water Act Amendment Act of 1929 which appeared as c. 67 of the statutes of that year. This Act provided for the control of such rates and imposed upon a power company producing electrical energy by water power the duty of supplying electrical energy to the public in the manner defined. Power companies were required to file schedules of their tolls with the Water Board constituted under the Water Act, R.S.B.C. 1924, c. 271.\n\"Unjust and unreasonable\" as applied to tolls was declared to include injustice and unreasonableness, whether arising from the fact that the tolls were insufficient to yield fair compensation for the service rendered or from the fact that they were excessive as being more than a fair and reasonable charge for service of the nature and quality furnished.\nSection 141B authorized the Board upon the complaint of any person interested that a toll charge was unjust, unreasonable or unduly discriminatory to enquire into the matter, to disallow any rate found to be excessive, and to fix the tolls to be charged by the power company for its service or respecting the improvement of the service in such manner as the Board considered just and reasonable.\nSection 141C read:\nEvery power company shall be entitled to a fair return on the value of all property acquired by it and used in providing service to the public of the nature and kind furnished by such power company or reasonably held by such power company for use in such service and the Board in determining any toll shall have due regard to that principle.\nSection 141D read in part:\nIn considering any complaint and making any order respecting the tolls to be charged by any power company the Board shall have due regard, among other things, to allowing the company a fair return upon the value of the property of the company referred to in Clause 141C and to the protection of the public from tolls that are excessive as being more than a fair and reasonable charge for services of the nature and quality furnished by the company.\nThese amendments to the Water Act appeared as ss. 138 to 157 in the Revision of the Statutes of 1936 and these sections were repealed when the first Public Utilities Act was passed by the Legislature, c. 47 of the statutes of 1938.\nIt will be seen by an examination of the Public Utilities Act that in large measure the language of the amendments to the Water Act made in 1929 was adopted. The definition of the terms \"unjust\" and \"unreasonable\", which appeared in the 1929 amendment as part of s. 2, was reproduced in s. 2 of the Act of 1938. The prohibition against levying any unjust and unreasonable, unduly discriminatory or unduly preferential rate appearing as s. 8 of the Public Utilities Act merely expresses in slightly different terms the prohibition contained in s. 141B. The expression \"shall have due regard\" which appears in s. 16(1) (b) of the Public Utilities Act was apparently taken from ss. 141C and D.\nThe Public Utilities Act, however, did not, when first enacted, and does not now contain any section which declares in express terms, as did s. 141C of the Water Act Amendment Act, that the power company shall be entitled to a fair return on the value of its property. Had the present Act contained such a provision it appears to me to be perfectly clear that the answer to be made to the first question should differ from that given by the Court of Appeal. Whether its omission affects the matter is to be determined.\nAs it has been pointed out, the utility in the present matter is required by the Act to maintain its property in such condition as to enable it to supply an adequate service to the public and to furnish that service to all persons who may be reasonably entitled thereto without discrimination and without delay. It may not discontinue its operations without the permission of the Public Utilities Commission. The utility has, so far as we are informed, a monopoly on the sale of electrical energy in the Cities of Vancouver and Victoria and in my opinion at common law the duty thus cast upon it by statute would have entitled it to be paid fair and reasonable charges for the services rendered in the absence of any statutory provision for such payment.\nI consider that, in this respect, the position of such a utility would be similar to that of a common carrier upon whom is imposed as a matter of law the duty of transporting goods tendered to him for transport at fair and reasonable rates. This has been so from very early times. In Bastard v. Bastard[2], in an action against a common carrier in the Court of King's Bench for the loss of a box delivered to him for carriage, in delivering judgment for the plaintiff it was said that, while there was no particular agreement as to the amount to be paid for the carriage, \"then the carrier might have a quantum meruit for his hire\".\nIn Great Western Railway v. Sutton[3], Blackburn J. said in part:\nThe obligation which the common law imposed upon him was to accept and carry all goods delivered to him for carriage according to his profession (unless he had some reasonable excuse for not doing so) on being paid a reasonable compensation for so doing.\nThe result of the authorities appears to me to be correctly summarized in Browne's Law of Carriers, at p. 42, where it is said:\nWe have already seen that the law imposes very onerous duties, and very considerable risks, upon a person who is designated a common carrier. As to his duty, he is bound by law to undertake the carriage of goods. Another man is free from any such duty until he has entered into a special agreement; but the law holds that the common carrier, by the very fact of his trade and business, has, on his side, entered into an agreement with the public to carry goods, which becomes at once a complete and binding contract when any person brings him the goods, and makes the request that he should carry them to a certain person or place. To make such a contract binding upon him as a common carrier, it is not necessary that a specific sum of money should be promised or agreed upon; but where that is not the case, there is an implied undertaking upon the part of the bailor that the remuneration shall be reasonable.\nThe Water Act Amendment Act of 1929 appears to have followed closely the form of public utilities legislation in certain of the United States. There had been statutes of this nature in force in various parts of the Union for a considerable time prior to the year 1929.\nI do not find that the American statutes generally declared in terms as did s. 141C of the Water Act Amendment Act that a power company providing service to the public should be entitled to a fair return on the value of all property acquired by it and used in providing service to the public. This method, however, of establishing a fair and reasonable rate would appear to have been followed universally.\nThe authorities in the American cases are to be found summarized in Nichols\u2014Ruling Principles of Utility Regulation, at p. 49\u2014where a passage from the judgment of the Supreme Court of the United States in Bluefield Water Works & Improvement Co. v. West Virginia Public Service Commission[4] is quoted reading:\nRates which are not sufficient to yield a reasonable return on the value of the property used at the time it is being used to render the service are unjust, unreasonable, and confiscatory, and their enforcement deprives the public utility company of its property in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. This is so well settled by numerous decisions of this court that citation of the cases is scarcely necessary.\nIn New Jersey Public Utility Commissioners v. New York Telephone Company[5], Butler J. said:\nThe just compensation safeguarded to the utility by the Fourteenth Amendment is a reasonable return on the value of the property used at the time that it is being used for public service. And rates not sufficient to yield that return are confiscatory.\nWhile without the provision made in s. 141C of the Water Act Amendment Act a power company compelled by the amendment to furnish electrical service on demand upon the conditions prescribed would in my opinion have been entitled to a fair and reasonable payment for such service, the Legislature, by s. 141C, defined the manner in which fair and reasonable rates should be established.\nAs I have said, the Public Utilities Act does not contain any provision which in terms declares the right of the utility to a fair return on the value of its property. It does, however, by the definition of the terms \"unjust\" and \"unreasonable\" adopted from the Water Act Amendment Act declare that these expressions include rates that are insufficient to yield fair compensation for the service rendered, and the Public Utilities Commission in the present matter have interpreted this in its context as indicating the yardstick to be used in determining the fair and reasonable return to which the appellant was entitled.\nUnder the powers given to the Commission by s. 45 of the Act the value of the property of the appellant used, or prudently or reasonably acquired to enable the company to furnish its services was determined as at December 31st, 1942, and since then has been kept up to date. On September 11th, 1952, the Commission, after public hearings, decided that until some change in the financial and market circumstances convinced the Commission that a different rate should be applied, the Commission would apply the rate of 6.5 per cent. on the rate base as a fair and reasonable rate of return for the company.\nThat decision remains unchanged and is not questioned by anyone in these proceedings.\nIn interpreting the statute, the position at common law of the utility after the repeal of the sections of the Water Act must be considered. Had the statute imposed upon the appellant the obligation to furnish service of the natures defined upon demand, without more, it would have been entitled as a matter of law to recover from a person demanding service reasonable and fair compensation. It will not in my opinion be presumed that it was the intention of the Legislature to deprive a utility of that common law right. In Colonial Sugar Refining Company v. Melbourne Harbour Trust Commissioners[6], the Judicial Committee said:\nIn considering the construction and effect of this Act the Board is guided by the well known principle that a statute should not be held to take away private rights of property without compensation, unless the intention to do so is expressed in clear and unambiguous terms.\nIn Maxwell on Statutes, 10th ed., at p. 286, the authorities are thus summarized:\nProprietary rights should not be held to be taken away by Parliament without provision for compensation unless the legislature has so provided in clear terms. It is presumed, where the objects of the Act do not obviously imply such an intention, that the legislature does not desire to confiscate the property or to encroach upon the right of persons, and it is therefore expected that, if such be its intention, it will manifest it plainly, if not in express words at least by clear implication and beyond reasonable doubt.\nSubsection 6 of s. 23 of the Interpretation Act, R.S.B.C. 1948, c. 1, directs that every Act shall receive such fair, large and liberal construction and interpretation as will best ensure the attainment of the object of the Act. In my opinion the true meaning of the relevant sections of the Public Utilities Act is that a utility is given a statutory right to the approval of rates which will afford to it fair compensation for the services rendered and that the quantum of that compensation is to be a fair and reasonable rate of return upon the appraised value of the property of the company referred to in s. 16(1) (b).\nThe appellant in addition to the sale of electrical energy operates a public transportation system and sells gas and by an Order-in-Council made under the provisions of s. 15(1) (c) of the Statutes of 1938 it was directed that these three categories of service should be considered as one unit in fixing the rates. In the reasons delivered by the Commission upon the application to increase the rates for electricity, it is said that the appellant has never earned the approved rate of return and that the rates proposed by it, and which were not approved, would not enable it to do so even in respect of the electrical system alone. Rates that fail to yield fair compensation for the service rendered are declared by s. 2 to be unjust and unreasonable as they were by s. 2 of the Water Act Amendment Act of 1929. The Commission is directed by s. 16(1) (b) to have due regard to fixing a rate which will give to the utility a fair and reasonable return upon the appraised value of its property used or prudently and reasonably acquired to enable it to furnish the service. It is the inclusion of the expression \"shall have due regard\" which has led the Commission and the Court of Appeal to conclude that this means that allowing a fair return upon the appraised value is simply one of the matters to be considered by the Commission in fixing the rate. Clearly no such interpretation could have been placed upon this expression under the provisions of the Water Act in view of the express provisions of s. 141C, and with great respect I think no such interpretation should be given to it in the present statute.\nThe fair compensation referred to in s. 2 of the Water Act Amendment Act of 1929 referred, and could only refer, to an aggregate produced by tolls sufficient to yield to the power company the fair return on the value of its property to which s. 141C declared it was entitled. The fair compensation referred to in s. 2 of the Public Utilities Act is in its context, in my opinion, to be construed in the same manner. The Order of the Commission of September 11th, 1952, determined what that compensation should be. The rates to be put into force to yield such fair compensation, which, at least in the case of electricity, vary in accordance with the use to which it is put and the quantities purchased, are matters to be determined by the Commission. The direction to the Commission in s. 16(1) (b) to have due regard to the protection of the public from rates that are excessive as being more than a fair and reasonable charge for the services requires it, in my opinion, to approve rates which are in its judgment fair and reasonable having in mind the purpose for which the electricity is used, the quantities purchased and such other matters as it considers justify the approval of rates which differ for different users.\nI can find nothing in this legislation indicating an intention on the part of the Legislature to empower the Commission to deprive the utility of its common law right to be paid fair compensation for the varying services rendered or to depart from the declared intention of the Legislature in the Water Act Amendment Act that such companies upon whom these obligations are imposed are entitled to have the quantum of such fair compensation determined as a fair return upon the appraised value of the properties required.\nI do not think it is possible to define what constitutes a fair return upon the property of utilities in a manner applicable to all cases or that it is expedient to attempt to do so. It is a continuing obligation that rests upon such a utility to provide what the Commission regards as adequate service in supplying not only electricity but transportation and gas, to maintain its properties in a satisfactory state to render adequate service and to provide extensions to these services when, in the opinion of the Commission, such are necessary. In coming to its conclusion as to what constituted a fair return to be allowed to the appellant these matters as well as the undoubted fact that the earnings must be sufficient, if the company was to discharge these statutory duties, to enable it to pay reasonable dividends and attract capital, either by the sale of shares or securities, were of necessity considered. Once that decision was made it was, in my opinion, the duty of the Commission imposed by the statute to approve rates which would enable the company to earn such a return or such lesser return as it might decide to ask. As the reasons delivered by the Commission show, the present appellant did not ask the approval of rates which would yield a return of 6.5 per cent. to which it was entitled under the Order of the Board.\nI do not consider that Question (1) can be answered by a simple affirmative or negative. The obligation to approve rates which will produce the fair return to which the utility has been found entitled is, in my opinion, absolute, which does not mean that the obligation of the Commission to have due regard to the protection of the public, as required by s. 16(1) (b), is not to be discharged. It is not a question of considering priorities between \"the matters and things referred to in Clauses (a) and (b) of subsection (1) of s. 16\". The Commission is directed by s. 16(1) (a) to consider all matters which it deems proper as affecting the rate but that consideration is to be given in the light of the fact that the obligation to approve rates which will give a fair and reasonable return is absolute. In my opinion the answer to be made to Question (1) (a) is that the Commission was wrong in deciding that it was not required to approve rates which in the aggregate would produce for the utility the fair return which by its order of September 11, 1952, the Commission found it to be entitled or such lower rates as the utility might submit for approval. The duty of the Commission to have due regard to the protection of the public from excessive rates referred to in the first four lines of s. 16(1) (b) refers to the approval of rates according to the use to be made by and the quantities supplied to those to whom the service is rendered.\nThe second part of Question (1) reads:\nIf the answer to (1)(a) is \"No\", what decision should the Commission have reached on the point?\nAs to this I agree with the answer proposed by my brother Martland.\nI would allow this appeal but make no order as to costs.\nThe judgment of Cartwright, Martland and Ritchie JJ. was delivered by\nMARTLAND J.:\u2014Pursuant to the provisions of subs. (1) of s. 107 of the Public Utilities Act of British Columbia, R.S.B.C. 1948, c. 277, the Public Utilities Commission of that Province stated a case for the opinion of the Court of Appeal of British Columbia. Five questions were submitted for the consideration of the Court, of which the first was as follows:\n(1) (a) Was the Commission right in deciding as appears in the said Reasons for Decision of 14th July, 1958, that no one of the matters and things referred to in clauses (a) and (b) of subsection (1) of Section 16 of the \"Public Utilities Act\" should as a matter of law be given priority over any other of those matters or things and that, if a conflict arises among these matters or things, it is the Commission's duty to act to the best of its discretion?\n(b) If the answer to question (1) (a) is \"No\", what decision should the Commission have reached on the point?\nQuestion (1) (a) was answered in the affirmative. The appellant, by special leave of this Court, has appealed from that portion of the judgment of the Court of Appeal which comprises the answer given by it to question (1). The other four questions and the answers given to them are not in issue in this appeal. The relevant circumstances involved are contained in the case stated by the Public Utilities Commission and are as follows:\nThe appellant and British Columbia Electric Company Limited (together called \"the Company\") are related companies and between them own and operate equipment and facilities for the transportation of persons and property by railway, trolley coach and motor buses and for the production, generation and furnishing of gas and electricity, all for the public for compensation.\nThe Company is regulated by the Public Utilities Commission of British Columbia (called \"the Commission\") pursuant to the provisions of the Public Utilities Act.\nBy appraisal the Commission ascertained the value of the property of the Company used, or prudently and reasonably acquired, to enable the Company to furnish its services. The appraisal was made as of December 31, 1942, and since then has been kept up to date. The appraised value is referred to as \"the rate base\".\nBy Order-in-Council No. 1627, approved on July 16, 1948, the Commission was directed to consider the classes or categories of the regulated services of the Company as one unit in fixing the rates.\nOn September 11, 1952, the Commission after public hearing made \"Findings as to Rate of Return\" and decided that, \"until changed financial and market circumstances convince the Commission that a different rate should be applied, the Commission will in its continuing examination of the Company's operations apply the rate of 6.5%\" on the rate base as a fair and reasonable rate of return for the Company. This decision remains unchanged.\nThe Company from time to time amended its rate schedules with the consent of the Commission and filed with the Commission schedules showing the rates so established. On April 23, 1958, it applied for the consent of the Commission, under s. 17 of the Public Utilities Act, to file amended schedules containing increased rates for its electric service on the Mainland and on Vancouver Island. On July 28, 1958, it also applied for the consent of the Commission to file amended schedules containing increased transit fares for its transit systems in Vancouver and other Mainland areas and in Victoria and surrounding areas. Public hearings were held by the Commission and it handed down its decision with respect to the electric applications on July 14, 1958, and with respect to the transit applications on October 30, 1958.\nBriefly, the decisions of the Commission accepted the proposed rate schedules submitted by the Company, except that it refused to approve the proposed increases in the principal residential electric rates on the Mainland and on Vancouver Island. It directed that those rates be scaled down by approximately 25%. In its decision with respect to electric rates the Commission stated:\nThe Commission has therefore consented to the filing to be effective July 15th, 1958, of all the rate schedules submitted by the Company for the Mainland and Vancouver Island, as modified and supplemented by the Company during the course of the hearings on its application, except the residential rate schedules and Mainland Rate 3035 for industrial users.\nThe Commission has decided that the principal residential rate on the Mainland (Schedule 1109) and the principal residential rate on the Island (Schedule 1110 under which the principal divisions are Billing Codes 1110 and 1112) should be adjusted to yield not more than three-quarters of the additional revenue proposed. The adjustment must be applied primarily to reduce sharp changes in impact and lessen disproportionately large percentage increases in the consumption range of 60 KWH to 280 KWH per month. Comparable adjustments must also be made in some of the related special residential rates of lesser importance. Most of the relief would be given to the small residential user.\nAt the same time the Commission decided that further increases in the commercial and industrial rates to compensate for this reduction in the proposed residential rates would not be justified.\nDuring the hearings it was contended by counsel for the Company that, the Commission, having determined on a fair and reasonable return to the Company, namely, 6.5%, the Commission should authorize rates which would yield that return, or whatever lesser return the Company's application requested for the time being. The Commission did not accept this contention and the rates which were approved by the Commission would yield approximately $750,000 less per annum than those applied for by the Company would yield. The rates for which the Company sought approval themselves would not have yielded to the Company the full allowed rate of return of 6.5%.\nThe relevant portions of s. 16(1) of the Public Utilities Act provide as follows:\n16. (1) In fixing any rate:\u2014 (a) The Commission shall consider all matters which it deems proper as affecting the rate:\n(b) The Commission shall have due regard, among other things, to the protection of the public from rates that are excessive as being more than a fair and reasonable charge for services of the nature and quality furnished by the public utility; and to giving to the public utility a fair and reasonable return upon the appraised value of the property of the public utility used, or prudently and reasonably acquired, to enable the public utility to furnish the service:\n(c) Where the public utility furnishes more than one class of service, the Commission shall segregate the various kinds of service into distinct classes or categories of service; and for the purpose of fixing the rate to be charged for the service rendered, each distinct class or category of service shall be considered as a self-contained unit, and the rates fixed for each unit shall be such as are considered just and reasonable for that unit without regard to the rates fixed for any other unit. If it is considered by the Lieutenant-Governor in Council that the rates as so determined might be inequitable or contrary to the general public interest, the Lieutenant-Governor in Council may direct that two or more classes or categories of service shall be considered as one unit in fixing the rate:\nIn the reasons given for its decision the Commission deals with the effect of clauses (a) and (b) of s. 16(1) and says:\nWith great respect, the Commission considers that although for this purpose the statutory duty of the Commission to have due regard to all matters which the Commission deems proper as affecting the rate might without any significant inaccuracy be described as the right of the Commission, and its statutory duty to have due regard to giving the utility a fair and reasonable return might without significant inaccuracy be described as the Commission's responsibility for giving the utility a fair and reasonable return, there is nothing in the Act to relieve the Commission in the case now before it from complying with the language of the Act and giving due regard to all those matters to which the legislature has directed the Commission to give due regard in fixing a rate. No one of those matters should, in the opinion of the Commission, be given as a matter of law priority over any other of those matters and if, as the legislature appears to have thought possible, a conflict arises among those matters, the Commission considers that it is its duty to act to the best of its discretion.\nThe Court of Appeal concurred in this view. The judgment of the Court[7], delivered by Sheppard J.A., refers to this question in the following words:\nA further inquiry is what weight should be given to the matters required to be considered by Sec. 16(1) (b) and particularly to the \"fair and reasonable return\". Under Sec. 16(1) (b), the Commission is required to consider \"the protection of the public\" and the \"giving to the public utility a fair and reasonable return\". Although clauses (a) and (b) of Sec. 16(1) require certain matters to be considered, they do not state what weight is to be assigned by the Commission. Consequently, the Statute requires only that the Commission consider the matters falling within Sec. 16(1) (a), namely, \"all matters which it deems proper as affecting the rate\" and those falling within Sec. 16(1) (b), namely, \"the protection of the public\" and \"a fair and reasonable return\" to the Utility. But the Statute does not require more, and does not require any weight to be given to these matters after they have been considered. Hence the weight to be assigned is outside any statutory requirement and must be a question of fact for the Commission in each instance.\nFrom this decision the present appeal is brought.\nTo determine the intent and meaning of clauses (a) and (b) of s. 16(1) of the Act it is necessary to consider them in relation to the other provisions of the Act, with which they must be read.\nSection 5 imposes upon a public utility the duty to maintain its property and equipment in such condition as to enable it to furnish, and to furnish, service to the public in all respects adequate, safe, efficient, just and reasonable. Section 7 prevents a public utility which has been granted a certificate of public convenience and necessity or a franchise from ceasing its operations or any part of them without first obtaining the permission of the Commission.\nSection 6 requires every public utility, upon reasonable notice, to furnish to all persons who may apply therefor, and be reasonably entitled thereto, suitable service without discrimination and without delay.\nSections 38, 42 and 43 contain provisions whereby, in the circumstances therein defined, a public utility may be ordered by the Commission to extend its existing services.\nThese four sections last mentioned involve a statutory obligation on the part of a public utility to make capital outlays for extensions of its service. A public utility which operates in a rapidly expanding community may be required to make substantial expenditures of that nature in order to keep pace with increasing demands. It must, if it is to fulfil those obligations, be able to obtain the necessary capital which is required, which it can only do if it is obtaining a fair rate of return upon its rate base. The meaning of a fair return was defined by Lamont J. in Northwestern Utilities, Limited v. City of Edmonton[8]:\nBy a fair return is meant that the company will be allowed as large a return on the capital invested in its enterprise (which will be net to the company) as it would receive if it were investing the same amount in other securities possessing an attractiveness, stability and certainty equal to that of the company's enterprise.\nThe necessity for giving a public utility fair compensation for the service which it renders appears in the definition of the words \"unjust\" and \"unreasonable\" in s. 2(1), which is as follows:\n\"Unjust\" and \"unreasonable\" as applied to rates shall be construed to include respectively injustice and unreasonableness, whether arising from the fact that rates are excessive as being more than a fair and reasonable charge for service of the nature and quality furnished by the public utility, or from the fact that rates are insufficient to yield fair compensation for the service rendered, or arising in any other manner:\nThe word \"service\", which appears in this definition, is defined in the Act to include:\nthe use and accommodation afforded consumers or patrons, and any product or commodity furnished by a public utility; and also includes, unless the context otherwise requires, the plant, equipment, apparatus, appliances, property, and facilities employed by or in connection with any public utility in performing any service or in furnishing any product or commodity and devoted to the purposes in which the public utility is engaged and to the use and accommodation of the public:\nThese defined words appear in two sections of the Act which relate to the rates to be charged by a public utility.\nSection 8, which is among a group of sections dealing with the duties and restrictions imposed on public utilities, provides:\n8. (1) No public utility shall make demand or receive any unjust, unreasonable, unduly discriminatory, or unduly preferential rate for any service furnished by it within the Province, or any rate otherwise in violation of law; and no public utility shall, as to rates or service, subject any person or locality, or any particular descripiton of traffic, to any undue prejudice or disadvantage, or extend to any person any form of agreement, or any rule or regulation, or any facility or privilege, except such as are regularly and uniformly extended to all persons under substantially similar circumstances and conditions in respect of service of the same description, and the Commission may by regulations declare what constitute substantially similar circumstances and conditions. (2) It shall be a question of fact, of which the Commission shall be the sole judge, whether any rate is unjust or unreasonable, or whether in any case there is undue discrimination, preference, prejudice, or disadvantage in respect of any rate or service, or whether service is offered or furnished under substantially similar circumstances and conditions. 1938, c. 47, s. 8; 1939, c 46, s. 5.\nSection 20, which empowers the Commission to determine rates, reads as follows:\n20. The Commission may upon its own motion or upon complaint that the existing rates in effect and collected or any rates charged or attempted to be charged by any public utility for any service are unjust, unreasonable, insufficient, or discriminatory, or in anywise in violation of law, after a hearing, determine the just, reasonable, and sufficient rates to be thereafter observed and in force, and shall fix the same by order. The public utility affected shall thereupon amend its schedules in conformity with the order and file amended schedules with the Commission.\nIt will be noted that this section, in addition to the use of the words \"unjust\" and \"unreasonable\", also uses the terms \"insufficient\" and \"sufficient\" in relation to rates.\nBoth of these sections contemplate a system of rates which would be fair to the consumer on the one hand and which will yield fair compensation to the public utility on the other hand.\nSection 16, the section with which we are concerned in this appeal, also deals with this matter of fairness of rates. In addition, it spells out the method by which a public utility is to obtain fair compensation for its service; i.e., by a fair and reasonable return upon its rate base, which rate base, pursuant to s. 45, the Commission can determine by appraisal.\nSection 16 deals with the duties of the Commission in fixing rates. Clause (a) of subs. (1) states that the Commission shall consider all matters which it deems proper as affecting the rate. It confers on the Commission a discretion to determine the matters which it deems proper for consideration and it requires the Commission to consider such matters.\nClause (b) of subs. (1) does not use the word \"consider\", which is used in clause (a), but directs that the Commission \"shall have due regard\", among other things, to two specific matters. These are:\n(i) The protection of the public from rates that are excessive as being more than a fair and reasonable charge for services of the nature and quality furnished by the public utility; and (ii) To giving to the public utility a fair and reasonable return upon the appraised value of its property used or prudently and reasonably acquired to enable the public utility to furnish the service.\nAs I read them, the combined effect of the two clauses is that the Commission, when dealing with a rate case, has unlimited discretion as to the matters which it may consider as affecting the rate, but that it must, when actually setting the rate, meet the two requirements specifically mentioned in clause (b). It would appear, reading ss. 8, 16 and 20 together, that the Act contemplates these two matters to be of primary importance in the fixing of rates.\nIn my opinion, therefore, these two factors should be given priority over any other matters which the Commission may consider under clause (a), or any other things to which it shall have due regard under clause (b), when it is fixing any rate.\nThe second portion of question (1) (a) was as to whether, in case of conflict among the matters and things referred to in clauses (a) and (b) of s. 16(1), it was the Commission's duty to act to the best of its discretion. I have already expressed my view regarding the priority as between those things specifically mentioned in clause (b) and the other matters or things referred to in clauses (a) and (b). This leaves the question as to possible conflict as between the two matters specifically mentioned in clause (b).\nClearly, as between these two matters there is no priority directed by the Act, but there is a duty imposed upon the Commission to have due regard to both of them. The rate to be imposed shall be neither excessive for the service nor insufficient to provide a fair return on the rate base. There must be a balancing of interests. In my view, however, if a public utility is providing an adequate and efficient service (as it is required to do by s. 5 of the Act), without incurring unnecessary, unreasonable or excessive costs in so doing, I cannot see how a schedule of rates, which, overall, yields less revenue than would be required to provide that rate of return on its rate base which the Commission has determined to be fair and reasonable, can be considered, overall, as being excessive. It may be that within the schedule certain rates may operate unfairly, relatively, as between different classes of service or different classes of consumers. If so, the Commission has the duty to prevent such discrimination. But this can be accomplished by adjustments of the relative impact of the various rates in the schedule without having to reduce the total revenues which the whole schedule of rates is designed to produce.\nAccordingly, it is my opinion that the answer to question (1) (a) should be \"No\". My answer to question (1) (b) would be that the Commission, in priority to any other matters which it may deem proper to consider under clause (a) and any of the other things referred to in clause (b) of s. 16(1), should have due regard to the two matters specifically mentioned in clause (b). In the present case, having decided that certain of the rates proposed by the appellant would impose an unreasonable burden upon certain classes of consumers, the Commission should permit the Company to submit alternative schedules of rates, which, while yielding approximately the same overall revenues, would eliminate the comparatively excessive impact of those classes of rates to which the Commission objected, until a rate schedule is devised which meets the requirements of clause (b) of s. 16(1).\nIn my view the appeal should be allowed, but no costs should be payable.\nAppeal allowed, Kerwin C.J. dissenting.\nSolicitor for the appellant: A.

C, who accepted an offer to join in the purchase, claimed that it was agreed that R should have a 50 per cent interest and that C and an associate F should each have a 25 per cent interest.\nTitle was taken in the name of a trustee P, who later, upon instructions from R, sold the claims to North Denison Mines Limited for a price which was eventually set at $15,000 plus 100,000 fully paid shares of North Denison.\nP, upon further instructions from R, and upon receiving a release from C, transferred the North Denison shares to another company which was controlled by R. In consideration of C signing the release, R waived payment of some money owed to him by C. The proceeds of these shares came into the hands of R in the form of 100,000 shares of New Denison Mines Limited, all of which were free from the terms of an escrow agreement to which 90,000 of the North Denison shares had been subject. The \u201cfree\u201d shares were later exchanged for shares of Consolidated Denison Mines Limited.\nThe $15,000 was duly accounted for; one-half being paid to R and his nominee and one\u2011half to C, who gave his own cheque to F for one-half the amount received by him. However, R did not account to F or his estate for any part of the shares.\nIn an action taken by the plaintiff trust company, on behalf of F\u2019s estate, and C, judgment was given for the trust company against R. C was unsuccessful. The Court of Appeal dismissed appeals by R and C and a cross-appeal by the trust company. R and C appealed to this Court. Held (Kerwin C.J. dissenting as to C\u2019s appeal): R\u2019s appeal should be dismissed. C\u2019s appeal should be allowed.\nPer Kerwin C.J. and Taschereau, Cartwright, Martland and Ritchie JJ.: The partnership asset or that which it had become through R\u2019s dealings was vested in R as trustee and he must account for it. Before he dealt with the shares in a manner inconsistent with the duties attaching to his fiduciary position he had knowledge of F\u2019s beneficial ownership.\nPer Taschereau, Cartwright, Martland and Ritchie JJ.: R stood in a fiduciary relationship to C as well as to F, and when he received the shares which he placed in P\u2019s name he was a constructive trustee of those shares to the extent of C\u2019s beneficial interest therein.\nR did not obtain a valid release or transfer of C\u2019s beneficial interest. He was in the position of a trustee purchasing from his cestui que trust the latter\u2019s beneficial interest in the trust property. In failing to make full disclosure to C of all the material circumstances he failed to satisfy the onus, which lay upon him, of supporting the transaction. Williams v. Scott, [1900] A.C. 499, Brickenden v. London Loan and Savings Co., [1934] 3 D.L.R. 465, referred to.\nC was entitled to the same relief as that awarded by the courts below to F\u2019s estate, subject only to R\u2019s entitlement to the amount of which he waived payment in consideration of C signing the release.\nPer Kerwin C.J. dissenting: C owed money to R and his release under seal to P, acting for R, cannot be set aside.\nAPPEALS from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, affirming a judgment of Judson J. Appeal of John D. Crighton allowed, Kerwin C.J. dissenting. Appeal of Stephen Boleslav Roman dismissed.\nC.R. Archibald, Q.C., for the plaintiff, appellant.\nJ. Sedgwick, Q.C., and J.D. Arnup, Q.C., for the defendant, respondent.\nT. Sheard, Q.C., for the plaintiff, respondent.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE (dissenting as to Crighton\u2019s appeal): I have had the advantage of reading the reasons for judgment of Cartwright J. I agree that Roman\u2019s appeal fails and should be dismissed with costs. However, I am unable to concur that Crighton\u2019s appeal should succeed as I find it impossible to dissent from the views of the trial judge and the Court of Appeal that Crighton owed money to Roman and that the release under seal by Crighton to Peacock, acting for Roman, cannot be set aside. I would, therefore, dismiss Crighton\u2019s appeal with costs. The judgment of Taschereau, Cartwright, Martland and Ritchie JJ. was delivered by\nCARTWRIGHT J.:\u2014These two appeals arise out of an action brought by The Toronto General Trusts Corporation as Executor of the estate of William Raey Featherstone, as hereinafter referred to as \u201cFeatherstone\u201d, and John D. Crighton, hereinafter referred to as \u201cCrighton\u201d, as plaintiffs, against Stephen Boleslav Roman, hereinafter referred to as \u201cRoman\u201d, and four other individuals as defendants.\nThe plaintiffs asked for numerous items of relief but we are now concerned only with the first two of these which are as follows:\n(a) The immediate transfer and delivery to the Plaintiff The Toronto General Trusts Corporation as executor of the estate of the late William Raey Featherstone, of 25;000 shares of the capital stock of North Denison Mines Limited.\n(b) The immediate transfer and delivery to the Plaintiff Crighton of 25,000 shares of the capital stock of North Denison Mines Limited.\nThe action was tried before Judson J. and judgment was given in favour of the plaintiff trust company against Roman, the terms of the formal judgment being as follows:\n1. THIS COURT DOTH ORDER AND ADJUDGE that the Defendant Stephen Boleslav Roman, do forthwith deliver to the Plaintiff, the Toronto General Trusts Corporation as Executor of the Estate of William Raey Featherstone, deceased, 25,000 fully paid shares of North Denison Mines Limited, or, in the alternative, the equivalent thereof being 7,143 fully paid shares of Consolidated Denison Mines Limited.\nThe claims of the Trust Company against all the defendants other than Roman were dismissed.\nThe claims of Crighton against all the defendants were dismissed.\nRoman appealed to the Court of Appeal for Ontario, asking that the claim of the plaintiff trust company be dismissed or, in the alternative, that the judgment be varied by awarding the said plaintiff damages in a sum not exceeding $2,500.\nThe trust company cross-appealed and Crighton appealed, asking that Roman be ordered to deliver to each of them the equivalent of 50,000 shares of North Denison Mines Limited. We are not now concerned with this increased claim.\nRoman\u2019s appeal, Crighton\u2019s appeal, and the cross-appeal of the trust company were dismissed. Roman appeals to this Court against the judgment in favour of the plaintiff trust company asking for the same relief as that for which he asked in the Court of Appeal.\nCrighton appeals to this Court asking for judgment directing Roman to transfer to him 25,000 fully paid shares of the capital stock of North Denison Mines Limited or the equivalent thereof being 7,143 fully paid shares of Consolidated Denison Mines Limited.\nMuch of the voluminous evidence introduced at the trial relates to claims with which we are no longer concerned.\nSome of the facts relevant to the questions which we have to decide are undisputed but as to several there is conflict between the evidence of Crighton and that of Roman.\nEarly in the year 1953, Crighton and Featherstone had embarked on a venture described as \u201cthe Glencair Dear\u201d. They invited Roman to participate in this. He did so and in the course of a few weeks the matter was brought to a successful conclusion resulting in the distribution of a profit of some $300,000.\nAt or shortly after the date of the completion of \u201cthe Glencair Deal\u201d Roman purchased from a prospector, named McCarthy, five unpatented mining claims in Northern Saskatchewan, known as the Skibbereen claims; the price was $10,000 in cash plus, at the option of the vendor, a further $10,000, or 25,000 fully paid shares of the capital stock of a company to be designated by Roman.\nThere is a conflict of evidence as to what happened at this point. Roman says that he talked to Crighton about the matter, that \u201cto the best of his recollection\u201d no one else was present, that he told Crighton about his deal with McCarthy and asked him whether he wanted any part of it and that Crighton agreed to take a 50% interest. Crighton, on the other hand, says that Featherstone also was present and that it was agreed that Roman should have a 50% interest and that Featherstone and Crighton should each have a 25% interest. It is common ground that Roman gave his cheque for $5,000 to the Royal Bank, which was to hold the $10,000 until the necessary documents were delivered, that Crighton gave two cheques drawn on his own account, each for $2,500, and that Featherstone in turn gave his cheque to Crighton for $2,500. Title to the five claims was taken in the name of E.R. Peacock, a solicitor, who executed a declaration of trust stating that he held them in trust for Roman. It is clear that throughout its existence Roman was the manager or person in control of the venture. Roman, in cross\u2011examination, testified as follows:\nQ. You were really the manager of the operations in respect of these things\u2014you were the one in the drivers seat?\nA. Yes, it was the understanding from the start, that I was to have full power to deal with the claims.\nQ. You wouldn\u2019t have gone into it on any other understanding?\nA. No.\nQ. You wouldn\u2019t have let Mr. Crighton make deals for you?\nA. I wouldn\u2019t have gone into it in any other way.\nOn June 30, 1953, Peacock, on the instructions of Roman, entered into an agreement with North Denison Mines Limited, whereby that company purchased the five Skibbereen claims for $25,000 and the allotment of 100,000 fully paid shares of its capital stock of which 90,000 were to be deposited in escrow with a trust company. The cash consideration was to be paid $15,000 upon the recording of the transfers of the claims and the balance of $10,000 in 90 days. The $15,000 was paid and certificates for the shares were issued in the name of Peacock. The share certificates were numbered 5756 and 5757.\nIn July word was received from a geologist in the field that the Skibbereen claims were of a less area than had been represented. In consequence of this an action was commenced against McCarthy. This was settled by McCarthy agreeing to accept the $10,000 he had already received as payment in full for the claims and in turn the price payable by North Denison Mines Limited was reduced from $25,000 to $15,000 plus the 100,000 fully paid shares.\nOn September 22, 1953, Peacock, on instructions from Roman, distributed the $15,000 received from North Denison Mines Limited. One-half was paid to Roman and his nominee and one-half to Crighton. Crighton immediately gave his own cheque to Featherstone for one\u2011half of the amount received by him. Featherstone died a few days later on September 29, 1953. Peacock still held the 100,000 shares of North Denison Mines Limited. In November 1953 he received instructions from Roman to transfer them to a company, New Concord Development Corporation Limited, which was then controlled by Roman. Peacock, who had heard that Crighton had an interest in the 100,000 shares but had not heard of the interest of Featherstone, said he would require a release from Crighton before making the transfer. Peacock prepared a release which was later returned to him signed by Crighton and which is dated November 23, 1953. There is a conflict in the evidence as to where and under what circumstances this document was signed by Crighton. It reads as follows:\nTo: Evan R. Peacock,Barrister etc.,305 Royal Bank Building,Toronto, Ontario.\nFOR VALUE RECEIVED, I hereby release my interest, if any, in certificate number 5757, North Denison Mines Limited for ninety thousand (90,000) shares of its capital stock and in certificate number 5756, North Denison Mines Limited for ten thousand (10,000) shares.\nDATED at the City of Toronto, in the County of York, this 23rd day of November, A.D. 1953.\nWITNESS:\n\u201cL. Gardon\u201d\n\u201cJohn Crighton\u201d (seal)\nFollowing receipt of this release Peacock transferred the 100,000 shares to New Concord. I do not find it necessary to trace the course of the dealings between Roman and New Concord in regard to these shares for I agree with the finding, made expressly or implicitly by all of the learned judges in the courts below, that their proceeds came into the hands of Roman in the form of 100,000 fully paid shares of New Denison Mines Limited all of which were free from the terms of the escrow agreement to which 90,000 of those held in the name of Peacock had been subject.\nThese 100,000 \u201cfree\u201d shares were later exchanged for fully paid shares of Consolidated Denison Mines Limited on the basis of one share of the stock of that company for every three and a half shares of the stock of New Denison Mines Limited.\nThe end result of Roman\u2019s dealings with the Skibbereen claims, the asset of the joint venture of which he was the manager, was that he had received $15,000 and the 100,000 shares now represented by 28,571 fully paid shares of Consolidated Denison Mines Limited. He duly accounted for the $15,000 but at no time did he account to Featherstone or his estate for any part of the shares which at the date of the trial remained in his hands.\nDealing first with Roman\u2019s appeal against the judgment in favour of Featherstone\u2019s executor, I do not find it necessary to reach a final conclusion as to whether, as Crighton says, Featherstone\u2019s interest was agreed upon by Roman at the inception of the venture on March 19, 1953, when the cheques totalling $10,000 were handed to the Royal Bank, although on a consideration of all the evidence bearing on the question I think it probable that (Brighton\u2019s version is the correct one, for it is clear that before he dealt with the 100,000 shares in a manner inconsistent with the duties attaching to his fiduciary position Roman had knowledge of Feathers tone\u2019s beneficial ownership.\nThe situation as between Roman and Featherstone\u2019s estate is accurately and succinctly stated in the following passage in the reasons of Aylesworth J.A.:\nThis much is clear: Roman was made aware that the Featherstone estate had an interest before the Peacock shares were transferred (at Roman\u2019s direction) to New Concord. New Concord at the time of the transfer was controlled by Roman. That transfer was not made in the course of the partnership business or in the process of liquidation of the partnership or with the consent of the Featherstone estate and I respectfully agree with Judson J. that so far as the estate\u2019s claim regarding the Peacock shares is concerned \u201cthere is no answer to it\u201d. Roman as managing partner dealt with the partnership asset for his own purposes. It or that which it has become through his dealings, is vested in him as trustee and he must account for it.\nI would dismiss Roman\u2019s appeal.\nTurning now to Crighton\u2019s appeal, it is obvious that Roman stood in a fiduciary relationship to Crighton as well as to Featherstone and that when Roman received the 100,000 shares which he placed in Peacock\u2019s name he was a constructive trustee of those shares to the extent of Crighton\u2019s beneficial interest therein.\nThe reason that the courts below, while upholding the claim of Featherstone\u2019s estate, have rejected that of Crighton is that they reached the conclusion that Crighton had released or transferred his beneficial interest to Roman for good consideration. The ascertainment of the facts as to the dealings between Roman and Crighton which involved the execution by Crighton of the release of November 23, 1953, hereinafter referred to as \u201cthe release\u201d and the determination of the effect of those dealings and of that document appear to me to be the most difficult matters arising in these appeals.\nIn the statement of claim no reference is made to the release but in paragraph 14 there is the following sentence:\nNeither the Plaintiff Crighton nor the Plaintiff Executor ever received any consideration or payment for his or its interests in all or any of the said shares, nor did they ever consent to the sale or disposition of their beneficial title or interests therein, and they hold the Defendants responsible for return to each of them of 25,000 shares of North Denison.\nParagraph 8 of Roman\u2019s statement of defence reads as follows:\nOwing to illness, the Defendant, Roman, was unable to complete the purchase of the control of Denison pursuant to the agreement with Richmond as planned and in or about the month of June, 1953, he arranged for the sale to New Concord Development Corporation Limited (hereinafter referred to as \u201cNew Concord\u201d) of 744,900 shares of Denison, in part free and in part escrowed, and including in such sale the 100,000 shares of Denison covered by certificates Numbers 5756 and 5757 hereinbefore mentioned as well as the shares being purchased from Richmond. The Plaintiff, Crighton, orally informed the said Roman that he was no longer interested in the transaction and therefore acquiesced in such sale and under his hand and seal executed and delivered a release to Evan R. Peacock, the Defendant Roman\u2019s Trustee, of all his interest in and to the said 100,000 shares covered by certificates Numbers 5756 and 5757. In due course the transaction with New Concord was completed and part of the consideration due from New Concord was paid dircetly to the said Richmond and\/or his nominees.\nIt will be observed that nowhere in the statement of defence is there any allegation that Crighton received any consideration for executing the release.\nNo reply was delivered.\nCrighton\u2019s evidence in chief as to the signing of the release may be summarized as follows. Roman told him that he had to transfer the 100,000 shares held by Peacock to New Concord as a step in clearing up an indebtedness to one Richmond, that he required Crighton to sign \u201ca waiver or permission\u201d, that Roman wrote out a \u201cslip\u201d in longhand and Crighton signed it, that later Roman told him he required a more formal document, and he signed the release. The slip in longhand was not produced. In cross-examination Crighton agreed with the suggestion of Roman\u2019s counsel that he understood the release was required for Peacock\u2019s protection and stated that his understanding with Roman was that \u201csometime later if we got a suitable property we would be able to take North Denison out of New Concord\u201d. He agreed with counsel that the alleged understanding was \u201cnebulous\u201d.\nRoman\u2019s evidence on the point commences at the time of the dispute with McCarthy. Roman says he wanted \u201cto reverse the deal\u201d, that is to sue McCarthy for return of the $10,000 and to return the $15,000 and 100,000 shares to North Denison Mines Limited, that Crighton wanted the deal with North Denison Mines Limited carried through, that Crighton wanted his share of the money and \u201cmade a suggestion\u201d that he was not interested in the 100,000 shares that all he wanted was his share of the cash. Roman\u2019s evidence as to this conversation, even if accepted, falls short of establishing any agreement by Crighton to transfer his beneficial interest in the shares to Roman or any consideration for such an agreement.\nPeacock\u2019s evidence, which was accepted by the learned trial judge, makes it clear that it was Peacock and not Roman who initiated the request that Crighton sign the release. Roman\u2019s account of the signing is that he took the position with Crighton that the latter had agreed to give up his interest in the shares at the time of the discussion about \u201creversing the deal\u201d and that having made an agreement he ought to stick to it, that Crighton said \u201cYes, I agreed but I think I should get something for it\u201d, that Crighton went on to suggest that Roman should cancel Crighton\u2019s indebtedness to him and in return for this he would sign the release. Crighton denies this and expressly denies that he owed Roman any money. According to Roman\u2019s evidence it was at this meeting that Crighton telephoned the trust company to see if it would release Featherstone\u2019s interest and in the course of the telephone conversation Crighton said to the officer of the trust company to whom he was speaking: \u201cWell, it isn\u2019t worth very much anyway. It\u2019s escrowed stock most of it.\u201d\nRoman\u2019s evidence as to Crighton\u2019s alleged indebtedness to him is not satisfactory. I have already pointed out that it was not mentioned in the pleadings. Roman says that on his examination for discovery he had estimated the indebtedness at $700 but believes it would be well over $1,000, that it consisted of loans made by him to Crighton in cash from time to time, that he had no receipts, records or acknowledgments of these advances.\nIf I had to decide the question from the written record I would incline to the view that Roman had failed to prove that Crighton owed him anything at the time the release was signed; but the learned trial judge who had the advantage of seeing and hearing the witnesses says on this point:\nI think it quite probable that he (Crighton) had been borrowing money from Roman.\n* * *\nThe release is operative as far as Crighton is concerned but does not deprive the Featherstone estate of its interest in these shares.\nI regard this as a finding of fact, based on the balance of probabilities, that Crighton did owe Roman a sum of money, the exact amount of which the learned trial judge did not find it necessary to determine, and that the release of that indebtedness formed the consideration for the signing of the release; and it is implicit in the reasons of the learned trial judge that in signing the release Crighton intended to release to Roman his beneficial interest in the shares. The Court of Appeal took a similar view of the evidence. Aylesworth J.A., with whom Morden J.A. agreed, says in part:\nCrighton\u2019s own position is very different. In my view of the evidence, his execution of the release was actually for valuable, adequate consideration, namely Roman\u2019s agreement to forego the moneys Crighton owed him. The release is under seal and recites that Crighton is releasing his interest in what was the sole partnership asset \u201cfor value received\u201d. The Peacock shares had little or no realizable value and no foreseeable potential future value when the release was signed. Crighton knew that; he was \u201cfamiliar with Bay Street\u201d as he put it and he, of course, knew that the marketing operation to create some saleability for the shares had been a failure. In discussing the release with Roman he was in a position to rely upon himself and his own knowledge of the situation as I think in fact he did. What apparently he did not know was that all of the Richmond shares were not being turned over by Roman to New Concord but that on the contrary, Roman was retaining 100,000 of them. Assuming he had known it and assuming, without at the moment deciding, that Roman had a duty to disclose to him the retention by Roman of the 100,000 shares, would Crighton upon such disclosure have refused to execute the release? In my opinion that knowledge would have had no effect whatsoever upon the question of his signing or refusing to sign. He knew that there was no peculiar value to any single block of 100,000 shares; New Concord would have a very substantial control of New Denison with or without those shares and Crighton knew quite enough about Roman\u2019s deal with Richmond and about the fact that Roman was causing New Concord to complete that deal to appreciate that control of New Denison was passing to New Concord. With or without the transfer to New Concord of the 100,000 shares retained by Richmond (sic), the bargain struck by Crighton as his price for the release, was to Crighton\u2019s advantage and must at the time literally have appealed to him as the equivalent of cash in the hand for something of very doubtful and unrealizable value. It is not to be overlooked that Crighton was aware of the source of the New Denison shares (Richmond) to be utilized in the ill-fated \u201cmarketing operation\u201d and that it was Roman solely upon his own responsibility who had first procured and then dealt in those shares\u2014that is directed the marketing operation. Crighton did not disapprove of these activities; he was whole-heartedly behind them. In all the circumstances I do not consider that Roman was under any duty to disclose the precise terms of his contract with New Concord or that the fact that he was retaining 100,000 of the Richmond shares was a material fact which would in any way affect Crighton\u2019s action. I would affirm the dismissal of Crighton\u2019s claim to any interest in the Peacock shares.\nWith the greatest respect I am unable to agree with this conclusion. On the view of the evidence most favourable to Roman he was in the position of a trustee purchasing from his cestui que trust the latter\u2019s beneficial interest in the trust property. The conditions which must, as a general rule, exist to enable the courts to uphold such a transaction are well settled and are conveniently stated in Halsbury\u2019s Laws of England, 2nd ed., vol. 33, pages 284 and 285, as follows:\nA trustee for other purposes than for sale cannot purchase the property, where the purchase would conflict with his duties respecting it or his position in regard to it. There is, however, no absolute rule against his purchasing the trust property from his cestui que trust, and if he purchases the whole of it the relation between them is terminated. Such a transaction is always regarded by courts of equity with the utmost jealousy, and in order that it may stand, if it is impeached within a reasonable time by the cestui que trust or a person claiming through him, the trustee must show (1) that there has been no fraud or concealment or advantage taken by him of information acquired by him in the character of trustee; (2) that the cestui que trust had independent advice, and every kind of protection, and the fullest information with respect to the property; and (3) that the consideration was adequate.\nAt the lowest the duty which lay upon Roman was to make full disclosure to Crighton that as the result of the transaction in which he proposed to use the 100,000 shares referred to in the release he was to obtain in exchange for these shares, 90,000 of which were in escrow, 100,000 free shares. Far from making this disclosure he gave Crighton to believe that he was parting with the shares altogether as a step in the fulfilment of his commitments to Richmond. He knew that Crighton considered that the fact of 90% of the shares being in escrow rendered them of less value than free shares. It seems to me impossible to say that these were not material circumstances.\nThe onus of supporting the transaction was upon Roman and, in my opinion, he has failed to satisfy it.\nThe following passage in the judgment of the Judicial Committee in Williams v. Scott[1], appears to me to be applicable to the facts of the case at bar:\nA trustee for sale of trust property cannot sell to himself. If, notwithstanding the form of the conveyance, the trustee (or any person claiming under him) seeks to justify the transaction as being really a purchase from the cestui que trusts, it is important to remember upon whom the onus of proof falls. It ought not to be assumed, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, that the transaction was a proper one, and that the cestui que trusts were informed of all necessary matters. The burthen of proof that the transaction was a righteous one rests upon the trustee, who is bound to produce clear affirmative proof that the parties were at arm\u2019s length; that the cestui que trusts had the fullest information upon all material facts; and that, having this information, they agreed to and adopted what was done.\nas does also the following in the judgment of the Judicial Committee delivered by Lord Thankerton in Brickenden v. London Loan and Savings Co.[2]:\nWhen a party, holding a fiduciary relationship, commits a breach of his duty by non\u2011disclosure of material facts, which his constituent is entitled to know in connection with the transaction, he cannot be heard to maintain that disclosure would not have altered the decision to proceed with the transaction, because the constituent\u2019s action would be solely determined by some other factor, such as the valuation by another party of the property proposed to be mortgaged. Once the Court has determined that the non\u2011disclosed facts were material, speculation as to what course the constituent, on disclosure, would have taken is not relevant.\nIn the result, it is my opinion that Roman did not obtain a valid release or transfer of Crighton\u2019s beneficial interest in the shares and that Crighton is entitled to the same relief as that awarded by the courts below to Featherstone\u2019s estate, subject only to this that as the learned trial judge has found that Crighton owed some money to Roman, payment of which Roman waived in consideration of the signing of the release, Roman is entitled to payment of the amount of which he waived payment. The only evidence as to the amount of Crighton\u2019s indebtedness is that of Roman referred to above that while on his examination for discovery he had stated that he thought it was $700 he now believed that it would be well over $1,000. Based on this evidence, and in the hope of avoiding the necessity of further proceedings, I would fix the amount of Crighton\u2019s indebtedness at the sum of $1,000, but with the right to either Crighton or Roman if dissatisfied with this amount, to have it referred to the Master of the Supreme Court of Ontario to determine the exact amount of which payment was waived.\nFor the above reasons, I would dismiss the appeal of Roman with costs; I would allow the appeal of Crighton, with costs as against Roman in the Court of Appeal and in this Court, set aside the judgments below in so far as they relate to the claim of Crighton and direct judgment to be entered ordering that upon Crighton paying to Roman the sum of $1,000, or such other sum, if any, as may be determined if a reference be had as above provided, Roman do deliver to Crighton 25,000 fully paid shares of North Denison Mines Limited or, in the alternative, the equivalent thereof being 7,143 fully paid shares of Consolidated Denison Mines Limited.\nAppeal of John D. Crighton allowed, KERWIN C.J. dissenting.\nAppeal of Stephen Boleslav Roman dismissed.\nSolicitors for the plaintiff, appellant, and for the plaintiff, respondent: Roberts, Archibald, Seagram & Cole, Toronto.\nSolicitors for the defendant, respondent: Mungovan & Mungovan, Toronto.\nEDITOR\u2019S NOTE: At the time of the argument of this appeal the Court was not aware of the fact that dividends had been received by Roman.

In appealing this decision the Crown contended that the trial judge did not consider the included offence of common assault and, in the result, failed to direct himself with respect to the divisibility of the charge laid and to the incidence of drunkenness as a defence to a charge of common assault, as distinguished from a charge of robbery with violence. The appeal was dismissed by the Court of Appeal, and the Crown then sought and obtained the leave of this Court to appeal from that judgment.\nHeld (Locke J. dissenting) : The appeal should be allowed, the verdict of acquittal with respect to common assault set aside, and a verdict of guilty of that offence entered.\nPer Taschereau and Fauteux JJ.: As provided by s. 569(1) (a) of the Code, when the commission of the offence charged, as described in the enactment creating it or as charged, includes the commission of another offence, the charge is divisible, and the accused may be convicted of the offence so included, if proved, notwithstanding that the whole offence that is charged is not proved. The King v. Wong On (No. 3), 8 C.C.C. 423; Rex v. Stewart, 71 C.C.C. 206, referred to.\nIn a like situation, the offence included is part of the case which the accused has to meet under the law. The mere omission of the Crown to raise the issue cannot per se and without more relieve the trial judge from the duty imposed upon him under the section. The words \"may convict\" give an authority which must be exercised when the circumstances described in the section are present. Rex v. Bishop of Oxford, (1879) 4 Q.B.D. 245, applied; Wexler v. His Majesty The King, [1939] S.C.R. 350, distinguished.\nContrary to what is the case in the crime of robbery, where, with respect to theft, a specific intent must be proved, there is no specific intent necessary to constitute the offence of common assault. Here the manner in which force was applied by the respondent to his victim was not accidental or unintentional. Re Beard, [1920] A.C. 479, referred to. The finding of the trial judge that the accused had not the capacity to form the specific intent to commit robbery did not justify the conclusion reached in appeal that he could not then have committed the offence of common assault.\nPer Martland and Ritchie JJ.: Pursuant to s. 569 of the Code the trial judge was under a duty to consider the included offence of assault, and the fact that his report to the Court of Appeal contained a statement \"that common assault was not raised by Crown counsel at the trial\" is not sufficient ground for concluding that he did not consider this offence.\nThe duty which rests upon the trial judge to consider all included offences of which there is evidence can, in no way, be affected by the fact that the Crown has omitted to make reference to such offences, and it follows that where the trial judge has wrongly applied the law applicable to an included offence the Crown is not deprived of its statutory right of appeal because of its omission at trial to address the Court on the matter.\nThe offence of robbery requires the presence of the kind of intent and purpose specified in ss. 269 and 288 of the Code, but the use of the word \"intentionally\" in defining \"common assault\" in s. 230(a) is exclusively referable to the physical act of applying force to the person of another.\nPer Locke J., dissenting: The Crown's contention that where a trial judge hearing a criminal charge fails not to deal with, but to consider independently, an offence included in the offence specifically charged, and this is done with the approval of counsel for the Crown, the provisions of s. 584 of the Code may be invoked to again place the accused in jeopardy, should be rejected.\nThe right of the Crown to appeal, while given in clear terms, may not be exercised in all circumstances, as was decided in Wexler v. R., supra. To construe the section differently would mean that accused persons could be subjected to a succession of trials for the same offence on grounds that were not advanced at the first and succeeding previous trials, and which the accused person had not accordingly attempted to meet. The King v. Miles, (1890) 24 Q.B.D. 423, referred to.\nAlthough s. 569 imposes a duty upon the judge to consider the included offence of assault, his failure to do so does not render the proceeding defective and a new trial necessary. The King v. Wong On, supra, applied; The Queen v. Bishop of Oxford, supra, referred to.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1] affirming a judgment of Morrow C.C.J. Appeal allowed, Locke J. dissenting.\nJ. Urie, for the appellant.\nE. P. Newcombe and R. Cleary, for the respondent.\nThe judgment of Taschereau and Fauteux JJ. was delivered by FAUTEUX J.:\u2014Respondent was charged with robbery with violence and tried by Morrow C.C.J., in the County Court of Cariboo holden at Prince George in the Province of British Columbia. In answer to the charge, the accused raised, amongst others, the issues of identification and drunkenness. At the end of a lengthy hearing, the trial Judge acquitted him and, in doing so, said in part:\n(i) as to identification.\nI have reached the conclusion, therefore, without any doubt, that it was the accused who committed the offence on the night in question.\n(ii) as to drunkenness.\nThe law seems to be that in the case of intoxication an accused person can claim that drunkenness need not result in absolute incapacity rendering the accused incapable of awareness of the nature of his physical act, but it is sufficient if there is a degree of drunkenness which renders the accused incapable of forming the specific intent essential to constitute the crime.\nI will be frank and say that this defence of drunkenness in this instance is one that caused me much concern. To me it is very much a border line case. That being so it is my duty to give the accused the benefit of the doubt on the defence of drunkenness that has been set up in my mind.\nHaving announced the acquittal, the trial Judge then addressed these remarks to the accused:\nYou are being acquitted not because you didn't do it\u2014there is no doubt in my mind that you did do it\u2014you are being acquitted because I have found that you were so drunk on the night in question that you were unable to form an intent to do it. In that respect, you have been very fortunate, and perhaps fortunate in another respect in that you were not up on a charge of murder, because anyone that tackles a man as you did and the man survives after an attack of double pneumonia, you can only put it down to good luck. Perhaps this will be a warning to you. The next time, you see, you may not be so fortunate. This defence of drunkenness does not excuse a crime, it merely is a defence under the circumstances that we have had during this rather lengthy trial.\nIn the reasons for judgment, there is nothing expressed or implied with reference to common assault, an offence included in the major offence of robbery with violence.\nThe Crown appealed this decision to the Court of Appeal for the Province, on grounds stated as follows in the notice of appeal:\n(i) The learned trial Judge erred in holding that drunkenness was a defence to said charge at all;\n(ii) In the alternative, the learned trial Judge erred in not convicting the respondent of common assault;\n(iii) The learned trial Judge misdirected himself on the defence of drunkenness and its effect on question of intent. In clear reference to the second ground, the trial Judge, in his report to the Court of Appeal, stated that common assault had not been raised by Crown counsel at the trial. From this statement, the Crown contended in the Court below, one must infer that common assault was not considered by the trial Judge who, in the result, failed to direct himself with respect to the divisibility of the charge laid and to the incidence of drunkenness as a defence to a charge of common assault, as distinguished from a charge of robbery with violence.\nIn dismissing the appeal[2] O'Halloran J.A., with the concurrence of Bird J.A., rejected as ill-founded the inference drawn by the Crown from the report of the trial Judge and further expressed the view that \"if the respondent could not, through the effect of liquor, have the intent to rob, then he could not, because of liquor's effect upon him, have the intent to assault and steal, where as here these two essential ingredients of robbery occurred concurrently and integrated in the robbery as charged.\"\nSheppard J.A. declared that if, as suggested, the trial Judge omitted to consider the included offence of common assault, such an omission was entirely due to the failure of Crown counsel to raise that issue as part of the case to be met by the accused. Assimilating such a situation to the one considered in Wexler v. His Majesty the King[3], he concurred in the dismissal of the appeal.\nThe Crown then sought and obtained leave of this Court to appeal from this judgment. As stated in appellant's factum, the questions submitted for determination are:\n1. Whether or not evidence of drunkenness falling short of insanity can be used as a defence not only to negative the capacity of the accused to form a specific or special intent, but also to negative the ordinary mens rea which is a constituent of all crime.\n2. Whether or not the Court of Appeal should substitute a conviction for the included offence of common assault, or order a new trial with respect thereto, when Crown counsel at the trial of the accused did not raise the issue of the accused's capacity to commit the included offence of common assault.\nThat the trial Judge did not consider the included offence of common assault is, in my view, the reasonable inference flowing from his statement in the report to the Court of Appeal. This is specially so when this statement, made in reference to the second ground raised by the Crown in its notice of appeal, is considered in the light of the reasons given by the trial Judge in support of the acquittal.\nIn the circumstances of this case, it was the duty of the trial Judge to consider common assault. For when, as in the present case, the commission of the offence charged, as described in the enactment creating it or as charged, includes the commission of another offence, the charge is divisible, and the accused may be convicted of the offence so included, if proved, notwithstanding that the whole offence that is charged is not proved. The law and the jurisprudence in this respect are clear. Section 569(1) (a) Cr. C. reads as follows:\n569. (1) A count in an indictment is divisible and where the commission of the offence charged, as described in the enactment creating it or as charged in the count, includes the commission of another offence, whether punishable by indictment or on summary conviction, the accused may be convicted\n(a) of an offence so included that is proved, notwithstanding that the whole offence that is charged is not proved, or\nSee The King v. Wong On (No. 3)[4]; Rex v. Stewart[5].\nIn a like situation, the offence included is part of the case which the accused has to meet under the law. The mere omission of counsel for the Crown to have raised the issue cannot per se and without more relieve the trial Judge from the cardinal duty imposed upon him under the section. This is not a civil but a criminal case. The words \"may convict\", appearing in the opening phrase thereof, give an authority which must be exercised when, as in this case, the circumstances described in the section are present. In Reg. v. Bishop of Oxford[6] it was held that\nso long ago as the year 1693 it was decided in the case of R. v. Barlow, that when a statute authorizes the doing of a thing for the sake of justice or the public good, the word \"may\" means \"shall\" and that rule has been acted upon to the present time \u2026.\nThis proposition was relied on in Welch v. The King[7] where, at page 426, this Court said:\nFor new and extraordinary would be a rule of construction stating that, being empowered to make an order required by justice, a Court of justice would be free to refrain from making it when the occasion to do so arises. With deference, the decision of this Court in Wexler v. His Majesty the King, supra, has no application in the matter. The question of divisibility did not arise in that case. What the Court decided was simply that subsection 4 of section 1013 Cr.C. was not intended to confer jurisdiction upon an appellate court to set aside a verdict of acquittal and so entitle the Crown to an order for a new trial for the purpose of presenting an entirely new case against the accused. Furthermore, the circumstances which gave rise to that decision are entirely different from those present in this case. As stated by Sir Lyman Duff, C.J., at pp. 351 and 352:\nThe case presented by the Crown was that the appellant had intentionally shot the deceased Germaine Rochon with the intention of killing her. The defence relied upon the testimony given by the appellant himself. It was agreed by both counsel for the Crown and for the defence, and the learned trial Judge so instructed the jury, that if they believed the account given by the accused he was entitled to be acquitted. I quote the words of the learned judge in which he summed up the whole matter at the request of counsel for the defence after the jury had retired and had been recalled:\nThe COURT: Gentlemen, I have been asked by the defence attorneys, to give a further explanation on a certain point. I have told you that, if you are satisfied with the explanation given by the accused, that the shooting was an accident, that he was entitled to an acquittal, but I must add\u2014and I think I did\u2014I must add, even on that evidence, he is entitled to the benefit of the doubt; that is, if you are not reasonably sure that his explanations are not true, that you must give him the benefit of the doubt and acquit him.\nThat is, the accused is entitled to the benefit of the doubt on the entire evidence. You must be reasonably sure that he has committed the offence before finding him guilty.\nWe are left in no doubt that this instruction by the learned trial judge was accepted as satisfactory by counsel both for the Crown and for the accused and that it correctly formulated the single issue of fact which both counsel put before the jury as the sole issue upon which it was their duty to pass.\nIn the present case, the record does not indicate any agreement between counsel, or any suggestion that robbery was the only issue or that common assault which, under the law, was part of the case that the accused had to meet, was excluded. Nor was there any occasion for counsel to approve or disapprove the manner in which the trial Judge directed himself. The Wexler case, supra, is no authority for the proposition that the mere omission of the Crown to raise the issue of common assault amounted to an approval of the trial Judge's failure to direct himself in the matter or to a circumstance relieving him of the duty he had under s. 569(1) (a).\nIt must then be held that the failure of the trial Judge to consider common assault amounted to non-direction.\nIt follows that the appeal of the Crown should have been allowed, unless it be shown by respondent that, but for this error, the verdict would necessarily have been the same.\nThis indeed is the view which appears to have been reached by O'Halloran and Bird JJ.A., who, as above indicated, said in substance that if, as found by the trial Judge, the accused did not, owing to drunkenness, have the capacity to form the specific intent required as a constituent element of the crime of robbery, he could no more, for the same reason, have had the intent to assault and steal.\nWith deference, I do not think that this conclusion legally follows from the premises upon which it rests.\nIn considering the question of mens rea, a distinction is to be made between (i) intention as applied to acts considered in relation to their purposes and (ii) intention as applied to acts considered apart from their purposes. A general intent attending the commission of an act is, in some cases, the only intent required to constitute the crime while, in others, there must be, in addition to that general intent, a specific intent attending the purpose for the commission of the act.\nContrary to what is the case in the crime of robbery, where, with respect to theft, a specific intent must be proved by the Crown as one of the constituent elements of the offence, there is no specific intent necessary to constitute the offence of common assault, which is defined as follows in s. 230 Cr.C.:\nA person commits an assault when, without the consent of another person or with consent, where it is obtained by fraud,\n(a) he applies force intentionally to the person of the other, directly or indirectly, or\n(b) he attempts or threatens, by an act or gesture, to apply force to the person of the other, if he has or causes the other to believe upon reasonable grounds that he has present ability to effect his purpose. The word \"intentionally\" appearing in s. 230(a) is exclusively related to the application of force or to the manner in which force is applied. This, indeed, is also made clear in the French version, reading:\n230. Commet des voies de fait, ou se livre \u00e0 une attaque, quiconque, sans le consentement d'autrui, ou avec son consentement, s'il est obtenu par fraude,\na)d'une mani\u00e8re intentionnelle, applique, directement ou indirectement, la force ou la violence contre la personne d'autrui, ou\nb)tente ou menace, par un acte ou un geste, d'appliquer la force ou la violence contre la personne d'autrui, s'il est en mesure actuelle, ou s'il porte cette personne \u00e0 croire, pour des motifs raisonnables, qu'il est en mesure actuelle d'accomplir son dessein.\n(The italics are mine).\nThere can be no pretence, in this case, that the manner in which force was applied by respondent to his victim was accidental or\u2014excluding at the moment, from the consideration, the defence of drunkenness\u2014unintentional.\nOn this finding of fact, the accused was guilty of common assault unless there was evidence indicating a degree of drunkenness affording, under the law, a valid defence.\nThe rules for determining the validity of a defence of drunkenness have been stated by the House of Lords in the well known case of Beard[8]:\n(i) Insanity, whether produced by drunkenness or otherwise, is a defence to the crime charged.\n(ii) Evidence of drunkenness which renders the accused incapable of forming the specific intent essential to constitute the crime should be taken into consideration with the other facts proved in order to determine whether or not he had this intent.\n(iii) Evidence of drunkenness falling short of a proved incapacity in the accused to form the intent necessary to constitute the crime, and merely establishing that his mind was affected by drink so that he more readily gave way to some violent passion, does not rebut the presumption that a man intends the natural consequences of his acts.\nThe first rule has no relevancy here for there is no pretence that, owing to drunkenness, respondent was insane, even temporarily, at the time of the assault.\nThe second rule was relevant and indeed properly applied by the trial Judge who entertained a doubt on the question whether the Crown had proved, as part of its case, that the accused had, owing to drunkenness, the capacity to form the specific intent required in the offence of robbery, i.e., the intent to steal.\nHowever, and consequential to the applicability of the rule of divisibility, the included offence of common assault is to be considered independently of the major offence of robbery, and the law as to the validity of a defence of drunkenness has to be related to that particular included offence.\nHence, the question is whether, owing to drunkenness, respondent's condition was such that he was incapable of applying force intentionally. I do not know that, short of a degree of drunkenness creating a condition tantamount to insanity, such a situation could be metaphysically conceived in an assault of the kind here involved. It is certain that, on the facts found by the trial Judge, this situation did not exist in this case.\nThe accused was acquitted of the offence of robbery, not on the ground that he could not have applied force intentionally, but because of the doubt entertained by the trial Judge on the question whether he had the capacity to form the specific intent required as a constituent element for the offence of theft.\nIn these views, the finding of the trial Judge that the accused had not the capacity to form the specific intent to commit robbery did not justify the conclusion reached in appeal that he could not then have committed the offence of common assault; nor is it shown that, had the trial Judge considered common assault, the verdict would necessarily have been the same.\nIn these circumstances, the Court of Appeal should have allowed the appeal from the acquittal and should have proceeded to make an order pursuant to its authority under s. 592(4) (b), to wit, either enter a verdict of guilty with respect to the offence of which, in its opinion, formed in the light of the law applicable in the matter, the accused should have been found guilty but for the error in law, and pass a sentence warranted in law, or order a new trial.\nUnder section 600 Cr. C., this Court is given the authority to make any order that the Court of Appeal might have made. At the hearing before this Court, it was intimated that should the appeal of the Crown be maintained, this case should be finally disposed of, if possible, and that in such event, respondent could appropriately be given a suspended sentence.\nBeing of opinion that the accused should have been found guilty of common assault, had that offence been considered in the light of the law applicable to the facts of this case, I would maintain the appeal, set aside the verdict of acquittal with respect to common assault and enter a verdict of guilty of that offence. Prior to his acquittal in the Court below, respondent has been incarcerated during a number of weeks. It would appear more consonant with the representations made with respect to sentence, to sentence respondent to the time already spent by him in jail; and this is the sentence that I would pass.\nLOCKE J. (dissenting) :\u2014This is an appeal by the Crown pursuant to leave granted by this Court from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia, which dismissed an appeal from the acquittal of the respondent by His Honour Judge Morrow, Judge of the County Court Judges' Criminal Court for the County of Cariboo, on a charge that:\nHe did on the 8th day of February, 1959, at the City of Prince George, in the County of Cariboo, Province of British Columbia, unlawfully and by violence steal from the person of Nicholas Avgeris the sum of Twenty-two dollars, contrary to the form of Statute in such case made and provided.\nThe charge appears to have been laid under the provisions of s. 288 of the Criminal Code. The evidence disclosed that the respondent, an Indian, had gone on the afternoon of the day in question to the home of Avgeris, a man 84 years of age who apparently purchased furs, and was informed that the latter would not purchase a fisher skin which the respondent offered for sale. Later that night, or early the next morning, the respondent returned to the home of Avgeris demanding money, beating him severely with his fists, breaking his nose and causing other grievous bodily injuries and obtaining a sum of $22. According to Avgeris, the respondent, in addition to beating him, threatened to kill him unless he gave him money and wrenched the telephone in the house from the wall. The defence advanced on behalf of the respondent was that he had been drinking heavily during the day, apparently following the first occasion that he went to the house of Avgeris, and that this reduced him to such a state that he was unable to form the intent of committing the offence charged against him. At the conclusion of the hearing the learned trial judge acquitted the accused, saying that while he was satisfied that he had committed the offence he was being acquitted because:\nI have found that you were so drunk on the night in question that you were unable to form an intent to do it.\nWhile two questions of law were raised in the factum filed on behalf of the Crown, only the second of these was argued before us. This was expressed in the following terms:\nWhether or not the Court of Appeal should substitute a conviction for the included offence of common assault, or order a new trial with respect thereto, when Crown counsel at the trial of the accused did not raise the issue of the accused's capacity to commit the included offence of common assault.\nWhile the question, therefore, as to whether the learned County Court judge was right in acquitting the respondent of the offence charged on the ground above stated is not questioned, some reference should be made to the evidence. The only account of what had occurred was that given by Avgeris who described the severe beating he had received before he gave his attacker the sum of $22. He was, however, unable to identify the respondent. The latter, however, after his arrest gave two statements to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. In the first of these, which appears to have been expressed in the language employed by the respondent, he said that he had been drinking heavily and did not remember where he had gone but that he had gone to a house and remembered hitting a man. In the second statement he described in more detail his movements on the day in question, saying that he had brought a fisher fur from Summitt Lake and had gone to a fur buyer and tried to sell the fur to an old man who came to the door and who said he did not want to buy it. After describing the drinking he had done after this, he then said:\nThen I blacked out and the next thing I remember I was in a house. It was the house I was at in the afternoon where the fur buyer lived. I remember hitting a man in this house. I was hitting him with my fists.\nI had mitts on. The person I was hitting was old and I think he was wearing a kimona. I think it was the fur buyer I had talked to in the afternoon. I remember seeing the same furniture in the house then as I had seen in the afternoon. Then I don't remember anything.\nThe constables by whom these statements were taken swore that they were made voluntarily, that the respondent had been duly warned and that no promises or threats had been made to induce him to make the statements, and the learned County Court judge admitted both of them in evidence. They had both been signed by the respondent.\nWhile the first statement had been couched in the language of the respondent, the second was in the language of the police officer who took the statement, being his interpretation of what the respondent had said. The respondent did not deny having signed the statements but denied having said that he remembered hitting the man and said that the police had told him to sign the statement. The learned judge apparently did not believe this but, while holding the second statement admissible in evidence, said that he considered that, as it was not in the language of the prisoner but of that of the police officer, he should not attach any weight to it.\nSection 569 of the Criminal Code reads in part:\nA count in an indictment is divisible and where the commission of the offence charged, as described in the enactment creating it or as charged in the count, includes the commission of another offence, whether punishable by indictment or on summary conviction, the accused may be convicted\n(a) of an offence so included that is proved, notwithstanding that the whole offence that is charged is not proved.\nSection 288 of the Criminal Code, so far as relevant, reads:\nEvery one commits robbery who\n(a) steals, and for the purpose of extorting whatever is stolen or to prevent or overcome resistance to the stealing, uses violence or threats of violence to a person or property,\n(b) steals from any person and, at the time he steals or immediately before or immediately thereafter, wounds, beats, strikes or uses any personal violence to that person.\nThat violence was used for the purpose of extorting and stealing money from Avgeris was proved and this upon the evidence involved an assault within the meaning of that term in s. 230 of the Criminal Code, and an assault occasioning bodily harm within s. 231 (2). In the reasons for judgment delivered by O'Halloran J.A., with whom Bird J.A. agreed, that learned judge said that it followed rationally in the circumstances that the judge must also be deemed to have found that the respondent was equally incapable, for the same reason, of having an intent to commit an assault and that if he could not have the intent to commit robbery he could not have the intent either to assault or to steal, and did not say that he disagreed with this conclusion.\nThe offences described in subss. (a) and (b) of s. 288 of the Code include the offence of assault described in s. 230 and it was, in my opinion, the duty of the learned trial judge to consider this offence upon the hearing of the charge of robbery with violence. In view of the severity of the injuries inflicted upon Avgeris by the brutal beating to which he was subjected, it is clear that George might properly have been charged with assault occasioning bodily harm under s. 231. That had not been done and that offence is not an included offence within the meaning of s. 569. In respect of the offence charged and the offence of assault, it was necessary to prove that force was applied intentionally and in the case of the charge under s. 288 that it was done with intent to steal, and the case of the Crown has been argued on the footing that it is only the latter question that was considered by the learned judge in arriving at the conclusion that the prisoner should be acquitted.\nIt is not made clear in the reasons for judgment delivered at the trial that the learned judge had not considered the included offence and O'Halloran and Bird JJ.A. were of the opinion that it was to be assumed that he had done so. They do not, however, mention the judge's report referred to by Sheppard J.A. This is required by s. 588(1) of the Code. The report is not in the case and the only information we have relating to it is in the reasons of Sheppard J.A. who says that it \"states that common assault was not raised by Crown counsel at the trial.\" In my opinion, the proper inference to be drawn from this is that the trial judge did not consider the question of common assault and we should deal with the appeal on that footing. The effect of the acquittal extended to both offences and the basis of the appeal taken by the Attorney-General to the Court of Appeal of British Columbia under the provisions of s. 584 of the Code, in so far as the included offence of common assault was concerned, was that the learned judge had not considered whether or not the accused was intoxicated to such an extent that he was incapable of forming the intent to assault Avgeris. The appeal proceeded, of necessity, on the footing that the accused had been acquitted of the charge.\nThe decision to be made in these circumstances is of general importance in dealing with the Crown's right of appeal under s. 584 of the Code. That right was first given by the amendment of s. 1013 of the Criminal Code effected by s. 28 of c. 11 of the Statutes of 1930. The long-standing principle of the common law that was affected by this enactment was stated by Hawkins J. in The King v. Miles[9] in the following terms:\nWhere a criminal charge has been adjudicated upon by a Court having jurisdiction to hear and determine it, that adjudication, whether it takes the form of an acquittal or conviction, is final as to the matter so adjudicated upon, and may be pleaded in bar to any subsequent prosecution for the same offence.\nIn Hawkins' Pleas of the Crown, vol. 2, p. 515, it is stated:\nThe plea of autrefoits acquit is grounded on this maxim that a man should not be brought into danger of his life for one and the same offence more than once.\nThe right of appeal thus given to the Attorney-General is a departure from this long-established principle of the common law. The appeal is on a question of law alone. The question of whether George was at the time of the commission of the offence capable of forming the intent to assault Avgeris was a question of fact and not of law. The trial judge did not consider it and this was obviously due to the fact that he was not asked to do so by counsel for the Crown and, apparently, overlooked the fact that the offence of common assault was included in the charge laid under s. 288. Had the matter been tried before a jury, it would clearly have been the judge's duty to have instructed them that they were to consider not merely the offence of robbery with violence, but also that of common assault. The question, and indeed the only question, that arises on this appeal is whether in these circumstances the Crown may ask that the accused be again placed in jeopardy.\nSheppard J.A. considered that the question as to whether a new trial should be ordered was affected by the decision of this Court in Wexler v. R.[10]. In Wexler's case the charge was murder. The defence was that the shooting was the result of an accident. The evidence of the accused was that at the time in question he had intended to commit suicide and informed Rochon, the woman who was killed, of his intention to do so: that she had seized hold of the revolver to prevent this and that while they were struggling it had accidentally discharged, killing her. The case for the Crown was that the killing of the woman had been intentional and the jury were not charged by the trial judge on manslaughter or upon an issue suggested on appeal that, as upon his own admission the accused was in the course of committing the unlawful act of suicide, the killing of the woman was murder. The jury acquitted the accused but this verdict was set aside on appeal to the Court of King's Bench and a new trial ordered. On the appeal to this Court the judgment at the trial was restored.\nIn that case the trial judge had, with the consent of both counsel, charged the jury that if they accepted Wexler's account of what had occurred, they should acquit him. As a matter of law, the jury should also have been charged upon both of the issues suggested in this Court. These were not, of course, included offences within the meaning of that expression in the present section 569, but were offences of which the accused might have been found guilty if the jury reached certain conclusions on the evidence. As all of the judgments delivered show, it was by reason of the course of the trial that the order for a new trial was held to be error.\nIn the present case, the learned judge dealt only with the charge of robbery with violence with the apparent consent and approval of counsel for the Crown, overlooking the fact that it was his duty to deal with the included offence. In this respect, Wexler's case touches the matter and must be considered.\nStated bluntly, the contention of the Crown is that where a trial judge hearing a criminal charge fails not to deal with, but to consider independently, an offence included in the offence specifically charged, and this is done with the approval of counsel for the Crown, the provisions of s. 584 may be invoked to again place the accused in jeopardy. I do not think that it was ever contemplated when the legislation was enacted that it might be exercised in circumstances such as these.\nThe principle of law referred to by Hawkins J. in Miles' case was, prior to 1930, as firmly imbedded in the criminal law of this country as the principle that a man is to be presumed innocent until the contrary is proven in a court of competent jurisdiction. The right to appeal, while given in clear terms, may not be exercised in all circumstances, as was decided by this Court in Wexler's case. To construe the section differently would mean that accused persons could be subjected to a succession of trials for the same offence on grounds that were not advanced at the first trial and succeeding previous trials, and which the accused person had not accordingly attempted to meet. The section should not be construed as permitting in criminal prosecutions a course so contrary to this long-established principle and, in my opinion, to the public interest.\nIn my opinion, the decision in The Queen v. Bishop of Oxford[11], does not affect the question. In that case a section of the Church Discipline Act (3 & 4 Vict. (Imp.), c. 86) reading that \"it shall be lawful\" in defined circumstances for the Bishop of a diocese to issue a commission of enquiry, was held to be imperative rather than permissive. The proceedings were instituted by a parishioner for a mandamus to the Bishop to compel the issue of a commission to enquire into a charge made against the rector. From this it may be suggested that the word \"may\" in s. 569 should be construed as meaning \"shall\" and that, accordingly, the failure of the judge to consider the included offence renders the proceedings defective and a new trial necessary. I agree that the section imposes such a duty upon the judge but I do not agree that his failure to do so has the suggested consequences. It was also the duty of the judge who presided at the trial in Wexler's case to charge the jury that upon the evidence they might return a verdict of manslaughter or a verdict of murder if they were of the opinion that it was while endeavouring to commit suicide that Wexler had fired the shot that killed Rochon. The law is as stated by Hunter C.J. in The King v. Wong On[12], in these terms:\nThe cardinal duty of the judge in his address to the jury is to define the crime charged and to explain the difference between it and any other offence of which it is open to the jury to convict the accused.\na statement concurred in by Drake and Duff JJ. The trial judge was not relieved of that duty by the views asserted by the counsel at the trial. The duty was not discharged but it was held by this Court that, in the circumstances, an appeal did not lie.\nAs to the question of fact as to whether the respondent was at the time capable of forming the intent necessary to constitute the crime of assault, I express no opinion in view of my conclusion upon the point of law.\nI would dismiss this appeal.\nThe judgment of Martland and Ritchie JJ. was delivered by\nRITCHIE J.:\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Appeal of British Columbia[13] affirming the acquittal of the respondent by Morrow C.C.J. of the charge that he did \"unlawfully and by violence steal from the person of Nicholas Avgeris the sum of Twenty-two Dollars\".\nThe learned trial judge has found that:\n\u2026a man of 84, was violently manhandled by an Indian on the date noted in the Indictment \u2026as a result of which he was in hospital for a month. During this scuffle he was badly injured, dumped into a bathtub and pulled out again when he agreed to give the Indian what money he had, $22.\nand he has also\n\u2026reached the conclusion \u2026 without any doubt that it was the accused who committed the offence on the night in question. The learned trial judge continued:\nThe first statement perhaps should be considered. It was obviously written in the words of someone who has not had too much education. In his second paragraph after recalling the drinking period, he said: \"Then I came to and I was in house and I remember hitting man and I don't remember where I went after.\"\nNotwithstanding these findings, the learned trial judge acquitted the respondent, saying:\nTo me it is very much a border line case. That being so it is my duty to give the accused the benefit of the doubt on the defence of drunkenness that has been set up in my mind.\nAfter acquitting him, the learned trial judge addressed the accused in part as follows:\nYou are being acquitted not because you didn't do it\u2014there is no doubt in my mind that you did do it\u2014you are being acquitted because I have found that you were so drunk on the night in question that you were unable to form an intent to do it.\nFrom this acquittal the Crown appealed to the Court of Appeal of British Columbia, and in rendering the decision of the majority of that Court Mr. Justice O'Halloran said[14]:\nI am unable with respect to accept Crown counsel's submission that in failing to convict respondent of assault upon this charge of robbery, the learned trial Judge omitted to instruct himself regarding any difference between the intent to commit the robbery and a specific intent to commit assault as one of the essential ingredients of the robbery with which he was charged.\nIn my judgment, with respect, a sufficient answer thereto is; that having found the respondent so incapacitated by liquor that he could not form an intent to commit the robbery, it follows rationally in the circumstances here, that he must also be deemed to have found that respondent was equally incapable for the same reason of having an intent to commit the assault. If he could not have the intent to commit the robbery, viz. to assault and steal as charged, then he could not have the intent either to assault or to steal when both occurred together as charged; the charge reads \"by violence steal\".\nMr. Justice Sheppard dismissed the appeal on another ground, namely, that the Crown's case at the trial was confined to the charge of robbery with violence, and that in any event a conviction of assault should not be entered in the Court of Appeal without the accused having been given an opportunity to meet that included offence as the failure to do so in the circumstances of this case may have been due to his having been misled by Crown counsel presenting the case as solely that of robbery with violence.\nIn the course of his decision Mr. Justice Sheppard said[15]:\nThe learned trial Judge in his report states that common assault was not raised by Crown counsel at the trial. It, therefore, appears that the case presented by the Crown at the trial was that of robbery with violence; that is the sole offence which the accused was here called upon to meet.\nIt is to be noted that the report of the learned trial judge was not part of the record before this Court and this observation by Mr. Justice Sheppard is the sole reference made to it in the course of the proceedings.\nLeave to appeal to this Court was granted pursuant to an application made on behalf of the Attorney-General of British Columbia. No appeal was taken from the acquittal of the respondent on the charge of robbery and the first five grounds of appeal are, in large measure, devoted to the question of whether a distinction should be drawn \"between the degree of drunkenness required to negative the existence of\" that intent which is, under the Criminal Code, an essential ingredient of the crime of robbery and the degree of drunkenness which is necessary to negative such intent as is an ingredient of common assault.\nThe sixth ground of appeal was directed to the decision of Mr. Justice Sheppard and the appellant put the question thereby raised in the following terms:\nWhether or not the Court of Appeal should substitute a conviction for the included offence of common assault, or order a new trial with respect thereto, when Crown counsel at the trial of the accused did not raise the issue of the accused's capacity to commit the included offence of common assault.\nPursuant to s. 569 of the Criminal Code, the learned trial judge was under a duty to direct his mind to the \"included offence\" of assault, and in the absence of any evidence to the contrary, I do not think that it should be assumed that he did not do so. Whether or not he properly directed himself as to the effect of drunkenness in negativing the intent to commit this offence is another question.\nThe report of the learned trial judge is not before us, and, with the greatest respect for those who may take a contrary view, I do not consider that the fact that it contains a statement \"that common assault was not raised by Crown counsel at the trial\" is sufficient ground for concluding that the learned trial judge did not consider this offence.\nIn my opinion, the duty which rests upon the trial judge to direct himself with respect to all included offences of which there is evidence can, in no way, be affected by the fact that the Crown Prosecutor has omitted to make reference to such offences. It follows, in my view, that in a case where the trial judge has wrongly applied the law applicable to such an offence the Crown is not deprived of its statutory right of appeal because of the omission of its agent at the trial to address the Court on the matter.\nThe fact that the learned trial judge found, as I think he did, that the respondent had \"violently manhandled\" an old man but was not guilty of assault because he was drunk at the time raises the question of law posed by the appellant as to whether, under the circumstances as found by the trial judge, drunkenness is a valid defence to common assault.\nIn considering the question of mens rea, a distinction is to be drawn between \"intention\" as applied to acts done to achieve an immediate end on the one hand and acts done with the specific and ulterior motive and intention of furthering or achieving an illegal object on the other hand. Illegal acts of the former kind are done \"intentionally\" in the sense that they are not done by accident or through honest mistake, but acts of the latter kind are the product of preconception and are deliberate steps taken towards an illegal goal. The former acts may be the purely physical products of momentary passion, whereas the latter involve the mental process of formulating a specific intent. A man, far advanced in drink, may intentionally strike his fellow in the former sense at a time when his mind is so befogged with liquor as to be unable to formulate a specific intent in the latter sense. The offence of robbery, as defined by the Criminal Code, requires the presence of the kind of intent and purpose specified in ss. 269 and 288, but the use of the word \"intentionally\" in defining \"common assault\" in s. 230(a) of the Criminal Code is exclusively referable to the physical act of applying force to the person of another. I would adopt the following passage from Kenny's Outlines of Criminal Law, 17th ed., p. 58, para. 42, as an authoritative statement on this subject. He there says:\n\u2026in Director of Public Prosecution v. Beard, (1920) A.C. 479 \u2026it was laid down that evidence of such drunkenness as \"renders the accused incapable of forming the specific intent, essential to constitute the crime, should be taken into consideration, with the other facts proved, in order to determine whether or not he had this intent\". In such a case the drunkenness, if it negatives the existence of the indispensable mental element of the crime \"negatives the commission of that crime\". Thus a drunken man's inability to form an intention to kill, or to do grievous bodily harm involving the risk of killing, at the time of committing a homicide, may reduce his offence from murder to manslaughter (which latter crime requires no more than a realization that some bodily harm may be caused). Drunkenness may likewise show that a supposed burglar had no intention of stealing, or that wounds were inflicted without any \"intent to do grievous bodily harm\", or that a false pretence was made with no \"intent to defraud\". But it must be remembered that a man may be so drunk as not to form an intention to kill or do grievous bodily harm while yet in sufficient control of his senses to be able to contemplate some harm and so to be guilty of manslaughter or of an unlawful wounding.\nThe decision of the learned trial judge, in my opinion, constitutes a finding that the respondent violently manhandled a man and knew that he was hitting him. Under these circumstances, evidence that the accused was in a state of voluntary drunkenness cannot be treated as a defence to a charge of common assault because there is no suggestion that the drink which had been consumed had produced permanent or temporary insanity and the respondent's own statement indicates that he knew that he was applying force to the person of another.\nIn view of the above, I would allow the appeal, and, having regard to the circumstances mentioned by him, I would dispose of this appeal as proposed by my brother Fauteux.\nAppeal allowed, Locke J. dissenting.

The appellant asserted that his evidence, given more than a year after the events to which it related, was an honest statement of what he could remember. An appeal from his conviction by a judge sitting without a jury was dismissed by the Court of Appeal. The appellant then appealed to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be allowed, the conviction quashed and a judgment of acquittal entered.\nPer Curiam: There was no evidence of any intent to mislead, or knowledge of the falsity of the evidence given. The evidence may have been in error, although that was doubtful, but error alone affords no basis for the inference of the intent and knowledge necessary to support a charge of perjury.\nPer Locke, Cartwright, Abbott, Martland and Ritchie JJ.: It was incumbent upon the prosecution to prove beyond reasonable doubt (i) that the appellant's evidence, specified in the indictment, was false in fact, (ii) that the appellant when he gave it knew that it was false, and (iii) that he gave it with intent to mislead the Court. Although there was some evidence on which it was open to the tribunal of fact to find that the first of these matters was proved, there was no evidence on which it could find that either of the other matters was proved. In such circumstances, had the trial been before a jury it would have been the duty of the trial judge to direct them to find a verdict of not guilty and it was equally his duty to so direct himself.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Supreme Court of Alberta, Appellate Division, affirming the conviction of the appellant. Appeal allowed.\nW. G. Morrow, Q.C., for the appellant.\nW. Shortreed, Q.C., for the respondent. The judgment of Kerwin C.J. and of Taschereau, Locke, Fauteux, Abbott, Martland, Judson and Ritchie JJ. was delivered by\nJudson J.:\u2014John Gordon Calder appeals from the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta, which dismissed his appeal from his conviction on a charge of perjury after a trial before a judge sitting without a jury. The only reasons before us from the Appellate Division are those of the Chief Justice, who dissented and would have allowed the appeal.\nThe precise charge of perjury against the appellant was that, as a witness in a divorce case heard in September 1958, he had given evidence to the effect\nthat shortly after the 1st day of July, A.D. 1957, Mr. Douglas Dunn and Mrs. Geraldine Holland and her two children moved to his trailer located about 30 feet west of his office facing south on 8th Street and Railway Avenue, Dawson Creek, British Columbia, and lived in the said trailer from three weeks to a month, well knowing same to be false and with intent to mislead.\nIn 1957 the appellant was living in Dawson Creek and carrying on a transport business. In his yard there was a trailer which he used for the accommodation of his drivers when they came in late at night and needed sleeping quarters. In June 1957 he permitted one Douglas Dunn, who also owned a small trucking business, to occupy this trailer. In the latter half of June 1957, Dunn was joined by a woman, whom he introduced as Mrs. Dunn. This woman was at that time married to William Holland. The two lived in this trailer for a period of about two weeks in the month of June 1957, and for part of this time there was another couple living there with them. At the end of June Mrs. Holland returned to Edmonton with Dunn to pick up her two children at the end of the school term. The two returned with the children to Dawson Creek early in the morning of July 2. Her story is that for the remainder of the first night she slept in the car with the two children and then immediately moved into a house with Dunn.\nIn the divorce action between Holland, as plaintiff, and his wife, as defendant, the appellant was subpoenaed as a witness. This is the evidence that he gave:\nQ. Was anybody else living in this trailer at the time you met Mrs. Dunn, as you were introduced to her?\nA. Mr. Dunn. Q. He was living there?\nA. Yes.\nQ. How long did Mr. Dunn and the woman you were introduced to as Mrs. Dunn live in this trailer?\nA. I would say approximately three weeks to a month.\nQ. Had Mr. Dunn slept in the trailer prior to the time that this lady appeared on the scene?\nA. That is right, yes.\nQ. And do you recall what period of time it would be that Mr. Dunn and this lady, who you now know to be Mrs. Holland, occupied the trailer?\nA. Sometime shortly after the 1st of July. It was right within a week of that First of July.\nQ. Were there any children?\nA. Yes.\nQ. The Court: Do you mean that she started to occupy the trailer about the 1st of July or the latter part of June?\nA. No, after the 1st of July, sometime right in there.\nQ. The Court: Sometime after the 1st of July, that was the first time she occupied it?\nA. Yes.\nQ. The Court: Now you said something about the children, they were there too?\nA. Yes.\nQ. Mr. Stanton: How many children?\nA. Two I believe sir.\nQ. When did they appear on the scene?\nA. Sometime just a few days after the 1st of July.\nMr. Miller cross-examines:\nQ. Another thing now, Mr. Calder, I am suggesting to you that Mrs. Holland's children never stayed in that trailer, that when they came to Dawson Creek they immediately went to this house that we are speaking about that belonged to Henderson?\nA. No sir.\nQ. I want you to consider, Mr. Calder, I am suggesting to you that the children never stayed in that trailer.\nA. Well, it is, they were there, that is all I know.\nQ. I know they were in Dawson Creek.\nA. They were there in that trailer. I have mentioned that twice or three times now sir.\nQ. All right now, Mr. Calder, I am suggesting to you that Mr. and Mrs. Hine stayed in that trailer at the time that Mrs. Holland or\/and Mr. Dunn were there?\nA. I don't know anything about that.\nThe Court: Were you ever in the trailer when Mrs. Holland and Mr. Dunn were in there?\nA. No, not that I recall sir.\nThe Court: When did you see Mrs. Holland in there with Mr. Dunn? A. Every day, right there 30 feet from my office, I couldn't help but see.\nThe Court: She was inside?\nA. Yes, she was outside and inside and in and out all the time.\nThe Court: And the children too?\nA. Yes.\nAt the trial of the appellant on the charge of perjury, Mrs. Holland, who by that time had become Mrs. Dunn, denied that she had ever occupied the trailer at any time in the month of July 1957 with Dunn and the children. The appellant gave evidence in his own defence and stated that Dunn and the woman had stayed in the trailer in June for some time and that the next time he saw them was July 2. On the following day they moved into the trailer again and he saw them in and around the trailer for a few days, after which they moved into a house. He asserted that his evidence, given at the trial, was an honest statement of what he could remember and that he thought that the couple had stayed in the trailer for a few days with the children. He admitted that he had never walked around and looked in the trailer to see who was in it. His observations were made from his office which was about 30 feet away. His understanding from Dunn was that they would be there for a few days. He explained that his evidence of the occupation of the trailer for a period of three weeks to a month, given at the trial, related to the month of June. He also said that he had seen Mrs. Holland's children around the trailer after Dunn had spoken to him about arrangements for the use of the trailer.\nThe unquestionable facts are that Mrs. Holland was living in the trailer with Dunn in the second half of June 1957, with Dunn and the children in a small house nearby from some time early in July until the end of September 1957 and that the children did not arrive in Dawson Creek until July 2.\nThe appellant gave his evidence at the divorce trial on September 16, 1958, more than a year after the events to which he testified. He became involved, as an innocent bystander, in events which were of no particular significance to him at the time. He had no interest in the outcome of the divorce trial and he was in court under subpoena. On this record, there is, to me, a preponderance of evidence, coming from other witnesses as well as the appellant, that this couple, along with the children, were in occupation of the trailer for some period early in July 1957. This, however, is no ground for reversal in this Court. But I agree with the learned Chief Justice that this appellant should not have been convicted of perjury on the ground that there was no evidence of any intent to mislead, or knowledge of the falsity of the evidence given. The evidence may have been in error, although I doubt that, but error alone, and that is the most that can be found against the appellant, affords no basis for the inference of the intent and knowledge necessary to support this charge.\nI would quash the conviction and direct that a judgment of acquittal be entered.\nThe judgment of Locke, Cartwright, Abbott, Martland and Ritchie JJ. was delivered by\nCartwright J.:\u2014I agree with the reasons and conclusion of my brother Judson and have little to add.\nWhile the learned Chief Justice of Alberta dissented from the judgment of the majority of the Appellate Division on two questions of law I find it necessary to consider only the first of these which is expressed in the formal order in the following words:\nThere was no evidence on which it could properly be found that the accused intended to swear as to the facts as was charged.\nThe test to be applied in determining whether or not there was any evidence, as distinguished from sufficient evidence, to support a conviction is to be found in the unanimous judgment of this Court delivered by Duff C.J.C. in The King v. D\u00e9cary1. The question to be answered is whether \"there was no evidence in support of the accusation before the jury in the sense that it was within the power of the trial judge, and therefore, of course, his duty, to direct a verdict of not guilty to be entered\"; it has long been settled that the question so stated is one of law in the strict sense, while the question on which the Court of Appeal is empowered to pass by s. 592(1) (a) (i) of the Criminal Code \u2014whether the verdict should be set aside on the ground that it is unreasonable or cannot be supported by the evidence\u2014is a mixed question of fact and law. This Court has jurisdiction to review a decision of the Court of Appeal on the first but not on the second of these questions. The two questions have however a common feature; to answer either the Court must, speaking generally, review the whole of the evidence.\nIn the case at bar it was incumbent upon the prosecution to prove beyond a reasonable doubt three matters, (i) that the evidence, specified in the indictment, given by the appellant on September 16, 1958, before Greschuk J. was false in fact, (ii) that the appellant when he gave it knew that it was false, and (iii) that he gave it with intent to mislead the Court. It may well be that if there were evidence to support findings that the appellant had given evidence false in fact knowing it to be false the tribunal of fact, in the absence of other evidence as to his intention, could properly draw the inference that in so doing he intended to mislead the Court.\nAfter reading all the evidence with care it appears to me that there was some evidence on which it was open to the tribunal of fact to find that the first of the matters mentioned above was proved but, in my opinion, there was no evidence on which it could find that either the second or third of such matters was proved. In such circumstances, had the trial been before a jury it would have been the duty of the learned trial judge to direct them to find a verdict of not guilty and it was equally his duty to so direct himself.\nI would allow the appeal, quash the conviction and direct a judgment of acquittal to be entered.\nAppeal allowed, conviction quashed and judgment of acquittal directed to be entered.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Morrow, Reynolds & Stevenson, Edmonton.\nSolicitor for the respondent: The Attorney General for Alberta.\n1 [1942] S.C.R. 80 at 83, [1942] 2 D.L.R. 401.\n"

Topechka, [1960] S.C.R. 898\nDate: 1960-11-21\nHer Majesty The Queen Appellant;\nand\nJohn Topechka Respondent.\n1960: October 11; 1960: November 21.\nPresent: Taschereau, Fauteux, Martland, Judson and Ritchie JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF ALBERTA, APPELLATE DIVISION.\nCriminal law\u2014Common gaming houses\u2014Slot machines\u2014Whether bowling machine giving amusement and chance of free game depending on skill a \"slot machine\" contrary to the Criminal Code, 1953\u201354 (Can.), c. 51, s. 170.\nThe accused's premises contained an automatic machine whereby a person, on the insertion of a coin, could play a bowling game by aiming a device which propelled balls toward the pins at the other end of the machine. The skill used in playing the game was in aiming the mechanical bowler. If the scoring of points had a sufficient margin the operator became entitled to a free game. On a charge of keeping a common gaming house for the purpose of gambling contrary to the Criminal Code, the respondent was acquitted by the magistrate and this judgment was confirmed by the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court on an equal division. The Crown appealed to this Court.\nHeld (Fauteux and Judson JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be dismissed.\nPer Taschereau, Martland and Ritchie JJ.: This machine is not a slot machine within the meaning of the Act. It is used for vending \"services\", and \"services\" include \"amusements\". Laphkas v. The King, [1942] S.C.R. 84, applied.\nWhat the law forbids is a machine that by electronic devices or other means, defeats the ability of the player to obtain favourable results. To be within the law, the player must control the game, and not be at the mercy of a machine where skill is not the only element.\nWhen the Act speaks of a matter of chance or uncertainty to the operator, it refers obviously to the machine itself which may produce different results independently of the skill of the player. Laphkas v. R., supra; R. v. Isseman, [1956] S.C.R. 798; Regent Vending Machines v. Alberta Vending Machines, [1954] S.C.R. 98, referred to.\nThe privilege of a free game is the result of skill in operating rather than an element of chance or uncertainty due to the machine and therefore does not make the machine unlawful.\nPer Fauteux and Judson JJ., dissenting: It is an offence if the result of one of any number of operations of the machine is a matter of chance or uncertainty to the operator. Chance or uncertainty to the operator must be present unless he can, without possibility of failure, achieve any result that he wishes or unless the result is automatic.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Supreme Court of Alberta, Appellate Division1, affirming, on an equal division, the acquittal of the accused. Appeal dismissed, Fauteux and Judson JJ. dissenting. S. A. Friedman, for the appellant.\nT. A. Miller, for the respondent.\nThe judgment of Taschereau, Martland and Ritchie JJ. was delivered by\nTaschereau J.:\u2014The charge against the respondent is that on the 26th day of February, 1959, at the City of Edmonton, he did unlawfully keep a disorderly house, to wit: a common gaming house for the purpose of gambling contrary to the Criminal Code. His Honour Magistrate Barclay acquitted the respondent, and this judgment was confirmed by the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta2, on an equal division, Mr. Justice McBride having died before the rendering of the judgment.\nThe provisions of the Criminal Code which have to be examined for the purpose of determining this case, are the subsections of section 170. This section reads as follows:\n170. (1) For the purpose of proceedings under this Part, a place that is found to be equipped with a slot machine shall be conclusively presumed to be a common gaming house.\n(2) In this section \"slot machine\" means any automatic machine or slot machine\n(a) that is used or intended to be used for any purpose other than vending merchandise or services; or\n(b) that is used or intended to be used for the purpose of vending merchandise or services if\n(i) the result of one of any number of operations of the machine is a matter of chance or uncertainty to the operator,\n(ii) as a result of a given number of successive operations by the operator the machine produces different results, or\n(iii) on any operation of the machine it discharges or emits a slug or token.\nIt was admitted at the trial that when the machine was seized, it was in good operating condition, and was on the premises of the accused. The only question that arises and which has to be decided is whether or not this \"William Ten Strike\" bowling machine is a \"slot machine\" contrary to the above section of the Criminal Code.\nThis alleged slot machine, as found by the learned trial judge, is operated as follows, and this is not contested by the appellant. \"There is a mechanical man at one end, and when ten cents is inserted in the slot, a ball comes out and comes before the man's hand. The man can be turned through an angle and is aimed at the pins which are placed in the form of a triangle at the other or far end. The base of the triangle is at the far end of the rectangle, with the apex facing the \"man\" and the player. After the man is aimed a plunger is pushed forward and the arm of the man moves and propels the ball forward. The direction of the ball is determined by the position of the man as determined by the player.\" The trial judge came to the conclusion that the skill used in playing the game is in aiming the man or bowler.\nIf the aim is accurate, the operator will get a \"strike\", and if he gets twelve strikes in a row, his score will be 300, which is the maximum that can be obtained. If the aim is inaccurate, the score will be lower. A better player will of course be the winner.\nI do not think that this machine is a \"slot machine\" within the meaning of the Act. It is used for vending \"services\" and, \"services\" include \"amusements\". (Laphkas v. The King3).\nThis machine, I believe, procures an innocent amusement to the operator, and this is not within the ban of the Act. It is an automatic machine used for vending services, and it does not emit a slug or token. Of course, under s. 170, a machine used for vending services or amusements will be illegal, if the result produced by the machine is a matter of chance or uncertainty to the operator, or if different results as a consequence of the adjustment of the mechanism are obtained. But this has nothing to do with the skill of the operator and is quite independent of the ability of the player to hit the target if he aims properly.\nWhat the law forbids is a machine that by electronic devices or other means, defeats the ability of the player to obtain favourable results. To be within the law, the player must control the game, and not be at the mercy of a machine where skill is not the only element, as it is in the present case.\nWhen the Act speaks of a matter of chance or uncertainty to the operator, it refers obviously to the machine itself which may produce different results independently of the skill of the player. I think this is the letter and spirit of the law. (Vide: Laphkas v. R., supra; R. v. Isseman4; Regent Vending Machines v. Alberta Vending Machines5). Skill might be successful or not, it may produce uncertain results, as in baseball, football, trap or skeet shooting, golf or hockey, but the uncertainty then comes from the player, and not from the mechanism of a machine which nullifies, the ability of the player.\nI would hate to think that the law intends to brand as a criminal a Canadian citizen who, for a dime, procures an innocent amusement to the public where there is no element of gambling or hazard.\nOf course, I have in mind a machine that functions properly and not a machine which does not operate normally, and where the skill of the player might be defeated. I finally believe, as did the learned Chief Justice of Alberta, that if the scoring of points shows that the operator has a sufficient margin, he is entitled to play another game without further payment of money for the operation. This feature can be eliminated by an adjustment of the scoring mechanism. As found by the courts below, the privilege so given is the result of skill in operating rather than an element of chance or uncertainty due to the machine, and does not make the machine unlawful.\nI would dismiss the appeal.\nThe judgment of Fauteux and Judson JJ. was delivered by\nJudson J. (dissenting):\u2014For the reasons given by Porter J.A. in the Appellate Division, I would allow this appeal. While there is some element of skill involved in the operation of the machine, in that one player may obtain a better result than another, it is still an offence if the result of one of any number of operations of the machine is a matter of chance or uncertainty to the operator. Chance or uncertainty to the operator must be present unless he can, without any possibility of failure, achieve any result that he wishes or unless the result is automatic. I do not think that uncertainty to the operator can be given the restricted meaning set out in the reasons of my brother Taschereau.\nAppeal dismissed, Fauteux and Judson JJ. dissenting.\nSolicitor for the appellant: The Attorney General for Alberta.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Miller, Miller & Witten, Edmonton.\n1 (1959\u201360), 30 W.W.R. 359, 32 C.R. 144.\n2 (1959\u201360), 30 W.W.R. 359, 32 C.R. 144.\n3 [1942] S.C.R 84, 2 D.L.R. 47.\n4 [1956] S.C.R. 798, 24 C.R. 346.\n5 [1954] S.C.R. 98, 2 D.L.R. 679.\n"

They later incorporated the appellant company to which all the property in question was transferred. Due to the failure to negotiate a lease with a major department store the shopping centre plan was dropped, and the holdings of the company were disposed of at enhanced prices resulting in a substantial profit to the company.\nThe appellant was assessed for income tax on this profit. An appeal by it to the Income Tax Appeal Board and a further appeal to the Exchequer Court were dismissed. Appellant then appealed to this Court.\nHeld (Cartwright J. dissenting): The appeal should be dismissed.\nPer Fauteux, Martland, Judson and Ritchie JJ.: As found by the trial judge, the promoters and the company failed to promote a shopping centre and they then disposed of their speculative property at a profit. This was a venture in the nature of trade and the profit from it is taxable within the meaning of ss. 3, 4 and 139(1) (e) of the Income Tax Act.\nThere is no analogy between the sale of long-held bona fide capital assets and the realization of a profit from a speculative venture in the nature of trade, as was the case here. Sutton Lumber and Trading Co. Ltd. v. Minister of National Revenue, [1953] 2 S.C.R. 77, distinguished.\nPer Cartwright J., dissenting: The evidence does not support the view that the appellant or its promoters would have purchased, or did purchase, the lands in question as a speculation looking to re-sale. The sales of the lands were a realization of its capital assets when the purpose for which they had been acquired was defeated, owing to circumstances beyond the control of the appellant.\nThe result is not affected by the circumstance that these capital assets were held for a much shorter time than those which were under consideration in Sutton Lumber and Trading Co. Ltd. v. Minister of National Revenue, supra,\nAPPEAL from a judgment of Dumoulin J. of the Exchequer Court of Canada1, affirming a decision of the Income Tax Appeal Board. Appeal dismissed, Cartwright J. dissenting. R. H. Barron, Q.C., for the appellant.\nD. S. Maxwell, for the respondent.\nCartwright J. (dissenting):\u2014The relevant facts out of which this appeal arises are set out in the reasons of my brother Judson. I agree with his view that the question to be determined is what business the appellant did in fact engage in, and that cases of this sort must all depend on their particular facts.\nThe respondent seeks to uphold the assessment on the ground that the profit resulting from the sale of the lands in question was income of the appellant for the year 1955 from its business. There is no doubt that the appellant was carrying on a business which it wound up when it became apparent that its scheme to develop a shopping centre could not be carried out. The question to be determined is whether the gain which resulted to the appellant from the sale of the lands was a capital gain or was income within the meaning of the applicable provisions of the Income Tax Act.\nIt is clear from many decisions that the Income Tax Act does not impose tax upon a profit which is in truth a capital gain. On this point it is sufficient to refer to the unanimous judgment of this Court delivered by Locke J. in Sutton Lumber and Trading Company Ltd. v. Minister of National Revenue2, in which are set out the principles by which the Court should be guided in dealing with the question, essentially one of fact, whether a particular profit is in truth a capital gain.\nIn the case at bar the question whether the profit realized by the appellant is subject to tax is dependent upon whether in fact the true nature of the business in which it engaged was, (i) the purchase of lands with a view to reselling them at a profit or, (ii) the development of a shopping centre to be held and operated as an investment or, (iii) both of these.\nAs I read the reasons of the learned trial judge, he has accepted as truthful the evidence of the appellant's witnesses and has found that the \"motivating intention\" of the appellant and its promoters and directors was to purchase the lands as the first step in the erection and development of a shopping centre to be held and operated as a revenue-producing investment. He has however held the profit realized subject to tax on the ground that reasonable and experienced business men, such as the promoters were, must have envisaged the possibility of being unable to carry out the scheme of developing the shopping centre and have hoped in that event to dispose of the lands at a profit. Accepting this as a reasonable inference, it does not appear to me to justify the finding that the appellant was in fact engaged in the business of buying and selling lands. I do not think the evidence supports the view that the appellant or its promoters would have purchased, or did purchase, the lands in question as a speculation looking to re-sale.\nApplying the principles set out in the Sutton Lumber case it appears to me that the sales of the lands made by the appellant were a realization of its capital assets when the purpose for which they had been acquired was defeated by the decision of the department store mentioned in the evidence to build on a nearby site. To put the matter colloquially, the lands were acquired and disposed of not as the stock-in-trade or inventory of a dealer in land but as capital assets of a developer of a shopping centre which, owing to circumstances beyond the control of the appellant, it became impossible to develop. The result is not affected by the circumstance that these capital assets were held for a much shorter time than those which were under consideration in the Sutton Lumber case.\nI would allow the appeal with costs throughout and direct that the judgment of the Exchequer Court and the assessments should be set aside.\nThe judgment of Fauteux, Martland, Judson and Ritchie JJ. was delivered by\nJudson J.:\u2014Regal Heights Limited appeals from the judgment of the Exchequer Court3 which dismissed its appeal from the judgment of the Income Tax Appeal Board. The issue is whether the appellant was properly assessed on a profit of $135,704.73 arising from its dealings with certain real property in the City of Calgary. The appellant reported an income for the year 1955 of $970.94. The department re-assessed at $135,704.73. Both the Income Tax Appeal Board and the Exchequer Court have held that the re-assessment was correct. Hence this appeal. The question is whether the appellant's profit from the sale of this real estate in the 1955 taxation year was a profit derived from a venture or concern in the nature of trade and was therefore income from a business within the meaning of ss. 3, 4 and 139(1) (e) of the Income Tax Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 148.\nIn September 1952 one Benjamin Raber became interested in the purchase of 40 acres of land in the City of Calgary which was then being operated as the Regal Golf Course. Mr. Raber took in three other associates and the four, as partners, purchase the property for $70,000. They intended to attempt to establish a large shopping centre on the property.\nIn May 1953 the partners purchased for $14,700 a property on the other side of the road which would be useful in giving more ready access to a shopping centre. They also purchased in March 1954 an undivided one-third interest in a property some distance away which they proposed to use for the purpose of advertising the existence of the shopping centre. The total outlay of the partners for the acquisition of these properties was, therefore, $88,700. In February 1954 they incorporated Regal Heights Limited and transferred all the property in question to the company in return for shares. The partners were the sole shareholders of the company. It became apparent in September 1954 that a shopping centre of the kind intended could not be established on the property. The reason was that a large department store, which the promoters hoped to interest in their centre, announced publicly that it intended to locate in the neighbourhood but on another site 20 blocks away.\nThe company, in December 1954, disposed of 30 acres for $88,500. In May 1955 the shareholders passed a resolution to wind up the company. The company next sold the property on the other side of the road, which had been purchased for the purpose of access, for $20,000, and finally, in May 1955, it sold 6.3 acres of the remaining property for $143,200.\nThere is no doubt that the primary aim of the partners in the acquisition of these properties, and the learned trial judge so found, was the establishment of a shopping centre but he also found that their intention was to sell at a profit if they were unable to carry out their primary aim. It is the second finding which the appellant attacks as a basis for the taxation of the profit as income. The Minister, on the other hand, submits that this finding is just as strong and valid as the first finding and that the promoters had this secondary intention from the beginning.\nThe appellant adduced much evidence concerning the efforts of the promoters to establish what was described as a \"regional shopping centre\". This means the largest of this type of enterprise and requires an area of from 30 to 60 acres. These promoters undoubtedly had the necessary land but a scheme of this kind involves an expenditure of anything from $2,000,000 to $5,000,000 and its financing and establishment depend upon the negotiation of leases with satisfactory tenants, and above all, upon the negotiation of a lease with a major department store as the centre of attraction.\nIt is necessary to set out the efforts made by the promoters to develop this property in this way. The acquisition of the two additional properties, the one for the purpose of easy access and the other for the purpose of advertising the centre, fits into the scheme. In February 1953 they secured a favourable opinion from the Calgary Planning Board that the property would be re-zoned from residential to commercial purposes although the Board withheld formal approval until there should be some indication that construction would begin. In addition, they had sketches made to show what the centre would look like. These sketches were no more than promotional literature. They made studies of other shopping centres; with professional help they compiled lists of prospective tenants; they entered into discussions with four department stores although the evidence shows that there was only one which might possibly be interested; they had discussions with one of the banks concerning the financing of the project; they had a special survey made at a fee of $3,000 for the purpose of influencing one particular department store; and they incorporated this company.\nThese efforts were all of a promotional character. The establishment of a regional shopping centre was always dependent upon the negotiation of a lease with a major department store. There is no evidence that any such store did anything more than listen to the promoters' ideas. There is, understandably, no evidence of any intention on the part of these promoters to build regardless of the outcome of these negotiations. There is no evidence that these promoters had any assurance when they entered upon this venture that they could interest any such department store. Their venture was entirely speculative. If it failed, the property was a valuable property, as is proved from the proceeds of the sales that they made. There is ample evidence to support the finding of the learned trial judge that this was an undertaking or venture in the nature of trade, a speculation in vacant land. These promoters were hopeful of putting the land to one use but that hope was not realized. They then sold at a substantial profit and that profit, in my opinion, is income and subject to taxation.\nThroughout the existence of the appellant company, its interest and intentions were identical with those of the promoters of this scheme. One of the objects stated in the memorandum of association of the company was\nTo construct and operate apartment houses, blocks, shopping centres and to otherwise carry on any business which may be conveniently carried on in a shopping centre.\nNothing turns upon such a statement in such a document. The question to be determined is not what business or trade the company might have carried on but rather what business, if any, it did in fact engage in. (Sutton Lumber and Trading Co. Ltd. v. Minister of National Revenue4). What the promoters and the company did and intended to do is clear to me on the evidence, as it was to the learned trial judge. They failed to promote a shopping centre and they then disposed of their speculative property at a profit. This was a venture in the nature of trade and the profit from it is taxable within the meaning of ss. 3, 4 and 139(1) (e) of the Income Tax Act. These cases must all depend on their particular facts and there is no analogy between the sale of long-held bona fide capital assets, as in the Sutton Lumber case, and the realization of a profit from this speculative venture in the nature of trade.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.

The corporation advertised to the public that it had enclosed a questionnaire form in 10,000 of these containers. The questionnaire sought certain information from the recipient which would be valuable to the respondent in the operation of its business. A recipient who completed the form and mailed it to the respondent was entitled to a payment of $5 from the respondent.\nThe corporation was charged with three offences under s. 179(1) of the Criminal Code, the lotteries section.

It was not the money that was disposed of by chance, but a form by means of which the recipient thereof could, on compliance with the required conditions, obtain the payment.\nAn uncompleted questionnaire form is not an instrument \"giving a right to receive money\" within the definition of property in s. 2(32) (a) of the Criminal Code.

Osler, Q.C., for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nMartland J.:\u2014The respondent is a corporation which manufactures soap products. On April 11, 1959, it advertised by newspaper, in Edmonton, that it had enclosed a questionnaire in 10,000 packets of its products, distributed across Canada, and identified by a five star seal on the container. Over 100,000 packages of soap products were distributed in Canada in the containers marked with the five star seal. A person who obtained a questionnaire, by purchase of a package containing it, could, by completing and mailing it to a specified address, receive the sum of $5. The scheme was also advertised on television.\nThe questionnaire sought information from the recipient of it, among other things, as to the product in the package in which the questionnaire was found, the type of washing machine used, the laundry product mostly used, whether bleach was used in laundering, how certain kinds of garments were washed and concluded with a question as to the ways in which the respondent's laundry, dish washing, and house cleaning products could be improved.\nThe respondent was charged with three offences under s. 179(1) of the Criminal Code. The first was that it \"did unlawfully conduct a certain scheme for the purpose of determining who, or the holders of what lots, tickets, numbers or chances, are the winners of any property so proposed to be advanced, loaned, given, sold or disposed of, to wit: Questionnaire forms each of which when completed and returned to the said Company had a value of $5. Contrary to the Criminal Code of Canada.\" The second and third charges were that the respondent unlawfully advertised and that it unlawfully caused to be advertised this scheme.\nSection 179(1) of the Criminal Code provides:\n179(1) Every one is guilty of an indictable offence and is liable to imprisonment for two years who\n(a) makes, prints, advertises or publishes, or causes or procures to be made, printed, advertised or published, any proposal, scheme or plan for advancing, lending, giving, selling or in any way disposing of any property, by lots, cards, tickets, or any mode of chance whatsoever;\n* * *\n(d) conducts or manages any scheme, contrivance or operation of any kind for the purpose of determining who, or the holders of what lots, tickets, numbers or chances, are the winners of any property so proposed to be advanced, loaned, given, sold or disposed of;\n* * *\nThe relevant definition of \"property\" is contained in para. (a) of subs. (32) of s. 2 of the Criminal Code, which reads:\n(32) \"property\" includes\n(a) real and personal property of every description and deeds and instruments relating to or evidencing the title or right to property, or giving a right to recover or receive money or goods,\nAll three charges were dismissed by the learned Magistrate who tried the case. In the written reasons for his decision he makes the following findings:\nTherefore, to sum up, I find that the forms were sent out in these packages, to various areas throughout the whole of Canada, that there was a sincere effort on the part of the company to ascertain the desires and opinions of the housewives who used their property with the intention of improving the property, the packages of soap in this case. I find that the reward was not unduly high, and that it didn't vary, and that the price of the packages didn't vary and that no extra money had to be sent in with the form, that once the questionnaire form was sent in, duly answered by the person sending it, there was no lottery or no choice of who would win. It was a conscientious effort on the part of the company to obtain the views of the people using their product. I don't think there was any sham about the whole proceedings, and I think that the company have proved this in their evidence by calling the member of the research department of their firm to show that the answers received were treated seriously, \u2026\nHis decision was sustained on appeal to the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta2 on an equal division. The appellant has appealed from that judgment.\nIt is not questioned that the distribution of the questionnaire forms was determined by chance. The question is whether, because of that fact, the respondent's scheme was one for the disposition of property by chance. This involves the question as to what it was that the purchaser of a five star seal package, which contained a form, had obtained.\nThe contention of the appellant is that, under the respondent's scheme, what was disposed of by lot or chance was the sum of $5. It was contended that the acquisition of the questionnaire form gave to the recipient a right to receive the sum of $5 from the respondent.\nThe obtaining of a form in a package did not, however, immediately entitle the recipient to the payment. Before he could claim the payment he was required to complete the form and to mail it to the respondent. That which was disposed of by chance was not, therefore, the money, but a form, by means of which, on compliance with the required conditions, he could obtain the payment.\nThis brings us to the question as to whether an uncompleted questionnaire form is an instrument \"giving a right to receive money\" within the paragraph defining \"property\" in the Criminal Code.\nI do not think that it was. Assuming that the form was an instrument, the questionnaire uncompleted, or completed but not mailed, did not confer any right to receive a $5 payment. The form gave to the recipient an opportunity to obtain the payment by performing the stipulated services; i.e., completion and mailing of the form. The questionnaire constituted nothing more than an offer, but the right to receive the payment could only arise by contract, which would result if the offer were accepted in the manner which it had indicated, which involved the furnishing of information to the respondent. In itself it created no right to property.\nAs previously pointed out, the learned Magistrate has found, and the evidence supports the finding, that the requirement for the completion and mailing of the questionnaire form was not a sham. The services which the recipient of the questionnaire form was asked to perform were not a mere formality, serving as a device seeking to avoid the application of s. 179(1) of the Criminal Code. On the contrary, the evidence, accepted by the learned Magistrate, establishes that the whole plan was a genuine effort on the part of the respondent to obtain information which would be valuable to it in the operation of its business. For those services the respondent agreed to make a standard payment of $5 in each case.\nFor these reasons it is my opinion that the appeal should be dismissed.\nAppeal dismissed.\nSolicitor for the appellant: The Attorney General for Alberta.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Clement, Parlee, Whittaker, Irving, Mustard & Rodney, Edmonton.\n1 (1959-60), 30 W.W.R. 352, 32 CR. 137.\n2 (1959-60), 30 W.W.R. 352, 32 C.R. 137.\n"

According to his uncontradicted evidence this payment was simply for the manufacture of the dentures, and no charge was made for any part of the other dental work. On a charge of practising dentistry for hire, contrary to s. 37(a) of The Dental Association Act, R.S.A. 1955, c. 82, the accused was acquitted in magistrate's court, and an appeal from this acquittal was dismissed by the District Court judge.\nOn an ex parte application to a Supreme Court judge, made under s. 15 of The Summary Convictions Act, R.S.A. 1955, c. 325, leave to appeal to the Appellate Division was granted as a question of law was involved of sufficient importance to justify a further appeal. The Appellate Division allowed the appeal and from this decision the accused appealed to this Court. The appellant contended that s. 15(1) makes no provision for an appeal by the informant from an acquittal, and is confined to applications made by \"the Attorney General or counsel instructed by him\".\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nSections 581 to 592 inclusive of the Criminal Code, as adopted by s. 15(2) of The Summary Convictions Act of Alberta, are limited in their effect to matters of procedure and are in no way related to the right of appeal itself which is fully stated in s. 15(1). As the informant is a \"person affected by the conviction or order\" to which the Act applies, it follows that he is accorded a right to apply to a Supreme Court judge under s. 15(1).\nThe contention that because of the omission of the term \"order of dismissal\" from s. 15 of The Summary Convictions Act, the right of appeal to the Appellate Division does not apply where there has been an acquittal by the District Court, failed in view of the provisions of s. 692(1) of the Criminal Code. The argument that the Appellate Division exceeded its jurisdiction which was limited to a question of law alone also failed. As the facts were not in dispute, the only question at issue was as to the true construction to be placed upon ss. 30 and 37(a) of The Dental Association Act. This is a question of law and was so dealt with in the majority judgment.\nAs the appellant's \"skill and experience\" in doing dental work were part of the value or price he was able to obtain for the finished dentures, it followed that the appellant's conduct constituted \"practising the profession of dentistry \u2026 for hire\" within the meaning of the statute.\nFurthermore the words \"for hire\" as used in s. 37(a) do not necessarily import the payment of money and should be construed as including any kind of compensation or reward. At least part of the compensation which the appellant received for doing the dental work was that he thereby obtained an order to manufacture the dentures.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Supreme Court of Alberta, Appellate Division1, allowing an appeal from a judgment of Edwards D.C.J. Appeal dismissed.\nE. M. Woolliams, for the appellant.\nS. J. Helman, Q.C., for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nRitchie J.:\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta2 allowing an appeal by the private prosecutor from a judgment of His Honour Judge M. J. Edwards and entering a conviction against the appellant for practising the profession of dentistry within the Province of Alberta \"for hire\" contrary to the provisions of s. 37(a) of The Dental Association Act, R.S.A. 1955, c. 82.\nAt all times relevant to these proceedings, the appellant, who did not hold a valid certificate of registration from the Alberta Dental Association, resided at Drumheller in the Province of Alberta where he carried on the business of a dental mechanic in an office, over the door of which there was a sign reading \"Valley Dental Lab\". In the Autumn of 1958 a man by the name of Hill came to this office by appointment to be fitted for a complete set of false teeth. On his first visit a preliminary impression was taken of his jaws and he paid $42.33. On his second visit a \"final impression\" was taken. On his third visit \"bite blocks\" were placed in his mouth to determine the relation of the upper and lower jaws, and at the fourth appointment the teeth were set up in wax and placed in his mouth and a further appointment was then made for the \"finished date\" at which time the plates were put in his mouth and he paid the appellant a further sum of $47.63, making a total of $90. All this work was done by the appellant.\nThe above facts are not in dispute, but the appellant's uncontradicted evidence was that the $90 charge was \"simply for the manufacture of those dentures\" and that no charge whatever was made for obtaining \"the bite\", making the impression or any of the other dental work. The sole question before the Appellate Division was whether or not, under these circumstances, the appellant was practising dentistry within the meaning of The Dental Association Act.\nSection 37 of The Dental Association Act reads as follows:\n37. A person not holding a valid certificate of registration and a subsisting annual certificate who\n(a) practises the profession of dentistry within the Province either publicly or privately for hire, gain or hope of reward,\n* * *\nis guilty of an offence and liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding two hundred dollars and not less than fifty dollars for the first offence, and to a fine of four hundred dollars for each and every subsequent offence.\nThe practice of dentistry is described in the following words in s. 30 of the same statute:\n30. A person who, for a fee, salary, reward or commission, paid or to be paid by an employer to him, or for fee, money or compensation, paid or to be paid either to himself or an employer or any other person\n(a) examines, diagnoses or advises on any condition or the tooth or teeth in the jaw or jaws of any person,\n(b) directly in the oral cavity of any person takes, makes, performs or administers any impression, operation or treatment or any part of any impression, operation or treatment of any kind of or upon the tooth or teeth or jaw or jaws, or of, for or upon any disease or lesion of the tooth or teeth or jaw or jaws, or the malposition thereof, in the mouth of any person,\n(c) fits any artificial denture, tooth or teeth in, to or upon the jaw or jaws of a person, or\n(d) advertises or holds himself out as being qualified or entitled to do all or any of the above things,\nshall be deemed to be practising the profession of dentistry within the meaning of this Act.\nOn October 30, 1958, the appellant was arraigned before Magistrate Hardcastle and pleaded not guilty to an Information sworn against him by Dr. Ronald G. Dickson, a dentist of Drumheller, it being submitted on his behalf that as he had charged nothing for doing any of the work described in s. 30 but only for his work as a dental mechanic in manufacturing the dentures he could not be found guilty of practising dentistry \"for hire\" within the meaning of s. 37(a), and that he was, in fact, guilty of no offence under that section. In dismissing the charge, the learned magistrate said:\nAccording to the evidence as I see it, I cannot see where there was a charge made for dentistry. The witness distinctly stated he paid $90.00 for the making of the teeth.\nAn appeal from this acquittal was duly asserted to the Divisional Court of the District of Southern Alberta by the informant's solicitor pursuant to the provisions of Part XXIV of the Criminal Code which, except as otherwise specifically provided, are made to apply \"to all convictions and all orders and the proceedings relating thereto made by a justice\" by s. 5 of The Summary Convictions Act of Alberta.\nAt the trial de novo held before His Honour Judge Edwards the informant's, solicitor was expressly authorized to act on behalf of the Crown by the Department of the Attorney General of Alberta, and the above facts, including the fact that the money was paid simply for manufacturing the teeth were sworn to both by the appellant and by Mr. Hill. In dismissing this appeal, the learned District Court judge said:\nThe evidence before me, and uncontradicted, is that the $90.00 was paid to the accused for making a set of dentures, and not for doing any of the things specifically itemized in Section 30, of the Dental Association Act.\nThe relevant section of The Summary Convictions Act of Alberta governing an appeal from a judgment or a decision of a District Court judge in such circumstances as these reads as follows:\n15. (1) Where it is made to appear to a judge of the Supreme Court, on the application of the Attorney General or any person affected by a conviction or order to which this Act applies, that a judgment or decision of a judge of the district court made on appeal from any such conviction or order involves a question of law of sufficient importance to justify a further appeal, the judge of the Supreme Court may so certify, and thereupon an appeal lies to the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court from the judgment or decision of the judge of the district court.\n(2) The procedure on the appeal shall be the same as that provided by sections 581 to 592 of the Criminal Code and the rules relating thereto in so far as they are applicable where the ground of appeal involves a question of law.\nIn purported compliance with this section, the informant's solicitor, who, for this purpose, does not appear to have been instructed by the Attorney General, made an ex parte application to Mr. Justice W. G. Egbert of the Supreme Court who duly certified that a question of law was involved of sufficient importance to justify a further appeal, and Notice of Appeal having been served the appeal came on for hearing before the Appellate Division.\nIt was urged before the Appellate Division that Mr. Justice Egbert lacked jurisdiction to make the order embodying the aforesaid certificate because the accused had been given no notice of the application. Although this ground of appeal was included in the notice pursuant to which leave to appeal to this Court was granted, it was specifically abandoned at the hearing of this appeal. It was, however, contended before the Appellate Division and before this Court that Mr. Justice Egbert lacked jurisdiction on another ground, viz., that s. 15(1) of The Summary Convictions Act of Alberta makes no provision for an appeal by the informant from an acquittal, and is confined to applications made by \"the Attorney General or counsel instructed by him\".\nIn this regard the argument was advanced that because the procedure provided by s. 584 of the Criminal Code, for appealing from a verdict of acquittal in proceedings by indictment, is adopted by s. 15(2) \"in so far as \u2026 applicable\" and because that section of the Code only refers specifically to appeals by \"the Attorney General or counsel instructed by him\", it, therefore, follows that there can be no appeal by an informant under s. 15 of The Summary Convictions Act of Alberta.\nIn my opinion ss. 581 to 592 inclusive of the Criminal Code, as adopted by the said s. 15(2), are limited in their effect to matters of procedure and are in no way related to the right of appeal itself which is fully stated in s. 15(1) (see Scullion v. Canadian Breweries Transport Limited3, per Fauteux J.) and as I take the view that the informant is a \"person affected by the conviction or order\" to which The Summary Convictions Act applies, it follows that I am of opinion that the informant is accorded a right to apply to a Supreme Court judge under s. 15(1).\nThe application \"of the Attorney General or any person affected by a conviction or order to which this Act applies\" for which provision is made in s. 15(1) of The Summary Convictions Act is only to be granted when it has been made to appear to a Supreme Court judge\n\u2026 that a judgment or decision of a judge of the district court made on appeal from any such conviction or order involves a question of law of sufficient importance to justify a further appeal \u2026 (The italics are mine.) It was, however, contended on behalf of the appellant that\nthe legislature, having omitted the term \"order of dismissal\" from s. 15 of the Summary Convictions Act, the right of appeal to the Appellate Division does not apply where there has been an acquittal by the district court. (The quotation is from the factum of the appellant.)\nAs the \"conviction or order\" from which an appeal lies to a District Court judge is the \"conviction or order\" of the justice, I am of opinion that those words as used in s. 15(1) can only refer to such a \"conviction or order\", and as the summary conviction provisions of the Criminal Code apply \"to all orders and the proceedings relating thereto made or to be made by a justice\", it follows that the word \"order\" as used in s. 15(1) is to be given the meaning assigned to it by s. 692(1) of the Criminal Code which provides that: \" 'Order' means any order, including an order for payment of money.\" These words are, in my opinion, sufficiently wide to include an \"order of dismissal\". If it were otherwise it would mean that there could be no appeal to the Appellate Division under The Summary Convictions Act of Alberta in any case in which an order of dismissal had been made by a justice even if that order had later been reversed and the accused had been convicted by a District Court judge. That the legislature should have intended such a result is, in my opinion, so unlikely that I would have been inclined to attach the wider meaning to the word \"order\" as used in s. 15(1) even if it had not been for the provisions of s. 692(1) of the Code.\nI am, accordingly, of opinion that Egbert J. had jurisdiction to grant the order which he did and that the Appellate Division was clothed with jurisdiction to hear and determine this appeal, but it is said on behalf of the appellant that that Court exceeded its jurisdiction which was limited to a question of law alone because the reasons of Chief Justice Ford and Mr. Justice Porter\n\u2026 are based on facts found by them and inferences drawn by them and not on facts found by the trial judge and inferences drawn by him. As the facts are not in dispute, the only question at issue is as to the true construction to be placed upon ss. 30 and 37(a) of The Dental Association Act. This is a question of law and was so dealt with by Ford C.J. in rendering the decision on behalf of the majority of the Appellate Division, in which he held that as the appellant's \"skill and experience\" in doing dental work were part of the value or price he was able to obtain for the finished dentures, it followed that the appellant's conduct constituted \"practising the profession of dentistry \u2026 for hire\" within the meaning of the statute.\nI am in full agreement with the reasoning and conclusion of the Appellate Division, but I am of opinion that the dental work was also done \"for hire\" in another sense. The words \"for hire\" as used in s. 37(a) do not necessarily import the payment of money and should, in my view, be construed as including any kind of compensation or reward. In the present case, at least a part of the compensation which the appellant received for doing the dental work was that he thereby obtained Mr. Hill's order to manufacture the dentures and incidentally received it for a better price than the dentists had been in the habit of paying for such work so that even if it could be said that the appellant was paid no money for doing the work of a professional dentist it would, nevertheless, be apparent that he was compensated for such work by receiving a profitable order for his work as a dental mechanic, and this, in my opinion, was one measure of his hire. I am, accordingly, of opinion that the transaction between the appellant and Mr. Hill, as the appellant himself described it, constituted practising dentistry \"for hire\" within the meaning of ss. 37(a) and 30 of The Dental Association Act.\nI would dismiss the appeal, but in view of the circumstances of this case there should be no costs.\nAppeal dismissed without costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Woolliams & Kerr, Calgary.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Helman, Fleming & Neve, Calgary.\n1 (1959\u201360), 30 W.W.R. 101, 125 C.C.C. 349.\n2 (1959\u201360), 30 W.W.R. 101, 125 C.C.C. 349.\n3 [1956] S.C.R 512 at 514\n"

Very little effort was made to commence production of the generators, and as a result of the appellant\u2019s inability to begin deliveries at the time promised, the three interested parties agreed to a revised delivery schedule. B failed to adhere to the new schedule and C cancelled the sub-contract, having previously notified B of its intention so to do, if delivery was not made as promised. B sued for damages arising from cancellation of the contract. The action was dismissed by the trial judge, and this judgment was affirmed by a majority in the Court of Appeal.

Appeal dismissed.\nA.S. Pattillo, Q.C., and D.J. Wright, for the plaintiff, appellant.\nP.B.C. Pepper, Q.C., Miss Janet Scott and W. Herridge, for the defendant, respondent. The judgment of the Court was delivered by\nJUDSON J.:\u2014Bogue Electric of Canada Limited, the appellant, sued the respondent, Crothers Manufacturing Limited, for damages arising from the cancellation of a contract for the supply of 249 electrical generators which Bogue was to manufacture for Crothers. The judgment at trial was that Crothers was justified in cancelling the contract for non-delivery at the stated time. This judgment was affirmed on appeal and Bogue now appeals to this Court.\nOn October 18, 1956, Crothers entered into a contract with Canadian Commercial Corporation, a Crown corporation, for the supply of a large number of motor-driven generator sets for rural electrification in India. Crothers were suppliers of diesel motors and they sub-let to Bogue the contract for the supply of the generators. On October 19, Crothers wired to Bogue to book the order for the generators. There had been previous discussions between the two companies. Bogue knew that Crothers was tendering for the contract with Canadian Commercial Corporation and that if the tender was successful, it would be asked to supply these generators. Bogue had stated that shipment could begin 16 to 18 weeks from the date of receipt of a firm order. On October 30, 1957, Bogue and Crothers entered into their formal contract, which provided for end of the month deliveries of 40 generators from February to June 1957 and the balance in July and August. The need for regular deliveries was known to both parties. Crothers had first to connect the generators to the diesel units before it could meet its own schedule of deliveries under the head contract commencing in March 1957, and its ability to do this depended upon prompt performance by Bogue.\nIt became apparent on February 13, 1957, as a result of a visit by an official of Crothers to the Bogue plant in Ottawa, that Bogue had made very little effort to begin to produce the generators and that delivery could not begin by the end of February as promised. This was nearly four months after the placing of the order. The evidence coming from the internal memorandum of the Bogue Company, dated February 22, 1957, makes it clear that the delay was entirely the fault of the Bogue Company, which appears to have been making little or no effort to complete its contract. The reason was that while the contracting party was Bogue Electric of Canada Limited, the decisions necessary to carry out the contract had to be made at the head office of the parent company in the United States and these decisions were not being made. As a result of the obvious inability of Bogue to begin its deliveries on February 28, 1957, the three interested parties, the Government, Crothers and Bogue, agreed, on March 12, 1957, to accept a new delivery schedule to begin on May 15, 1957. On March 13, 1957, the Canadian company emphasized to its parent company the urgency of preparing to meet this new delivery schedule.\nAfter this had been arranged, Crothers, with the approval of the Government, revised its own delivery schedule of the completed units to begin on June 30, 1957, instead of March, as previously agreed. On March 29, 1957, Bogue assured Crothers that \u201cdelivery was progressing satisfactorily according to the revised schedule.\u201d This assurance was given notwithstanding the fact that on March 22, 1957, a Government inspector who had visited the Bogue plant in Ottawa had made a report which showed that little was being done to fill the order and that there was little likelihood of the delivery of 40 generators by May 15, 1957. Crothers complained to the Government about this but was informed on April 18 that it would be held to its own revised delivery schedule under the head contract. After receiving this information, Crothers made another visit to the Bogue plant and found that conditions were as bad as had been reported by the Government inspector one month before. In spite of the assurances of Bogue that the delivery schedule would be met, Crothers was satisfied that this was impossible because of the inactivity in the plant. Crothers then began to make plans for an alternative source of supply of generators.\nOn May 6, 1957, Crothers notified Bogue that if deliveries were not made on May 15 as promised, it would cancel the sub-contract. Bogue, on May 7, 1957, stated that it was exerting its best efforts to meet its commitments under the contract. Crothers made tentative arrangements to obtain generators from an alternative supplier if Bogue generators should not be delivered on May 15. Bogue did not deliver on May 15 and Crothers cancelled the subcontract on May 16.\nAt the trial no attempt was made to explain Bogue\u2019s lack of preparedness and dilatory conduct. The learned trial judge said that there was no evidence to lead to any conclusion about the date when Bogue might have delivered its first 40 units had it been allowed to do so. The generators called for under the contract were uncomplicated, run-of-the-mill units. At no time did Bogue have a first-production unit available for inspection as required by the contract. It failed to take on labour. It was late in ordering supplies. By May 15, 1957, it had been supposedly working on this sub-contract from October 19, 1956, a period of 7 months. Both the trial judge and the majority opinion in the Court of Appeal held that Crothers was justified in terminating the contract in these circumstances. The only point of the dissent in the Court of Appeal was that certain general conditions, which Laidlaw J.A. said formed part of the sub-contract, required the giving of 15 days\u2019 notice of termination on default by Bogue.\nThe sub-contract between Crothers and Bogue contained the following condition:\nThe purchaser reserves the right to cancel all or any part of this order if delivery is not made within the time promised or specified, without any liability whatsoever.\nThis was the condition under which Crothers exercised its right of cancellation. The learned trial judge\u2019s finding was that time was of the essence of the head contract between the Government and Crothers. He was also of the same opinion concerning the sub-contract between Crothers and Bogue. In the circumstances of this case no other conclusion is possible. This was a mercantile contract. The importance of delivery according to schedule is emphasized by the whole of this record. Crothers was depending upon Bogue to make and deliver a component part of a complete unit. After delivery of the generator, Crothers had to connect it with its motive power and meet a delivery schedule of its own. The supply of these complete units was part of a wider Government plan which was recognized to be an urgent one. It was part of a chain of transactions, and punctual performance by Bogue went to the whole consideration of the sale. (22 Hals., 2nd ed., 57)\nThe next question is whether time ceased to be of the essence because of the alteration of the delivery dates by mutual consent. The dates of all the deliveries were precisely stated in both the original and the amended schedule. No other change was made in the sub-contract. All that happened was that one schedule of deliveries was substituted for another. Bogue\u2019s new delivery schedule was acted upon by Crothers in re-scheduling its own deliveries despite the problem of storage space, and at no time between March 1957 and May 15, 1957, did Crothers do anything to indicate to Bogue that May 15 was not the deadline. As late as April 25 Bogue was insisting that it could make delivery on May 15 although it is quite apparent from the evidence that there was no basis of fact for this insistence.\nBoth the learned trial judge and the Court of Appeal, without any dissent on this point, have held that time remained of the essence of the contract notwithstanding the substitution of new delivery dates, and in my opinion this is clearly correct. The principle is stated in 8 Hals., 3rd ed., 165:\nWhere time is of the essence of the contract, and is extended by agreement between the parties, the extension does not operate as an entire waiver of the condition, but merely has the effect of substituting the extended time for that originally fixed.\nEven if this were not so, there is also a unanimous finding of the learned trial judge and the whole Court of Appeal that the notice given by Crothers to Bogue on May 6th requiring Bogue to deliver on the date promised was reasonable. These are concurrent findings on a question of fact, fully supported by the evidence and obviously correct. I have therefore no difficulty in rejecting the appellant\u2019s twofold submission that on May 6, the date of the notice, time was not of the essence and that the notice given was not a reasonable one.\nThis leaves only the appellant\u2019s submission that there was no right of cancellation until 15 days following May 15, 1957. This proposition is the sole foundation for the dissenting opinion of Laidlaw J.A. in the Court of Appeal. In order to succeed the appellant must show that General Conditions CCC 50 form part of the contract and that the provision for 15 days\u2019 notice of cancellation contained in clause 22 of these Conditions overrides the specific provision for cancellation contained in the contract itself which I have already quoted.\nThe learned trial judge dealt with this aspect of the case on the assumption that these general conditions did form part of the sub-contract. They expressly form part of the head contract and they were drawn to be of general application to contracts between the Crown and a contractor. There are many clauses which can have no possible application to a contract to which the Government is not a party. The sub-contract between Crothers and Bogue states that it is understood that General Conditions, Form CCC 50, will apply for the duration of the contract, which could be interpreted to mean that Bogue was contracting on the understanding that Crothers was subject to these conditions. It is not, however, necessary to decide this point. I will proceed on the same assumption as the trial judge. Clause 22 of these general conditions provides:\nIf the Contractor is in default for a period of fifteen days in carrying out the terms of the contract as a result of events or occurrences for which it is responsible or which are within its control\u2026 the Corporation may at his option, upon giving notice in writing to the Contractor, (i) terminate the contract as to work not theretofore completed or (ii) take the work out of the Contractor\u2019s hands and employ such means as the Corporation may see fit to complete the work in whole or in part.\nBut along with this, one must read Clause 1(2) of the interpretation section of these general conditions. It reads:\nIn the event of any inconsistencies, the provisions of the agreement and\/or of these general conditions shall prevail over the specifications (if any) and the provisions of the agreement and of the supplemental conditions (if any) shall prevail over these general conditions.\nI agree entirely with the finding of the learned trial judge that the provision for cancellation on 15 days\u2019 notice in the general conditions is in conflict with the condition in the agreement between Crothers and Bogue authorizing an immediate right of cancellation without further liability \u201cif delivery is not made within the time promised or specified\u201d, and that consequently, the general conditions, even if assumed to be applicable, must give way. I would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the plaintiff, appellant: Mcllraith and Mcllraith, Ottawa.\nSolicitors for the defendant, respondent: McMillan, Binch, Stuart, Berry, Dunn, Corrigan & Howland, Toronto.\n"

The caretaker was present when the opening was made the previous day. A panel to contain the heat on the floor below had been placed across the opening. The caretaker was leaning over the opening and fell after losing his balance. The action was maintained by the trial judge, but this judgment was reversed by the Court of Appeal.\nHeld: The accident was not caused by any fault on the part of the contractor.\nIt is normal that building operations involve certain inherent dangers, and any person who enters such a site cannot expect complete security. The law does not require that the standard of care be placed at an exaggerated level. Hence the law does not require a contractor to protect against an inherent danger a person who, having knowledge of it, does not try to guard against it.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench, Appeal Side, Province of Quebec1, reversing a jugment of Marquis J. Appeal dismissed.\nR. Legendre, Q.C., and R. Angers, for the plaintiff, appellant. J. de Grandpr\u00e9, for the defendant, respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nTaschereau J.:\u2014La demanderesse-appelante r\u00e9clame de l'intim\u00e9, tant personnellement qu'en sa qualit\u00e9 de tutrice \u00e0 ses enfants mineurs, la somme de $47,198.68. Elle all\u00e8gue qu'au cours du mois de janvier 1953, le d\u00e9fendeur Gravel effectuait pour le compte de la Commission Scolaire de Chicoutimi, des travxaux de r\u00e9parations \u00e0 l'\u00e9cole St-Joachim, et il avait entrepris de construire un \u00e9tage suppl\u00e9mentaire \u00e0 l'\u00e9cole d\u00e9j\u00e0 existante.\nLe 22 janvier 1953, Saucier, l'\u00e9poux de la demanderesse-appelante, qui \u00e9tait \u00e0 l'emploi de la Commission Scolaire depuis quelques ann\u00e9es, a fait une chute du second \u00e9tage au premier, soit environ dix-sept pieds, et mourut sur les lieux, d'une fracture du cr\u00e2ne. La pr\u00e9tention de la demanderesse est que le d\u00e9fendeur et ses employ\u00e9s avaient perc\u00e9 une ouverture au plafond du rez-de-chauss\u00e9e, entre les deux \u00e9tages, et que c'est \u00e0 travers cet orifice insuffisamment recouvert que Saucier est tomb\u00e9 et a perdu la vie.\nM. le Juge Marquis, de la Cour sup\u00e9rieure, si\u00e9geant \u00e0 Chicoutimi, a maintenu l'action, a condamn\u00e9 le d\u00e9fendeur \u00e0 payer \u00e0 la demanderesse personnellement la somme de $12,804.50, et \u00e0 la demanderesse en sa qualit\u00e9 de tutrice \u00e0 ses enfants mineurs la somme de $4,150, formant un total de $16,954.50. La Cour du banc de la reine a fait droit \u00e0 l'appel de l'intim\u00e9, a cass\u00e9 le jugement attaqu\u00e9, et a d\u00e9bout\u00e9 la demanderesse de son action.\nLa victime \u00e9tait le surveillant \u00e0 la Commission Scolaire, et quelques jours avant cet accident, il fut consid\u00e9r\u00e9 n\u00e9cessaire de faire une ouverture dans le plancher en forme de L, afin de permettre la construction d'un escalier pour relier les deux \u00e9tages. Le 21 janvier, cette ouverture fut pratiqu\u00e9e par l'intim\u00e9 et ses employ\u00e9s en pr\u00e9sence de Saucier qui, le 17 janvier, avait aussi particip\u00e9 \u00e0 la pr\u00e9paration du plan.\nLe jour de l'accident, alors que le plancher du second \u00e9tage \u00e9tait en construction, la victime se rendit au second \u00e9tage pour donner certaines instructions aux \u00e9lectriciens. L'ouverture, autour de laquelle on avait fait un cadre en bois qui exc\u00e9dait le plancher de six pouces, avait \u00e9t\u00e9 recouverte partiellement de planches et de ten-test \u00e0 la suggestion m\u00eame de la victime, afin que l'on puisse conserver la chaleur \u00e0 l'\u00e9tage inf\u00e9rieur o\u00f9 se tenaient les classes.\nAlors que Saucier et l'\u00e9lectricien Desforges discutaient de l'endroit o\u00f9 l'on devait placer un appareil \u00e9lectrique, il fallut enlever le morceau de ten-test qui recouvrait une partie de l'ouverture, afin de permettre, d'avoir une vision exacte de l'int\u00e9rieur du plafond du premier \u00e9tage. Desforges recouvrit alors partiellement l'ouverture avec la pi\u00e8ce de ten-test, mais ne la referma pas compl\u00e8tement afin qu'il y e\u00fbt possibilit\u00e9 pour les deux hommes de communiquer de haut en bas. Il descendit au premier \u00e9tage, et c'est \u00e0 ce moment que Saucier fit sa chute par l'ouverture, et se fracassa le cr\u00e2ne.\nLe t\u00e9moin St-Gelais, qui \u00e9tait sur les lieux, pr\u00e9cise exactement comment est arriv\u00e9 l'accident. Il nous dit qu'au moment de l'accident, il \u00e9tait \u00e0 trois ou quatre pieds de la victime. Saucier a voulu lui montrer par o\u00f9 les fils \u00e9lectriques devaient passer, et le t\u00e9moin affirme que c'est en se penchant, apr\u00e8s avoir recul\u00e9 sur le bord de l'ouverture, qu'il est tomb\u00e9.\nComme la Cour du banc de la reine, je suis d'opinion que ce malheureux accident n'est pas le r\u00e9sultat d'une n\u00e9gligence qui puisse entra\u00eener la responsabilit\u00e9 civile de l'intim\u00e9. La victime connaissait l'existence de cette ouverture et de quelle fa\u00e7on elle \u00e9tait recouverte. Elle savait que c'est par l\u00e0 qu'elle devait communiquer avec Desforges pour d\u00e9terminer l'endroit de l'installation des fils et appareils \u00e9lectriques. C'est \u00e9videment comme cons\u00e9quence d'un faux-pas que Saucier est tomb\u00e9, ou parce qu'il a perdu l'\u00e9quilibre ou n'a pas pris les pr\u00e9cautions voulues en s'approchant de l'ouverture.\nJe ne vois pas sur quels principes l\u00e9gaux il serait possible d'appuyer un jugement qui reconna\u00eetrait la responsabilit\u00e9 de l'intim\u00e9. Comme le dit M. le Juge Pratte de la Cour du banc de la reine, il est normal qu'un chantier en construction pr\u00e9sente certains dangers inh\u00e9rents aux op\u00e9rations qui y sont poursuivies, et celui qui y p\u00e9n\u00e8tre ne peut s'attendre \u00e0 se trouver en parfaite s\u00e9curit\u00e9. Ce serait exiger du con tracteur plus que ne r\u00e9clame la prudence normale en des circonstances identiques, que de pr\u00e9tendre qu'un garde-fou aurait d\u00fb \u00eatre plac\u00e9 autour de cette ouverture. C'e\u00fbt \u00e9t\u00e9 pratiquement rendre impossibles les op\u00e9rations de construction.\nJe suis donc d'opinion que Saucier, qui \u00e9tait familier avec les lieux, a \u00e9t\u00e9 la victime de sa propre imprudence ou inhabilet\u00e9. La loi ne r\u00e9clame pas que l'on porte le standard de prudence \u00e0 un niveau exag\u00e9r\u00e9, et par cons\u00e9quent elle ne demande pas \u00e0 un contracteur de prot\u00e9ger contre les risques inh\u00e9rents \u00e0 un m\u00e9tier ou \u00e0 une occupation celui qui connaissant un danger ne cherche pas \u00e0 s'en pr\u00e9munir.\nL'appel doit \u00eatre rejet\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nAttorney for the plaintiff, appellant: R.

The embodiments of the invention were defined in 3 claims. The defendant pleaded that as the claims omitted the holding connection, the bracelet was an inoperative device, and alternatively, that there had been no infringement. The trial judge found that claims 1 and 2 were invalid for lack of utility and that claim 3 was valid but had not been infringed. The Court of Appeal reversed this judgment as to claims 1 and 2, the plaintiff having abandoned its demand based on claim 3. The defendant appealed to this Court.\nHeld: Claims 1 and 2 of the patent were valid and were infringed by the defendant.\nClaims must be construed with reference to the entire specifications, but the patentee is not allowed to expand his monopoly specifically expressed in the claims by borrowing from other parts of the specifications. However, in the present case, the plaintiff was not seeking to enlarge or expand its monopoly by reference to the specifications, but referred to them to explain the obvious. The monopoly consisted of three elements, and the particular means by which the parts were to be held together was immaterial. The specifications proposed the use of a means, but it was not essential that it should be that particular one.\nAs was held by the Court of Appeal, the device was operative and useful and the claims were, therefore, valid. There was in the invention, sufficient creative or inventive character and sufficient novelty to constitute the subject-matter of the patent, and it was infringed by the defendant.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench, Appeal Side, Province of Quebec1, reversing a judgment of Ralston J. Appeal dismissed.\nG. F. Henderson, Q.C., J. R. Hoffman and D. Watson, for the defendant, appellant.\nChristopher Robinson, Q.C., and S. Godinsky, for the plaintiff, respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nTaschereau J.:\u2014This is an appeal from the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench of the Province of Quebec2, reversing a judgment of the Superior Court rendered by Mr. Justice Ralston.\nIn its statement of claim the plaintiff-respondent alleges that it is the owner of a Canadian patent bearing no. 505,676, dated September 7, 1954, and that as such, had the exclusive rights, privilege and liberty of making, constructing, using, and selling to others to be used in Canada, an invention entitled \"EXTENSIBLE CHAIN BANDS\", and that the appellant-defendant has infringed its patent, by manufacturing and selling to others \"Extensible Chain Bands\" similar to those protected by its patent. The appellant-defendant pleaded that the patent of the respondent is invalid, and in the alternative, alleged that if the patent were valid, which is denied, the extensible chain bands which it manufactured and sold to the public are distinctive in all relevant elements both as to structure and function, from those designated in the limitative provisions of the three claims set forth in respondent's patent, hereafter recited at length, and do not constitute in any way an infringement of the distinctive features of the latter.\nThe learned trial judge dismissed the plaintiff's action with costs, cancelled and annulled the interlocutory injunction previously granted by Associate Chief Justice W.B. Scott. Mr. Justice Ralston held that claims nos. 1 and 2, although not invalid for lack of invention and of novelty, were invalid for lack of utility, that consequently there could be no infringement thereof, and that claim no. 3, although valid, had not been infringed.\nThe Court of Queen's Bench allowed the appeal, declared that as between the parties claims nos. 1 and 2 of the Canadian patent no. 505,676 granted to the respondent were valid, and that they had been infringed by the appellant. The Court of Queen's Bench did not deal with respondent's demands based on claim no. 3, because they had been abandoned. The Court of Queen's Bench further ordered that the interlocutory injunction granted by the Superior Court of Montreal on December 13, 1956, be declared permanent, and that the defendant-appellant cease to manufacture, produce, import, buy or sell extensible chain bands similar to and in violation of plaintiff's patent and in particular, the \"Bandmaster\" or \"Metalliflex\" type of bracelets. The Court also condemned the present appellant to pay to the plaintiff the sum of $551.05 as damages with costs.\nThe present action leading to this appeal, was instituted by the respondent in December 1956, and deals with patent no. 505,676 issued to the respondent on September 7, 1954.\nAfter the issues were joined, the appellant filed a supplementary plea on September 30, 1957, alleging that in August 1957, the Commissioner of Patents issued in favour of the present appellant a patent bearing no. 545,184 which granted to the appellant the exclusive right, privilege and liberty of making, constructing, using and selling to others in Canada, its invention referred to in the patent.\nWhen the present action was instituted, the plaintiff-respondent also sued Watchstraps Inc. for infringement of its patent (no. 505,676) and claimed $27,795 in damages. It was then agreed that the evidence in one case would be evidence in the other. The trial judge dismissed the action against Metalliflex Ltd., but maintained it in part against Watchstraps Inc. There was an appeal to the Court of Queen's Bench in both cases, but the Watchstraps case did not proceed, and judgment was delivered only in the present case. As I have stated, the Court allowed the appeal, ordered that the interlocutory injunction granted by the Superior Court be declared permanent, and that the defendant Metalliflex cease to manufacture, produce, import, buy or sell \"extensible chain bands\" similar to and in violation of Rodi's patent and, in particular, the \"Bandmaster\" or \"Metalliflex\" type of bracelets. This Court is therefore not concerned with the case against Watchstraps Inc.\nTo summarize the course of this litigation: the Court of Queen's Bench reached the conclusion that claims 1 and 2 of respondent's patent were valid, not only as regards invention and novelty, but also as regards utility, and that Rodi's patent had been infringed. As to claim no. 3, it was held valid by the trial judge, who also came to the conclusion that it had not been infringed. In the Court of Queen's Bench, the appellant Rodi (now the respondent) abandoned the demand based on claim no. 3, and restricted its argument to claims 1 and 2, which it contended to be valid, and infringed by the appellant Metalliflex.\nIt might be useful to state the embodiments of the invention in which an exclusive property or privilege was claimed. They are defined as follows:\nClaim No. 1. An extensible self-retracting chain band, comprising hollow links constituted by tubular sleeves arranged transversely to the longitudinal direction of the chain band in two series, pairs of connecting links constituted by U-shaped connecting bows arranged with one limb of each pair of bows in engagement with a hollow link of one series and the other limbs of said pair of bows in engagement with two links of the other series so as to connect the hollow links together in an articulated manner in two rows with the hollow links of one row of the retracted chain band staggered in the longitudinal direction of the chain band with respect to those of the other row, the limbs of said connecting bows having a greater width than their thickness and co-operating with spring means arranged to hold the hollow links in the said relationship while permitting said links to be pulled apart to extend the chain band, said spring means comprising a leaf spring within each hollow link interposed between one wall thereof and the limbs of the connecting bows in engagement with the link so as to force the said limbs against the opposite wall of the link.\nClaim No. 2. An extensible self-retracting chain band, comprising hollow links constituted by tubular sleeves arranged transversely to the longitudinal direction of the chain band in two series, pairs of connecting links constituted by U-shaped connecting bows the limbs of which are flat on the inside, said connecting bows being arranged with one limb of each pair of bows in engagement with a hollow link of one series and the other limbs of said pair of bows in engagement with two links of the other series so as to connect the hollow links together in an articulated manner in two rows with the hollow links of one row of the retracted chain band staggered in the longitudinal direction of the chain band with respect to those of the other row, and spring means arranged to hold the hollow links in the said relationship while permitting said links to be pulled apart to extend the chain band, said spring means comprising a leaf spring within each hollow link interposed between one wall thereof and the inside of the limbs of the connecting bows in engagement with the link so as to force the said limbs against the opposite wall of the link.\nClaim No. 3. An extensible self-retracting chain band, comprising hollow inks constituted by tubular sleeves arranged transversely to the longitudinal direction, of the chain band in two series, pairs of connecting links constituted by U-shaped connecting bows on both sides of the chain band and arranged with one limb of each pair of bows in engagement with a hollow link of one series and the other limbs of each pair of bows in engagement with two links of the other series so as to connect the hollow links together in an articulated manner in two rows with the hollow links of one row of the retracted chain band staggered in the longitudinal direction of the chain band with respect to those of the other row, the limbs of said connecting bows having a greater width than their thickness and having transverse grooves on the inside, and spring means arranged to hold the hollow links in the said relationship while permitting said links to be pulled apart to extend the chain band, said spring means comprising a bent spring plate inserted in each hollow link and extending lengthwise thereof, said spring plate having bent up ends which engage in the transverse grooves in the limbs of the connecting bows on the respective sides of the chain band.\nThe construction of this bracelet is simple. It consists of three parts which are sleeves, U-shaped connecting bows and leaf springs, the arrangement of which provides a relatively cheap and simple bracelet. It can be more easily adjusted in length for different wrists than the other bracelets. It is said on behalf of the appellant that although claims 1 and 2 cover a combination, the elements of which are links, bows and springs, they omit the holding connection, with the consequence that the bracelet is an inoperative device, which must necessarily fall apart, and that the claims should therefore be held invalid as lacking utility. The respondent's contention is that claims 1 and 2 should be construed so that something to hold the parts in their specified relationship be included as part of the normal routine of a person setting out to construct the bracelet. It has been also argued, and the Court of Queen's Bench has adopted this view, that it is not sufficient to consider only the wording of the claims, but also the whole specifications, which have been described as the \"Dictionary\" of the Claims.\nThe claims, of course, must be construed with reference to the entire specifications, and the latter may therefore be considered in order to assist in apprehending and construing a claim, but the patentee may not be allowed to expand his monopoly specifically expressed in the claims \"by borrowing this or that gloss from other parts of the specifications\". Vide: Ingersoll Sergeant Drill Co. v. Consolidated Pneumatic Tool Co.3\nBut here, the respondent does not seek to enlarge or expand its monopoly by reference to the specifications, but refers to them to explain the obvious. The monopoly applied for is the combination of three elements, and the particular means by which the parts are to be held together is immaterial. The appellant does not claim a holding means. This, of course, may be effected in any practical way. In the specifications, a means proposed to be used by the respondent was disclosed, but it is not essential that it should be that particular one. It is beyond question that the parts have to be held together, but the means to attain that purpose and hold together the combination, which is the invention claimed in 1 and 2, is not material.\nThus, in The King v. Uhlemann4, it was held that the claims to a spectacle construction were valid, although it was not specified how these straps \"embracing\" the edges of the lenses would maintain the embrace. Vide also: Canadian Tire v. Samson5. In this latter case, the claims spoke of blades carried by a hub without specifying any means to retain them in position during operation. In both cases the claims were held to be valid. I have, therefore, come to the conclusion, as did Mr. Justice Rinfret of the Court of Queen's Bench with whom Pratte and Owen JJ. concurred, that the device, which is the subject-matter of this case, is operative and useful and that, therefore, the claims are valid.\nI also agree with the Court of Queen's Bench that there is in the invention, sufficient creative or inventive character and sufficient novelty to constitute the subject-matter of the patent, and that it has been infringed by the appellant.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nAttorney for the defendant, appellant: Kaufman, Hoffman & Respitz, Montreal.\nAttorneys for the plaintiff, respondent: Greenblatt, Godinsky & Kingstone, Montreal.\n1 [1960] Que.

The Queen, [1961] S.C.R. 123\nDate: 1960-12-19\nAlan Thomas Marshall (Plaintiff) Appellant;\nand\nHer Majesty The Queen (Defendant) Respondent.\n1960: October 19; 1960: December 19.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.\nEvidence\u2014Motor vehicles accident\u2014Statements made to police\u2014Whether admissible in criminal proceedings\u2014The Highway Traffic Act, R.S.O. 1950, c. 167, s. 110, as amended\u2014Canada Evidence Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 807, s. 36\u2014Criminal Code, 1953-54 (Can.), c. 51, s. 7(1).\nThe appellant was convicted on a charge of causing death by criminal negligence in the operation of a motor vehicle contrary to the Criminal Code. The Court of Appeal having dismissed his appeal, the appellant appealed to this Court on a question of law whether oral statements as to the quantity of beer he had consumed prior to the accident made to the police by him were inadmissible at the trial because of s. 110 of The Highway Traffic Act of Ontario.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nPer Kerwin C.J. and Taschereau and Judson JJ.: By common law a confession was admissible when it was proved to have been voluntarily made in the sense that it was not induced by threats or promises. Here the trial judge was right in holding that the statements made by the appellant were voluntary. If s. 110(5) of The Highway Traffic Act purported to alter the rule, its application in a trial under the Criminal Code was excluded by s. 36 of the Canada Evidence Act because s. 7(1) of the Code retained the old common law. But in view of the amendment contained in s. 20 of c. 17 of the Statutes of 1938, wherein the words \u201ccivil or criminal\u201d were stricken from the section corresponding to the present s. 110(5) of the Act, it was never the intention of the Legislature to so alter the rule.\nPer Locke and Cartwright JJ.: Statements made under compulsion of a statute were not by reason of that fact alone rendered inadmissible in criminal proceedings against the person making them. Walker v. R., [1939] S.C.R. 214; R. v. Scott, (1856), Dears & B. 47; R. v. Coote, (1873), L.R. 4 P.C. 599, referred to. This rule was continued as part of the criminal law of Ontario by virtue of s. 7 of the Criminal Code.\nSection 36 of the Canada Evidence Act could not be interpreted as providing that where a law in the province in which criminal proceedings are taken renders a statement made under specified circumstances inadmissible in civil proceedings it shall be inadmissible in criminal proceedings also. R. v. Gordon, [1946] O.R. 845; R. v. Pedersen, 23 C.R. 198; R. v. Arnew, 30 C.R. 318, disapproved.\nIn addition the words in s. 36, \u201csubject to this and other acts of the Parliament of Canada\u201d prevented the section having the effect that a statement made pursuant to the obligation imposed by s. 110 of The Highway Traffic Act should be inadmissible in criminal proceedings.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, affirming the conviction of the appellant. Appeal dismissed.\nH.S. Honsberger, for the appellant.\nW.C. Bowman, Q.C., for the respondent.\nThe judgment of Kerwin C.J. and of Taschereau and Judson JJ. was delivered by\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE:\u2014By leave of this Court Alan Thomas Marshall appeals upon a question of law against a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario dismissing his appeal from his conviction upon a charge that he caused the death of James Brown by criminal negligence in the operation of a motor vehicle contrary to the Criminal Code. The point of law is whether oral statements as to the quantity of beer he had consumed prior to the accident made to the police by the appellant were inadmissible at his trial upon that charge because of s. 110 of The Highway Traffic Act, R.S.O. 1950, c. 167. The appellant was tried at the Toronto Assizes before Wilson J. and a jury. The evidence for the Crown was that about 5.45 p.m., on August 4, 1959, the appellant was driving a Volkswagen automobile in an easterly direction along the Lakeshore Road, a wide street with two sets of streetcar tracks, at about forty-five miles per hour in a thirty-mile per hour zone and barely avoided colliding with the rear of a streetcar proceeding in the same direction and which streetcar was coming to a stop at a stop light. Later the Volkswagen made a wide sweep in passing a truck, went into a spin and struck another automobile, as a result of which Brown was fatally injured. When Constable Wackett arrived at the scene of the accident about 5.54 p.m., Brown was unconscious. The appellant was conscious but there was a cut on his face and the constable \u201cnoticed there was a smell of an alcoholic beverage on his breath\u201d. The appellant was taken in an ambulance to the Queens-way General Hospital and later to St. Joseph\u2019s Hospital.\nEvidence was then given in the absence of the jury to determine the admissibility of statements alleged to have been made by the accused. In answer to the question to Constable Wackett: \u201cDid you have any conversation, Officer, with the accused man at the scene of the accident?\u201d, the reply was: \u201cJust general questions as to his well-being and in connection with the accident\u201d. No evidence as to that occurrence was given by the appellant. About 6.15 p.m. the same day, the constable saw the appellant at the Queensway General Hospital, told the appellant he had observed that he had been drinking, and asked him: \u201cHow much have you had to drink?\u201d, to which the reply was: \u201cSix pints of beer\u201d. Later in the evening of the same day Wackett saw the appellant at St. Joseph\u2019s Hospital and testified that he said to the appellant that he \u201cwas of the opinion that he had had too much to drink to be driving\u201d, to which the appellant answered: \u201cWell, if that is your opinion, you are entitled to your opinion\u201d. Sergeant Morrisson testified that the appellant told him that he had had some beer to drink at a bar in downtown Toronto, from where he had gone to another downtown bar and had more beer. He had then gone to New Toronto, where he had met Brown in the beverage room of the Almont Hotel where the two of them had beer and were proceeding from that place to the Woodbine race track when the accident occurred. Sergeant Morrisson testified that the appellant had admitted to having four pints of beer and two glasses of draft beer in all. The accused testified on the voir dire that he had not had anything to drink downtown but only at the Almont Hotel where he met Brown and where he, himself, had three pints of beer. All this time the accused was not under arrest and no charge had been laid against him.\nThe trial judge held that the evidence did not show that there was any intention on the part of the appellant to report the accident since, on the voir dire, he had no memory of doing anything except vaguely having some conversation with a police officer. Assuming that s. 110 of The Ontario Highway Traffic Act applied to the appellant, the trial judge held that an investigation by the police to determine whether or not a crime had been committed was not to be hampered by a ruling that there was a privilege extended by the section. He had no doubt that the statement was voluntary. He therefore admitted the statements which were repeated in evidence in the presence of the jury.\nSection 110 of the Ontario Highway Traffic Act, as amended by s. 14 of c. 35 of the Statutes of 1954, reads as follows:\n110. (1) Every person in charge of a motor vehicle who is directly or indirectly involved in an accident shall, if the accident results in personal injuries, or in damage to property apparently exceeding $100, report the accident forthwith to the nearest provincial or municipal police officer, and furnish him with such information or written statement concerning the accident as may be required by the officer or by the Registrar.\n(2) Where such person is physically incapable of making a report and there is another occupant of the motor vehicle, such occupant shall make the report.\n(3) A police officer receiving a report of an accident, as required by this section, shall secure from the person making the report, or by other inquiries where necessary, such particulars of the accident, the persons involved, the extent of the personal injuries or property damage, if any, and such other information as may be necessary to complete a written report concerning the accident to the Registrar.\n(4) The Registrar may require any person involved in an accident, or having knowledge of an accident, the parties thereto, or any personal injuries or property damage resulting therefrom, to furnish, and any police officer to secure, such additional information and make such supplementary reports of the accident as he may deem necessary to complete his records, and to establish, as far as possible, the causes of the accident, the persons responsible, and the extent of the personal injuries and property damage, if any, resulting therefrom. (5) Any written reports or statements made or furnished under this section shall be without prejudice, shall be for the information of the Registrar, and shall not be open to public inspection, and the fact that such reports and statements have been so made or furnished shall be admissible in evidence solely to prove compliance with this section, and no such reports or statements, or any parts thereof or statements contained therein, shall be admissible in evidence for any other purpose in any trial arising out of a motor vehicle accident.\n(6) Any person who fails to report or furnish any information or written statement required by this section shall be liable to a penalty of not less than $10 and not more than $50, and in addition the Minister may suspend the operator\u2019s or chauffeur\u2019s licence and owner\u2019s permit or permits of any such persons.\nSection 7(1) of the Criminal Code, 1953-54 Statutes of Canada, c. 51, enacts:\n7. (1) The criminal law of England that was in force in a province immediately before the coming into force of this Act continues in force in the province except as altered, varied, modified or affected by this Act or any other Act of the Parliament of Canada.\nSection 36 of the Canada Evidence Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 307, provides:\n36. In all proceedings over which the Parliament of Canada has legislative authority, the laws of evidence in force in the province in which such proceedings are taken, including the laws of proof of service of any warrant, summons, subpoena or other document, subject to this and other Acts of the Parliament of Canada, apply to such proceedings.\nThe question whether the provisions of subs. 5 of s. 88 of the Ontario Highway Traffic Act, R.S.O. 1927, c. 251, as enacted by 20 Geo. V, c. 47, s. 6, applied to verbal statements was left open in Walker v. The King[1]. That sub-section, with an important amendment noted below, corresponds to subs. 5 of s. 110 of the present Act but it is unnecessary to express any view on the question in the present appeal. As was pointed out in the Walker case, by common law a confession is admissible when it is proved to have been made voluntarily in the sense that it was not induced by threats or promises. I agree with the trial judge that the statements here in question were made voluntarily. If subs. 5 of s. 110 of the present Act purported to alter this rule, its application in a trial under the Criminal Code is excluded by that part of s. 36 of the Canada Evidence Act which is underlined because s. 7(1) of the Criminal Code retains the old common law; but in view of the amendment referred to above, I am satisfied that the Legislature never so intended. The Walker case was decided in 1939 with reference to an accident which had occurred in July 1937 before the Revised Statutes of Ontario 1937 came into force. Subsection 5 of s. 88 of R.S.O. 1927, c. 251, as enacted by Geo. V., c. 47, s. 6, was carried forward into the Revised Statutes of 1937 as subs. 5 of s. 94, but by s. 20 of c. 17 of the Statutes of 1938 the words \u201ccivil or criminal\u201d in the ninth line of subs. 5 of s. 94 of the 1937 Revised Statutes were striken out.\nThe appeal should be dismissed.\nThe judgment of Locke, Cartwright and Judson JJ. was delivered by\nCARTWRIGHT J.:\u2014The relevant facts, the provisions of the applicable statutes and the question raised on this appeal are set out in the reasons of the Chief Justice.\nThe finding of the learned trial judge that the statements made by the appellant, the admissibility of which is questioned, were voluntary in the sense that they were not induced by threats or promises is supported by the evidence and could not be successfully challenged; and he was right in admitting them unless they were rendered inadmissible by the combined effect of s. 110(5) of The Highway Traffic Act of Ontario and s. 36 of the Canada Evidence Act.\nAs a matter of construction it is my opinion that the words in s. 110(5) \u201cany trial\u201d mean \u201cany trial respecting the proceedings in which the Legislature has jurisdiction\u201d. This follows not only from the history of the subsection and particularly the amendment made by s. 20 of c. 17 of the Statutes of Ontario 1938 set out in the reasons of the Chief Justice but also from the well settled rule of construction that if the words of an enactment so permit they shall be construed in accordance with the presumption which imputes to the legislature the intention of limiting the operation of its enactments to matters within its allotted sphere.\nThe judgment of this Court in Klein v. Bell[2] makes it plain that it would be ultra vires of the Legislature to provide that the reports and statements made under the compulsion of s. 110 of The Highway Traffic Act should be inadmissible in criminal proceedings. At page 315 the Chief Justice said:\nCanada, of course, could only provide with reference to all proceedings over which it had legislative authority and the provincial legislature with reference to proceedings over which it had such authority.\nAt page 319, Rand J. said:\nI entertain no doubt that a province cannot exclude from testimony in a criminal prosecution admissions made in the course of discovery or of trial in a civil proceeding; to do so would be to legislate in relation to procedure in criminal matters which is within the exclusive jurisdiction of Parliament.\nIt has long been settled that statements made under compulsion of a statute are not by reason of that fact alone rendered inadmissible in criminal proceedings against the person making them; it is sufficient on this point to refer to Walker v. The King[3]; Regina v. Scott[4]; and Regina v. Coote[5].\nIt remains to consider the effect of s. 36 of the Canada Evidence Act. No doubt s. 110(5) of The Highway Traffic Act forms part of the laws of evidence in force in the Province of Ontario but, construed as I think it must be, it does not purport to render the statements made under it inadmissible in criminal proceedings. It cannot assist the appellant unless s. 36 of the Canada Evidence Act can be interpreted as providing that where a law in the province in which criminal proceedings are taken renders a statement made under specified circumstances inadmissible in civil proceedings it shall be inadmissible in criminal proceedings also. Parliament has power to so enact, but it does not appear to me that the words of s. 36 are susceptible of the suggested interpretation, and I am forced to conclude that even on the assumption that the statement made by the appellant would have been rendered inadmissible in a civil trial arising out of the motor vehicle accident out of which the criminal charge against the appellant arose (a question which I find unnecessary to decide) they were not rendered inadmissible on the trial of that charge. I realize that the view which I have expressed restricts the operation of s. 36 within narrow limits in so far as criminal proceedings are concerned, but the contrary view would involve the possibility of the law as to the admissibility in evidence in criminal proceedings of statements made by an accused person varying from province to province and from year to year in accordance with provincial enactments dealing with the rules of evidence in civil cases. It would, in my opinion, require plainer words than have been used to enable us to construe s. 36 as having such an effect.\nI have reached the above conclusion with hesitation as it appears to be at variance with the view implicit in the reasons of Lebel J. in Rex v. Gordon[6], those of Gale J. in Regina v. Pedersen[7], and those of the Court of Appeal in Regina v. Arnew[8].\nIf, however, contrary to the opinion I have expressed, the words of s. 36 would otherwise have been apt to provide that a statement made pursuant to the obligation imposed by s. 110 should be inadmissible in criminal proceedings arising out of the same motor vehicle accident, I would agree with Mr. Bowman\u2019s submission that the words in s. 36, \u201csubject to this and other acts of the Parliament of Canada\u201d prevent the section having that effect.\nThe predecessor of what is now s. 110 of The Highway Traffic Act was first enacted in 1930. At that time the rule embodied in many decisions, that a statement made under compulsion of a statute is not by reason of such compulsion rendered inadmissible in criminal proceedings against the person making it, was by virtue of an Act of the Parliament of Canada, i.e., s. 10 of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1927, c. 36, part of the criminal law of the Province of Ontario, and that state of affairs is preserved by s. 7 of the Criminal Code, 2-3 Elizabeth II, c. 51. It follows that the protection accorded by s. 110(5) to a person making a statement pursuant to s. 110, is effective in civil but not in criminal proceedings arising out of the accident in regard to which the statement was made. That such a conclusion has anomalous results cannot be denied. If a person in charge of a motor vehicle is involved in an accident causing personal injuries under such circumstances that he may well be guilty of criminal negligence and is confronted immediately thereafter by a police officer he is entitled, under the maxim nemo tenetur seipsum accusare, to remain silent and indeed it is desirable that the officer before questioning him should give him the usual warning that he is not obliged to say anything (other than to give his name and address, as required by s.221(2) of the Criminal Code); on the other hand it is his duty under s. 110, to furnish the officer with such information concerning the accident as the officer may require, and the information which he gives in fulfilment of this duty can be used against him if he is tried for criminal negligence. If it is thought undesirable that such anomalies should exist, they can be removed only by legislative action.\nThe opinion which I have formed as to the combined effect of s. 110(5) of The Highway Traffic Act and s. 36 of the Canada Evidence Act renders it unnecessary for me to examine the arguments addressed to us on the question whether the statements with which we are concerned would, in the particular circumstances of this case, have been admissible at the trial of a civil action; I wish to reserve my opinion on the questions, (i) whether under s. 110 it is the duty of a person to inform the police officer, if such information is required by the latter, as to the amount of intoxicating liquor he had consumed prior to the accident, and (ii) whether the view of the majority of the Court of Appeal or that of Mackay J.A. in Smith Transport et al. v. Vanderyagt[9] is to be preferred.\nI agree that the appeal should be dismissed.\nAppeal dismissed.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Raymond & Honsberger, Toronto.\nSolicitor for the respondent: F.L.

The employer procured an individual insurance policy covering the employee against public liability for a period of one year from March 22, 1954. All that the employee did was to sign an application for the policy. Within a few days after the termination of his employment in May 1954, the appellant received an insurance identification card from the insurer. Shortly afterwards the policy was cancelled at the instance of Hearst, although there was no express term in the agreement of employment that the employer should have the right to cancel the policy before its expiration. The cancellation was made without the appellant\u2019s knowledge, and he learned of it only in November 1954 when he made enquiries of the insurer. Upon being so informed he made no protest. He was involved in an accident in February 1955, and then claimed indemnification after judgment went against him. The trial judge held in his favour, but this decision was reversed by a majority in the Court of Appeal. The appellant appealed to this Court.\nHeld (Cartwright J. dissenting): The appeal should be dismissed.\nPer Kerwin C.J. and Abbott, Martland and Judson JJ.: The inference of fact drawn by the Court of Appeal that the employer, as a necessary incident of the right and authority to place the insurance as a term of the contract of employment, had the right to cancel it when the employment came to an end was correct. In any event the inference is one that can only be interfered with if this Court is satisfied that it is clearly erroneous. Pelletier v. Shykofsky, [1957] S.C.R. 635, referred to.\nPer Cartwright J., dissenting: The Court may supply a term which the parties have failed to express in a contract only if satisfied that it is doing merely what the parties would clearly have done themselves had they thought about the matter. Here it was far from clear what the parties would have done under the circumstances. Reigate v. Union Manufacturing Co. (Ramsbottom), [1918] 1 K.B. 592, applied. APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1], reversing a judgment of Wells J. Appeal dismissed, Cartwright J. dissenting.\nR.N. Meakes, for the plaintiff, appellant.\nT.N. Phelan, Q.C., for the defendant, respondent.\nThe judgment of Kerwin C.J. and of Abbott, Martland and Judson JJ. was delivered by\nJUDSON J.:\u2014The appellant, Lloyd LaFontaine, sued the respondent insurance company for indemnification against two judgments given against him as a result of a motor car accident. He succeeded at the trial but failed on appeal and he now seeks to have the judgment at trial restored.\nFrom March 22, 1954, to May 25, 1954, the appellant was employed by Hearst Corporation of New York as a sales agent in its Magazine Division in Toronto. It was a term of his employment that he should use his own car. Since he had no insurance, the Hearst Corporation immediately applied for public liability insurance for him through its own brokers in New York. To comply with s. 194(1) of the Ontario Insurance Act, R.S.O. 1950, c. 183, it was necessary to have a signed application from the employee. At the request of the employer, the employee signed the application and an individual policy was eventually issued covering the employee against public liability from March 22, 1954, the date when the employment began, until March 22, 1955, while driving either for business or pleasure. The Hearst Corporation chose the insurance company through its own broker; it decided that there should be insurance as a condition of employment; it decided the extent of the coverage and the monetary limits; it paid the premium and took delivery of the policy. All that the employee did was to sign an application for the policy. The appellant\u2019s employment ended on May 25, 1954. On July 15, 1954, the Hearst Corporation surrendered the policy for cancellation and return of the unearned premium. The insurance company acted on this application on July 23, 1954.\nBecause there had been delays in correspondence between Toronto and New York the policy was not actually issued until May 21, 1954, but the employee had been covered from March 22, 1954. This explains why the insurance company, within a few days after May 25, when the appellant\u2019s employment had already ended, sent to him an identification card, for use in case of an accident, which gave some particulars of the policy which had been issued. This might have led the appellant to conclude at the time that notwithstanding the termination of his employment, his automobile policy was still in force and would remain in force. It was in fact in force at the time of the receipt of the identification card but was cancelled shortly afterwards without his knowledge. He learned of the cancellation only in November 1954 when he made enquiries at the Toronto office of the insurance company and was told that the insurance had been cancelled in June and the unearned premium paid to the Hearst Corporation. He made no protest either to Hearst Corporation or the insurance company against what had been done. He was involved in an accident in February 1955 and then claimed indemnification after judgment went against him. He succeeded at the trial on his claim for indemnity because the learned trial judge held that the Hearst Corporation, while it had authority to take out the policy, had none to surrender it.\nThe Court of Appeal, Schroeder J.A. dissenting, held that the Hearst Corporation, as employer, in all the circumstances of this case, had authority to do both. The finding of the Court of Appeal was that the clearly understood purpose of this insurance was to cover the appellant while he was an employee and not for the period of one year stated in the policy; that the appellant knew that the employer had no interest in covering him after the termination of the employment, and that his failure to protest after his discovery of the cancellation was significant, not, it is true, in creating an estoppel, but as a tacit acknowledgment that he knew that the company had the right to surrender the policy.\nWhat the Court of Appeal has found was that the scope of the agency was the insurance of the appellant against public liability during the term of the employment and not after its termination. There was express authority to place this insurance in the form of the signed application. The fact that the policy was for a term of one year did not entitle the appellant to this protection if his employment ceased within the year. The employer, therefore, as a necessary incident of the right and authority to place this insurance I as a term of the contract of employment, had the right to cancel it when the employment came to an end. This, of course, is an inference of fact drawn by the Court of Appeal I and differing from that of the learned trial judge. It is, in my respectful opinion, the correct inference from the undisputed facts but in any event it is one that can only be interfered with if this Court is satisfied that it is clearly erroneous. (Pelletier v. Shykofsky[2])\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nCARTWRIGHT J. (dissenting):\u2014The facts out of which this appeal arises are not in dispute. They are stated in the reasons of my brother Judson. I shall endeavour to refrain from repetition but wish to emphasize certain matters.\nBy the policy which was admittedly issued by the respondent to the appellant the former agreed to indemnify the latter, and every other person who with the appellant\u2019s consent should personally drive the automobile belonging to the appellant and described in the policy, against the liability imposed by law upon the appellant or upon any such person for loss or damage arising from the ownership or operation of the automobile. The purposes for which the automobile was to be chiefly used were stated in the policy to be \u201cbusiness and pleasure\u201d.\nIt will be observed that the policy afforded protection to the appellant with which his employer the Hearst Corporation, hereinafter referred to as \u201cHearst\u201d, was not concerned. Hearst would be exposed to the risk of vicarious liability for injuries inflicted or damage done by the negligent operation of the automobile only if the appellant were at the time of such operation using the automobile on the business of Hearst.\nThere was no express term in the agreement of employment between the appellant and Hearst that the latter should have the right to cancel the policy before its expiration. The difference of opinion, between the majority in the Court of Appeal on the one hand and the learned trial judge and Schroeder J.A. on the other, is as to whether or not the Court should imply such a term. On this question I agree with the conclusion reached by Schroeder J.A. and by the learned trial judge and also with their reasons, which make it unnecessary to refer at length to the authorities with which they deal so fully.\nThe test to be applied in determining whether or not the Court should imply a term which the parties have not expressed has been stated by several judges in varying language but without difference in substance.\nIn Reigate v. Union Manufacturing Co. (Ramsbottom)[3], Scrutton L.J. said:\nA term can only be implied if it is necessary in the business sense to give efficacy to the contract; that is, if it is such a term that it can confidently be said that if at the time the contract was being negotiated some one had said to the parties, \u2018What will happen in such a case,\u2019 they would both have replied, \u2018Of course, so and so will happen; we did not trouble to say that; it is too clear.\u2019 Unless the Court comes to some such conclusion as that, it ought not to imply a term which the parties themselves have not expressed.\nApplying the test suggested in this passage to the circumstances of the case at bar, it appears to me that if some one had said to the appellant and the officer of Hearst while they were negotiating the contract of employment, \u201cWhat will happen in regard to the insurance policy if the employment terminates during its currency?\u201d there is no answer which it can be said would have been given by both of them as a matter of course. There are, I think, a number of answers any one of which might have been made by reasonable business men. I suggest the following examples and doubtless others could be given.\n(i) Hearst may surrender the policy for cancellation at any time after the employment terminates, without giving any notice to the appellant and may accept and retain the portion of the premium that is refunded. (This is the term implied by the judgment of the majority in the Court of Appeal.)\n(ii) If Hearst terminates the employment for any reason other than the misconduct of the employee, the policy will be handed over to the appellant without obligation on his part. (iii) Hearst will give the appellant the option of taking delivery of the policy and paying to Hearst the proportionate part of the premium for the unexpired term, or of having it cancelled and allowing Hearst to retain the portion of the premium refunded.\n(iv) Hearst may surrender the policy for cancellation at any time after the employment terminates upon giving the appellant two weeks notice of its intention so to do, in order that he may have an opportunity of obtaining other insurance if he so desires.\nI find myself quite unable to say that if the suggested question had been raised both parties would have said \u201cOf course the agreement will be that set out in example (i)\u201d. Personally, I think it more likely that some discussion would have been necessary and that the parties would have agreed on the term set out in example (iii) which would adequately protect the rights of both Hearst and the appellant and appears to me to be the most reasonable of those I have suggested.\nThe Court may supply a term which the parties have failed to express in a contract only if satisfied that it is doing merely what the parties would clearly have done themselves had they thought about the matter. In the circumstances of this case I think it far from clear what the parties would have done.\nI would allow the appeal, set aside the judgment of the Court of Appeal and restore the judgment of the learned trial judge with costs throughout.\nAppeal dismissed with costs, CARTWRIGHT J. dissenting.\nSolicitors for the plaintiff, appellant: Palamar & Hebert, Toronto.\nSolicitors for the defendant, respondent: Phelan, O\u2019Brien, Phelan & Rutherford, Toronto.\n[1] [1960] O.W.N. 25, 21 D.L.R.

In each case the magistrate dismissed the charge, and an appeal by way of a stated case was dismissed by a majority in the Court of Appeal. The appellant appealed to this Court.\nHeld: The appeals should be dismissed.\nPer Curiam: The only object in deleting the words \"besides trading stamps commonly so called\" from the definition of trading stamps section in the 1953 revision of the Code (s. 322(b)) was to make the present definition exhaustive. The word \"include\" had an exhaustive definition in the present case.\nThere was no general accepted definition of \"trading stamps\". Here the stamp was not token currency, nor was it used in the obtaining of goods; it was not usable instead of money in procuring articles from the issuer of the stamps. The stamp could be redeemed only from the respondent from whom the article had been purchased and at the premises where it was sold; and the stamp showed upon its face the place where it was delivered and where it was redeemable upon demand, and in fact where it was so redeemed. Per Fauteux J.: The word \"includes\" in s. 322(b) of the Code was, in the context, exclusively related to the words \"any form\"; it was not referable to what the documents or other devices must be as to substance in order to come within the prohibition. While all-embracing or all-inclusive as to the forms which may possibly be adopted for such documents or devices, the definition was exhaustive as to the particular features required as constituent elements of the prohibited trading stamps. The precise specifications as to substance, contained in (b) (i), (ii) and (iii) of the section as well as in the saving clause did not justify the inference that Parliament intended, from the use of the word \"includes\", to extend the definition in order to cover any other documents or devices as to which it said nothing with respect to features attending issuance, nature of benefit and redemption.\nAPPEALS from judgments of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba1, affirming orders of acquittal of a Police Magistrate.\nJ. A. Scollin, for the appellant in both appeals.\nEdward A. Pitblado, Q.C., and David Procter, for the respondent, Loblaw Groceterias Co. (Manitoba) Ltd.\nJ. J. Robinette, Q.C., H. Solway, Q.C., and J. F. R. Taylor, for the respondent, David Thomson (Niagara I.G.A. Grocery).\nThe judgment of Kerwin C.J. and of Locke, Abbott and Martland JJ. was delivered by\nThe Chief Justice:\u2014These two appeals were argued together. I deal first with that in connection with Loblaw Groceterias Co. (Man.) Limited, which is an appeal against a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba2 on an appeal to it by way of stated case against an order or judgment of acquittal of a Police Magistrate. By answering the three questions submitted to it in the affirmative the Court of Appeal held that on the facts found by the Magistrate, as to which there is no dispute, he had correctly dismissed the charge against that respondent company that it did on November 17, 1959, at Winnipeg, unlawfully, being a merchant or dealer in goods, by its employee or agent, directly, or indirectly, give trading stamps to William Hrycyk, a person who purchased goods from it. The charge was laid under subs. 2 of s. 369 of the Criminal Code, 1953\u201354, c. 51:\n(2) Every one who, being a merchant or dealer in goods, by himself or his employee or agent, directly or indirectly gives or in any way disposes of, or offers to give or in any way dispose of, trading stamps to a person who purchases goods from him is guilty of an offence punishable on summary conviction.\nSection 369 appears in Part VIII and the first section in that Part reads as follows:\n322. In this Part,\n(a) \"goods\" means anything that is the subject of trade or commerce; and\n(b) \"trading stamps\" includes any form of cash receipt, receipt, coupon, premium ticket or other device, designed or intended to be given to the purchaser of goods by the vendor thereof or on his behalf, and to represent a discount on the price of the goods or a premium to the purchaser thereof\n(i) that may be redeemed\n(A) by any person other than the vendor, the person from whom the vendor purchased the goods, or the manufacturer of the goods,\n(B) by the vendor, the person from whom the vendor purchased the goods, or the manufacturer of the goods in cash or in goods that are not his property in whole or in part, or\n(C) by the vendor elsewhere than in the premises where the goods are purchased; or\n(ii) that does not show upon its face the place where it is delivered and the merchantable value thereof; or\n(iii) that may not be redeemed upon demand at any time,\nbut an offer, endorsed by the manufacturer upon a wrapper or container in which goods are sold, of a premium or reward for the return of that wrapper or container to the manufacturer is not a trading stamp.\nThe respondent is a merchant or dealer in goods doing business at 1445 Main St. North, Winnipeg. On November 17, 1959, a member of the Winnipeg City police force, William Hrycyk, purchased from the respondent at that address, one tin of sardines for which he paid ten cents; at the time of the purchase Hrycyk was given by an employee of the respondent, one \"Lucky Green stamp\" and a book, called a stamp saver book, in which could be pasted that stamp and any others secured by the purchaser from time to time. On the face of the stamp appear the words:\nRedeemable at any time\nMerchantable Value 2 Mills\n1445-Main St. N.\nWinnipeg\nB.C. Premium Company and the stamp saver book states that the stamps are redeemable at any time and only at the store from which original purchases were made, and, further that the gifts illustrated in the premium catalogue are the property of the retailer. There were filed before the Magistrate as one exhibit a premium catalogue and supplements thereto and it was agreed that the lucky green stamp scheme was as detailed in that exhibit. Hrycyk presented the stamp and book to the manager of the respondent's store at the above address for redemption and he was handed by the manager two cake cups.\nThe answer given by the majority of the Court of Appeal to each of the following questions submitted by the Magistrate was: \"Yes\".\n1. Was I right in law in holding that the word \"includes\" in Section 322(b) of the Criminal Code is to be construed as \"means and includes\"?\n2. Was I right in law in holding that the stamp given to the said William Hrycyk by the said Loblaw Groceterias Co. Manitoba Limited is not a trading stamp within the meaning of the term \"Trading stamps\" in Section 322(b) of the Criminal Code?\n3. Was I right in law in holding that the stamp given to the said William Hrycyk by the said Loblaw Groceterias Co. Manitoba Limited is not a trading stamp within the meaning of the term \"trading stamps\" in Section 369(2) of the Criminal Code?\nTritschler J.A. and Miller J.A. would have answered \"No\" to the questions.\nThe problem to be decided is whether the lucky green stamp is a \"trading stamp\" within the meaning of the Code and more particularly whether the definition of \"trading stamps\" in s. 322(b) is exhaustive. The history of the Criminal Code dealing with trading stamps shows that the first legislation by Parliament was enacted by c. 9 of the Statutes of 1905, amending the 1892 Code by the introduction of ss. 526(a) and 526(b). Until the amendments made to the Code, when it was revised in 1953 (Statutes of Canada 1953\u201354, c. 51), the definition section read in part:\n\"trading stamps\" includes, besides trading stamps commonly so called, any form of cash receipt, receipt, coupon, premium ticket or other device, designed or intended to be given to the purchaser of the goods by the vendor\u2026 The definition section 322 inserted in the revision of 1953 deleted the underlined words. I can conceive of no object in deleting these words except to make the present definition of trading stamps exhaustive. Counsel for the appellant relies upon the statement of Lord Watson delivering the judgment of the Judicial Committee in Dilworth v. New Zealand Commissioner of Stamps3. He was there referring to ss. 2 and 3 of the Charitable Gifts Duties Exemption Act, 1883, as to which he said:\nSect. 2 is, beyond all question, an interpretation clause, and must have been intended by the Legislature to be taken into account in construing the expression \"charitable devise or bequest\", as it occurs in s. 3. It is not said in terms that \"charitable bequest\" shall mean one or other of the things which are enumerated, but that it shall \"include\" them. The word \"include\" is very generally used in interpretation clauses in order to enlarge the meaning of words or phrases occurring in the body of the statute; and when it is so used these words or phrases must be construed as comprehending, not only such things as they signify according to their natural import, but also those things which the interpretation clause declares that they shall include.\nHowever, Lord Watson continues:\nBut the word \"include\" is susceptible of another construction, which may become imperative, if the context of the Act is sufficient to show that it was not merely employed for the purpose of adding to the natural significance of the words or expressions defined. It may be equivalent to \"mean and include\", and in that case it may afford an exhaustive explanation of the meaning which, for the purposes of the Act, must invariably be attached to these words or expressions.\nIf authority were needed, the last part of Lord Watson's statement shows that \"include\" may be an exhaustive definition and for the reasons above stated that is the case in the present appeal.\nFurthermore, a reference to the dictionaries mentioned by counsel for the respondent and for the appellant shows that there is no general accepted definition of \"trading stamps\". Certainly the stamp here in question is not token currency; it is not used in the obtaining of goods; it is not usable instead of money in procuring articles from the issuer of the stamps, B.C. Premium Company. The stamp delivered to Hrycyk could be redeemed only from the respondent from whom the tin of sardines had been purchased and at the premises where it was sold; and the stamp shows upon its face the place where it was delivered and where it was redeemable upon demand, and, in fact, where it was so redeemed.\nIn the Thomson case, the purchaser, Hrycyk, purchased a tin of sardines from David Thomson, trading under the name and style of Niagara IGA Grocery, and upon demand received one safety pin. Hrycyk had received a stamp and a stamp saver book similar to the articles described in considering the Loblaw appeal and the same or similar circumstances existed.\nThe appeals should be dismissed.\nFauteux J.:\u2014Respondents were charged under sub-section (2) of s. 369 Cr. C., 1953\u20131954, c. 51:\n(2) Every one who, being a merchant or dealer in goods, by himself or his employee or agent, directly or indirectly gives or in any way disposes of, or offers to give or in any way dispose of, trading stamps to a person who purchases goods from him is guilty of an offence punishable on summary conviction.\nThe expression \"trading stamps\" is defined as follows in s. 322(b):\n322 (b) \"trading stamps\" includes any form of cash receipt, receipt, coupon, premium ticket or other device, designed or intended to be given to the purchaser of goods by the vendor thereof or on his behalf, and to represent a discount on the price of the goods or a premium to the purchaser thereof\n(i) that may be redeemed\n(A) by any person other than the vendor, the person from whom the vendor purchased the goods, or the manufacturer of the goods,\n(B) by the vendor, the person from whom the vendor purchased the goods, or the manufacturer of the goods in cash or in goods that are not his property in whole or in part, or\n(C) by the vendor elsewhere than in the premises where the goods are purchased; or\n(ii) that does not show upon its face the place where it is delivered and the merchantable value thereof; or\n(iii) that may not be redeemed upon demand at any time,\nbut an offer, endorsed by the manufacturer upon a wrapper or container in which goods are sold, of a premium or reward for the return of that wrapper or container to the manufacturer is not a trading stamp.\nIn essence, the question is whether this definition of trading stamps is exhaustive, or whether, as contended for by both appellants, it contemplates a class of trading stamps other than the one as to which specifications are given. The word \"includes\", appearing in the first line of the definition is, in the context, exclusively related to the words \"any form\"; it is not referable to what the documents mentioned or other devices must be as to substance in order to come within the prohibition. While all-embracing or all-inclusive as to the forms which may possibly be adopted for such documents or devices, the definition is exhaustive as to the particular features required as constituent elements of the prohibited trading stamps. The precise specifications as to substance, contained in (b)(i),.(ii) and (iii) of the section as well as in the saving clause appearing at the very end of it, do not justify the inference that Parliament intended, from the use of the word \"includes\", to extend the definition in order to cover any other documents or devices as to which it said nothing with respect to features attending issuance, nature of benefit and redemption.\nFor the reasons given by the Chief Justice and the reasons above, I would dismiss the appeals.\nAppeals dismissed.\nSolicitor for the appellant in both appeals: The Attorney-General of Manitoba, Winnipeg.\nSolicitors for the respondent, Loblaw Groceterias Co.

The respondent was found guilty of murder. He appealed and, by a unanimous decision, the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court quashed the conviction of murder, and substituted therefor one of manslaughter.\nIt was not disputed that the victim was killed by the respondent. According to the latter's evidence, the deceased while sitting in his car with the respondent, made an indecent proposal to the respondent who was drunk. The respondent seized the deceased by the neck and choked him. When the respondent came to his senses he found the victim limp and he attempted unsuccessfully to revive him. Thinking that the man was dead, he drove the car a short distance and then dragged the body to a ditch. He placed the man's belt around his neck, took his wallet and the car and left the place.\nThe pathologist who performed the autopsy concluded that death was caused by strangulation due to the tightening of the belt.\nHeld (Locke, Fauteux, Martland and Judson JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be dismissed.\nPer Kerwin C.J. and Taschereau and Abbott JJ.: There was no jurisdiction in this Court to hear the appeal. The Chief Justice of Alberta, speaking on behalf of the Appellate Division, considered that the evidence was not sufficient to support a conviction, which was a question of fact. This first reason was not obiter dictum merely because he also gave another reason. Gravestock v. Parkin, [1944] S.C.R. 150; Jacobs v. London County Council, [1950] A.C. 361, referred to.\nPer Taschereau, Cartwright and Abbott JJ.: The Appellate Division quashed the conviction on the ground inter alia that it could not be supported by the evidence. This was a distinct ground on which its judgment was based, and was a ground raising no question of law in the strict sense. It was nihil ad rem that the judgment was based also on other grounds raising such points of law.\nPer Ritchie J.: In finding that a reasonable doubt existed as to whether or not the respondent believed his victim to be already dead at the time when he in fact caused his death, the Appellate Division made a finding of fact which excluded the application of s. 201 of the Code from the circumstances of this case, and which was not subject to review in this Court.\nIf the Appellate Division erred in finding that such a doubt existed, then this was an error of fact from which other errors necessarily flowed, including that s. 202 was the only one under which the jury could have found the accused guilty of murder. The error, if error it was, raised a mixed question of fact and law, and as such was not a competent ground of appeal to this Court. R. v. D\u00e9cary, [1942] S.C.R. 80, referred to.\nAs the Appellate Division quashed the conviction on the ground inter alia that it could not be supported by the evidence, no question of law in the strict sense was raised by this appeal.\nPer Locke J., dissenting: The language of the Chief Justice of the Appellate Division did not indicate that the decision of that Court rested upon the insufficiency of the evidence. If, however, it should be so construed, what was said as to the insufficiency of the evidence referred only to a charge of murder under s. 202 of the Code and not to such a charge under s. 201. This was misdirection. It was further made manifest that one of the grounds for this conclusion was the opinion that, as it could not be said with assurance that the accused did not believe the victim to have been dead when he tightened the belt around his neck, there could be no conviction for murder under s. 202. These were errors in law, which this Court was vested with jurisdiction to correct. Thabo Meli v. R., [1954] 1 W.L.R. 228; Bradley v. The Queen, [1956] S.C.R. 723, referred to.\nPer Fauteux, Martland and Judson JJ., dissenting: Although the Chief Justice of the Appellate Division was strongly of the opinion that the verdict of murder could not be supported by the evidence, he was not satisfied that this opinion had that degree of finality required to assert it as a distinct ground for the decision of the appeal.\nIf, however, it could be said that the decision of the Appellate Division was that the verdict could not be supported on the evidence, it appeared that this conclusion rested on the proposition stated when the Chief Justice, after dealing with s. 202, said: \"this is the only section under which the jury could have found the accused guilty of murder.\" This was tantamount to saying that there was no evidence on which the jury could have convicted under s. 201, which was a question of law.\nWhere it appears that a decision of a court of appeal that a verdict cannot be supported by the evidence has been founded on a wrong conclusion of law, this Court is not without jurisdiction to hear an appeal from it. It was an error in law to say that there was no evidence upon which the jury could have found the accused guilty of murder under s. 201, which was the conclusion, in a relation to that section, which was ultimately reached by the Chief Justice of the Appellate Division.\nThe jury having rejected the defence of drunkenness, the suggestion of the Appellate Division that the trial judge should have put to the jury \"a suggestion\" that the accused put the belt around the victim's neck to assist in dragging him from the car to the ditch, was untenable. In directing a jury, the trial judge has not the duty to speculate and instruct them as to all the views which one might possibly take of the evidence.\nAs to the errors found in the Court below, and as to the grievances alleged for respondent in the notices of appeal to that Court, there was nothing of real substance.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Supreme Court of Alberta, Appellate Division1, quashing a conviction of murder and substituting one of manslaughter. Appeal dismissed, Locke, Fauteux, Martland and Judson JJ. dissenting.\nW. Shortreed, Q.C., for the appellant.\nBruce D. Patterson, for the respondent.\nThe judgment of Kerwin C.J. and of Taschereau and Abbott JJ. was delivered by The Chief Justice:\u2014In my opinion there is no jurisdiction in the Court to hear this appeal. The first two sentences of the reasons for judgment of the Chief Justice of Alberta, speaking on behalf of the Appellate Division, are as follows:\nI am strongly of opinion that the verdict of murder cannot be supported by the evidence. But I feel I must go further, and set out other reasons for setting aside the conviction.\nI read the first sentence as meaning that the Chief Justice considered that the evidence was not sufficient to support a conviction,\u2014which is a question of fact. As to the second sentence and the remainder of the reasons, the decisions, referred to on the argument, of Gravestock v. Parkin2 and Jacobs v. London County Council3 show authoritatively that the first reason given by the Chief Justice of Alberta was not obiter dictum merely because he also gave another reason.\nWhile it was announced that we had jurisdiction, further consideration has persuaded the majority of the Court that such is not the case.\nThe appeal should be dismissed.\nThe judgment of Taschereau, Cartwright and Abbott JJ. was delivered by\nCartwright J.:\u2014This is an appeal from a unanimous judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta4 pronounced on March 31, 1960, allowing an appeal from the conviction of the appellant on January 22, 1960, before Greschuk J. and a jury on the charge that at Edmonton on or about August 23, 1959, he did murder Stanley Valpeters. The Appellate Division quashed the conviction of murder, substituted a conviction of manslaughter and subsequently sentenced the appellant to ten years imprisonment.\nThe appeal is brought pursuant to an order made by this Court on May 12, 1960, granting the appellant leave to appeal on the following questions:\n(a) Did the Appellate Division err in law in holding that there was nondirection amounting to misdirection, if not misdirection, in respect to the offence of murder under section 202 of the Criminal Code, and that the grounds on which the jury could find the accused guilty of murder while committing robbery were not placed before the jury as facts to be found by them;\n(b) Did the Appellate Division err in law in finding that the trial judge should have put to the jury \"a suggestion\" that the accused put the belt around Valpeters' neck to assist in dragging him from the car to the ditch, in the absence of evidence to support any such suggestion;\n(c) Did the Appellate Division err in law in holding that the judge's charge was inadequate in failing to explain the theory advanced by the Crown that strangulation was used to facilitate the commission of robbery, and, hence, whether it was intended to cause death or not the act constituted murder;\n(d) Did the Appellate Division err in law in holding that only under section 202 of the Criminal Code could the jury have found the accused guilty of murder.\nThe order granting leave was made by a court consisting of five members, two of whom, dissenting, would have dismissed the application.\nIt is not disputed that Valpeters was killed by the appellant. There were no eye-witnesses of the killing other than the appellant himself who made a voluntary statement to the police after his arrest on the charge of murder and also gave evidence at the trial. The effect of the evidence is sufficiently summarized in the following passage in the reasons of Ford C.J.A. who delivered the reasons of the Appellate Division:\nThe facts of what happened when the deceased, Valpeters, met his death must be ascertained from the story told by the accused himself with the reasonable inferences to be drawn therefrom, the location and condition of the body when found, and the opinion evidence of the two doctors called by the Crown.\nThe story of the accused is that he is a drink addict and had been drinking throughout part of the afternoon of Saturday, August 22nd, 1959 and all of the evening, during which time he visited at least two hotels, the Hotel Regis, and the King Edward. He said that he met a constable on the street and asked to be taken into custody for being drunk as he wanted to go to Belmont for treatment because of his drink habits. Being unsuccessful in this, he went to police headquarters and suggested that there was a charge of false pretences that could or should be laid against him on which he could be taken into custody. In this, too, he was unsuccessful. There is no doubt that he tried to have this done as it is confirmed by the evidence of the police constables.\nAfter this he roamed the streets of Edmonton until about two o'clock Sunday morning. During this period he was put out two or three times from the Rose cafe. This is also confirmed by independent evidence. About the hour just mentioned, when still in search of liquor, he met a stranger somewhere near the same restaurant. This stranger, who has turned out to be Valpeters, invited him to go in his car out of the City of Edmonton into the country to consume a bottle of whiskey. Valpeters drove out past the oil refineries until the car was brought to a stop somewhere in the entrance to a farmhouse in the country. Valpeters invited the accused into the back seat in order to drink the whiskey. After both got into this seat he invited the accused to perform an act of gross indecency, whereupon a struggle began in which some blows, apparently ineffective, were struck, and Valpeters got the accused down and the accused seized Valpeters by the neck and choked him. The accused said that when he came to his senses Valpeters was all limp and that he attempted to revive him. The accused said that he had had some training with the St. Johns Ambulance. The attempt to revive was unsuccessful and, after feeling his heart and pulses, he thought the man was dead.\nHe said that he was in fear because of what he had done and backed the car out of the entrance way to the farmhouse and drove it a short distance along the road to a ditch where he got out and pulled the body from the back seat and dragged it by the armpits to the ditch. He said that he tried again to revive the man but could not do so. He said also what is the most serious evidence against himself that he put the man's belt around his neck when he was in the ditch and took his wallet and the car and left the place. That is where the body was found the following Monday afternoon.\nThe accused, on taking the car, drove to where he was living in Edmonton and took with him the woman with whom he was living and their son, that same morning, and drove back to the home of her parents in Ontario where he was later arrested.\nI do not find it necessary to consider the several errors of law alleged by the appellant to have been made by the Appellate Division as I think it is clear that the Appellate Division allowed the appeal on two main grounds:\n(1) that, in the opinion of the Appellate Division, the verdict of guilty of murder should be set aside on the ground that it could not be supported by the evidence, and\n(2) that there had been errors in law in the charge of the learned trial judge.\nSo far as the judgment of the Appellate Division is based on the first ground mentioned, this Court is powerless to interfere with it. The question whether the Appellate Division was right in proceeding on this ground is not a question of law in the strict sense. It is a question of fact or, at the best from the point of view of the appellant, a mixed question of fact and law.\nThe reasons of the learned Chief Justice of Alberta open with the following paragraph:\nI am strongly of opinion that the verdict of murder cannot be supported by the evidence. But I feel I must go further, and set out other reasons for setting aside the conviction. Later in his reasons, the learned Chief Justice says:\nNo one can say with assurance that the accused did not believe Valpeters was dead on his becoming unconscious during the course of the struggle and after the efforts to revive him had failed.\nThis is a finding of fact made by the Appellate Division as a result of its examination of the evidence. It is irrelevant to inquire whether we would make the same finding if we had the power, which the Appellate Division has but which we have not, to proceed upon grounds of fact.\nThe jurisdiction of the Appellate Division to allow the appeal is found in s. 592(1) (a) of the Criminal Code which reads:\n592(1) On the hearing of an appeal against a conviction, the court of appeal\n(a) may allow the appeal where it is of the opinion that\n(i) the verdict should be set aside on the ground that it is unreasonable or cannot be supported by the evidence,\n(ii) the judgment of the trial court should be set aside on the ground of a wrong decision on a question of law, or\n(iii) on any ground there was a miscarriage of justice;\nOn reading the reasons as a whole, I am satisfied that the Appellate Division was exercising its jurisdiction under s. 592(1) (a) (i) and was setting the verdict aside on the ground that, in its opinion, it could not be supported by the evidence.\nIt was suggested during the argument that what the Appellate Division really did was to rule that there was no evidence on which the jury could have convicted the respondent of murder and that the question whether there is any evidence, as distinguished from the question whether there is enough evidence, is a question of law.\nI cannot agree with this suggestion for several reasons. First, it appears that there was, as indeed both counsel concede, some evidence on which it would have been open to a properly instructed jury to find a verdict of murder and I am not prepared to assume that the Appellate Division overlooked or misunderstood this evidence. Secondly, if the Appellate Division had intended to hold that there was no evidence they would have said so; it is significant that they followed the very words of s. 592(1) (a) (i). This clause gives jurisdiction to the Court of Appeal to proceed on grounds of fact, while clause (ii) which follows immediately gives it jurisdiction to proceed on the ground that there has been a wrong decision on a question of law. Thirdly, while a large number of grounds of appeal were put forward in the notice of appeal to the Appellate Division these did not include the ground that there was no evidence to support the conviction, while the following grounds were all appropriate to found the submission that the verdict should be set aside under s. 592(1) (a) (i) as being one that could not be supported by the evidence:\n(1) That the said conviction is against the law, evidence and weight of the evidence.\n* * *\n(3) That the jury failed to give proper, fair, reasonable and adequate consideration to the evidence and came to a hasty conclusion.\n(4) That the verdict of the jury was perverse and contrary to the evidence at the trial.\n* * *\n(19) The verdict of the jury was perverse and contrary to the evidence in that it generally failed to give the appellant the benefit of reasonable doubt and more particularly with respect to the following:\n(a) That the medical evidence indicated that a person rendered unconscious by pressure on the carotid nerve would become dead in a matter of minutes if certain steps such as lowering of the head between the knees and relieving of the pressure did not take place and there being no evidence that the deceased was so relieved prior to the placing of the belt.\n(b) That the medical evidence indicated death by strangulation and the evidence of the appellant indicated the deceased was limp and appeared to be dead in the car, which evidence was consistent with appellant's theory and defence as to cause and time of death or at least raised reasonable doubt that death occurred from the placing of the belt on the deceased's neck in the ditch and not by reason of the appellant's actions as stated in the car.\nHowever, I may have dealt with this suggestion at undue length for the grounds on which leave to appeal to this Court was granted do not include a ground that the Appellate Division erred in holding that there was no evidence on which the jury could have convicted the respondent of murder.\nIf I am right in my view that the judgment of the Appellate Division is based on distinct grounds, with one of which we cannot interfere because it raises no question of law in the strict sense, it is of no consequence that the other grounds on which they proceeded did raise such questions of law. If authority be needed for this proposition it is to be found in the cases referred to by the Chief Justice during the argument of the appeal, Gravestock v. Parkin5 and Jacobs v. London County Council6: in the last mentioned case Lord Simonds, with whom the other Law Lords agreed, said at page 369:\nBut, however this may be, there is in my opinion no justification for regarding as obiter dictum a reason given by a judge for his decision, because he has given another reason also. If it were a proper test to ask whether the decision would have been the same apart from the proposition alleged to be obiter, then a case which ex facie decided two things would decide nothing.\nAt the risk of appearing repetitious, I venture to suggest that if the learned Chief Justice of Alberta, as he might have done, had simply said:\nI am strongly of opinion that the verdict of murder cannot be supported by the evidence \u2026 I would allow the appeal and quash the conviction of murder \u2026 we order that the conviction for murder be quashed, and a conviction of manslaughter be substituted.\nno one would have suggested that this Court had power to review the judgment of the Appellate Division. I am unable to see how we acquire such power because the learned Chief Justice felt that he \"must go further, and set out other reasons for setting aside the conviction\"; his use of the word \"other\" makes it plain that he had already given one reason. The meaning of the word \"other\" as here used is that given first in the Concise Oxford Dictionary \"not the same as one or more or some already mentioned or implied, separate in identity, distinct in kind, alternative or further or additional\". Once a distinct reason has been given its character is not altered by the giving of additional reasons.\nI conclude that the Appellate Division quashed the conviction on the ground inter alia that it cannot be supported by the evidence, that this was a distinct ground on which its judgment was based, that it is a ground raising no question of law in the strict sense and that it is nihil ad rem that the judgment was based also on other grounds raising such points of law.\nI would dismiss the appeal.\nLocke J. (dissenting):\u2014The passage from the judgment of the learned Chief Justice of Alberta which is relied upon to support the argument that this Court is without jurisdiction to entertain this appeal must be read together with other passages of the reasons which discuss the grounds upon which that portion of the opinion is based. After saying:\nI am strongly of opinion that the verdict of murder cannot be supported by the evidence. But I feel I must go further, and set out other reasons for setting aside the conviction.\nthe learned Chief Justice said in part:\nI would hold that there was non-direction amounting to misdirection, if not misdirection, in respect of the offence of murder under Section 202 of the Code. This is the only section under which the jury could have found the accused guilty of murder.\nand again, after referring to the fact that the belt of the deceased was drawn tightly about his neck, this admittedly having been done by the respondent, and that the medical evidence was to the effect that the man had died of strangulation, it was said:\nNo one can say with assurance that the accused did not believe Valpeters was dead on his becoming unconscious during the course of the struggle and after the efforts to revive him had failed.\nWith great respect, I am of the opinion that upon the evidence the accused might properly have been found guilty of murder under s. 201 of the Criminal Code and I consider the learned trial judge properly charged the jury upon that section.\nI am further of the opinion that the fact that the accused may have believed that Valpeters was dead when he put the belt around his neck and drew it tight does not affect the question as to whether the offence was murder under either sections 201 or 202.\nUpon the respondent's own statement, in the struggle with Valpeters in the car he struck him several times with his fists and attempted to throttle him and, after moving the car to another location, dragged the man to the ditch and there placed and tightened the belt around his neck. These were all facts which formed part of the offence of either murder or manslaughter and were properly all considered together. The argument that the various unlawful acts causing the death of a person may be split up and the intention of the accused considered in respect of each of them separately was made and rejected by the Judicial Committee in Thabo Meli v. R7. In that case the accused persons had planned to kill the victim and had beaten him so severely that they thought he was dead. They then threw his body over a cliff for the purpose of indicating that the man had accidentally fallen over and been killed. It was shown at the trial that the injured man died not from the beating to which he had been subjected but from the exposure when lying out at the foot of the cliff. The contention that as the accused persons thought the man was dead when they threw him over the cliff and did this accordingly without the intent of killing him was rejected, for reasons which are applicable in the present case. I would add that a similar contention was advanced in this Court and rejected in Bradley v. The Queen8.\nI agree with my brother Fauteux, whose reasons I have had the advantage of reading, that the language of the learned Chief Justice above quoted does not indicate that the decision was rested upon the insufficiency of the evidence. If, however, it should be so construed, it is my opinion that there is jurisdiction in this Court to hear the appeal. Clearly, what is said as to the insufficiency of the evidence refers only to a charge of murder under s. 202 and not to such a charge under s. 201 and this, with respect, was misdirection. It is further made manifest that one of the grounds for this conclusion was the opinion that, as it could not be said with assurance that the accused did not believe Valpeters to have been dead when he tightened the belt around his neck, there could be no conviction for murder under s. 202. These were errors in law, in my opinion, which this Court is vested with jurisdiction to correct.\nI would allow the appeal and restore the judgment at the trial.\nThe judgment of Fauteux, Martland and Judson JJ. was delivered by\nFauteux J. (dissenting):\u2014In the early afternoon of August 24, 1959, two hunters discovered a body, in a ditch beside a municipal road, outside the city limits of Edmonton, in the Province of Alberta. The body, later identified as that of one Stanley Valpeters, was partly hidden by growing grass and was lying face down with a belt around the neck.\nThe pathologist who subsequently performed the autopsy observed, amongst other marks of violence, that there were, all around the neck, a straplike constriction and a furrow to which blades of grass were stuck. When the belt was exhibited to him and when told of its finding around the neck of the body, he expressed the opinion that the furrow could have resulted from a tension sustained for some time on the free end of the belt. He estimated it would take a minimum of about five minutes for constriction to stop the breath so as to cause death. His findings indicated to him that Valpeters was alive prior to the exertion of the pressure that caused the furrow. He concluded that death was caused by strangulation.\nInvestigation by the police led to the arrest of respondent a few days later, in the city of Toronto. Warner was then found in possession of Valpeters' wallet and automobile, the wallet containing identification papers of the latter and the license plates, issued for his automobile, having been substituted.\nRespondent made an admittedly voluntary statement to the police. In the first part thereof, he relates at length and with details various occasions during which, the week before the date of the fatal occurrence and on the very day itself, he consumed alcoholic liquors. Then follows a narration of events contemporaneous and immediately subsequent to the killing of Valpeters, including his hurried departure from Edmonton, with all the members of his family, in the automobile of the latter. Respondent says that, in the early hours of the 23rd of August, 1959, the day before the discovery of the body, he and the deceased, who were strangers to one another, met casually on a street within the city limits of Edmonton. He accepted an invitation of Valpeters to drive to a suitable place to consume a bottle of liquor which the latter said he had in his automobile. They eventually stopped on a gravel road \"or a kind of track or cattle-path in some bushes\", where, on respondent's story, the following events took place:\nHe (Valpeters) says \"Let's get in the back seat because the whiskey is there\". Both of us got in the back seat with him behind the driver's seat and I was on his right. Instead of producing a bottle of whiskey he put his hand over and started to undo my pants. The next thing I knew I got mad and proceeded to struggle with him. I started to choke him. I don't remember too much how long I was choking him or what but when I came to my sense again he was all limp.\nI tried to feel a heart beat but couldn't and I got scared. This was in the back seat with my door open and I tried artificial respiration with him laying on the back seat. Nothing happened so I closed the back door and climbed into the driver's seat. I backed the car out of there on to the road and I drove a short distance from there. It wasn't very far. I got out and pulled him out of the car into the ditch.\nI don't know whether I was still mad or crazy but I took his belt from his pants and wrapped it around his neck. I left him there.\nI took his wallet from him but I don't know just what pocket it was in. I put it in my own pocket. Then I drove out of there and went home. It was just breaking daylight when I got home. I went into the house and got my wife out of bed and told her we were leaving right away as we were going to Drayton Valley and to pack everything that she could get in the car and we would send for the rest of the stuff later.\nRespondent was then charged with the murder of Valpeters. At trial, he testified in his own defence repeating, with some additions, what he had already stated to the police. Thus, he suggested that while wrestling in the car, he was overpowered by his victim and then started to choke him. He said he had some knowledge of first aid and that, to practise artificial respiration, he thought it better, being in fear that attention of people in the neighbourhood might have been attracted by the scuffle, to drive some distance away. Having done so, he dragged Valpeters by the arm-pits in the ditch where, he said, he attempted to revive him and then he put the belt around his neck\u2014an act for which, he testified, he was unable to account.\nOn this direct and other incriminating evidence of a circumstantial nature, the jury, having been directed particularly on the various issues raised in defence, to wit, drunkenness, provocation and self-defence, found the accused guilty of murder.\nRespondent appealed and, by a unanimous decision, the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court quashed the verdict of murder, substituting thereto one of manslaughter.\nThe reasons for judgment were delivered by Ford C.J.A., and concurred in by the other members of the Court. In the opening paragraph of his reasons for judgment, the learned Chief Justice said:\nI am strongly of opinion that the verdict of murder cannot be supported by the evidence. But I feel I must go further, and set out other reasons for setting aside the conviction. He then proceeded to review the evidence, relating it to the offence of murder under s. 202 Cr.C., i.e., murder associated with robbery, and, having found fault with the address of the trial Judge in that respect, he disposed of the appeal in the manner just indicated.\nThe Crown then applied to this Court for leave to appeal. On this application, counsel for respondent, relying on the first sentence of the opening paragraph of the reasons for judgment, contended that this Court had no jurisdiction in the matter.\nSubject to the right of respondent to raise the question of jurisdiction at the hearing of the appeal on the merit, leave to appeal was granted on questions of law here mentioned in the order in which they will hereafter be considered:\n(i) Did the Appellate Division err in law in holding that only under section 202 of the Criminal Code could the jury have found the accused guilty of murder.\n(ii) Did the Appellate Division err in law in finding that the trial judge should have put to the jury \"a suggestion\" that the accused put the belt around Valpeters' neck to assist in dragging him from the car to the ditch, in the absence of evidence to support any such suggestion;\n(iii) Did the Appellate Division err in law in holding that there was nondirection amounting to misdirection, if not misdirection, in respect to the offence of murder under section 202 of the Criminal Code, and that the grounds on which the jury could find the accused guilty of murder while committing robbery were not placed before the jury as facts to be found by them;\n(iv) Did the Appellate Division err in law in holding that the judge's charge was inadequate in failing to explain the theory advanced by the Crown that strangulation was used to facilitate the commission of robbery, and, hence, whether it was intended to cause death or not the act constituted murder;\nDealing with the objection to the jurisdiction of this Court.\nIt may well be impossible to affirm our jurisdiction in a case where a Court of Appeal states, clearly and without more, that a verdict is set aside on the ground that it cannot be supported by the evidence. This is not the situation in the present case. Here, the Chief Justice said:\nI am strongly of the opinion that the verdict of murder cannot be supported by the evidence.\nThis sentence, he immediately and substantially qualified in adding:\nBut I feel I must go further, and set out other reasons for setting aside the conviction. Read together, these two sentences indicate, I think, that while entertaining, even to a strong degree, the opinion expressed, the Chief Justice was not ready to rest a decision upon it, but felt compelled to \"go further\" and give, not the other reasons, but \"other reasons\", meaning reasons other than the opinion expressed, to justify the setting aside of the verdict of murder. In other words, strong as was this opinion, the Chief Justice was not satisfied that it had that degree of finality required to assert it as a distinct ground for the decision of the appeal which he ultimately rested on grounds stated as follows at the end of his reasons for judgment:\nI would hold that there was non direction amounting to misdirection, if not misdirection, in respect of the offence of murder under s. 202 of the Code. This is the only section under which the jury could have found the accused guilty of murder.\nOn this interpretation, the decisions in Gravestock v. Parkin9 and Jacobs v. London County Council10 have no application in this case.\nIf, however, it can be said that the decision of the Appellate Division was that the verdict of murder could not be supported on the evidence, we must, in that event, read the remainder of the reasons for judgment as being explanatory of the decision which had been reached. When that is done, it appears to me to be clear that the conclusion rested upon the proposition stated when the learned Chief Justice, after dealing with s. 202, said: \"This is the only section under which the jury could have found the accused guilty of murder.\" This is tantamount to saying that there was no evidence on which the jury could have convicted under s. 201, and that is a question of law.\nHas this Court jurisdiction to hear an appeal under such circumstances? In my opinion it has. The situation is somewhat analogous to that which arose in Lizotte v. The King11. In that case the Court of King's Bench had affirmed a conviction of murder, one of the grounds being that there was no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice, notwithstanding certain errors of law at the trial. The Court12 had declared \"que la preuve justifie amplement le verdict\". Before this Court it was contended, on behalf of the Crown, that, as this was a decision of fact, or mixed law and fact, it was not subject to review in this Court. That argument was rejected in the following terms at p. 134:\nI do not think that this argument is entitled to prevail. In the case at bar it might perhaps be disposed of by pointing out that in my opinion there were serious errors in matters of law at the trial which the Court of Appeal did not regard as being errors at all; but even had the Court of Appeal found the existence of all the errors in law which in my view did occur and nonetheless dismissed the appeal pursuant to section 1014(2), I do not think that this court would be without jurisdiction.\nSimilarly, in my view, where it appears that a decision of a court of appeal, that a verdict cannot be supported by the evidence, has been founded on a wrong conclusion on a question of law, this Court is not without jurisdiction to entertain an appeal from it. That this occurred in the present case is shown in the consideration of the first ground of appeal.\nDealing with the merits of the appeal. The question whether the Appellate Division erred in law in holding that only under section 202 could the jury have found the accused guilty of murder, must be answered affirmatively. As presented to the jury, the case was not and could not have been legally confined to the issue of murder under section 202, i.e., murder associated with robbery, but included the issue of murder under section 201. On the latter issue, it was open to the jury to accept the opinion of the pathologist that the straplike constriction and the furrow around the neck resulted from a tension sustained for about five minutes on the free end of the belt and that prior to the exertion of the tension, Valpeters was alive. From these facts and subject to the consideration of the various defences raised,\u2014which were rejected,\u2014the jury could validly infer an intention to kill and reach a verdict of guilty of murder under section 201.\nIn his reasons for judgment, the Chief Justice said:\nNo one can say with assurance that the accused did not believe Valpeters was dead on his becoming unconscious during the course of the struggle and after the efforts to revive him had failed.\nIt has been suggested that this constitutes a finding of fact which excludes the application of s. 201 of the Criminal Code, because, it is contended, if the respondent believed Valpeters to be dead he could not thereafter have conceived the intent to cause his death. It is then contended that, being a finding of fact, this Court has no jurisdiction to disturb it.\nIt should be noted, however, that the learned Chief Justice did not himself, in his reasons for judgment, relate the statement above quoted to the conclusion which he ultimately reached that the respondent could not have been convicted under s. 201. It occurs in the course of his consideration of the adequacy of the charge to the jury by the learned trial Judge in respect of the application of s. 202 of the Criminal Code, for, after discussing what was said in the charge in relation to that matter, he said:\nTaken by itself, this is not objectionable. But the real question for the jury was whether or not what the accused did was done in the course of a robbery and, basic to this, is the question of whether or not this was a robbery; and that, in turn, depends upon the intent in the mind of the accused up to the time that he thought the man was dead. No one can say with assurance that the accused did not believe Valpeters was dead on his becoming unconscious during the course of the struggle and after the efforts to revive him had failed.\nThe question of the belief of the respondent as to the condition of Valpeters after the struggle is thus related by the learned Chief Justice solely to the question as to whether, prior to Valpeters becoming unconscious during the course of the struggle, the respondent had formulated the intent to rob him.\nIn any event, even if it could be said that the respondent did believe Valpeters to be dead, it does not follow that, because of this belief, he could not conceive the idea and form the intent to make definitely certain that any possible spark of life be conclusively destroyed. It was clearly open to the jury to infer that such an intent accompanied the commission of the very acts of violence by which the respondent did actually kill his victim; and this is murder under s. 201.\nIt was, therefore, an error in law to say that there was no evidence upon which the jury could have found the accused guilty of murder under the latter section, which is the conclusion, in a relation to that section, which was ultimately reached by the learned Chief Justice.\nWith respect to the second question, there is nothing in the evidence suggesting that the accused put the belt around Valpeters' neck to assist in dragging him from the car to the ditch. On the contrary, in both his statements to the police and in his testimony, the accused said that the placing of the belt took place once the victim was in the ditch. The presence of blades of grass stuck to the furrow found around the neck is significant. Moreover, on his own story given at the trial, the accused specified that he dragged his victim by the armpits in the ditch, in order to revive him by practising artificial respiration. The jury having rejected his defence of drunkenness, the suggestion of the Appellate Division is, with all deference, untenable. In directing a jury, the trial judge has not the duty to speculate and instruct them as to all the views which one might possibly take of the evidence.\nAs to the errors found in the Court below and referred to in the third and fourth grounds of the appeal for the Crown, and as to the numerous grievances alleged for respondent in the original and supplemental notices of appeal to the Court below, I must say that, after having considered the address of the trial Judge and the evidence, I can find nothing of real substance. The jury were directed with exceptional care and clarity on all the issues upon which it was the duty of the trial Judge to do so, and more particularly on the defence of drunkenness, provocation and self-defence raised by the accused and ultimately rejected by the jury. While failure of counsel for an accused to object to the address of the trial Judge at the stage of trial is not fatal, it may be added that though invited to submit objections, none were offered by counsel.\nI would allow the appeal, set aside the judgment of the Appellate Division, and restore the verdict of the jury.\nRitchie J.:\u2014The circumstances giving rise to this appeal are outlined in the reasons for judgment of Mr. Justice Cartwright and Mr. Justice Fauteux which I have had the benefit of reading.\nIn my view the opening words of the decision rendered by Ford C.J. on behalf of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta are the controlling factor in the determination of the difficult question as to whether or not a question of law in the strict sense is raised by this appeal. The learned Chief Justice said:\nI am strongly of opinion that the verdict of murder cannot be supported by the evidence. But I feel I must go further, and set out other reasons for setting aside the conviction. In the course of his decision, the learned Chief Justice also held that s. 202 of the Criminal Code \"is the only-section under which the jury could have found the accused guilty of murder\" and it was contended on behalf of the appellant that this finding constituted an error in law and formed the basis of the opinion of the Appellate Division that the verdict of murder could not be supported by the evidence. It, therefore, becomes necessary to examine the grounds upon which the Appellate Division based its conclusion with respect to s. 202 of the Code.\nDominant amongst the reasons set out by the learned Chief Justice for allowing this appeal is the finding that \"no one can say with assurance that the accused did not believe Valpeters was dead on his becoming unconscious during the course of the struggle and after the efforts to revive him had failed\".\nIn my view this finding must be interpreted as meaning that on the evidence before them, all the members of the Appellate Division concluded that there was a reasonable doubt as to whether or not the respondent believed his victim to be dead before the belt was placed around his neck. The medical evidence was that the deceased came to his death by being strangled with his belt and must, therefore, have been alive when the belt was first applied, and it is implicit in the decision of the Appellate Division that this evidence was accepted.\nIf the respondent had believed his living victim to be dead after his efforts to revive him had failed, it follows that he could not thereafter have conceived the intent to cause his death which is a necessary ingredient of the offence of murder as described in s. 201 of the Criminal Code for no man can intend to kill a person whom he thinks to be already dead. It, therefore, seems to me that in finding that a reasonable doubt existed as to whether or not the respondent believed his victim to be already dead at the time when he in fact caused his death, the Appellate Division made a finding of fact which excluded the application of s. 201 from the circumstances of this case and which is not subject to review in this Court.\nIf the Appellate Division erred in finding that such a doubt existed, then this was an error of fact from which other errors necessarily flowed, including the finding that s. 202 was the only one under which the jury could have found the accused guilty of murder. The latter conclusion follows directly from the former, and, accordingly, in my view the error, if error it was, raises a mixed question of fact and law, and as such is not a competent ground of appeal to this Court (see The King v. D\u00e9cary13).\nI agree with Mr. Justice Cartwright that, as the Appellate Division quashed the conviction on the ground, inter alia, that it could not be supported by the evidence, no question of law in the strict sense is raised by this appeal.\nI would dismiss this appeal.\nAppeal dismissed, Locke, Fauteux, Martland and Judson JJ. dissenting.\nSolicitor for the appellant: The Attorney General of Alberta, Edmonton.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Patterson, Patterson & Shelton, Edmonton.\n1 127 C.C.C. 394.\n2 [1944] S.C.R. 150, 2 D.L.R. 337.\n3 [1950] A.C. 361, 1 All E.R. 737.\n4 127 C.C.C. 394.\n5 [1944] S.C.R. 150, 2 D.L.R. 337.\n6 [1950] A.C. 361, 1 All E.R. 737.\n7 [1954] 1 W.L.R. 228, 1 All E.R. 373.\n8 [1956] S.C.R. 723 at 742, 6 D.L.R.

Rotter (Plaintiff) Respondent.\n1960: May 6; 1960: November 21.\nPresent: Locke, Cartwright, Abbott, Martland and Judson JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR BRITISH COLUMBIA\nWaters and watercourses\u2014Conveyance of land with registered plan indicating one boundary at top of river bank\u2014Whether title extends to centre line of stream\u2014Application of ad medium filum aquae rule\u2014Land Registry Act, R.S.B.C. 1948, c. 171\u2014Land Act, R.S.B.C. 1948, c. 175.\nR took conveyance to a certain sub-lot of land, except that portion thereof which had previously been conveyed to him, and which in turn was transferred by him to the Crown as the result of expropriation proceedings. This latter portion, of which the appellant company later became the registered owner, by transfer from the Crown, lay on the opposite side of a river from R's property.\nThe description of the appellant's land was that which appears coloured red on the registered plan, the western limit of which was a line drawn along the top of the river bank. The certificate of title which issued to R described the lands held as being sub-lot 36 save and except those parts of the lot shown outlined in red on the plan.\nThe appellant having entered into the stream bed of the river opposite its lands and having carried out certain works, R commenced an action. The appellant counterclaimed for damages and for a declaration that it was the lawful owner of the bed of the river ad medium filum aquae.\nThe finding of the trial judge that the appellant was the owner of the bed ad medium filum was reversed by the Court of Appeal. By special leave of the Court of Appeal the appellant appealed to this Court. Held (Martland J. dissenting): The appeal should be allowed.\nPer Locke, Cartwright, Abbott and Judson JJ.: The rights acquired by the Crown, all of which were transferred to the appellant, were the same in their nature as if the western boundary of the property had been defined as being the river. The matter is not affected by the fact that the land conveyed is shown in the description by measurement and colour on the plan. Micklethwait v. Newlay Bridge Co., (1886), 33 Ch. D. 133; Berridge v. Ward, (1861), 10 C.B.N.S. 400, referred to.\nWhether the basis upon which the title of such an owner ad medium filum rests is of common right, as stated by Sir Mathew Hale in his Treatise De Jure Maris and by Lord Blackburn in Bristow v. Cormican (1878), 3 App. Cas. 641, or whether it passes as a matter of construction of the grant, as it was treated by the Judicial Committee in Lord v. City of Sydney (1859), 12 Moo P.C. 473 and in Maclaren v. Attorney General of Quebec, [1914] A.C. 258, the principle is too deeply embedded in the law to be disturbed or doubted. City of London v. Central London Railway, [1913] A.C. 364, referred to.\nThe proper construction of the grant by the respondent to the Crown cannot be affected by the terms of ss. 53, 125, 141(1) and 156 of the Land Registry Act, R.S.B.C. 1948, c. 171. The failure of the Crown to ask that the grant be construed as conveying title ad medium filum cannot deprive the appellant of the right to insist as against the grantor that it should be so construed.\nEsquimalt Waterworks Co. v. City of Victoria (1906), 12 B.C.R. 302; Chasemore v. Richards (1859), 7 H.L. Cas. 349; Gibbs v. Messer, [1891] A.C. 248; The Queen v. Robertson (1882), 6 S.C.R. 52, referred to. The King v. Fares et al., [1932] S.C.R. 78, explained and distinguished.\nPer Martland J., dissenting: The rebuttable rule of construction at common law as to conveyances of land bounded by a non-tidal river, that the land extends to the middle of the stream, is not applicable to a certificate of indefeasible title under the Land Registry Act. The appellant's certificate does not establish title in the appellant to any lands beyond those which are actually described in it.\nThe contention that if the form of the appellant's certificate of title is not in a form satisfactory to include the whole of his interest he is in a position in equity to apply for rectification of the title fails.\nThe King v. Fares, supra; Gibbs v. Messer, supra; Micklethwait v. Newlay Bridge Co., supra, referred to.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1], allowing in part a judgment of Brown J. Appeal allowed, Martland J. dissenting.\nEvans E. Wesson, for the defendant, appellant.\nJ. F. Meagher, for the plaintiff, respondent.\nThe judgment of Locke, Cartwright, Abbott and Judson JJ. was delivered by LOCKE J.:\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[2] brought by special leave of that Court. That judgment allowed in part an appeal of the present respondent from the judgment of Brown J. by increasing the damages awarded and declaring that the present appellant is not the lawful owner of that part of the bed of the Salmo River adjoining its property ad medium filum aquae.\nWhile oral evidence was given at the trial, the case filed in this Court contains only an agreed statement of the facts, the material parts of which are as follows:\nThe appellant is the holder of a certificate of indefeasible title to a parcel of land in the Nelson Assessment District, therein described as being those parts of sub-lot 36 of lot 1,236, Kootenay District, Plan X 69, shown outlined in red on Reference Plan 61457-I.\nThe plan referred to was prepared under the circumstances to be hereinafter described and shows the property in question coloured in red lying immediately to the east of the Salmo River, the westerly boundary of which is indicated by stakes placed in the ground at the top of the river bank and lettered A, B, C, D, E, F, G and H.\nThe question to be determined in the action is as to the respective rights of the parties to the ground lying between the line thus delineated and the centre line of the stream at the relevant times.\nIn 1897 the Nelson and Fort Shepard Railway Company obtained a grant of land in the Kootenay District which included a parcel described in the Crown grant to it as lot 1,236. There was no reservation in this grant of the beds of any rivers or streams. In 1938 a portion of these lands described as sub-lot 36 of lot 1,236 was owned by the Erie Timber Co. Ltd. and, through this lot, there runs a river or stream known as the Salmo River. In that year the respondent purchased sub-lot 36 from the Erie Timber Company under an agreement of sale and entered into possession.\nIn the latter part of 1942 or early in 1943 Wartime Metals Ltd., a Crown corporation, commenced operation of a tungsten mine situated in the mountains to the east of sub-lot 36 and, requiring lands for a mill site and for a disposal area for tailings or waste from the mill, took expropriation proceedings to acquire a portion of sub-lot 36. During these proceedings the respondent caused a survey to be made of the property to be expropriated by Boyd C. Affleck, a British Columbia land surveyor. The agreed statement of the facts dealing with this aspect of the matter reads:\nThe land to be taken by the Crown was to be that portion of the Sub-lot lying to the East of the River and South of Lot 275. In carrying out the survey on the river boundary the surveyor ran a series of traverses from point to point along the river bank, marking the points with stakes placed in the ground. These points, and the stakes, are represented on the plan of his survey as \"A\", \"B\", \"C\", etc. The boundary line along the river was the top of the riverbank\u2014the line of perennial vegetation.\nThe plan so prepared was registered with the above mentioned reference number, with the first conveyance and application to register, in accordance with the requirements of the Land Registry Act, R.S.B.C. 1948, c. 171.\nRotter had not completed his payments to the Erie Timber Company at the time these lands were required by the Crown. The matter was arranged by that company conveying the lands described in the plan to Rotter and he, in turn, transferred such lands to His Majesty The King.\nThe conveyance from the Erie Timber Company dated March 29, 1945, described the lands transferred as being \"those parts of sub-lot thirty-six (36) of lot 1,236, Kootenay District, shown outlined in red on the attached plan\".\nThe conveyance from Rotter to His Majesty The King dated May 28, 1945, described the lands conveyed as being those parts of sub-lot 36 described in the deed last mentioned and shown outlined in red on the reference plan attached. The plan referred to in both of these conveyances was Reference Plan 61457-I.\nWhile the documents are not mentioned in the agreed statement of the facts or made exhibits at the trial, it may be assumed that certificates of indefeasible title were issued to Rotter and to the Crown respectively for the lands mentioned pursuant to these conveyances, as required by s. 142(1) of the Land Registry Act.\nBy a conveyance dated December 11, 1945, the Erie Timber Company conveyed to Rotter sub-lot 36, save and except that portion theretofore conveyed to him as above mentioned. By a conveyance dated April 11, 1947, His Majesty The King conveyed to the appellant the lands conveyed to him by Rotter by the above mentioned conveyance and the certificate of title first above mentioned dated October 21, 1947, issued in the appellant's name.\nIn November 1954 the appellant, purporting to be acting under the authority of a conditional licence granted by the Provincial Water Rights Branch for that purpose under the provisions of the Water Act, R.S.B.C. 1948, c. 361, entered into the stream bed of the river opposite its lands and carried out certain works, removing approximately 30,000 cubic yards of sand and gravel which it used to build an impoundment area for the tailings from its mill. These works extended in places to the west of the surveyed line upon the plan and into the westerly half of the bed of the river. In January 1955 the respondent commenced the present action for damages, for trespass, for the value of the materials removed from the bed of the river and for an injunction. The appellant, in turn, counterclaimed for the cost of certain repairs and reinforcements which it claimed to have been necessary to the east bank of the river by reason of a certain wing dam erected by the respondent at a point up stream on lot 275 about the year 1948, and for a declaration that it was the lawful owner in fee simple of the bed of the river ad medium filum aquae at the place in question.\nBrown J., by whom the action was tried, found that the appellant was the owner of the bed of the stream ad medium filum and that it was entitled to remove the material from the eastern half of the bed of the stream but, as the evidence disclosed that material had also been removed from the western half, held that the appellant was liable in damages in a sum of $100 as the value of the material so removed. Upon the counterclaim it was found that the appellant had suffered damages by the variation of the course of the stream caused by the wing dam and damages were awarded in the sum of $3,075.17.\nOn appeal to the Court of Appeal this judgment was set aside in part, the judgment declaring that the present appellant was not the lawful owner of that part of the bed of the stream ad medium filum which is adjacent to the portion of sub-lot 36 owned by it, and increasing the damages awarded to the sum of $300. The appeal taken by the present respondent from the damages awarded on the counterclaim was dismissed.\nThe judgment of the court delivered by Coady J.A. proceeded upon a view of the questions involved which had not been raised at the trial or considered by Brown J. As will be seen from the foregoing recital, the description of the appellant's land was that which appears coloured red on the registered plan, the western limit of which was the line drawn between the stakes placed in the ground at the top of the river bank. The certificate of title which issued to Rotter, following the conveyance to him of the balance of sub-lot 36 by the Erie Timber Company, described the lands held as being sub-lot 36 save and except those parts of the lot shown outlined in red on the plan. Coady J.A. was of the opinion that, by reason of the fact that as he considered this latter certificate evidenced title to the bed of the stream in the respondent, this was conclusive of the matter, there being no grounds in his opinion upon which the conclusive nature of the certificate as declared by s. 38(1) of the Land Registry Act might be impeached.\nThe question is one which is of importance not only in British Columbia but in the three other Western provinces where the Torrens system of land holding is in effect, as well as in certain other of the provinces.\nBrown J., considering that the law as to the rights of a riparian owner whose lands border a non-tidal or non-navigable stream were the same in British Columbia at the times in question as in England, found the rights of the appellant to the eastern half of the bed of the stream to be as they are stated in the judgment of Cotton L.J. in Micklethwait v. Newlay Bridge Co.[3] That learned judge there said:\nIn my opinion, the rule of construction is now well settled that where there is a conveyance of land, even though it is described by reference to a plan and by colour and by quantity, where it is said to be bounded on one side either by a river or by a public thoroughfare, then on the true construction of the instrument half the bed of the river or half of the road passes, unless there is enough in the circumstances or enough in the description of the instrument to show that that is not the intention of the parties. Coady J.A., accepting without deciding that the learned trial judge was right in finding that the land conveyed extended to the river bank notwithstanding the plan, and also without so deciding that the ad medium filum rule was introduced into and became at one time part of the law of British Columbia, considered that the so-called rule had no application in the circumstances of this case where the title of the lands in question and the lands adjoining them immediately to the west was evidenced by certificates of indefeasible title issued under the provisions of the Land Registry Act.\nBy the provisions of the English Law Act, R.S.B.C. 1948, c. 111, the civil and criminal laws of England, as the same existed on the 19th day of November 1858 and so far as the same are not from local circumstances inapplicable, are declared to be in force in all parts of the province, save to the extent that such laws are modified and altered by legislation having the force of law in the province.\nIn the case of Esquimalt Waterworks Co. v. City of Victoria[4], Duff J. (as he then was) considered whether the English law relating to riparian rights became part of the law of the Colony of Vancouver Island where the river in question in that litigation was situate and concluded that the English law applied, referring to what was said by Lord Wensleydale in Chasemore v. Richards[5] While unnecessary to decide whether this was so on the mainland, he expressed his agreement with a judgment of Martin J. (as he then was) in the case of West Kootenay Power and Light Co. v. Nelson[6], where that learned judge had expressed the view that the rules of English law on this point had since 1870 been the law of the whole Colony of British Columbia, and that of Drake J. in Columbia River Co. v. Yuill[7].\nThe exact ground upon which a riparian owner of lands upon a non-tidal or non-navigable stream is held to own the bed of the stream adjoining his property ad medium filum has been variously described. In Sir Matthew Hale's Treatise De Jure Maris, written in the 17th century, which is to be found in Moore's Law of the Foreshore, 3rd ed., the following statement appears (p. 370):\nFresh rivers of what kind soever, do of common right belong to the owners of the soil adjacent; so that the owners of the one side have, of common right, the propriety of the soil, and consequently the right of fishing, usque filum aquae; and the owners of the other side the right of soil or ownership and fishing unto the filum aquae on their side.\nIn Chasemore v. Richards[8], Lord Wensleydale said at p. 382:\nIt has been now settled that the right to the enjoyment of a natural stream of water on the surface, ex jure naturae, belongs to the proprietor of the adjoining lands, as a natural incident to the right to the soil itself, and that he is entitled to the benefit of it, as he is to all the other natural advantages belonging to the land of which he is the owner.\nIn Bristow v. Cormican[9] where the question of the right of the Crown to the soil of an inland non-tidal lake was considered, Lord Blackburn said at p. 666:\nIt is clearly and uniformly laid down in our books that where the soil is covered by the water forming a river in which the tide does not flow, the soil does of common right belong to the owners of the adjoining land.\nIn Lord v. City of Sydney[10], a grant by the Crown made in 1910 of land in New South Wales described as bounded by a creek was held to pass the soil ad medium filum aquae. The judgment of the Judicial Committee delivered by Sir John Coleridge quoted with approval a passage from Kent's Commentaries, ed. 1840, stating that:\nit may be considered as the general rule that a grant of land bounded upon a highway or river carried the fee on the highway or the river to the centre of it, provided the grantor at the time owned to the centre and there be no words or specific description to show a contrary intent.\nAs the description of the boundary in the grant from the Crown did not exclude from it that portion of the creek which by the general presumption of law would go along with the ownership of the land on the bank of it, the Board considered that title passed. The same principle has been held to apply in the case of lands which front upon a highway in England. In Berridge v. Ward[11], Erle C.J. at p. 415 said in part:\nI am of opinion that where a close is conveyed with a description by measurement and colour on a plan annexed to and forming part of the conveyance and the close abuts on a highway and there is nothing to exclude it, the presumption of law is that the soil of the highway usque ad medium filum passes by the conveyance.\nan opinion in which Williams, Willes and Keating JJ. concurred. The reference to this case in the 25th edition of Prideaux's Precedents in Conveyancing at p. 183 reads:\nWhen in the parcels the land is described as bounded on one side by a road or a non-tidal river the conveyance will, so far as the grantor has power to do so, pass the soil of the road or the bed of the river ad medium filum, unless a contrary intention is clearly shown. The fact that the land is described by reference to a coloured plan and no part of the road or river is coloured, and that precise measurements are given which will be satisfied without including any part of the road or river, are not sufficient indications of a contrary intention.\nAs authority for the last statement the learned authors quote Micklethwait v. Newlay Bridge Co., above mentioned, which supports it.\nIn City of London v. Central London Railway[12] Lord Shaw, after referring with approval to what had been said by Kay J. in Tilbury v. Silva[13], and by Cotton L.J. in Micklethwait v. Newlay Bridge Co.[14], said in discussing the reasons for the doctrine (p. 380):\nBut this doctrine is not a mere inference of dedication; it is not a mere convenience in conveyancing; but it is, and is nothing less than, a presumption of, and applicable to, ownership itself. This is too deeply embedded in the law to be disturbed or doubted.\na statement with which Lord Moulton agreed (p. 384).\nIn Maclaren v. Attorney-General of Quebec5[15], the appellants held lands on either side of the Gatineau River under letters patent in which they were described as numbered lots in the Townships of Low and Denholm. These townships on opposite sides of the river had been created by letters patent and a proclamation which described them as being bounded by the river in addition gave detailed boundaries which were stated to start from a post and stone boundary upon the bank of the river, to describe a certain course inland therefrom, then to return to another post and stone boundary at a higher point on the river bank, and \"thence along the bank of the river following its sinuosities as it winds and turns to the place of beginning.\" The judgment delivered on the appeal from this Court by Lord Moulton said in part (p. 272):\nIn the Courts below the learned judges have held that the presumption that the bed of the river ad medium filum aquae was included in the grant is negatived by the fact that the metes and bounds of the parcels forming the townships as described in the letters patent make them terminate at the bank of the river. But their Lordships are of opinion that in so holding they are not giving full effect to the presumption or (as it should rather be termed) rule of construction which is so well established in English law. It is precisely in the cases where the description of the parcel (whether in words or by plan) makes it terminate at the highway or stream and does not indicate that it goes further that the rule is needed.\nThe manner in which plans of the nature of that referred to in the present case are to be prepared is defined in Part VI of the Land Registry Act. Section 80 requires that the land intended to be dealt with by the plan is to be shown thereon surrounded by a line in red ink and that each angle of each parcel shall be defined on the ground by the surveyor by a post or monument of a durable character. Reference Plan No. 61457-I shows the western boundary of the part of sub-lot 36 as an irregular line, the posts being placed at what was apparently regarded as the top of the eastern bank of the river.\nWhile, by agreement between the parties, the case filed in this Court did not contain the evidence taken at the trial and which was considered in the Court of Appeal, the evidence as it appeared in the appeal books in that court is on the file and I have examined it. According to Mr. Affleck, the surveyor, the line showing the western boundary of the property in question was the bank of the river as it existed in 1944, which he described as the line of perennial vegetation, trees and shrubs growing there. This line indicates what is the edge or shore of the river at high water. This manner of preparing plans of lands adjoining non-tidal rivers was, he said, the standard practice followed on the instructions of the Surveyor General of British Columbia, an officer appointed under the provisions of the Land Act, R.S.B.C. 1948, c. 175, applying to all Crown granted lands except those affected by tidal waters. The Salmo River is subject to floods in the spring of the year when the water overflows its banks usually. In times of low water, however, as indicated upon a photograph put in evidence at the trial, there is an area in the bed of the river between the eastern boundary of the river so delineated and the stream itself which is dry.\nSection 38 of the Land Registry Act provides that every certificate of indefeasible title issued under the Act, so long as it remains in force and uncancelled, is conclusive evidence at law and in equity as against Her Majesty and all persons whomsoever that the person named in the certificate is seized of an estate in fee simple in the land therein described, subject to certain exceptions. Of these, if as a matter of law the certificate of title issued to Rotter following the conveyance to him by the Erie Timber Company of December 11, 1945, included the entire bed of the stream, the only exception which could affect the absolute nature of the respondent's title is that lettered (i) which reserves the right of any person to show that the whole or any portion of the land is by wrong description of the boundaries or parcels improperly included in such certificate.\nIt is, however, to be remembered that the certificate of title referred to describes the land as being sub-lot 36, save and except thereout, inter alia, those parts of the sub-lot shown outlined red on Reference Plan 61457-I. In these circumstances, the extent of the lands of which the respondent holds an indefeasible title cannot be determined as between the appellant and the respondent without first determining that of the lands acquired by Rotter, under the transfer of March 29, 1945, from the Erie Timber Company, by His Majesty The King under the transfer from Rotter of May 28, 1945, and those of the appellant under the certificate of indefeasible title, issued to it consequent upon the transfer from His Majesty. It is only sub-lot 36, less the lands to which these parties became respectively entitled under these successive certificates of title, for which the respondent has an indefeasible title.\nIt must be taken, in my opinion, to be conclusively established that if the area of land described by reference to the plan in the appellant's certificate of title was held by it under a registered Crown grant issued under the provisions of the Land Act of British Columbia, the appellant would have title to the bed of the stream ad medium filum, with all the rights and benefits which accrue to a riparian owner by virtue of that fact. That appears to me to be determined by the judgments of the Judicial Committee in Lord v. City of Sydney and Maclaren v. Attorney General of Quebec and by the House of Lords in Bristow v. Cormican, above referred to. The rights of the grantee would not be held to be limited in any respect by the fact that the lands were described in reference to such a plan showing the boundary as the bank of the river containing the stream and not in midstream.\nWhile evidence was not given as to the nature of the title of the Erie Timber Company to lot 1,236, it was stated in counsel's opening for the plaintiff at the trial that it had been registered in the name of that company since 1935 and it must be presumed that that company held a certificate of indefeasible title. It retained that title to sub-lot 36 at the time the portion shown on the plan was transferred by it to the respondent, to enable him to transfer it in turn to the Crown. According to the witness Mason, a mining engineer who was employed by Wartime Metals Ltd. from 1942 to 1944, after negotiations with the respondent, the land was acquired for the erection of a mill, for a tailings disposal area, and to afford direct access to the river for water for the operation of the mill. A pumping station was thereafter established for that purpose on the east bank by the Crown.\nThat the property was being acquired by the Crown for these purposes was undoubtedly known to the respondent during the course of the negotiations. No one would seriously suggest that either party contemplated that the land sold would afford to the grantee access to the water from the river, required for the operation of the mill, only during the time when it was in flood. Yet, this is the result if effect is given to the contention of the respondent that he is the legal owner of the entire bed of the stream. As the matter now stands, the appellant can only obtain access to the water for its mill by leave of the respondent, except during the spring floods. The property and the right to the use of the water is in the Crown in right of the province, as declared by s. 3 of the Water Act, and the apellant qua licensee might under the provisions of s. 21 of that Act expropriate sufficient of the bed of the stream to afford access to the water. However, in the view that I take of this matter, that is not necessary.\nIn The King v. Fares et al.[16], the rights of owners of lands in Saskatchewan in respect of the bed of a lake upon which it was claimed such lands had originally abutted were considered. So far as I am aware, this is the only Canadian case in which any mention is made of the rights of such an owner where title is held under the Torrens System.\nThe lands in question had been purchased by Fares and Alexander Smith, partly from the Canadian Agricultural Coal and Colonization Company and partly from the Canadian Pacific Railway Company and included certain fractional sections in the 17th Township in the 11th Range West of the Third Meridian in the Northwest Territories. Patents had been issued in respect of these lands to the vendor companies between the years 1888 and 1890 and, at the time they were issued, the fractional sections in question abutted on Rush Lake, a non-navigable body of water. The Canadian Agricultural Company had acquired these lands by purchase from the Government of Canada in the year 1887. They were part of an area of 50,000 acres purchased from the Crown for a consideration of $1.50 per acre. The lands purchased from the railway company formed part of the land grant to which that company was entitled under the contract dated October 21, 1880, which forms the schedule to chapter 1 of the Statutes of Canada, 1881. By that contract the Government agreed to grant to the company a subsidy of 25,000,000 acres of land and it was a term of that contract that \"lakes and water stretches\" should not be computed in the acreage of the lands granted but should be made up of other portions in the tract known as the fertile belt.\nAt the time when the patents were issued the lands were subject to the provisions of the Territories Real Property Act, S.C. 1886, c. 26, and, presumably, certificates of title had issued to the patentees under the provisions of s. 46 of that Act. That Act was taken practically verbatim from The Real Property Act of Manitoba passed in 1885, which introduced for the first time the Torrens System into Canada. While the report does not so state, the record in the case, which is available, shows that certificates of title were issued to Fares and to Smith for undivided half interests in the lands in the year 1909. Since the lands were subject to the Act, these conveyances must have been made by transfers in the prescribed form.\nAt the time the lands were purchased by Fares and Smith, the level of Rush Lake had been so lowered by drainage that no part of them abutted upon the lake. Their claim, however, was that, as at the time the patents were granted to their predecessors in title they did so, they were entitled to the lands abutting on and to the centre of the said lake.\nThe patents issued defined the area of each of the parcels of land in acres. The land had been surveyed up to the border of the lake as it was at the time when the patents were issued, but no reference was made in these instruments to the survey. The lands purchased by the company were sold under the provisions of the Dominion Lands Act, R.S.C. 1886, c. 54, which permitted the sale of such lands only as had been surveyed at such prices as might be fixed by the Governor in Council and at a price not less than $1 per acre.\nDuff J. (as he then was) considered that the letters patent could not be construed as conveying more than the acreage referred to in them, since to do so would be to convey unsurveyed lands without consideration, contrary to the terms of s. 29 of the Act. He held that what he referred to as the presumptive rule and also the presumptive construction of grants of riparian lands entitling the owners to non-navigable waters ad medium filum was rebutted by this fact and by the further fact that, at the time title to the lands was acquired by the claimants, the lands had long since ceased to be riparian lands. Lamont J. was of the same opinion upon the first of these grounds. It is in his judgment, which was concurred in by Cannon J., that the only reference is made to the fact that title to the lands was held under the Real Property Act. As to this Lamont J., after pointing out that the claimants obtained title by transfers under the Act, said that it would be noted that no provision was made under that Act for the registration of property or property rights to which a riparian owner would be entitled in the bed of a non-navigable stream or lake by virtue of the ad medium filum rule if the same were applicable to conveyance of lands in the Northwest Territories.\nIn respect of the lands purchased from the Canadian Pacific Railway Company, in view of the fact that the agreement between that company and the Government above referred to pursuant to which the patents were granted by its terms excluded \"lakes and water stretches\" in the sections granted, it was held that the letters patent could not be construed as conveying any rights to the bed of Rush Lake.\nThe Torrens System of landholding originated in Australia and, in New South Wales where the question with which we are concerned appears to have been considered as a matter of doubt, the matter was dealt with by an amendment made in the year 1930 to the Real Property Act 1900. Section 45A, added to that statute, reads in part:\nExcept as in this section mentioned, the rebuttable rule of construction applicable to a conveyance of land therein indicated as abutting on a non-tidal stream or a road, that the land extends to the middle line of the stream or road, shall apply, and be deemed always to have applied to instruments registered under the provisions of this Act relating to land indicated in the instruments as so abutting.\nThe cases in New South Wales dealing with the matter before this amendment was made are to be found in Baalman on the Torrens System, p. 180 et seq.\nIt is to be remembered that this is not a case where lands acquired by a person relying upon the state of the register are in question, as might have been the case had the parties to this litigation been some person who had purchased the remaining part of sub-lot 36 from Rotter after the conveyance to him by the Erie Timber Company and the appellant. What was said by Lord Watson in reference to the Transfer of Land Statute of Victoria in Gibbs v. Messer[17], has no relevance to the circumstances of this case.\nIn the evidence given by the respondent at the trial he stated that he had insisted on the preparation of a plan, apparently saying this in support of his contention that the property conveyed was bounded on the west by the line along the top of the bank shown on the plan, and this statement of fact is repeated in the reasons for judgment delivered by Coady J.A. The statement, however, would appear to be inaccurate since the plan was necessary, since the property formed a part only of sub-lot 36, by reason of the provisions of ss. 83 and 84 of the Land Registry Act unless it was dispensed with by the Registrar under the powers given by s. 106. Section 80 of that Act requires that every such plan tendered for deposit shall be based on a survey made by a British Columbia land surveyor and shall comply with all regulations in regard to surveys and plans which may from time to time be issued by the Surveyor General, and that the land intended to be dealt with shall be shown thereon surrounded by a line in red ink. As shown by the evidence of the surveyor Affleck, in placing the stakes at the top of the bank of the river at the vegetation line he was complying with the instructions of the Surveyor General relating to surveys of Crown lands. If there were at the time in question any regulations issued by the Surveyor General in regard to lands fronting upon non-tidal waters in respect of which a certificate of indefeasible title had been issued under the Land Registry Act following the issue of a Crown grant, no evidence was given as to the fact. Section 6(5) of the Land Act provides that where land to be surveyed is in whole or in part bounded by any lake or river, such lake or river may be adopted as the boundary of the land. By s. 7(d) it is provided that if a corner of a lot falls in the bed of a stream or in any other locality unfavourable to the planting of a post, or if a post is likely to be disturbed or destroyed the corner shall be witnessed by witness-posts planted at the nearest suitable point on the surveyed line, that is, either north, south, east or west of the true corner. There are, however, no similar provisions in the Land Registry Act.\nThe practical difficulties in surveying such property adjoining a mountainous stream such as the Salmo River, unless the river is stated to be the boundary, are obvious. In the summer time, at low water, it is apparent from the evidence that the body of the stream is comparatively small while, at the time of the spring floods, the banks at the vegetation line indicated on the plan are at times overflowed. To establish the medium filum or thread of the stream at a particular time would be feasible for a surveyor, but to mark it with posts which would be visible or continue in place when the stream was in flood would probably be a matter of extreme difficulty. Since it is obvious upon the evidence that what was intended by the parties was that the area to be conveyed would be such as to afford Wartime Metals Ltd. direct access to the water in the stream at all seasons of the year, the placing of the stakes at the top of the bank, in accordance with the directions of the Surveyor General applying to Crown lands in such cases, should not, in my opinion, be held to restrict the rights of the transferee to something less than would be the case if the western boundary had been defined as being the river.\nIn my opinion, the rights acquired by His Majesty The King on behalf of Wartime Metals Ltd., all of which were transferred to the appellant, were the same in their nature as if the westerly boundary of the property had been described in the certificate of title and the accompanying plan as the Salmo River. The matter is not affected, in my opinion, by the fact that the land conveyed is shown in the description by measurement and colour on the plan (Micklethwait v. Newlay Bridge Co., Berridge v. Ward, above referred to). Whether the basis upon which the title of such an owner ad medium filum rests is of common right, as stated by Sir Mathew Hale in his treatise and by Lord Blackburn in Bristow v. Cormican[18], or whether it passes as a matter of construction of the grant, as it was treated by the Judicial Committee in Lord v. City of Sydney[19] and in Maclaren v. Attorney General of Quebec[20], the principle appears to me to be, as Lord Shaw said in City of London v. Central London Railway[21] too deeply embedded in the law to be disturbed or doubted.\nThe argument to the contrary, to which effect has been given in the Court of Appeal, means that a transfer of land described as bounded by a non-tidal or non-navigable stream in a grant from the Crown, registered under an Act repealed by s. 26 of the statutes of 1921 (see s. 126 of the Land Registry Act), would vest in the owner title to the bed of the stream ad medium filum, while a transfer of immediately adjoining property fronting upon the same water and similarly described in a certificate of indefeasible title would carry no such right, even as between the parties. The question to be decided in this action is the proper construction of the grant by the respondent to His Majesty dated May 28, 1945. That question cannot, in my opinion, be affected by the terms of ss. 53, 125, 141(1) and 156 of the Land Registry Act which deal with the manner of registration of conveyances and the duty of the registrar to register the title claimed if the statutory conditions are complied with. The failure of the Crown to ask that the grant be construed as conveying title ad medium filum cannot deprive the appellant of the right to insist as against the grantor that it should be so construed.\nIn the Fares case it was held that the proper construction of the grants in the letters patent was that they were not intended to convey and did not convey the unsurveyed lands covered by the waters of Rush Lake, for the reasons above mentioned. There was no authority in anyone to give away lands of the Crown or to sell unsurveyed lands, and to do so was expressly prohibited by the Dominion Lands Act. No statutory enactment of that nature affects the present matter.\nThe transfer of the lands in question was made, as I have pointed out, for the purpose of enabling Rotter to convey the same forthwith to His Majesty the King for the purposes above described. There is nothing to rebut what was referred to by Strong J. in The Queen v. Robertson[22], as the presumption that it was intended that the soil and bed of the river ad medium filum should pass by the conveyance: rather do the circumstances support such presumption and, in my opinion, the transfers should be so construed. As all of the right, title and interest of His Majesty in the property were transferred by the conveyance to the appellant, that title has, in my opinion, been vested in it since the date of the issue to it of the certificate of indefeasible title which has been mentioned.\nIn Re White[23], where an application was made to bring land bounded by a river under the provisions of the Real Property Act 1900, it was determined by the Court of Appeal that the certificate of title should show as part of the description of the land whether the presumption of ownership of the soil ad medium filum does or does not apply. Street C.J., who gave the judgment of the Court, considered that it was the duty of the Registrar General in such cases to investigate the claim and determine whether the presumption applied and, if so, to insert in the description of the land in the certificate of title a statement to that effect. While in the present matter the appellant by its counterclaim asked for a declaration that it was the lawful owner in fee simple of the river bed ad medium filum, the prayer for relief did not ask that the certificates of title held by the parties respectively should be amended to evidence that fact.\nThis litigation has now been pending for more than five years and as the only persons whose rights may be affected are the parties to this action, it is, in my opinion, in the interests of the due administration of justice that such rights be now finally determined and defined upon the record.\nI would allow this appeal with costs and direct that the judgment at the trial be amended by directing that the certificate of indefeasible title issued to the appellant by the Nelson Land Registry Office and the duplicate thereof in that office be amended by adding to the description of the land the following words immediately after the figures 61457-1 in the description:\nand the lands immediately adjoining the same to the west ad medium filum aquae of the Salmo River as of May 28, 1945\nand that the certificate of indefeasible title of the respondent for the remaining portion of sub-lot 36 referred to in the pleadings and the duplicate thereof in the said Land Registry Office dated January 28, 1946, be amended accordingly.\nThe appellant should have its costs in this Court and in the Court of Appeal.\nMARTLAND J. (dissenting):\u2014The material facts in the present appeal are set out in the reasons of my brother Locke and do not require to be repeated at length. In each of the conveyances, from Erie Timber Company Limited to the respondent, from the respondent to the Crown, and from the Crown to the appellant, the description of the land to be conveyed was those parts of Sub-lot 36 of Lot 1236, Kootenay District, shown outlined in red on the reference plan, which plan was registered, as No. 61457, in the Land Registry Office in Nelson, British Columbia. The significant thing to me is that, on the basis of a conveyance in this form, a conveyance which resulted from expropriation proceedings by the Crown, application was made to register title to land pursuant to s. 125 of the Land Registry Act, R.S.B.C. 1948, c. 171, which provides:\nEvery person claiming to be registered as owner in fee-simple of land shall make application to the Registrar for registration in Form A in the First Schedule. R.S. 1936, c. 140, s. 124.\nAs Coady J.A. said, when delivering the judgment of the Court of Appeal:\nThat application is not before the Court but we can assume, I think, that the property described in that application is that described in the conveyance and nothing more. The purpose of requiring application to be made on Form A is to make sure that the applicant and the Registrar are \"ad idem\" as to what land the applicant requests registration of and what land is to be included in the certificate of title.\nThe material portion of Form A reads as follows:\nI, ,solemnly declare that I am entitled to be registered as the owner in fee-simple of the land hereunder described, and hereby make application under the provisions of the \"Land Registry Act\" and claim registration accordingly.\nWe must assume that the applicant for registration applied for registration of the parcel of land described as above and did not, on the strength of the conveyance in that form, seek registration of a title to include, in addition to the lands actually described in the conveyance, the lands to the west thereof ad medium filum of the Salmo River. On the basis of the various conveyances the appellant obtained a certificate of indefeasible title to those parts of Sub-lot 36 shown outlined in red on Reference Plan 61457-I.\nThese facts raise the issue as to whether the rebuttable rule of construction applicable, under the common law, to a conveyance of land therein indicated as abutting on a non-tidal stream, that the land extends to the middle line of the stream, is also applicable in respect of a registered title under a Torrens System of titles, such as the Land Registry Act. The appellant, in answer to a claim for trespass, and in support of its counterclaim, relied upon its title to the land to the middle line of the Salmo River and claimed ownership of that land. That claim depends upon what title was conferred upon it by its existing certificate of indefeasible title, for there has been no claim for any correction of the register or of any instrument. That the rule itself is well established in English law is shown in the cases cited by my brother Locke. But as Anglin C.J.C. said, in this Court, in The King v. Fares[24]:\nI have had the advantage of perusing the carefully prepared opinions of my brothers Duff and Lamont. While they may differ in some details, as I read what they have written, they agree in holding that, assuming the ad medium filum rule of English law to be ordinarily applicable in Saskatchewan to non-navigable waters, such as the lake in question, it is, at the highest, a rule of interpretation, and the rebuttable presumption thereby created yields readily to proof either of circumstances inconsistent with its application, or of the expressed intention of a competent Legislature so to exclude its application. With that view, I entirely agree (Keewatin Power Co. v. Kenora, (1908) 16 Ont. L.R. 184, at 190, 192), and I also agree that the intention of the Dominion Parliament\u2014an authority competent so to provide\u2014to exclude the application of the rule to Dominion lands in the North West Territories, was sufficiently manifested by the provisions of the Dominion Lands Act (c. 54, R.S.C. 1886).\nThere was no provision in the Dominion Lands Act, there under consideration, expressly excluding the application of the \"ad medium filum\" rule, but it was held that the Act disclosed an intent inconsistent with its application.\nLamont J., with whom Cannon J. concurred, made some reference to the application of the rule to a Torrens System of titles, at p. 96, as follows:\nIn addition, there was in force at the same time the Territories Real Property Act (ch. 51 of R.S.C., 1886), in which Parliament had adopted for the Territories the Torrens System of land registration and transfer by which the title of an owner was registered under the Act and a transfer of land could be made by a conveyance in Form G, in which form the land to be conveyed is described by section, township, range and meridian, according to the description given in the survey provided for by the Dominion Lands Act. It will be noted, however, that no provision was made for the registration of property or property rights to which a riparian owner would be entitled in the bed of a non-navigable stream or lake by virtue of the ad medium filum rule if the same were applicable to conveyances of land in the North West Territories.\nDo the provisions of the Land Registry Act manifest an intention to exclude the rule in respect of certificates of indefeasible title in British Columbia? The judgment of the Court of Appeal, delivered by Coady J.A., in this case is that they do, and I have reached the same conclusion. In the first place, the purpose of a Torrens System of titles, such as is provided for in the Land Registry Act, is that which was stated by Lord Watson, in the leading case of Gibbs v. Messer[25], when speaking of the Transfer of Land Statute of Victoria:\nThe main object of the Act, and the legislative scheme for the attainment of that object, appear\u2026 to be equally plain. The object is to save persons dealing with registered proprietors from the trouble and expense of going behind the register, in order to investigate the history of their author's title, and to satisfy themselves of its validity.\nIf the \"ad medium filum\" rule were to be applied to certificates of indefeasible title, it would always be necessary to go behind the register. The rule is a rebuttable one. It may be rebutted, as Cotton L.J. said, in Micklethwait v. Newlay Bridge Company[26], by \"facts, whether appearing on the face of the conveyance or not\". Consequently, if the rule were to apply to a registered title under the Land Registry Act, a person proposing to deal with respect to a parcel of land bounded by a non-tidal and non-navigable river, could not tell, even by a search of the conveyance which created the title, whether it carried the ownership of the land ad medium filum or not. The whole intent of this Act is that a person dealing with land may rely upon the register.\nIn the second place, in my opinion, specific provisions of the Act show a contrary intent. I have already referred to s. 125 and to Form A, dealing with an application to register land. Section 141(1) deals with the Registrar's power to register, and provides:\nWhere an application has been made for the registration of the title to any land, if the Registrar is satisfied that the boundaries of the land are sufficiently defined by the description or plan on record in the office or provided by the applicant, and that a good safeholding and marketable title in fee-simple has been established by the applicant, the Registrar shall register the title claimed by the applicant in the register.\nSection 156 deals with the issuance of subsequent certificates of title and reads:\nWhere a conveyance or transfer is made of any land the title to which is registered, the grantee or transferee shall be entitled to be registered as the owner of the estate or interest held by or vested in the former owner to the extent to which that estate or interest is conveyed or transferred; and the Registrar, upon being satisfied that the conveyance or transfer produced has transferred to and vested in the applicant a good safe-holding and marketable title, shall, upon production of the former certificate or duplicate certificate of title, register the title claimed by the applicant in the register. R.S. 1936, c. 140, s. 155.\nThese provisions establish that on the application for the issue of the first certificate of title the applicant must make claim to the title which he seeks to register and thereafter conveyances are made on the basis of the registered title.\nSection 53 of the Act contains the following provision:\nInstruments in statutory or other form sufficient to pass or create an estate or interest in land shall be registrable, and for all purposes of registration effect shall be given to them according to their tenor. R.S. 1936, c. 140, s. 52.\nIt seems to me, in view of this section, in the absence of any claim by the Crown that on the basis of the conveyance to it by Rotter it had become entitled to be registered as owner of the lands ad medium filum of the River Salmo, the only effect which could be given to that conveyance was the issuance of a certificate of indefeasible title to those lands which were actually described in the conveyance itself. That is what actually occurred and, in turn, a similar title issued in the name of the appellant as a result of the subsequent conveyance to it by the Crown.\nThe Act does contain a provision regarding title to minerals to the middle line of a highway, in certain circumstances. Section 112 provides:\n(1) Where, on the subdivision of land, any subdivision plan or reference plan covering the land subdivided is deposited in any Land Registry Office, and any portion of the land subdivided is shown on the plan as a highway, park, or public square, and is not designated thereon to be of a private nature, the deposit of the plan shall be deemed to be a dedication by the owner of the land to the public of each portion thereof shown on the plan as a highway, park, or public square for the purpose and object indicated on or to be inferred from the words or markings on the plan. No certificate of title shall issue for any highway, park, or public square so dedicated.\n(2) The deposit of any plan to which this section applies shall be deemed to vest in the Crown in right of the Province the title to such portion of the land subdivided as is shown thereon as a highway, park, or public square: Provided that the deposit of the plan shall not be deemed to vest in the Crown or otherwise affect the right or title to the minerals, precious or base, including coal, petroleum, fireclay, and natural gas, under lying any portion of the land shown as a highway, park, or public square, anything in the \"Highway Act\", the \"Municipal Act\", or any other Act to the contrary notwithstanding; but, upon conveyance of a parcel shown upon the plan adjoining a highway, park, or public square so dedicated, such minerals underlying the portion of the highway, park, or public square opposite the parcel conveyed and between that parcel and the middle line of the highway, park, or public square, unless expressly reserved, shall pass to and vest in the owner for the time being of the parcel conveyed. R.S. 1936, c. 140, s. 111.\nIt is to be noted that in this particular instance the question as to whether or not title to minerals to the middle line of the highway passes is made dependent upon whether or not there is an express reservation of mineral in the conveyance.\nMy conclusion is that the rebuttable rule of construction at common law as to conveyances of land bounded by a non-tidal river is not applicable to a certificate of indefeasible title under the Land Registry Act. In the present case the appellant, in claiming ownership of the river bed ad medium filum, relies upon its certificate of indefeasible title. In my opinion that certificate does not establish title in the appellant to any lands beyond those which are actually described in it.\nI have dealt up to this point with the question of the applicability of the rule above mentioned to the certificate of indefeasible title itself. However, counsel for the appellant, in his factum, also submits the following proposition.\nIf the form of the appellant's certificate of title is not in a form satisfactory to include the whole of the appellant's interest the appellant is in a position in equity to apply for rectification of the certificate.\nThe appellant's title is derived from a conveyance to it by the Crown. It could not acquire thereby anything beyond what the Crown owned. The Crown derived its title by virtue of the conveyance from the respondent whereby he had granted those parts of Sub-lot 36 \"outline in red on reference plan attached thereto\".\nThe portion of Sub-lot 36 outlined in red on the reference plan did not include the river bed of the Salmo River ad medium filum.\nThat conveyance from Rotter to the Crown was submitted by the Crown to the Registrar for registration and he, by virtue of s. 53 of the Land Registry Act, was bound to give effect to it \"according to its tenor\".\nIn Earl Jowitt's Dictionary of English Law, in defining the word \"tenor\", it is said:\nThe tenor of a document means, in ordinary conversation, its purport and effect, as opposed to the exact words of it. In law, in its correct usage, the reverse is the case, and tenor means the exact words of the document. In view of the provisions of s. 53, I do not see how the Registrar, solely on the basis of the conveyance presented to him by the Crown, could have issued to it a certificate of indefeasible title for anything more than the lands actually described in the conveyance. If the Crown contended that it was entitled to more it would seem that proceedings for rectification of the conveyance would have been necessary. No such proceedings have been taken, nor is there any evidence that the Crown made any such contention when it accepted its certificate of indefeasible title.\nFor these reasons, in my opinion, this contention of the appellant also fails.\nIn my view the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs, MARTLAND J. dissenting.\nSolicitors for the defendant, appellant: Wraggle, Hamilton and Arnesen, Nelson, B.C.\nSolicitor for the plaintiff, respondent: J.

At the time, the students were verifying the results of experiments they had just made in booths provided for this purpose. A student entered the booth where the appellant and others were working with a magneto and caused the explosion by holding a dynamite cap to the magneto. The teacher was not there but was in another room on the same floor attending to other duties for the school. The action was maintained by the trial judge, but this judgment was reversed by the Court of Appeal. The plaintiff appealed to this Court. Held: The appeal should be dismissed.\nThe damage was not the result of a probable and foreseeable act and was not due to the lack of supervision on the part of the teacher. The action of the student could not have been anticipated. A teacher could not be required to supervise his pupils every moment, especially if they are 16 to 18 years old and were not left with any dangerous articles in their hands.\nThe rules and regulations enacted for the discipline of the staff applied only to the staff and did not create any rights vis-\u00e0-vis third parties if they were breached.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench, Appeal Side, Province of Quebec1, reversing a judgment of Mitchell J.

A Asbestos, on a am\u00e9nag\u00e9 la construction de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 ce que l'enseignement th\u00e9orique se donne dans des salles sp\u00e9ciales, tandis que l'enseignement pratique se dispense au rez-de-chauss\u00e9e, dans des ateliers r\u00e9partis entre les quatre sp\u00e9cialit\u00e9s qui sont enseign\u00e9es \u00e0 l'\u00e9cole.\nCes ateliers sont de petites chambres ajour\u00e9es o\u00f9 les \u00e9l\u00e8ves, par groupes de deux, peuvent travailler et faire des exp\u00e9riences sur les enseignements th\u00e9oriques qui leur sont donn\u00e9s.\nLe professeur, qui dans le cas qui nous occupe, \u00e9tait M. Jules Dussault, un homme d'une comp\u00e9tence reconnue, surveillait les travaux pratiques d'\u00e9lectricit\u00e9, comme le posage des fils, des lampes, des interrupteurs, etc., non reli\u00e9s au courant de l'\u00e9cole. On se servait plut\u00f4t d'un courant d\u00e9velopp\u00e9 par magn\u00e9to, qui \u00e9tait moins puissant et par cons\u00e9quent moins dangereux. Il y a, \u00e0 c\u00f4t\u00e9 des cabines o\u00f9 travaillent les \u00e9l\u00e8ves, une pi\u00e8ce qu'on appelle le \"magasin\" \"o\u00f9 l'on remisait le mat\u00e9riel utile aux travaux des \u00e9l\u00e8ves. Le professeur M. Dussault surveillait donc ces travaux pratiques, o\u00f9 se d\u00e9veloppait l'initiative personnelle des \u00e9l\u00e8ves, mais il devait \u00e9galement s'occuper du magasin, du mat\u00e9riel et du syst\u00e8me \u00e9lectrique de l'\u00e9cole.\nIl est en preuve que des instructions sont donn\u00e9es aux \u00e9l\u00e8ves de travailler toujours avec la plus grande attention, de ne jamais se servir dans l'atelier d'appareils qu'ils ne connaissent pas, d'ex\u00e9cuter \u00e0 la lettre la t\u00e2che qui leur est assign\u00e9e, et de ne pas entreprendre d'exp\u00e9riences dont ils ne connaissent pas la port\u00e9e.\nIl est arriv\u00e9 que le 12 mars 1952, alors que la professeur Dussault \u00e9tait momentan\u00e9ment absent du local o\u00f9 se donnent les le\u00e7ons pratiques, un \u00e9l\u00e8ve du nom de Robert Lambert fit exploser un d\u00e9tonateur \u00e0 dynamite, avec le r\u00e9sultat que l'appelant a souffert de graves blessures \u00e0 l'oeil droit et \u00e0 la figure. Le juge au proc\u00e8s lui a accord\u00e9 la somme de $7,629.20, mais la Cour du banc de la reine2 a renvers\u00e9 ce jugement, et a rejet\u00e9 l'action avec d\u00e9pens.\nLe dossier r\u00e9v\u00e8le que le jour o\u00f9 ce malheureux accident s'est produit, environ quinze \u00e9l\u00e8ves suivaient les cours pratiques, sous la surveillance du professeur Dussault. Apr\u00e8s que ce dernier eut v\u00e9rifi\u00e9 que les travaux de deux \u00e9l\u00e8ves nomm\u00e9s Hamel et Ellyson avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 bien accomplis, il leur demanda de v\u00e9rifier, \u00e0 l'aide du petit magn\u00e9to activ\u00e9 \u00e0 la main, le travail des autres \u00e9l\u00e8ves dans les divers compartiments. Comme ils se trouvaient tous les deux dans le compartiment du jeune O'Brien et d'un autre \u00e9l\u00e8ve, un \u00e9tudiant du nom de Lambert quitta son propre compartiment, se rendit \u00e0 l'endroit o\u00f9 Hamel et Ellyson travaillaient, et sortit de la poche de sa salopette une capsule de dynamite qu'il avait ant\u00e9rieurement trouv\u00e9e hors de l'\u00e9cole. Il l'ajusta au fil du magn\u00e9to, et une explosion se produisit qui blessa plusieurs \u00e9l\u00e8ves dont le demandeur en reprise d'instance. Au moment o\u00f9 se produisit cet accident, le professeur Dussault avait temporairement quitt\u00e9 les lieux pour remplir d'autres fonctions sur le m\u00eame \u00e9tage. C'est la pr\u00e9tention de l'appelant qu'il y a eu n\u00e9gligence de la part de Dussault, et qu'il n'a pas exerc\u00e9 la surveillance n\u00e9cessaire.\nEn vertu de l'art. 1054, para. 5, du Code Civil, l'instituteur est responsable du dommage caus\u00e9 par ses \u00e9l\u00e8ves pendant' qu'ils sont sous sa surveillance. Il y a une pr\u00e9somption l\u00e9gale \u00e0 cet effet, mais elle n'est pas invincible, et l'instituteur sera exempt de responsabilit\u00e9 s'il d\u00e9montre qu'il n'a pu emp\u00eacher le fait qui a caus\u00e9 le dommage. L'instituteur est tenu de remplir bien et fid\u00e8lement son devoir de surveillance, et il doit aussi donner les instructions n\u00e9cessaires pour que des imprudences ne soient pas commises.\nMais, il ne faut pas \u00e9videmment exag\u00e9rer le standard de perfection qui est requis de l'instituteur. Il aura bien accompli son devoir, et il sera \u00e0 l'abri de toute responsabilit\u00e9 civile, s'il d\u00e9montre qu'il a fait ce qui \u00e9tait raisonnablement possible de faire, s'il a agi comme aurait agi un bon p\u00e8re de famille dans des conditions identiques, et s'il a pris les pr\u00e9cautions ordinaires qu'un homme diligent devait prendre dans les m\u00eames circonstances. Vide: Sourdat \"Trait\u00e9 de Responsabilit\u00e9 Civile\", vol. 2, p. 105; Alain v. Hardy3; Ouellet v. Cloutier4; Bisson v. Commissaires d'Ecoles de St-Georges5; Carty v. The Board of Protestant School of Sherbrooke6; L'\u0152uvre des Terrains de Jeux de Qu\u00e9bec v. Cannon7.\nOn a dit et on a r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9 souvent qu'on ne peut pas demander \u00e0 l'homme prudent, pas plus qu'\u00e0 l'instituteur avis\u00e9, de pr\u00e9voir toutes les possibilit\u00e9s. La loi n'a pas cette rigidit\u00e9.\nDans le cas qui nous occupe, il importe de nous demander si le dommage qui est survenu est le r\u00e9sultat d'un acte probable et pr\u00e9visible, et s'il est d\u00fb \u00e0 un d\u00e9faut de surveillance de la part de Dussault, employ\u00e9 de l'intim\u00e9. Je dois dire, en premier lieu, que ce n'est pas le devoir des autorit\u00e9s scolaires, dans des circonstances normales, d'exercer une surveillance de tous les instants sur les \u00e9l\u00e8ves qui fr\u00e9quentent l'\u00e9cole. Vide: The Board of Education for the City of Toronto et al. v. Higgs and Higgs et al8. Un instituteur doit n\u00e9cessairement se d\u00e9placer, et il peut s\u00fbrement s'absenter momentan\u00e9ment quand il sait que le travail qu'il a donn\u00e9 \u00e0 faire ne pr\u00e9sente aucun danger, et surtout lorsqu'il a affaire \u00e0 des \u00e9l\u00e8ves m\u00fbris de 16 \u00e0 18 ans. Dussault n'avait laiss\u00e9 aucun instrument dangereux entre les mains des \u00e9l\u00e8ves, et il n'y avait aucune raison de soup\u00e7onner ce qui est arriv\u00e9.\nL'accident est survenu comme cons\u00e9quence d'un acte spontan\u00e9, impossible \u00e0 pr\u00e9voir. Le jeune Lambert a profit\u00e9 d'une courte absence du professeur pour tromper sa vigilance et mettre son projet \u00e0 ex\u00e9cution, et il a viol\u00e9 les instructions qui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9es. On ne peut raisonnablement reprocher \u00e0 Dussault de ne pas avoir pr\u00e9vu ni soup\u00e7onn\u00e9 que Lambert se livrerait \u00e0 une telle exp\u00e9rience.\nL'appelant a cit\u00e9 les r\u00e8glements de l'\u00c9cole dans lesquels on donne des directives aux professeurs. Ces r\u00e8glements ne s'adressent qu'\u00e0 ces derniers, et ils ne font partie que de la r\u00e9gie interne de l'\u00c9cole; ils ne cr\u00e9ent aucun droit vis-\u00e0-vis les tiers.\nJe crois donc que la Cour du Banc de la Reine a bien jug\u00e9 en d\u00e9boutant de son action le demandeur en reprise d'instance, et je suis d'opinion que le pr\u00e9sent appel doit \u00eatre rejet\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nAttorneys for the plaintiff, appellant: Blanchette, P\u00e9loquin & Allaire, Sherbrooke.\nAttorneys for the defendant, respondent: Leblanc, Delorme, Barnard, Leblanc & Fr\u00e9chette, Sherbrooke.\n1 [1960] Que.

Frank Ross Construction Ltd., [1961] S.C.R. 195\nDate: 1960-12-19\nVerona Construction Limited (Plaintiff) Appellant;\nand\nFrank Ross Construction Limited (Defendant) Respondent.\n1960: May 27; 1960: December 19.\nPresent: Cartwright, Fauteux, Abbott, Martland and Ritchie JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF QUEEN'S BENCH, APPEAL SIDE, PROVINCE OF QUEBEC.\nContracts\u2014Breach of\u2014Unexpected difficulties\u2014Demand for new contract\u2014 Abandonment of work\u2014Right to take over abandonned contract.\nIn 1949, the defendant company entered into a contract with the City of Dorval to construct sewers within the city, and gave a sub-contract to the plaintiff company for some of the work. Within a few weeks of the signing of this sub-contract, the plaintiff wrote to the defendant that having encountered quicksand the sub-contract would have to be cancelled and a new one made for an increased price. The defendant refused to change the sub-contract, and eventually the work was stopped and taken over by the defendant. The plaintiff alleged in its action that the defendant had prevented it from completing the contract. The defendant counterclaimed and alleged abandonment of the contract. The trial judge found that both parties had voluntarily put an end to the sub-contract. He maintained the action in part and dismissed the counterclaim. The Court of Appeal reversed this judgment and held that the plaintiff had abandonned the sub-contract and that the taking over of the work by the defendant did not amount to a consent to the abandonment. The plaintiff appealed to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nAs held by the Court of Appeal, the impasse giving rise to this litigation was created by the plaintiff's decision to abandon the work when it came to the realization that it could not complete it without suffering a serious financial loss. The defendant did not have to remake its contract with the plaintiff or to temporize, and neither its refusal to do so nor the celerity with which it had the work completed could have changed the fact of the abandonment and its consequences.\nThe acceptation of the abandonment as a fait accompli, after the plaintiff had openly abandonned the contract and shown a clear intention to keep on doing so, did not imply that the defendant had consented to this unilateral act on the part of the plaintiff.\nAPPEALS from two judgments of the Court of Queen's Bench, Appeal Side, Province of Quebec1, reversing a judgment of Brossard J. Appeals dismissed.\nR. Duranleau, Q.C., for the plaintiff, appellant. J. G. Ahern, Q.C., for the defendant, respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nFauteux J.:\u2014Suivant un contrat d'entreprise \u00e0 forfait, intervenu en juin 1949 entre elle et la ville de Dorval, la compagnie intim\u00e9e assuma l'ex\u00e9cution de travaux d'installation de nouveaux \u00e9gouts dans le territoire de la ville. Pour assurer la marche rapide du travail, l'intim\u00e9e se chargea des travaux sur certaines sections et en confia l'ex\u00e9cution, sur les autres sections, \u00e0 diff\u00e9rents sous-entrepreneurs, dont l'appelante. A ces fins, elle passait avec celle-ci un contrat, le 8 ao\u00fbt 1949. L'appelante avait \u00e0 peine commenc\u00e9 l'ex\u00e9cution de son contrat qu'elle fit face \u00e0 des difficult\u00e9s attribu\u00e9es \u00e0 la nature du sol. Le 23 ao\u00fbt 1949, elle adressait la lettre suivante \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e:\nTel Dollard 7877 7470 Henri Julien\nVERONA CONSTRUCTION LIMITED\nMONTREAL, August 23rd, 1949.\nREGISTERED\nFrank Ross Construction Limited,\n736 Cote St. Catherine Road,\nOutremont, Que.\nDear Sir:\u2014\nWith reference to our contract re SEWER WORK in Dorval, it does not mention any quick sand whatsoever; our prices were for earth and rock but not for quick sand. Since we have started the job, we have been working in quick sand and should it continue to be quick sand, we are sorry to say that our contract will have to be cancelled and a new contract will have to be made up with a different price.\nYours very truly,\nVERONA CONSTRUCTION LTD.\n(signed) N. Marzitelli.\nL'appelante avait bien, cependant, accept\u00e9 les risques attenant \u00e0 la nature du sol. L'intim\u00e9e refusa son accord \u00e0 cette demande. Une m\u00e9sentente s'ensuivit entre les parties et leurs relations s'aggrav\u00e8rent. \u00c9ventuellement, l'appelante suspendit les travaux. C'est alors que l'intim\u00e9e se chargea d'en ex\u00e9cuter une partie et de confier le reste \u00e0 un autre entrepreneur.\nPr\u00e9tendant que l'intim\u00e9e l'avait emp\u00each\u00e9e de poursuivre l'ex\u00e9cution de son contrat, l'appelante la poursuivit en fin de septembre 1949, pour lui r\u00e9clamer une somme de $7,870.22 pour les travaux faits jusqu'au 15 de ce mois. L'intim\u00e9e contesta cette action et, de son c\u00f4t\u00e9, all\u00e9guant que, par suite de l'abandon des travaux par l'appelante, elle avait elle-m\u00eame \u00e9t\u00e9 oblig\u00e9e d'en faire une partie et en confier le reste \u00e0 d'autres, lui r\u00e9clama, par voie de demande reconventionnelle, une somme de $21,784.47, repr\u00e9sentant, en substance, la diff\u00e9rence entre le montant qu'elle aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 oblig\u00e9e de payer \u00e0 l'appelante\u2014si cette derni\u00e8re e\u00fbt ex\u00e9cut\u00e9 son contrat,\u2014et le montant qu'elle dut effectivement payer pour faire compl\u00e9ter les travaux d\u00e9j\u00e0 commenc\u00e9s par l'appelante et ceux que cette derni\u00e8re s'\u00e9tait engag\u00e9e \u00e0 faire.\nDe l'ensemble des griefs et moyens soulev\u00e9s par les parties, le Juge de la Cour sup\u00e9rieure consid\u00e9ra que la question essentielle \u00e0 d\u00e9cider \u00e9tait de savoir s'il y avait eu rupture de contrat et, dans l'affirmative, \u00e0 qui cette rupture \u00e9tait imputable. Adjugeant sur la question, la Cour en vint \u00e0 la conclusion que l'une et l'autre des parties avait volontairement et de propos d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9, respectivement mis fin au contrat tout en cherchant \u00e0 jeter sur l'autre partie la responsabilit\u00e9 de son inex\u00e9cution. En cons\u00e9quence, la Cour d\u00e9clara r\u00e9sili\u00e9, par la volont\u00e9 des parties, le contrat pass\u00e9 entre elles le 8 ao\u00fbt 1949, maintint en partie l'action de l'appelante, condamna l'intim\u00e9e \u00e0 lui payer la somme de $1,885.92 et rejeta la demande reconventionnelle.\nL'intim\u00e9e logea deux appels contre ce jugement, l'un, portant le n\u00b0 5174, visant la d\u00e9cision sur l'action principale du sous-entrepreneur, et l'autre, portant le n\u00b0 5173, ayant trait \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision sur sa demande reconventionnelle.\nLa Cour d'Appel2 consid\u00e9ra qu'en fait, la preuve \u00e9tablissait que l'appelante avait abandonn\u00e9 son sous-contrat et qu'en droit, le fait par l'intim\u00e9e d'avoir, subs\u00e9quemment \u00e0 cet abandon, assum\u00e9 l'ex\u00e9cution des travaux avec d'autres entrepreneurs, ne pouvait \u00e9quivaloir \u00e0 un consentement \u00e0 cet abandon des travaux et la priver du droit de r\u00e9clamer les dommages lui r\u00e9sultant de cet acte unilat\u00e9ral de l'appelante. Les dommages subis par l'intim\u00e9e furent liquid\u00e9s \u00e0 la somme de $12,759.17. En cons\u00e9quence, et par jugements unanimes, la Cour du banc de la reine fit droit \u00e0 ces appels, rejeta l'action principale de l'appelante, accueillit la demande reconventionnelle de l'intim\u00e9e et condamna l'appelante \u00e0 lui payer la somme des dommages ainsi liquid\u00e9s\nL'appelante se pourvoit maintenant \u00e0 l'encontre de ces d\u00e9cisions.\nTous les Juges des Cours inf\u00e9rieures s'accordent \u00e0 d\u00e9clarer\u2014et la preuve supporte amplement ces vues\u2014que le 6 septembre, l'appelante a fait l'abandon de son contrat et que ce n'est qu'apr\u00e8s le fait de cet abandon que l'intim\u00e9e a pris l'initiative des travaux que l'appelante s'\u00e9tait engag\u00e9e \u00e0 faire, aux termes du contrat du 8 ao\u00fbt 1949.\nEn vertu de son contrat, dit la Cour sup\u00e9rieure, la demanderesse avait l'obligation d'ex\u00e9cuter ces travaux; en les suspendant, avec l'intention de ne pas les reprendre, mais de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 provoquer la d\u00e9fenderesse \u00e0 les continuer \u00e0 sa place, la demanderesse a viol\u00e9 son obligation. D'autre part, ajoute-t-elle, il appert de la preuve que l'intim\u00e9e avait elle-m\u00eame, le 6 septembre, perdu tout d\u00e9sir d'astreindre l'appelante \u00e0 l'ex\u00e9cution de son contrat et que la signification, le m\u00eame jour, d'un prot\u00eat enjoignant \u00e0 l'appelante de reprendre les travaux dans les quarante-huit heures, n'avait pour objet v\u00e9ritable que de donner une couleur de droit aux dispositions qu'elle entendait prendre subs\u00e9quemment pour assumer elle-m\u00eame, avec d'autres, les travaux de l'appelante. Les parties, conclut la Cour, ont mis fin au contrat, non pas d'un commun accord, mais concurremment et partant, ni l'une ni l'autre n'ont droit \u00e0 des dommages.\nEn tout respect, et d'accord avec les vues exprim\u00e9es par M. le Juge Casey, de la Cour d'Appel, avec le concours de ses coll\u00e8gues, comme lui je dirais que l'impasse donnant lieu \u00e0 ce litige est n\u00e9e de la d\u00e9cision de l'appelante d'abandonner ces travaux lorsqu'elle r\u00e9alisa qu'elle ne pouvait les compl\u00e9ter sans subir une perte financi\u00e8re s\u00e9rieuse; que l'intim\u00e9e n'avait pas l'obligation de refaire le contrat ou de temporiser, et que ni son refus de ce faire, ni la c\u00e9l\u00e9rit\u00e9 avec laquelle elle proc\u00e9da \u00e0 entreprendre et faire entreprendre par d'autres l'ex\u00e9cution des travaux abandonn\u00e9s par l'appelante, n'affectent le fait de cet abandon et les cons\u00e9quences qui en r\u00e9sultent.\nInform\u00e9e que l'appelante avait suspendu ses travaux et avait manifest\u00e9 ouvertement, par des d\u00e9clarations et des faits, l'intention de ne pas les reprendre aux conditions du contrat, l'intim\u00e9e mit l'appelante en demeure de les reprendre imm\u00e9diatement, \u00e0 d\u00e9faut de quoi ceux-ci seraient termin\u00e9s par d'autres \u00e0 ses frais et d\u00e9pens. L'acceptation de cet abandon comme fait accompli n'implique pas que l'intim\u00e9e ait donn\u00e9 son accord \u00e0 cet acte unilat\u00e9ral pos\u00e9 par l'appelante. Rien n'indique d'ailleurs que si l'appelante, revisant sa position, s'\u00e9tait alors conform\u00e9e au contrat ou \u00e0 la mise en demeure, l'intim\u00e9e aurait pris l'initiative que la conduite de l'appelante l'a forc\u00e9e de prendre.\nQuant aux dommages, la Cour d'Appel a accord\u00e9, apr\u00e8s avoir fait certaines d\u00e9ductions, la somme de $12,784.47. A mon avis, il n'y a pas lieu d'intervenir.\nJe renverrais les deux appels avec d\u00e9pens.\nAppeals dismissed with costs.\nAttorneys for the plaintiff, appellant: Duranleau, Dupr\u00e9 & Duranleau, Montreal.\nAttorneys for the defendant, respondent: Lefran\u00e7ois, Goulet & Lalonde, Montreal.\n1 [1959] Que.

Coca-Cola Limited, [1961] S.C.R. 201\nDate: 1960-12-19\nEdward George Driver and Others (Plaintiffs) Appellants;\nand\nCoca-Cola Limited (Defendant) Respondent.\n1960: May 25, 26; 1960: December 19.\nPresent: Taschereau, Cartwright, Fauteux, Abbott and Ritchie JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF QUEEN'S BENCH, APPEAL SIDE, PROVINCE OF QUEBEC.\nDamages\u2014Fatal accident\u2014Child struck by truck\u2014Child died on same day\u2014 What damages recoverable\u2014Claim for shortening of life expectancy or loss of life\u2014Claim by parents under art. 1056 of the Civil Code\u2014Also claim by parents as heirs under art. 607 of the Civil Code.\nThe plaintiffs' female child was hit by a truck and died of her injuries on the same day. Her parents claimed damages under art. 1056 of the Civil Code. They also claimed with their other children, as legal heirs of the victim, damages for the shortening of the victim's life. The jury awarded damages under both heads. The Court of Appeal reduced the award given under art. 1056 as it found it to have been excessive, and dismissed the other claim. The parents appealed to this Court. The question of liability was not in issue.\nHeld (Cartwright J. dissenting in part): The appeal should be dismissed.\nPer Curiam: Only the father and mother had a claim under art. 1056 of the Code, this claim was limited to the damages they suffered as a consequence of the death of their daughter, and the amount of damages under this head, as reduced by the Court of Appeal, was reasonable and should not be disturbed.\nPer Taschereau, Abbott and Ritchie JJ.: The victim's heirs had no claim for the victim's pain and suffering and loss of life. Such a claim was not in the victim's patrimoine and could not, therefore, be transmitted to the heirs under art. 607 of the Code.\nIt is not contested that the victim of a delict or quasi-delict has a claim, transmissible to the heirs, for pain and suffering and shortening of life when the victim has actually felt the effect of these damages before dying, i.e., when the right arose ante mortem. This is not to be confused with solatium doloris which does not exist in the Quebec law. However, in the present case, since the victim died so shortly after the accident,\u2014the evidence does not disclose whether she suffered and even whether she was conscious during the interval between the accident and her death,\u2014it was not established that these essential elements of damage were part of her patrimoine.\nThe only claim, therefore, that could be made would be for loss of life. As the victim never had an action for damages resulting from her own death, such a claim could not be transmitted to her heirs. C.P.R. v. Robinson, 19 S.C.R. 292, applied.\nPer Fauteux J.: At the very moment of a person's death, all juridical possibilities for that person to acquire rights or obligations become extinct. When, in the present case, the head of damage under which the claim was made, i.e., the loss of life, came to be realized, no right could henceforth accrue to the victim who had ceased to live. Consequently, since the victim's patrimoine was not increased by the loss of her life, she could not transmit any right arising from that head of damage to her heirs.\nPer Cartwright J., dissenting in part: The victim had in her lifetime a right of action for damages for the shortening of her life which was transmissible to her heirs. The claim she was entitled to assert was for damages because the defendant's fault had deprived her of the reasonable prospect of an uncertain number of happy years of life. The inflicting of physical injury which cuts short the period during which the injured person had a normal expectation of living a reasonably happy life gives rise to a claim for damage which the injured person can assert under art. 1053 of the Code. Such damages are not to be confused with damages for life being rendered less enjoyable. The latter could be suffered only while the injured person is alive but the former are increased by the acceleration of his death.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench, Appeal Side, Province of Quebec1, reversing a judgment of Charbonneau J. Appeal dismissed, Cartwright J. dissenting in part.\nJ. Rosenblum and B. B. Cohen, for the plaintiffs, appellants.\nJ. F. Chisholm, Q.C., for the defendant, respondent.\nThe judgment of Taschereau and Ritchie JJ. was delivered by\nTaschereau J.:\u2014Le 19 septembre 1955, vers 4.15 heures de l'apr\u00e8s-midi, Beverley Driver a \u00e9t\u00e9 frapp\u00e9e par le camion de la d\u00e9fenderesse, sur la route Chambly, dans la municipalit\u00e9 de St-Hubert, district de Montr\u00e9al, et est d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9e le m\u00eame jour. Cette jeune enfant \u00e2g\u00e9e de huit ans \u00e9tait la fille de Edward George Driver et de Dame Agnes Vickers, et avait sept fr\u00e8res et trois s\u0153urs.\nComme cons\u00e9quence de cet accident, une action a \u00e9t\u00e9 institu\u00e9e contre la compagnie d\u00e9fenderesse-intim\u00e9e, dans laquelle le p\u00e8re a r\u00e9clam\u00e9 personnellement la somme de $23,376.19; la m\u00e8re $7,376.19; et le p\u00e8re en sa qualit\u00e9 de tuteur \u00e0 ses dix enfants mineurs $4,752.37, le tout formant un total de $35,504.75.\nLa cause a \u00e9t\u00e9 inscrite devant un jury qui a accord\u00e9 la somme de $13,249.50 qu'il a attribu\u00e9e ainsi: Au p\u00e8re Edward George Driver, en sa qualit\u00e9 de tuteur \u00e0 ses enfants mineurs $4,006; au p\u00e8re Edward George Driver personnellement $4,621.75; et \u00e0 la m\u00e8re Agnes Vickers Driver $4,621.75. M. le Juge J. P. Charbonneau de la Cour sup\u00e9rieure a confirm\u00e9 ce verdict du jury.\nLa Cour du banc de la reine2 a maintenu l'appel de la compagnie Coca-Cola Ltd. et a ordonn\u00e9 un nouveau proc\u00e8s, \u00e0 moins que les demandeurs ne consentent \u00e0 accepter dans un d\u00e9lai d\u00e9termin\u00e9, la somme de $2,487 \u00e0 \u00eatre ainsi divis\u00e9e: $1,000 \u00e0 la m\u00e8re Agnes Vickers et $1,487 au p\u00e8re Edward George Driver. La Cour a \u00e9t\u00e9 d'opinion que les montants accord\u00e9s aux p\u00e8re et m\u00e8re \u00e9taient excessifs, et que le p\u00e8re en sa qualit\u00e9 de tuteur \u00e0 ses enfants mineurs ne pouvait en droit exercer aucune r\u00e9clamation. M. le Juge Casey, dissident en partie, a partag\u00e9 l'opinion de l'honorable Juge en chef Galipeault et de M. le Juge Choquette concernant la r\u00e9clamation du p\u00e8re, en sa qualit\u00e9 de tuteur, qu'il trouve non fond\u00e9e, mais n'a pas cru devoir r\u00e9duire les montants accord\u00e9s aux p\u00e8re et m\u00e8re personnellement.\nLa question de responsabilit\u00e9 ne se pose pas. Les p\u00e8re et m\u00e8re r\u00e9clament non seulement en vertu de l'art. 1056 du Code Civil, mais all\u00e8guent \u00e9galement qu'ils sont, avec les enfants survivants, les h\u00e9ritiers l\u00e9gaux de l'enfant d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9e, et que de ce chef, ils peuvent exercer tous les droits qui faisaient partie du patrimoine de Beverley Driver.\nJe dois dire en premier lieu que les p\u00e8re et m\u00e8re peuvent s\u00fbrement exercer un recours en vertu de l'art. 1056 C.C. Cet article se lit ainsi:\nArt. 1056. Dans tous les cas o\u00f9 la partie contre qui le d\u00e9lit ou quasi-d\u00e9lit a \u00e9t\u00e9 commis d\u00e9c\u00e8de en cons\u00e9quence, sans avoir obtenu indemnit\u00e9 ou satisfaction, son conjoint, ses ascendants et ses descendants ont, pendant l'ann\u00e9e seulement \u00e0 compter du d\u00e9c\u00e8s, droit de poursuivre celui qui en est l'auteur ou ses repr\u00e9sentants, pour les dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats r\u00e9sultant de tel d\u00e9c\u00e8s.\nCet article accorde donc une action dans le cas de d\u00e9c\u00e8s au conjoint, aux ascendants et aux descendants seulement, et il refuse implicitement ce m\u00eame droit aux fr\u00e8res et s\u0153urs. Il est clairement limitatif et restreint, en cons\u00e9quence, la port\u00e9e et l'\u00e9tendue de l'art. 1053. De plus, il ne donne aux personnes qui y sont mentionn\u00e9es que le droit aux dommages que ces m\u00eame personnes ont soufferts comme cons\u00e9quence du d\u00e9c\u00e8s de la victime. Regent Taxi and Transport Co. v. La Congr\u00e9gation des Fr\u00e8res Maristes3. Evidemment, la situation pourrait \u00eatre diff\u00e9rente, si la victime n'\u00e9tait pas morte. Car, comme il a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cid\u00e9 dans cette cause de Regent Taxi, supra, le mot \u00abautrui\u00bb \u00e0 l'art. 1053 ne signifie pas seulement la victime imm\u00e9diate d'un d\u00e9lit ou d'un quasi-d\u00e9lit, mais aussi toute personne qui, comme cons\u00e9quence d'un tort caus\u00e9 \u00e0 une autre, souffre un dommage. Mais, tel n'est pas le cas qui nous occupe, vu que la victime est d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9e comme cons\u00e9quence de l'accident.\nC'est donc avec raison, je crois, que la Cour du banc de la reine a accord\u00e9 aux p\u00e8re et m\u00e8re de la victime chacun $1,000, plus les frais fun\u00e9raires, dommages qui leur ont \u00e9t\u00e9 occasionn\u00e9s par la mort de leur enfant, mais qu'elle a refus\u00e9 la r\u00e9clamation des fr\u00e8res et s\u0153urs, qui sont exclus de cet art. 1056 C.C.\nMais, disent les appelants, le p\u00e8re, la m\u00e8re et les enfants, sont les h\u00e9ritiers de la succession \"ab intestat\" de la d\u00e9funte, en vertu de l'art. 626 C.C, et comme tels, ils peuvent exercer les droits et les recours en dommages dont la victime \u00e9tait titulaire. Ils auraient \u00e9t\u00e9, par l'op\u00e9ration de l'art. 607 C.C, saisis des droits et actions de la d\u00e9funte. Cet art. 607 est r\u00e9dig\u00e9 dans les termes suivants:\n607. Les h\u00e9ritiers l\u00e9gitimes, lorsqu'ils succ\u00e8dent, sont saisis de plein droit des biens, droits et actions du d\u00e9funt, sous l'obligation d'acquitter toutes les charges de la succession.\nIls pourraient en cons\u00e9quence r\u00e9clamer pour douleurs et souffrances physiques, et pour la perte de la vie de la victime, une somme substantielle, droit dont Beverley Driver \u00e9tait personnellement investie durant sa vie. Il importe en premier lieu de nous demander si les souffrances et douleurs support\u00e9es par la victime, et le droit de poursuivre pour la perte de la vie, \u00e9taient des r\u00e9clamations qui existaient dans le patrimoine de la d\u00e9funte au moment de son d\u00e9c\u00e8s, et s'il s'agit de biens transmissibles ou non \u00e0 ses h\u00e9ritiers. Nous serions en pr\u00e9sence, selon les appelants, non pas d'une r\u00e9clamation post mortem, mais bien d'une r\u00e9clamation ante mortem, transmise aux h\u00e9ritiers l\u00e9gaux.\nLa r\u00e8gle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale veut que les h\u00e9ritiers soient investis du patrimoine du d\u00e9funt, c'est-\u00e0-dire de l'ensemble de ses droits et de ses obligations, appr\u00e9ciables en argent, dont le de cujus \u00e9tait titulaire. La totalit\u00e9 de ces biens constitue une universalit\u00e9 juridique. Entrent seuls dans le patrimoine les biens qui ont une valeur \u00e9conomique, et ceux-l\u00e0 sont les biens patrimoniaux et sont \u00e9videmment transmissibles aux h\u00e9ritiers.\nD'autre part, il existe des droits extra-patrimoniaux qui n'ont une valeur p\u00e9cuniaire que pour leur titulaire, et par cons\u00e9quent ne sont pas transmissibles. Ils s'\u00e9teignent avec la mort et ne font pas partie du corps ou de la masse de la succession qui s'ouvre. On peut v\u00e9ritablement dire que les biens pour lesquels le titulaire ne pouvait r\u00e9clamer en son vivant, ne font pas partie de la succession, et il s'ensuit logiquement que l'h\u00e9ritier ne peut en \u00eatre saisi.\nLes appelants ont cit\u00e9 deux jugements rendus par la Cour du banc de la reine pour appuyer leur pr\u00e9tention \u00e0 l'effet qu'ils ont droit de r\u00e9clamer comme h\u00e9ritiers pour les peines et souffrances endur\u00e9es par leur enfant d\u00e9funte, ainsi que pour l'abr\u00e8gement et la perte de sa vie survenue pr\u00e9matur\u00e9ment.\nLa premi\u00e8re de ces causes est celle de Green v. Elmhurst Dairy Ltd.4, o\u00f9 le jug\u00e9 est r\u00e9dig\u00e9 dans les termes suivants:\nThe right to recover damages for pain and suffering and for loss of enjoyment of life resulting from bodily injuries is a right of action which is transmissible to the heirs of the victim under article 607 C.C.\nC'est M. le Juge Casey qui a \u00e9crit les raisons du jugement, et \u00e0 son opinion se sont ralli\u00e9s M. le Juge en chef Galipeault ainsi que MM. les Juges St-Jacques, McDougall et Rinfret. Voici ce que dit M. le Juge Casey \u00e0 la page 89:\nThere is no doubt that the claim for the items of pain and suffering and loss of life expectancy were personal to the victim. It may even be said that they were exclusively attached to the person within the meaning of C.C. 1031 and that the right to claim for these damages could not have been exercised by her creditors. But this does not mean that they were not transmissible. We have been referred by defendants to several decisions of this Court as well as the other Courts of this Province but with all respect I find these decisions completely beside the point. Thus, in the case of Smith v. Pelletier (1942 K.B. 664), the point was whether minor children could, as heirs, and altogether apart from their recourse under C.C. 1056, claim for the medical expenses incurred by their father prior to his death. It is true that at page 668 Mr. Justice Pr\u00e9vost says:\n\"Les dommages dans sa personne, c'est la mutilation de son corps, l'alt\u00e9ration de sa sant\u00e9 ou de ses forces, l'invalidit\u00e9 permanente, totale ou partielle qui en r\u00e9sulte, les souffrances physiques, etc. Ces dommages sont conditionn\u00e9s par la survie de la victime. A la mort les souffrances et les infirmit\u00e9s prennent fin. Ces chefs de dommages si intimement li\u00e9s \u00e0 la personne de la victime disparaissent avec elle, et se trouvent par le fait m\u00eame intransmissibles de leur nature.\" But with all respect I do not think that too much importance should be attached to this statement. In the first place, it was not necessary for the decision of the case, and secondly it is not supported by authority.\nDans une seconde cause de L\u00e9vesque v. Malinosky5, la Cour du banc de la reine a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 (MM. les Juges Bissonnette, Hyde et Owen) que:\nThe victim had a claim for pain and suffering he endured from the date of his accident to the date of his death and this claim was transmissible to the heir. On the same basis, the victim's claim for shortening of life was also transmissible.\nM. le Juge Bissonnette \u00e9tait dissident en partie. Cette dissidence ne portait pas sur le fond m\u00eame de la question, mais sur un item de dommages fond\u00e9 sur la perte d'un revenu annuel.\nDans la pr\u00e9sente cause, M. le Juge Casey dit qu'il est all\u00e9 trop loin, si son jugement dans la cause de Elmhurst doit \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 comme voulant dire qu'il a maintenu la pr\u00e9tention que l'abr\u00e8gement de la vie donne naissance \u00e0 une r\u00e9clamation qui n'est pas limit\u00e9e \u00e0 la victime imm\u00e9diate, mais qui est aussi transmissible aux h\u00e9ritiers de cette derni\u00e8re.\nDe son c\u00f4t\u00e9, M. le Juge en chef Galipeault s'exprime ainsi:\nQuelles que soient les expressions employ\u00e9es dans les proc\u00e9dures, dans le jugement, ou dans d'autres d\u00e9cisions rapport\u00e9es, il est bien certain que la r\u00e9clamation est tout simplement pour perte de vie.\nC'est comme h\u00e9ritiers de la victime d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9e que les demandeurs ont r\u00e9clam\u00e9 $8,000.00 en vertu de la question 7 ci-dessus, soutenant que Beverley Driver a laiss\u00e9 dans sa succession cette somme de $8,000.00 qui a augment\u00e9 son patrimoine.\nM. le Juge Choquette a concouru dans les vues exprim\u00e9es par M. le Juge Casey. Et le jugement de la Cour contient un consid\u00e9rant \u00e0 l'effet que la r\u00e9clamation des h\u00e9ritiers pour la perte de la vie de la victime ne faisait pas partie du patrimoine de cette derni\u00e8re. Il se lit ainsi:\nCONSIDERANT que la somme de $8,000.00 r\u00e9clam\u00e9e par les h\u00e9ritiers leur a \u00e9t\u00e9 accord\u00e9e sans droit.\nJe m'accorde avec M. le Juge en chef Galipeault, et je crois de plus que dans notre jurisprudence et dans les \u00e9crits de certains de nos auteurs, des expressions impr\u00e9cises ont \u00e9t\u00e9 employ\u00e9es, et qu'une certaine confusion existe entre les mots \u00ababr\u00e8gement de la vie\u00bb et \u00abperte de la vie\u00bb. Les deux, cependant, ne produisent pas les m\u00eames cons\u00e9quences l\u00e9gales.\nJe comprends tr\u00e8s bien, et ceci ne peut \u00eatre s\u00e9rieusement contest\u00e9, qu'une personne victime d'un accident ait une r\u00e9clamation en justice, lorsque sa condition fait na\u00eetre la triste perspective d'avoir devant elle une vie abr\u00e9g\u00e9e, de tramer une existence mis\u00e9rable, remplie d'infirmit\u00e9s, de douleurs physiques, et d'angoisse et d'inqui\u00e9tudes morales. C'est sur cela que peut et doit reposer, si la preuve le justifie, une r\u00e9clamation en dommages comme celle qui est soumise \u00e0 notre consid\u00e9ration, car alors, un droit, appr\u00e9ciable en argent, a pris naissance, et fait partie du patrimoine de la victime suivant les dispositions de l'art. 607 du Code Civil.\nPersonne ne peut \u00eatre l'auteur de pareilles infortunes, sans \u00eatre tenu de payer une compensation proportionn\u00e9e au tort qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 caus\u00e9 par sa propre n\u00e9gligence. Cette source de dommages cependant ne doit pas \u00eatre confondue avec le Solatium Doloris, qui serait une compensation p\u00e9cuniaire pour la d\u00e9tresse morale ou la douleur \u00e9prouv\u00e9e par une personne pour la perte d'un \u00eatre cher. Un tel recours n'existe pas dans notre droit.\nMais si la douleur physique, l'abr\u00e8gement de la vie et l'anxi\u00e9t\u00e9 qui en r\u00e9sulte, constituent un s\u00e9rieux \u00e9l\u00e9ment de dommages, encore faut-il que la victime en ait ressenti les effets en son vivant, que le droit soit n\u00e9 avant sa mort.\nJe ne crois pas que l'on trouve dans la pr\u00e9sente cause les \u00e9l\u00e9ments n\u00e9cessaires pour justifier la r\u00e9clamation des h\u00e9ritiers. La victime est d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9e presque instantan\u00e9ment. A-t-elle souffert physiquement et moralement? A-t-elle \u00e9prouv\u00e9 cette douleur et cette angoisse que je signalais tout \u00e0 l'heure? Nous n'en savons rien, et nous ne savons m\u00eame pas si, apr\u00e8s avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 frapp\u00e9e par le camion de l'intim\u00e9e, elle avait encore sa connaissance lorsque l'ambulance l'a conduite \u00e0 l'h\u00f4pital.\nIl n'est pas \u00e9tabli que ces \u00e9l\u00e9ments essentiels de dommages ont jamais fait partie du patrimoine de la victime, et les h\u00e9ritiers en cons\u00e9quence ne peuvent en \u00eatre investis. Il r\u00e9sulterait donc, comme le dit le Juge en chef Galipeault, une r\u00e9clamation que veulent exercer les h\u00e9ritiers pour la perte de la vie de Beverley Driver. Je suis clairement d'opinion que la victime n'a jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 titulaire de ce droit qui n'a pas pu \u00eatre transmis. Elle ne pouvait s\u00fbrement pas poursuivre pour la perte de sa propre vie.\nMignault, vol. 5, p. 379, partage ces vues et s'exprime ainsi:\nLe recours en dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats, dans le cas de d\u00e9c\u00e8s de la victime, ne fait pas partie de sa succession, et il ne peut \u00eatre exerc\u00e9 par les h\u00e9ritiers de la victime, par exemple, ses fr\u00e8res et s\u0153urs; il ne peut \u00eatre exerc\u00e9 que par les parents indiqu\u00e9s \u00e0 l'article 1056 du code civil, de leur chef personnel, pour le tort qu'ils \u00e9prouvent;\nDans une cause de C.P.R. v. Robinson6, les remarques du Juge Taschereau \u00e0 la page 321 sont tr\u00e8s au point, et elles ont \u00e9t\u00e9 approuv\u00e9es par Ritchie C.J. et par MM. les Juges Gwynne et Patterson. Il disait ceci:\nOf course her action (that is, the widow's) was not transmitted to her by the deceased. He never had an action for damages resulting from his own death. And her action is different in this, that she claims the damages resulting from his death whilst he would have claimed the damages resulting from the injury to himself; in other words, he would have claimed his damages whilst she claims her own damages.\nIl est vrai que ce jugement de Robinson, supra, a \u00e9t\u00e9 modifi\u00e9 par le Comit\u00e9 judiciaire7, mais l'appel fut maintenu sur des points diff\u00e9rents, de sorte que l'opinion de notre Cour sur cette question demeure d\u00e9finitive.\nDans leur factum et \u00e0 l'argument, les appelants ont cit\u00e9 de nombreuses autorit\u00e9s anglaises, mais je ne crois pas qu'elles puissent nous \u00e9clairer. Elles ne servent qu'\u00e0 d\u00e9montrer les h\u00e9sitations jurisprudentielles en Angleterre et dans les autres pays, mais qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 finalement d\u00e9termin\u00e9es par des lois sp\u00e9ciales. Comme mon coll\u00e8gue M. le Juge Cartwright, je crois qu'elles ne peuvent lier les tribunaux de la province de Qu\u00e9bec, o\u00f9 il existe un syst\u00e8me de droit complet par lui-m\u00eame. Desrosiers v. The King8.\nIl r\u00e9sulte donc que dans la pr\u00e9sente cause, les h\u00e9ritiers ne peuvent r\u00e9clamer. Je m'accorde cependant avec le juge au proc\u00e8s, et la Cour du banc de la reine, qui ont maintenu qu'en leur qualit\u00e9 de p\u00e8re et m\u00e8re, les appelants pouvaient exercer une r\u00e9clamation sous l'art. 1056 du Code Civil, non pas comme h\u00e9ritiers d'un droit faisant partie du patrimoine de la d\u00e9funte, mais pour les dommages qui leur ont \u00e9t\u00e9 caus\u00e9s personnellement. La Cour du banc de la reine a substantiellement r\u00e9duit le montant qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 accord\u00e9 par le jury, et je crois qu'elle a eu raison de le faire. Ce montant \u00e9tait exag\u00e9r\u00e9, disproportionn\u00e9 aux dommages subis par les parents de Beverley Driver, et le montant de $1,000 accord\u00e9 au p\u00e8re et $1,000 \u00e0 la m\u00e8re, plus les frais fun\u00e9raires, est une ample compensation pour le dommage subi.\nComme on l'a dit d\u00e9j\u00e0, il est difficile d'appr\u00e9cier les dommages qui r\u00e9sultent aux parents de la perte de la vie d'un enfant. Mais, la jurisprudence veut qu'aucun solatium doloris ne soit accord\u00e9. Daly v. McFarlane9; Town of Montreal West v. Hough10; Bouchard v. Gauthier11.\nLes dommages doivent n\u00e9cessairement \u00eatre susceptibles d'une \u00e9valuation p\u00e9cuniaire. Toute appr\u00e9ciation math\u00e9matique est impossible, mais doivent \u00eatre accord\u00e9s les frais fun\u00e9raires et une compensation raisonnable pour la perte de soutien et des esp\u00e9rances de b\u00e9n\u00e9fices futurs, que les parents pouvaient attendre de leur enfant d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9e. De plus, comme l'a bien dit M. le Juge Dorion dans la cause de Hunter v. Gingras12:\nPeut-\u00eatre faudrait-il admettre comme base de dommages la perturbation apport\u00e9e dans la vie d'un p\u00e8re de famille par la mort d'un enfant, la perte de l'une de ces joies du foyer et d'une part du. bonheur, qui constituent la r\u00e9compense des sacrifices que co\u00fbte l'\u00e9ducation d'un enfant.\nLe difficile est de fixer un chiffre qui ne soit pas d\u00e9risoire pour pareille compensation et qui ne soit pas trop \u00e9lev\u00e9 pour des accidents o\u00f9 la fragilit\u00e9 humaine a tant de part, et d'o\u00f9 toute id\u00e9e de vindicte doit \u00eatre bannie.\nSi l'on s'en tient \u00e0 la perte purement p\u00e9cuniaire, il est bien difficile d'\u00e9valuer en chiffres l'espoir des parents qu'une enfant de neuf ans leur rendra plus tard de services. Ne vaut-il pas mieux revenir \u00e0 l'ancienne jurisprudence et consid\u00e9rer qu'un enfant, qui a cet \u00e2ge, a co\u00fbt\u00e9 tant de soins, repr\u00e9sente un actif, un appui moral, dont la perte n'est pas sans influence sur la sant\u00e9, le courage ou l'activit\u00e9 de ceux qui l'ont subie.\nDans la m\u00eame cause, M. le Juge Martin s'exprime ainsi:\nIt is manifestly difficult to arrive at an exact conclusion in valuing this asset. One can imagine cases where many contingencies might arise where the child would be of little or no financial benefit and perhaps become a liability to be sustained by the parent, but we have to appreciate these matters in the ordinary run of human lives, and I should say, having regard to the circumstances of this case, that a sum of $500.00 over and above the amount awarded by the judgment appealed from, would be fair and just compensation, and I would maintain the appeal and increase the condemnation by that sum, with costs against the respondent here and below.\nUne nombreuse jurisprudence a \u00e9t\u00e9 cit\u00e9e portant sur le montant de dommages qui doit \u00eatre accord\u00e9 aux parents pour la perte d'un enfant. Malgr\u00e9 qu'il s'agisse de cas isol\u00e9s, il r\u00e9sulte de tous ces jugements qu'il faut bien se garder d'accorder des montants exag\u00e9r\u00e9s. Je dois donc conclure que le p\u00e8re et la m\u00e8re pouvaient r\u00e9clamer en vertu de l'art. 1056 C.C., mais que pas plus que leurs enfants, ils ne pouvaient r\u00e9clamer comme h\u00e9ritiers. Je suis aussi d'opinion que le montant accord\u00e9 aux parents par la Cour du banc de la reine est raisonnable.\nL'appel doit donc \u00eatre rejet\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens, si r\u00e9clam\u00e9s, mais avec une l\u00e9g\u00e8re modification: c'est que l'option accord\u00e9e aux demandeurs de choisir entre un nouveau proc\u00e8s ou d'accepter la somme de $2,487, devra \u00eatre exerc\u00e9e non pas dans les trente jours depuis la date du jugement de la Cour du banc de la reine, mais dans les soixante jours de la date o\u00f9 le pr\u00e9sent jugement est rendu.\nCartwright J. (dissenting in part):\u2014The relevant facts and the questions raised on this appeal are set out in the reasons of my brother Taschereau. I wish to add only one observation as to the facts, that is as to the length of time that Beverley Driver survived the happening of the accident. In the factum of the appellants it is stated that \"she was taken to three different hospitals in an endeavour to save her life; nevertheless she died later in the same day\". In the factum of the respondent it is said: \"Beverley Driver died a few hours after the accident\".\nAs to the claim of the parents of Beverley for damages pursuant to art. 1056 of the Civil Code, for the reasons given by my brother Taschereau I agree with his conclusion that we ought not to interfere with the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench13 on this branch of the case.\nThe remaining issue arises out of the answer of the jury to the seventh question submitted to them which was:\nDid Beverley Driver suffer any damages for the shortening of her life expectancy, and in the affirmative state at what amount you assess these damages? To this the jury answered \"Yes\" and assessed the damages at $8,000. The learned trial judge in affirming the verdict of the jury dealt with this item as follows:\nThere remains the last item of $8,000.00 determined by the jurors as the amount of damages suffered by Beverley Driver for the shortening of her life expectancy, to which amount the Plaintiffs would be entitled as her heirs at law (C.C. Article 626).\nDuring the course of this trial, the undersigned considered, and still considers that he is bound by the decisions of the Court of Queen's Bench, sitting in Appeal in the cases of Green v, Elmhurst Dairy reported at 1953 Q.B., p. 85 and Levesque v. Malinosky 1956 Q.B., p. 351, in which cases it was decided that damages for pain and suffering and for loss of enjoyment of life, or shortening of life expectancy resulting from bodily injuries gave a right of action to the victim, which right was transmissible to its heirs, and that this right was separate and distinct from that which could be exercised under Article 1056 of the Civil Code.\nApplying the law as thus determined, the sum of $8,000.00 found by the jurors as damages suffered by the victim, then aged eight years, for the loss of all the years of life ahead of her, should be allotted to her heirs in proportion to their respective rights.\nThe members of the Court of Queen's Bench were unanimous in reversing the judgment of the learned trial judge on this item, which is dealt with in the formal judgment in the following terms:\nCONSID\u00c9RANT qu'en l'esp\u00e8ce, les demandeurs n'ont aucun recours en droit comme h\u00e9ritiers de Beverley Driver, la perte de vie de cette derni\u00e8re n'ayant en rien accru son patrimoine ou sa succession, de sorte que du chef de son d\u00e9c\u00e8s, elle n'a pu rien transmettre \u00e0 ses h\u00e9ritiers;\nCONSID\u00c9RANT que la somme de $8,000.00 r\u00e9clam\u00e9e par les h\u00e9ritiers leur a \u00e9t\u00e9 accord\u00e9e sans droit;\nThe primary questions of law raised by these conflicting views are, (i) whether by the law of Quebec the victim of a delict or quasi-delict has a right of action for damages for the prospective shortening of his own life due to the fault of the defendant, and (ii) if so whether the heirs of the victim who dies before action brought can assert that right of action pursuant to art. 607 of the Civil Code.\nWhile I do not rest my opinion on any supposed admission made by counsel, I did understand counsel for the respondent to take the position that if, contrary to his submission, the victim had such a right of action that right could be exercised by his heirs and that he disclaimed any suggestion that the maxim actio personalis moritur cum persona was applicable. We had the assistance not only of full and able argument but of elaborate factums. A consideration of these and of the authorities referred to has brought me to the conclusion that the learned trial judge was right in his view that these questions of law were decided by the Court of Queen's Bench in Green v. Elmhurst Dairy Ltd.14 and in L\u00e9vesque v. Malinosky15. I am further of opinion that the judgments in those two cases correctly state the law.\nIn Green v. Elmhurst Dairy Ltd., the plaintiffs' mother, who was 67 years of age, suffered bodily injuries on October 3, 1950, caused, as it was claimed, by the fault of the defendant, as a result of which she died three days later. The plaintiffs as the heirs of their mother brought action for damages and in their declaration claimed, inter alia, $500 for pain and suffering endured by the deceased and $3,500 for the shortening of her life expectancy. Batshaw J. maintaining a partial inscription in law struck from the claim these two figures and the paragraphs on which they were based. The Court of Queen's Bench in a unanimous judgment allowed the appeal of the plaintiffs and restored the two items and the paragraphs on which they were founded.\nIn the notes of Casey J., with whom Galipeault C.J. agreed, we find the following:\nAt page 87:\nParagraphs 10 to 14 contain a recital of the facts upon which is based the assertion that the mother, had she sued, would have been entitled to $500 for pain and suffering and $3,500 for the shortening of her life expectancy. As the learned trial Judge struck these two figures from the claim he was obliged to strike the paragraphs upon which they were based.\nAt pages 88 and 89:\nIn disposing of this appeal one must bear in mind that plaintiffs have invoked in one suit at least two separate rights of action; as descendant relations of the victim they claim under C.C. 1056 the items mentioned in par. 85; in addition, as legal heirs, under C.C. 607 they exercise the right of action which their mother could have exercised during her lifetime, i.e. the right to claim from defendants the sum of S500 and $3,500 mentioned in paragraphs 15c and 15d.\nDefendants object to the latter claim, urging in substance that it is purely personal to the deceased and could not have been transmitted to her legal heirs; and that in claiming under C.C. 1056 as well as under C.C. 607, plaintiffs were asking for the same damages, as is stated in the defendant's factum. There is no doubt that the claim for the items of pain and suffering and loss of life expectancy were personal to the victim. It may even be said that they were exclusively attached to the person within the meaning of C.C. 1031 and that the right to claim for these damages could not have been exercised by her creditors. But this does not mean that they were not transmissible.\nThe learned judge proceeded to refer to a number of decided cases and continued at page 90:\nWe must start with the premise that the generality of C.C. 607, couched as it is in the widest terms, is restricted only when we find the victim in possession of rights of action which by their very nature are incapable of being transmitted. The only rights of action not transmitted under 607 are the ones which cannot possibly survive the person who possessed or enjoyed them.\nAt pages 90 and 91:\nIt is well established that the victim of the accident may claim compensation for pain and suffering and for the loss of enjoyment of life, whenever these heads of damages arise as a consequence of the bodily injuries which he has suffered. This type of damage is generally referred to as \"moral\" as opposed to \"material\" of which examples would be loss of earning power or loss of a particular profit or gain. It is accepted that the right of the victim to claim for these \"material\" damages is transmissible. It is only with respect to the \"moral\" damages that we find differences of opinion based on distinctions of which Demolombe at least was unaware.\nThe learned Judge continued with a careful review of the statements of a number of authors and as a result expressed the following conclusion at page 94:\nOn the whole, I am unable to find any authority for excluding from the operation of C.C. 607 the right of action possessed by plaintiff's mother and which they are now attempting to enforce. I can find no reason for saying that while we must admit the transmissibility of the right to claim for the \"material\" damages arising out of bodily injuries, we must deny this character to the right to claim for those called \"moral\". In consequence, I would accept as applicable and in so far as heirs are concerned, as an accurate statement of our law, the following passage taken from par. 1902 (Mazeaud):\nAucune raison de principe ne s'oppose \u00e0 la transmissibilit\u00e9 de l'action en responsabilit\u00e9. Rien dans la nature g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de cette action ne l'emp\u00eache de se transmettre comme se transmettent en principe toutes les actions dans notre droit. L'action est un \u00e9l\u00e9ment du patrimoine de son titulaire, transmissible comme les autres \u00e9l\u00e9ments.\nOn peut alors poser en r\u00e8gle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale que l'action en responsabilit\u00e9 qui appartient \u00e0 la victime peut passer \u00e0 ses ayants cause, qu'elle peut \u00eatre ainsi exerc\u00e9e par ses h\u00e9ritiers ou par ses cr\u00e9anciers ou par un cessionnaire.\nFor these reasons I arrive at the conclusion that the right of action possessed by the plaintiffs' mother is not excluded from the rule of C.C. 607. That being so, they can claim what she could have claimed, and I would set aside the judgment a quo to restore to plaintiffs'. declaration certain paragraphs and to restore to the conclusion par. 1 as originally drawn. Every judgment must, of course, be read in the light of the subject-matter with which the Court was occupied, and in all that is quoted above Casey J. was dealing with the question whether the claims by the heirs of the deceased for damages for pain and suffering suffered by her and for the shortening of her life expectancy were maintainable in law.\nSt. Jacques J., agreeing, in the result, dealt mainly with the question whether rights conferred by art. 1053 could be asserted in one action with those conferred by art. 1056 and concluded that they could.\nStuart McDougall J. agreed with both St. Jacques J. and Casey J.\nRinfret J. agreed with both St. Jacques J. and Casey J. and said at page 98:\nJ'ai eu l'avantage de lire les notes de mes coll\u00e8gues les hon. juges St-Jacques et Casey; elles satisfont mon sens de justice et d'\u00e9quit\u00e9: la conclusion \u00e0 laquelle ils en arrivent fait dispara\u00eetre une anomalie qui m'a toujours frapp\u00e9, en vertu de laquelle l'auteur d'un d\u00e9lit ou d'un quasi-d\u00e9lit s'en tirait \u00e0 meilleur compte, si la victime d\u00e9c\u00e9dait par suite d'un accident au lieu d'\u00eatre simplement bless\u00e9e.\nJe ne vois pas la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 d'\u00e9crire des notes additionnelles: celles de l'hon. juge Casey repassent de fa\u00e7on compl\u00e8te et coordonn\u00e9e la jurisprudence et la doctrine sur le point en litige, et je ne ferais que r\u00e9p\u00e9ter la distinction qu'il soumet \u00e0 la suite de Mazeaud, entre la r\u00e9paration d'un pr\u00e9judice moral, d'un c\u00f4t\u00e9, et la r\u00e9paration d'un pr\u00e9judice corporel qui, lui, peut \u00eatre d'ordre mat\u00e9riel ou d'ordre moral,\u2014ces derniers \u00e9tant transmissibles tandis que les autres ne le sont pas.\nIt appears to me that the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench in the case at bar brings back the very anomaly the disappearance of which was approved by Rinfret J. in the passage last quoted.\nIn Levesque v. Malinosky, the facts were similar to those in Green v. Elmhurst. The plaintiff's father, aged seventy-six years, was struck by a taxi belonging to the defendant and died four days later. The plaintiff as sole testamentary heir brought an action claiming, inter alia, the following items of damages:\n(a) Pain and suffering endured by the father from the date of the accident to the date of death ........................$ 1,000\n(b) Shortening of father's life ................................ 5,000\n(c) Father's loss of annual revenue of $8,500 during 9.1 years of normal life expectancy .................................. 77,208\n(d) Plaintiff's loss of an annual revenue of $5,000 for 9.1 years on professional work which he would have received from clients referred to him by his late father if the latter had lived out its normal life expectancy ...................... 45,000 On a partial inscription in law the Superior Court struck out all four of these items. The Court of Queen's Bench allowed the plaintiff's appeal in part and restored items (a) and (b). The formal judgment of the majority as to these items reads as follows:\nConsidering that the victim had a claim for the pain and suffering he endured from the date of the accident to the date of his death and that this claim was transmissible to his heir so that item a should not have been struck out;\nConsidering that on the same basis the victim's claim for shortening of life was also transmissible to his heir and that item b should not have been struck out;\nand that of Bisonnette J. as follows:\nConsid\u00e9rant que de l'abr\u00e9gement de la vie na\u00eet un droit susceptible de compensation p\u00e9cuniaire que la victime peut r\u00e9clamer \u00e0 l'auteur du d\u00e9lit, droit qui est un bien patrimonial que recueille l'h\u00e9ritier, continuateur de la personne du de cujus;\nAs to the items (a) and (b) the members of the Court, Bissonnette, Hyde and Owen JJ. were unanimous.\nAt pages 363 and 364 Owen J. says:\nIt must be kept in mind that the basis of claims by the heir or legatee, such as we are now considering, is the damages suffered during his lifetime by the de cujus not the damages suffered subsequently by the heir or legatee. Under Quebec law the heir or legatee is not entitled to claim any damages he suffers personally as a result of the death of the de cujus unless he falls within the list of persons contained in art. 1056 C.C.\nIn the circumstances, and after much hesitation, I have come to the conclusion that the best practical solution is to lay down the general rule that the right which the de cujus had prior to his death to claim damages resulting from an offence or quasi-offence, including all items which are properly part of such claims, is transmissible in toto by succession.\nAccordingly, I am of the opinion that the late Victor L\u00e9vesque, father of the plaintiff, at the time of his death, as the result of the alleged offence or quasi-offence, had the right to claim from defendants damages for (a) pain and suffering; (b) shortening of life; (c) loss of earnings, which he suffered from the date of the accident to the date of his death, that he had not waived this right, that the right to claim each of these items was transmissible and that as universal legatee plaintiff is entitled to claim these three items from defendants.\nIt will be observed that the last paragraph quoted is a clear decision on two points, (i) that the deceased at the time of his death had the right to claim damages for shortening of life and (ii) that such right was transmissible. If that decision is correct it is decisive of the question which I am now considering. With the greatest respect I am unable to find in the reasons of the Court of Queen's Bench in the case at bar, a sufficient ground for rejecting the decision in Levesque v. Malinosky.\nThe words of art. 1053 of the Civil Code are wide enough to embrace all damage caused to another by the fault of the defendant. It appears to me that the infliction of physical injury which cuts short the period during which the injured person had a normal expectation of living a reasonably happy life gives rise to a claim for damage which the injured person can assert. This view is, I think, supported by the authors referred to by counsel for the apellants. I refer particularly to Mazeaud & Tunc, Trait\u00e9 th\u00e9orique et pratique de la responsibilit\u00e9 civile et d\u00e9lictuelle, 5th ed. 1956, vol. 2, nos. 1912 and 1913; and to Planiol et Ripert, Trait\u00e9 pratique de droit civil francais, 2nd ed. 1952, vol. 6 \u00abLes Obligations\u00bb, no. 658, n. 4.\nOn this point the underlying principles of the English common law do not appear to me to differ from those embodied in art. 1053 of the Civil Code. In both systems, generally speaking, the wrong-doer is liable to the person whom he has injured for all damages resulting directly from the injury inflicted. The reasoning of the Courts in England in the cases of Flint v. Lovell16, Rose v. Ford17 and Benham v. Gambling18, appears to me to support the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench in Levesque v. Malinosky. I refer to these decisions, as did counsel for the appellants, not as precedents binding upon the courts in a case arising under the Civil Code but because of what appears to me to be the clarity and cogency of their reasoning.\nThe nature of the claim I am now considering which, in my opinion, Beverley Driver was entitled to assert in her lifetime was for damages because the fault of the defendant had deprived her of the reasonable prospect of an uncertain number of years of life which the evidence as to the circumstances of her parents and their children permitted the jury to regard as likely to be, on balance, happy years. To place any exact pecuniary figure on such a deprivation is manifestly impossible, the task of assessment must be left to the good sense of the jury. The damages on this head are not awarded for the mental suffering caused by contemplating the prospective loss but for the loss of the years of life themselves. The numerous uncertainties arising in making an assessment can not necessitate the injured person going without a remedy.\nThere is, I think, a danger of confusing the concept of damages for shortening of life with that of damages for life being rendered less enjoyable. The latter could be suffered only while the injured person is alive but the former are increased rather than diminished by the acceleration of his death.\nFor the above reasons I have reached the conclusion that Green v. Elmhurst Dairy and L\u00e9vesque v. Malinosky were rightly decided and that in the case at bar Beverley Driver had in her lifetime a right of action for damages for the shortening of her life which was transmissible to her heirs; and I would allow the appeal to the extent necessary to give effect to this view.\nHaving reached this conclusion it would next be necessary to consider the arguments of counsel for the respondent that, if his other submissions were rejected, (i) the assessment of $8,000 was excessive and (ii) there was a duplication of damages. It might also be desirable to say something further as to the manner in which the tribunal of fact should proceed in assessing damages for the shortening of life. However, as the majority of this Court are of opinion that the appeal fails nothing would be gained by my pursuing these questions further or endeavouring to formulate the exact terms of the order which I think should be made.\nFauteux J.:\u2014Les faits et proc\u00e9dures conduisant \u00e0 cet appel sont expos\u00e9s aux raisons de notre coll\u00e8gue M. le Juge Taschereau. Bref, une fillette de huit ans d\u00e9c\u00e9dait le 19 septembre 1955, ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 heurt\u00e9e mortellement, le m\u00eame jour, par un camion appartenant \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e et conduit par l'un de ses employ\u00e9s, dans l'exercice de ses fonctions. Par la suite, les parents de la victime ont poursuivi l'intim\u00e9e en dommages.\nLa responsabilit\u00e9 de l'intim\u00e9e n'est plus en question. Seuls deux points ayant trait aux dommages r\u00e9clam\u00e9s font l'objet de cet appel. Le p\u00e8re et la m\u00e8re de l'enfant ont r\u00e9clam\u00e9, en vertu de l'art. 1056, comme dommages leur r\u00e9sultant du d\u00e9c\u00e8s de leur fillette, un montant de $5,000 en compensation de la perte d'assistance financi\u00e8re, des services domestiques et autres b\u00e9n\u00e9fices d'ordre similaire qu'ils pouvaient raisonnablement anticiper recevoir de l'enfant dans l'avenir. Le montant accord\u00e9, de ce chef, par le jury, a \u00e9t\u00e9 jug\u00e9 excessif par M. le Juge en chef Galipeault et M. le Juge Choquette, de la Cour d'Appel et, en cons\u00e9quence, r\u00e9duit par jugement de cette Cour1 \u00e0 la somme totale de $ 2,487. Le montant ainsi revis\u00e9 repr\u00e9sentant, dans les circonstances, une compensation raisonnable, ne saurait \u00eatre modifi\u00e9.\nLe p\u00e8re de l'enfant, tant personnellement qu'en sa qualit\u00e9 de tuteur \u00e0 ses dix autres enfants mineurs, et son \u00e9pouse, ont aussi, en leur qualit\u00e9 d'h\u00e9ritiers l\u00e9gaux de la jeune victime, r\u00e9clam\u00e9 une somme de $8,000 \u00e0 titre de dommages que l'enfant elle-m\u00eame aurait subis en raison de la perte de vie, devenant ainsi cr\u00e9anci\u00e8re d'un droit laiss\u00e9 par elle en son patrimoine.\nLe savant Juge de la Cour sup\u00e9rieure, se croyant li\u00e9 par les d\u00e9cisions rendues par la Cour d'Appel dans les causes de Green v. Elmhurst Dairy19 et L\u00e9vesque v. Malinosky20, confirma la d\u00e9cision du jury accordant, de ce chef, cette somme de $8,000. La Cour d'Appel consid\u00e9ra, comme, je crois, le Juge de premi\u00e8re instance, que nonobstant la vari\u00e9t\u00e9 des expressions utilis\u00e9es aux proc\u00e9dures pour d\u00e9signer ce chef de dommages, il s'agissait clairement d'une indemnit\u00e9 r\u00e9clam\u00e9e exclusivement pour perte actuelle de la vie; la Cour jugea, cependant, que la perte de vie n'ayant, per se, en rien accru le patrimoine ou la succession de la fillette, cette derni\u00e8re ne pouvait rien transmettre, de ce chef, \u00e0 ses h\u00e9ritiers. En cons\u00e9quence, elle rejeta comme mal fond\u00e9e en droit cette partie du recours des pr\u00e9sents appelants. Sur ce second point, la d\u00e9cision de la Cour d'Appel est unanime et est, je crois, comme d'ailleurs les motifs sur lesquels elle s'appuie, bien fond\u00e9e.\nSans doute et dans l'intervalle de temps, f\u00fbt-ce m\u00eame un seul instant de raison, s'\u00e9coulant entre le coup mortel et la mort qui s'ensuivit, on peut dire que la victime a \u00e9t\u00e9 nantie d'un droit \u00e0 la r\u00e9paration de tout pr\u00e9judice subi par elle en raison du quasi-d\u00e9lit commis \u00e0 son endroit. Encore faut-il, cependant, que le pr\u00e9judice dont la r\u00e9paration est demand\u00e9e ait \u00e9t\u00e9 actuellement souffert, et souffert par elle-m\u00eame. Le pr\u00e9judice invoqu\u00e9 au soutien de cette partie de la r\u00e9clamation ne satisfait pas \u00e0 ces conditions. Ayant \u00e0 d\u00e9cider le m\u00eame point, le tribunal de Toulouse, Trib. Civ. Toulouse, 17 avril 1902, S. 1905 2.81, a jug\u00e9 que si le de cujus avait eu le temps d'intenter l'action en dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats, celle-ci n'aurait \u00e9videmment eu pour objet que les dommages \u00e9prouv\u00e9s par le demandeur ant\u00e9rieurement \u00e0 son d\u00e9c\u00e8s et que ses h\u00e9ritiers ne sont pas recevables \u00e0 exercer une action qui n'a pu na\u00eetre du vivant de celui qu'ils repr\u00e9sentent.\nDes vues diff\u00e9rentes sont adopt\u00e9es par Mazeaud, Responsabilit\u00e9 d\u00e9lictuelle et contractuelle, tome 2, 4e \u00e9d., au no 1912, pp. 761 et 762, o\u00f9 il d\u00e9clare que la victime, du fait de son d\u00e9c\u00e8s, \u00e9prouve un dommage qui n'est pas post\u00e9rieur \u00e0 ce d\u00e9c\u00e8s, et qu'il lui en r\u00e9sulte une cr\u00e9ance transmissible \u00e0 ses h\u00e9ritiers. Le m\u00eame auteur, traitant au no 1923, p. 767, du droit d'action r\u00e9sultant de l'outrage \u00e0 la m\u00e9moire d'un mort, fait toutefois le raisonnement qui suit:\nUne fois morte, la personne est juridiquement disparue; elle est incapable d'\u00eatre l'objet d'un pr\u00e9judice, parce qu'elle ne peut plus \u00eatre sujet de droits ou d'obligations. L'outrage \u00e0 la m\u00e9moire d'un mort n'atteint donc pas le mort lui-m\u00eame; aucune action en responsabilit\u00e9 ne na\u00eet \u00e0 son profit; ses h\u00e9ritiers, pas plus d'ailleurs que ses cr\u00e9anciers, ne peuvent l'exercer en son nom.\nEn tout respect, je dirais qu'\u00e0 cette proposition de Mazeaud voulant que la victime \u00e9prouve, du fait de son d\u00e9c\u00e8s, un dommage qui n'est pas post\u00e9rieur \u00e0 ce d\u00e9c\u00e8s, il y a lieu, en raison des motifs sur lesquels elle se fonde, de pr\u00e9f\u00e9rer l'opinion contraire, exprim\u00e9e, dans les termes suivants, par Josserand: Les Transports, deuxi\u00e8me ed., no 922, p. 975:\nLes h\u00e9ritiers du voyageur bless\u00e9 et qui n'est d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9 qu'apr\u00e8s coup peuvent assur\u00e9ment demander, en son lieu et place, r\u00e9paration du pr\u00e9judice que lui avaient caus\u00e9 les blessures re\u00e7ues: dans cette mesure, ils se bornent, en effet, \u00e0 exercer l'action qui appartenait \u00e0 leur auteur et dont le principe leur a \u00e9t\u00e9 transmis, par voie de d\u00e9volution h\u00e9r\u00e9ditaire, avec tous les autres \u00e9l\u00e9ments de son patrimoine. Au contraire, ils ne pourraient pas, au m\u00eame titre, demander des dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats \u00e0 raison du d\u00e9c\u00e8s de la victime; en tant qu'elle viserait ce chef d'indemnit\u00e9, leur action aurait un principe posthume et ne pourrait donc \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme ayant pris naissance dans le patrimoine de leur auteur: seule, la voie de l'action directe, bas\u00e9e sur un pr\u00e9judice personnellement \u00e9prouv\u00e9, leur serait ouverte. La disparition juridique de la personne se produit \u00e0 l'instant pr\u00e9cis de son d\u00e9c\u00e8s et, \u00e0 ce m\u00eame instant, s'\u00e9teint juridiquement la possibilit\u00e9 pour elle d'acqu\u00e9rir des droits ou des obligations. Lorsque le pr\u00e9judice, pour lequel l'indemnit\u00e9 est recherch\u00e9e en l'esp\u00e8ce, s'est r\u00e9alis\u00e9, aucun droit ne pouvait d\u00e9sormais s'ouvrir au profit de la victime qui avait cess\u00e9 de vivre; la naissance d'un droit d'action pour r\u00e9clamer de ce chef \u00e9tait d\u00e8s lors devenue juridiquement impossible.\nComme mon coll\u00e8gue, M. le Juge Taschereau, et les membres de la Cour d'Appel, je suis d'avis que la perte de vie de la fillette, n'ayant en rien accru son patrimoine ou sa succession, elle n'a pu, de ce chef, transmettre aucun droit \u00e0 ses h\u00e9ritiers.\nJe disposerais de l'appel tel que le propose M. le Juge Taschereau.\nAbbott J.:\u2014I am in agreement with the reasons and conclusions of my brother Taschereau, which I have had the advantage of reading, and have little to add.\nIn his factum and at the hearing before us, counsel for appellant made extensive reference to English decisions, all of which I have examined. I have reached the conclusion, however, that these decisions can be of no assistance in this case, which must be determined according to the principles enunciated in the Civil Code and the jurisprudence applying those principles.\nA person injured as a result of the commission of a delict or quasi-delict acquires, of course, as of that moment, against the author of his misfortune, a claim in damages for the loss sustained by him, inter alia, by reason of (i) pain and suffering, (ii) loss of enjoyment of life, and (iii) loss of future earnings. If the injured person dies (either as a result of his injuries or for some other cause) before having received compensation for such loss, his claim\u2014arising under art. 1053 C.C.\u2014forms part of his patrimoine and is transmitted to his heirs, legal or testamentary. That proposition of law was in effect conceded by counsel for respondent, both in his factum and on the argument before us.\nWhether a claim be described as one for deprivation of life, shortened life expectancy, loss of life expectancy, shortening of life, or other like terms, I share the view expressed by Mr. Justice Casey that such a claim is, in reality, one for estimated loss of future earnings and of enjoyment of life. Since any claim for such loss is one for unliquidated damages, the Court in appreciating and liquidating the amount thereof must limit such damages to those actually sustained by the deceased from the date of injury to the date of death. It is this amount alone which the heirs of the deceased, qua heirs, are entitled to claim and receive.\nAs my brother Taschereau has pointed out, any claim for damages resulting from the premature death of the injured person can arise only under the provisions of art. 1056 C.C. and be exercised only by the persons specified in that article.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs, Cartwright J. dissenting in part.\nAttorney for the plaintiffs, appellants: M.

The contract of sale is not thereby rendered null, but the consequence of the admission is that the purchaser remains debtor for the price.\nWhen two debts are equally liquidated and have each for object a sum of money, compensation will not take place if one of the creditors is an heir and 'has not produced the certificate of payment or of non-exigibility of the succession duties pertaining to the debt. Until that certificate is produced, the debt is not demandable.

Barakett, for the plaintiff, respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nTaschereau J.:\u2014Les faits de cette cause pr\u00e9sentent peu de difficult\u00e9s.\nLa d\u00e9fenderesse-appelante, Ernestine Charron-Picard, \u00e9tait l'\u00e9pouse de Charles Eug\u00e8ne Charron maintenant d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9. Ils \u00e9taient mari\u00e9s sous le r\u00e9gime de la communaut\u00e9 l\u00e9gale, et le 14 f\u00e9vrier 1952, ils ont obtenu une s\u00e9paration judiciaire en vertu d'un jugement rendu par l'honorable Juge Choquette. Cette s\u00e9paration de corps a naturellement entra\u00een\u00e9 la s\u00e9paration de biens. Le 26 mai de la m\u00eame ann\u00e9e, comme cons\u00e9quence d'ententes intervenues, les biens de la communaut\u00e9 ont \u00e9t\u00e9 partag\u00e9s, et un immeuble qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9valu\u00e9 \u00e0 la somme de $18,000 a \u00e9t\u00e9 attribu\u00e9 \u00e0 Dame Ernestine Charron-Picard.\nCette derni\u00e8re a cependant contract\u00e9 l'obligation de payer \u00e0 son \u00e9poux une somme de $15,000, avec int\u00e9r\u00eat au taux de cinq pour cent (5%), par versements mensuels et cons\u00e9cutifs de $186.58 chacun. Et pour garantir le paiement de cette somme, l'appelante a hypoth\u00e9qu\u00e9 le lot n\u00b0 174, du bloc 41, canton de Rouyn. Il a \u00e9t\u00e9 aussi stipul\u00e9 \u00e0 l'acte de partage que si la d\u00e9bitrice faisait d\u00e9faut d'ex\u00e9cuter l'un des versements dans les soixante jours de son \u00e9ch\u00e9ance, la somme de $15,000 deviendrait imm\u00e9diatement exigible. Quelque temps plus tard, soit le 10 mars 1954, par acte devant le Notaire Morissette, Charron c\u00e9dait sa cr\u00e9ance contre son \u00e9pouse \u00e0 J. Orner Tardif, le demandeur-intim\u00e9 dans la pr\u00e9sente cause, pour une consid\u00e9ration qui est ainsi exprim\u00e9e dans l'acte:\nLe pr\u00e9sent transport a \u00e9t\u00e9 consenti pour le prix de $111,946.61 que le c\u00e9dant reconna\u00eet avoir re\u00e7u du cessionnaire dont quittance.\nSeize jours apr\u00e8s ce transport, soit le 26 mars 1954, Charron d\u00e9c\u00e9dait \u00e0 Rouyn, laissant un testament ant\u00e9rieur \u00e0 la date de la s\u00e9paration judiciaire, dans lequel il instituait sa femme l\u00e9gataire universelle. Madame Charron a cess\u00e9 d'effectuer ses versements le 1er mars 1954. Le 3 juin de la m\u00eame ann\u00e9e, le cessionnaire Tardif a institu\u00e9 contre l'appelante la pr\u00e9sente action dans laquelle il r\u00e9clame la somme de $11,946.61, plus $179.19 d'int\u00e9r\u00eat, formant un total de $12,125.80. Il demande en outre que la d\u00e9fenderesse soit condamn\u00e9e \u00e0 d\u00e9laisser l'immeuble dans les quinze jours de la signification du jugement \u00e0 intervenir, pour que ledit immeuble soit vendu en justice, et qu'\u00e0 m\u00eame le prix le demandeur soit pay\u00e9, par pr\u00e9f\u00e9rence de sa cr\u00e9ance, en principal, int\u00e9r\u00eats et frais.\nLa d\u00e9fenderesse-appelante a pr\u00e9tendu que le transport fait par son mari Charron \u00e0 Tardif \u00e9tait nul, parce qu'\u00e0 la date o\u00f9 il a \u00e9t\u00e9 ex\u00e9cut\u00e9, Charron n'avait pas la pl\u00e9nitude de ses facult\u00e9s mentales, qu'il \u00e9tait incapable de donner un consentement valide, qu'\u00e0 tout \u00e9v\u00e9nement ce contrat est fictif, qu'il n'est qu'une donation \u00abmortis causa\u00bb, et qu'il y a absence de consid\u00e9ration valable. Le juge au proc\u00e8s, apr\u00e8s avoir rejet\u00e9 la pr\u00e9tention de la d\u00e9fenderesse-appelante concernant la capacit\u00e9 mentale du c\u00e9dant, et apr\u00e8s avoir \u00e9cart\u00e9 le motif qu'il s'agissait d'une donation \u00e0 cause de mort, n'a retenu pour justifier son jugement que la l\u00e9galit\u00e9 de la consid\u00e9ration. Il est arriv\u00e9 \u00e0 la conclusion que le contrat \u00e9tait fait sans consid\u00e9ration, parce que le prix du transport, quoiqu'il f\u00fbt stipul\u00e9 qu'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 pay\u00e9, ne l'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 en r\u00e9alit\u00e9.\nLa Cour du banc de la reine2 a unanimement maintenu l'appel de Tardif, a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 qu'il y avait bien un contrat de vente entre les parties, et que le d\u00e9faut du paiement du prix ne faisait pas dispara\u00eetre la, consid\u00e9ration qui \u00e9tait stipul\u00e9e au contrat. Devant cette Cour, les deux parties ont appel\u00e9. Madame Charron pr\u00e9tend toujours qu'il y a absence de consid\u00e9ration, qu'on ne peut en cons\u00e9quence donner effet \u00e0 ce contrat, tandis que Tardif demande qu'il soit d\u00e9cid\u00e9 qu'il ne s'agit pas d'une vente, mais bien d'une donation inter vivos; cette donation, pr\u00e9tend-on, \u00e9tait la r\u00e9compense de services rendus pendant trente ans. Cette divergence d'opinion est facile \u00e0 comprendre. Si ce transport constitue v\u00e9ritablement une vente par Charron \u00e0 Tardif, et si ce dernier n'a pas pay\u00e9 le prix stipul\u00e9, comme c'est le cas, il s'ensuit que Charron, s'il eut v\u00e9cu, aurait eu le droit de le r\u00e9clamer. Comme il est d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9, sa veuve, l\u00e9gataire universelle, est titulaire de cette cr\u00e9ance contre Tardif, et peut offrir en compensation le montant qu'elle devait \u00e0 son mari, garanti par hypoth\u00e8que, et dont Tardif est le cessionnaire. Si, d'un autre c\u00f4t\u00e9, il s'agit d'une donation inter vivos, faite par Charron \u00e0 Tardif, aucune question de compensation ne se pr\u00e9sente, et Tardif peut r\u00e9clamer de madame Charron en vertu du transport en date du 10 mars 1954. C'est la seule question qui se pr\u00e9sente devant cette Cour, les autres moyens ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 abandonn\u00e9s.\nLa Cour du banc de la reine en est arriv\u00e9e \u00e0 la conclusion que ce transport par Charron \u00e0 Tardif constituait une vente, et je\" crois qu'elle a bien jug\u00e9. Les pr\u00e9tentions de Tardif \u00e0 l'effet qu'il s'agissait d'une donation inter vivos sont compl\u00e8tement contredites par son t\u00e9moignage. Examin\u00e9 au pr\u00e9alable, il s'exprime ainsi:\nIl a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 me dire: \u00abJe vais vous vendre mon affaire.\u00bb Je savais de quelle affaire il parlait, c'\u00e9tait le r\u00e8glement avec sa femme, sa part de distribution avec sa femme. Il me disait \u00e7a souvent: \u00abJe vais sous vendre \u00e7a mon affaire\u00bb, et l'affaire s'est pass\u00e9e de m\u00eame. A la fin de f\u00e9vrier ou au commencement de mars il est devenu plus insistant et une bonne journ\u00e9e il m'a dit: \u00abL'achetez-vous ou si vous l'achetez pas? Si vous l'achetez pas, je vais la vendre \u00e0 un autre.\u00bb J'ai dit: On va appeler le notaire, et on a pris le rendez-vous.\nC'est comme cons\u00e9quence de cette conversation que la cession a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite. Ce t\u00e9moignage de Tardif est conforme \u00e0 l'\u00e9crit qu'il a sign\u00e9; il a jur\u00e9 devant le tribunal qu'il s'agissait d'une vente, et il a sign\u00e9 un document qui constate qu'il y avait une vente o\u00f9 il \u00e9tait partie comme acheteur. L'\u00e9crit dit qu'il a pay\u00e9, mais il jure qu'il n'a rien donn\u00e9. \u00c9videmment, son aveu vaut contre cet \u00e9crit, et toute la jurisprudence est \u00e0 l'effet que dans un cas comme celui-l\u00e0, l'aveu est supr\u00eame, et qu'il n'est pas n\u00e9cessaire de recourir \u00e0 l'inscription en faux pour contredire les termes d'un \u00e9crit valablement fait. Le notaire a fid\u00e8lement rapport\u00e9 port\u00e9 dans son acte ce que les parties lui ont repr\u00e9sent\u00e9, et l'inscription en faux ne peut \u00eatre admise lorsque la partie\" reconna\u00eet que l'officier public a exactement relat\u00e9 les faits accomplis devant lui, sauf \u00e0 prouver par toutes esp\u00e8ces de moyens qu'ils ont \u00e9t\u00e9 simul\u00e9s par les parties. (Garsonnet, vol. 2, 705, p. 503.) Il est de principe que lorsque l'on attaque seulement la sinc\u00e9rit\u00e9 des d\u00e9clarations faites des parties devant le notaire, tout en reconnaissant que cet officier a bien constat\u00e9 ce qu'il a vu et entendu, il n'est pas n\u00e9cessaire de prendre la voie de l'inscription en faux, car la v\u00e9racit\u00e9 de l'officier public n'est point mise en question. (1, Boitard, 425.)\nDans une cause de Doyon v. Doyon3, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cid\u00e9 qu'aucune Inscription en faux n'est n\u00e9cessaire pour permettre la preuve que de l'argent dont on a accus\u00e9 r\u00e9ception dans l'acte n'a jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 pay\u00e9. Cette jurisprudence n'a jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 chang\u00e9e, et c'est celle-l\u00e0 qui doit pr\u00e9valoir.\nIl r\u00e9sulte donc qu'il s'agit d'une vent\u00e9 de Charron \u00e0 Tardif, dont le prix n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 pay\u00e9. La pr\u00e9tention que durant les trente ans qu'ils se sont connus, Tardif lui aurait pr\u00eat\u00e9 de l'argent, qu'il l'aurait visit\u00e9 de temps \u00e0 autre, ne me para\u00eet pas justifi\u00e9e. La preuve r\u00e9v\u00e8le que durant cette longue p\u00e9riode, Charron aurait emprunt\u00e9 de Tardif deux fois la somme de $50, qui d'ailleurs ont \u00e9t\u00e9 rembours\u00e9s, et que ce dernier est all\u00e9 lui donner des conseils \u00e0 l'H\u00f4tel Union o\u00f9 il demeurait, apr\u00e8s la s\u00e9paration matrimoniale. Ces faits ne peuvent justifier une consid\u00e9ration comme paiement de la cession de cette cr\u00e9ance. D'ailleurs, le t\u00e9moignage de Tardif d\u00e9truit toutes ces suggestions, car Charron \u00e9tait pr\u00eat \u00e0 vendre \u00e0 un autre, envers qui il n'\u00e9tait pas oblig\u00e9 par aucune dette de reconnaissance, si Tardif n'achetait pas.\nIl r\u00e9sulte qu'il s'agit bien d'une vente dont Tardif est le cessionnaire, par cons\u00e9quent cr\u00e9ancier de madame Charron, et qu'il a le droit de r\u00e9clamer le paiement. La consid\u00e9ration est le prix mentionn\u00e9 \u00e0 l'acte, et si Tardif ne l'a pas pay\u00e9, son d\u00e9faut ne fait pas dispara\u00eetre la consid\u00e9ration du contrat. Tardif est le d\u00e9biteur du montant vis-\u00e0-vis madame Charron, qui est l\u00e9gataire universelle de son \u00e9poux d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9.\nEvidemment, la compensation n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 plaid\u00e9e, car la d\u00e9fenderesse niait la cr\u00e9ance de Tardif, et on ne l'a m\u00eame pas invoqu\u00e9e comme moyen subsidiaire de d\u00e9fense. On en a cependant parl\u00e9 \u00e0 l'argument, mais comme la Cour du banc de la reine, je crois que ce moyen ne peut \u00eatre invoqu\u00e9.\nMadame Charron, h\u00e9riti\u00e8re de son mari, ne pouvait s\u00fbrement pas poursuivre Tardif pour r\u00e9clamer le montant, n'ayant pas pay\u00e9 les droits successoraux, ou n'ayant pas obtenu de certificat qu'il n'y en avait pas d'exigibles. Elle a \u00e9videmment \u00e9t\u00e9 saisie de la cr\u00e9ance de son mari contre Tardif. Elle en est aujourd'hui la titulaire; elle en est aussi la propri\u00e9taire, mais elle ne peut exercer les droits que lui conf\u00e8re cette propri\u00e9t\u00e9 tant que les droits successoraux ne sont pas pay\u00e9s. Jean v. Gagnon4, Ne pouvant pas poursuivre parce que l'exercice de ses droits de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 est suspendu, elle ne peut davantage offrir en compensation le montant de la cr\u00e9ance qui lui vient de la succession de son mari. La cr\u00e9ance de Tardif contre madame Charron, comme celle de madame Charron contre Tardif, sont toutes deux liquides, mais seule celle de Tardif est exigible. Code Civil 1188.\nDans le factum de l'appelante madame Charron, il semble y avoir confusion entre une action o\u00f9 l'on demande de se faire d\u00e9clarer uniquement h\u00e9ritier, et une action o\u00f9 l'on r\u00e9clame une cr\u00e9ance faisant partie du patrimoine du d\u00e9funt. Dans le premier cas, on ne demande que d'\u00eatre reconnu propri\u00e9taire d'un bien, tandis que dans le second on exerce un droit conf\u00e9r\u00e9 par la propri\u00e9t\u00e9, ce qui ne peut \u00eatre fait tant que les imp\u00f4ts successoraux ne sont pas pay\u00e9s.\nL'appelante madame Charron a \u00e9galement pr\u00e9tendu devant cette Cour que Tardif, s'il s'agit d'une vente de cr\u00e9ance, ne pouvait l\u00e9galement r\u00e9clamer le montant de $12,125.80, sans offrir \u00e0 madame Charron le montant dont il est son d\u00e9biteur, ou le consigner au Bureau du Tr\u00e9sor provincial. On veut \u00e9videmment appliquer la doctrine de Non Adimpleti Contractus qui veut que dans un contrat synallagmatique, la partie poursuivie en paiement peut, si de son c\u00f4t\u00e9 le demandeur n'a pas encore pay\u00e9, refuser de s'ex\u00e9cuter. Il est certain que chaque contractant est autoris\u00e9 \u00e0 consid\u00e9rer ce qu'il doit comme garantie de ce qui lui est d\u00fb, et tant que l'autre partie refuse d'ex\u00e9cuter son obligation, l'autre partie peut agir de m\u00eame. Lebel v. Commissaires d'\u00c9coles de Montmorency 5.\nMais, tel n'est pas le cas qui se pr\u00e9sente ici. Il n'est pas question d'un unique contrat bilat\u00e9ral, en vertu duquel les parties ont contract\u00e9 des obligations r\u00e9ciproques, que l'on veut faire annuler ou auxquelles on veut faire donner effect. Dans un cas comme celui-l\u00e0, \u00e9videmment, chacune des parties ne pourrait exiger la prestation qui lui est due que si elle offre elle-m\u00eame d'ex\u00e9cuter son obligation.\nJe suis d'opinion que cette doctrine de \"Non Adimpleti Contractus\" ne peut trouver son application. Tardif poursuit en sa qualit\u00e9 de cessionnaire d'une cr\u00e9ance qu'il a achet\u00e9e, dont il n'a pas pay\u00e9 le prix mais dont il est quand m\u00eame propri\u00e9taire. En sa qualit\u00e9 d'h\u00e9riti\u00e8re de son mari, madame Charron pourrait r\u00e9pondre qu'il y avait compensation parce qu'elle est h\u00e9riti\u00e8re de la cr\u00e9ance de son mari contre Tardif, mais malheureusement, elle ne peut le faire parce que la loi le lui interdit tant que les droits successoraux n'ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 pay\u00e9s.\nL'appel de Charron v. Tardif doit \u00eatre rejet\u00e9 de m\u00eame que l'appel de Tardif v. Charron, mais \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que les succ\u00e8s des parties devant cette Cour sont divis\u00e9s, et vu les circonstances sp\u00e9ciales de cette cause, il n'y aura pas d'Ordonnance quant aux frais sur les deux appels. Tous les droits que peut avoir l'appelante madame Charron de r\u00e9clamer de Tardif le montant de la cr\u00e9ance qu'elle a contre lui comme h\u00e9riti\u00e8re de son mari, lui sont \u00e9videmment r\u00e9serv\u00e9s.\nAppeal and cross-appeal dismissed without costs.\nAttorneys for the defendant, appellant: Garmaise & McNally, Rouyn-Noranda.\nAttorneys for the plaintiff, respondent: Cinq-Mars, Grimard & Ryan, Rouyn-Noranda.\n1 [1958] Que.

The deed will be null for lack of valid consent if the person lacks the capacity to understand its significance; if the person lacks the will to appreciate the deed, to resist or consent to it; if by reason of a weakness of mind the person cannot evaluate the deed or its consequences; if, in one word, the person has no control over his mind.\nWhere the evidence discloses that the plaintiff, who is seeking the annulment of two deeds of sale by which he exchanged with the defendant a house for a grocery store, was mentally sick at the time although not insane, but was prevented by his weakness of mind from giving the valid consent required by art. 986 of the Civil Code, the deeds must be annulled.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench, Appeal Side, Province of Quebec1, reversing a judgment of Demers J. Appeal allowed. J. G. Ahearn, Q.C., for the plaintiffs, appellants.\nG. Laurendeau, Q.C., and P. Champagne, for the defendant, respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nTaschereau J.:\u2014Un court r\u00e9sum\u00e9 des faits est essentiel pour la compl\u00e8te intelligence de cette cause.\nDurant plusieurs ann\u00e9es, l'appelant Oscar Thibodeau \u00e9tait propri\u00e9taire d'une \u00e9picerie, qu'il a vendue en subissant une perte d'environ $800. Il acheta alors une maison sur la rue Ste-Elizabeth \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al, pour laquelle il paya $11,000, mais en 1955, il vendit pour la somme de $20,000 une autre maison dont il \u00e9tait propri\u00e9taire sur la m\u00eame rue. Le 28 juin de la m\u00eame ann\u00e9e, avec le produit de cette vente, par acte devant Lamarre N.P., il acheta d'Oscar Leduc une autre maison situ\u00e9e sur la rue St-Hubert, pour le prix de $29,000, dont $13,000 furent pay\u00e9s comptant, et il assuma une hypoth\u00e8que de $15,000 due par son vendeur. Quant \u00e0 la balance de $1,000, il s'est engag\u00e9 \u00e0 la payer le ou avant le 1er janvier 1956.\nApr\u00e8s avoir achet\u00e9 cet immeuble de la rue St-Hubert, le demandeur l'\u00e9changea, le 13 septembre 1955, avec son fr\u00e8re Marcel Thibodeau, d\u00e9fendeur-intim\u00e9, et en consid\u00e9ration de cet \u00e9change, il re\u00e7ut un fonds de commerce ainsi d\u00e9sign\u00e9:\nUn certain fonds de commerce d'\u00e9picerie et de boucherie licenci\u00e9, exploit\u00e9 au num\u00e9ro 301 de la rue Gilford en la Cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al, comprenant tous les accessoires et toute la marchandise actuellement sur lesdits lieux, tous ses droits au bail actuel ainsi que tous ses droits dans le permis sp\u00e9cial \u00e9mis en son nom par la Commission des Liqueurs de la Province de Qu\u00e9bec permettant la vente de la bi\u00e8re.\nCet \u00e9change a \u00e9t\u00e9 effectu\u00e9 sous la forme de deux actes de vente, en date du 13 septembre 1955. Dans l'un, Oscar Thibodeau, l'appelant, a vendu l'immeuble de la rue St-Hubert pour la somme de $29,000 dont $13,000 pay\u00e9s comptant. La balance de $16,000 devait \u00eatre payable par l'acheteur intim\u00e9, jusqu'\u00e0 concurrence de $14,700, \u00e0 la Caisse Populaire de St-Jacques \u00e0 l'acquit du vendeur, et $1,300 devaient \u00eatre vers\u00e9s au domicile de l'appelant \u00e0 raison de cent dollars par mois. Le montant de $16,000 \u00e9tait garanti par hypoth\u00e8que sur l'immeuble vendu, en faveur d'Oscar Thibodeau. Dans l'autre document portant la m\u00eame date du 13 septembre 1955, l'intim\u00e9 Marcel Thibodeau a vendu le fonds de commerce ci-dessus d\u00e9crit et dont il \u00e9tait le propri\u00e9taire, pour la somme de $13,000; de sorte qu'il n'y a pas eu de paiements d'effectu\u00e9s. Ces deux montants de $13,000 qui \u00e9taient r\u00e9ciproquement dus, se sont mutuellement \u00e9teints par l'effet de la compensation. Il ne restait \u00e0 l'acheteur intim\u00e9 qu'\u00e0 effectuer le paiement de $16,000, tel que je l'ai exprim\u00e9 pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment.\nL'appelant Oscar Thibodeau a \u00e9t\u00e9 interdit pour d\u00e9mence le 13 octobre 1955. La requ\u00eate en interdiction a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par sa belle-m\u00e8re, Dame Georgiana Duford, et son \u00e9pouse Anita Bourne Thibodeau a \u00e9t\u00e9 nomm\u00e9e curatrice \u00e0 son mari. Il est bon de noter, cependant, que le conseil de famille s'est divis\u00e9 \u00e9galement sur la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 de cette interdiction.\nLe 14 d\u00e9cembre 1955, Dame Anita Bourne, d\u00fbment autoris\u00e9e par jugement de la Cour sup\u00e9rieure, a, en sa qualit\u00e9 de curatrice \u00e0 son mari, institu\u00e9 contre Marcel Thibodeau, le pr\u00e9sent intim\u00e9, des proc\u00e9dures l\u00e9gales pour faire annuler les deux actes notari\u00e9s en date du 13 septembre 1955. Elle all\u00e8gue que lorsque son mari les a sign\u00e9s, il souffrait de troubles mentaux qui l'emp\u00eachaient n\u00e9cessairement de donner un consentement valide.\nLe 21 mars 1956, alors que l'instance \u00e9tait pendante, \u00e0 \u00e0 la requ\u00eate de Marcel Thibodeau, l'intim\u00e9 dans la pr\u00e9sente cause, l'honorable Juge Marier de la Cour sup\u00e9rieure, si\u00e9geant \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al, a cass\u00e9 et annul\u00e9 le jugement rendu par le Protonotaire le 13 octobre 1955, qui pronon\u00e7ait l'interdiction d'Oscar Thibodeau pour cause de d\u00e9mence. Proc\u00e9dant \u00e0 rendre le jugement qui aurait d\u00fb \u00eatre rendu par le Protonotaire, le juge a nomm\u00e9 Dame Anita Bourne, \u00e9pouse de l'appelant, conseil judiciaire de son mari. Code Civil, arts. 331-332. L'appelant a dans la suite personnellement repris l'instance, avec l'assistance de son conseil judiciaire. C.C. 351.\nLe juge au proc\u00e8s a conclu que le demandeur appelant a \u00e9tabli qu'au moment o\u00f9 il a sign\u00e9 les deux actes en date du 13 septembre 1955, devant Lamoureux N.P., et dont il demande la r\u00e9siliation, il ne jouissait pas de toutes ses facult\u00e9s mentales, et n'\u00e9tait pas en mesure de donner un consentement valide. La Cour du banc de la reine1 (Taschereau et Choquette JJ. dissidents) a renvers\u00e9 cette d\u00e9cision, a rejet\u00e9 l'action, et a maintenu que si l'appelant a donn\u00e9 en certaines circonstances des signes d'instabilit\u00e9, ou a pris des attitudes bizarres, ou fut enclin \u00e0 des p\u00e9riodes de m\u00e9lancolie, ceci n'\u00e9tait pas suffisant pour annuler des contrats synallagmatiques, quand il n'y a pas de v\u00e9ritables indices d'aberration mentale.\nL'action dans laquelle on demande la nullit\u00e9 des deux contrats, repose \u00e9videmment sur l'art. 986 C.C. qui veut que les personnes ali\u00e9n\u00e9es ou souffrant d'une aberration temporaire caus\u00e9e par maladie, accident, ivresse ou autre cause, ou qui, \u00e0 raison de la faiblesse de leur esprit, sont incapables de donner un consentement valable, ne peuvent contracter.\nLes tribunaux ont souvent eu l'occasion d'examiner cette question d'incapacit\u00e9, et de se prononcer sur le degr\u00e9 d'aberration mentale que les parties doivent atteindre pour que les actes qu'elles posent soient frapp\u00e9s de nullit\u00e9. Les jugements qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 rendus n'ont pas toujours port\u00e9 sur la capacit\u00e9 mentale exig\u00e9e lorsqu'il s'agit de la validit\u00e9 de contrats synallagmatiques. Le plus souvent, le litige portait sur la capacit\u00e9 mentale d'un testateur, mais je ne vois pas qu'il y ait lieu d'\u00e9tablir une diff\u00e9rence entre la capacit\u00e9 de celui qui contracte, et celle de celui qui dispose par testament. C'est d'ailleurs ce que pr\u00e9cise l'article 831 C.C. lorsqu'il conditionne la capacit\u00e9 de tester \u00e0 la capacit\u00e9 d'ali\u00e9ner ses biens.\nLa r\u00e8gle veut qu'il n'est pas n\u00e9cessaire, dans un cas comme dans l'autre, pour que la nullit\u00e9 soit prononc\u00e9e, que le signataire d'un document soit frapp\u00e9 d'insanit\u00e9 totale. La loi n'exige pas qu'il soit d\u00e9tenu dans un asile d'ali\u00e9n\u00e9s, ni m\u00eame qu'il soit interdit ou ait besoin de l'assistance d'un conseil judiciaire. Si le contractant, ou le testateur, n'a pas la capacit\u00e9 de comprendre la port\u00e9e de son acte, s'il n'a pas la volont\u00e9 de l'appr\u00e9cier, d'y r\u00e9sister ou d'y consentir, si \u00e0 raison de la faiblesse de son esprit, il ne peut peser la valeur des actes qu'il pose ou les cons\u00e9quences. qu'ils peuvent entra\u00eener, si en un mot il ne poss\u00e8de pas le pouvoir de contr\u00f4ler son esprit, son acte sera nul faute de consentement valide. Vide: Baptist v. Baptist2; Russell v. Lefran\u00e7ois3; L\u00e9ger v. Poirier4; Rosconi v. Dubois5; Mathieu v. St-Michel6; McEwen v. Jenkins7.\nDans le cas qui nous occupe, la preuve r\u00e9v\u00e8le que le demandeur \u00e9tait s\u00fbrement un malade mental. Les actes dont on demande la nullit\u00e9 remontent au 13 septembre 1955. Avant cette date, il avait manifest\u00e9 d\u00e9j\u00e0 des indices s\u00e9rieux de d\u00e9rangement et d'instabilit\u00e9 intellectuels. Le juge au proc\u00e8s les rapporte dans son jugement, et il constate de la contradiction dans les t\u00e9moignages qu'il a entendus. Il relate cependant la version de plusieurs t\u00e9moins qui affirment qu'au cours de l'ann\u00e9e 1955, Oscar Thibodeau agissait de fa\u00e7on pour le moins \u00e9trange. Ainsi, il regrettait ses transactions immobili\u00e8res, parlait seul, et suivait difficilement les conversations; il faisait des crises violentes, se projetait sur les murs, et se frappait la t\u00eate. Il se livrait \u00e0 la m\u00e9lancolie, pleurait souvent, s'arrachait les cheveux, et voulait m\u00eame s'enlever la vie. Contre ces faits positifs, qui s\u00fbrement d\u00e9montrent un d\u00e9s\u00e9quilibre mental, d'autres t\u00e9moins ont d\u00e9clar\u00e9 l'avoir vu accidentellement durant 1955, et n'ont rien trouv\u00e9 d'anormal.\nLe 29 juin, c'est-\u00e0-dire pr\u00e8s de trois mois avant la signature des actes, le Dr Rodrigue a \u00e9t\u00e9 appel\u00e9 en consultation, et il a constat\u00e9 que l'appelant \u00e9tait un psycho-n\u00e9vrose, et il l'a r\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9 \u00e0 la clinique psychiatrique de l'H\u00f4tel Dieu, o\u00f9 le Dr DesRochers lui a appliqu\u00e9, durant le mois d'ao\u00fbt 1955, un \u00e9lectrochoc, afin de calmer la d\u00e9pression nerveuse. Thibodeau retourna alors chez lui o\u00f9, le 13 septembre, il signa les documents attaqu\u00e9s, mais le 7 octobre, le Dr Archambault le fit entrer \u00e0 l'H\u00f4pital Maisonneuve. Ce m\u00e9decin constata l'existence d'une psychose et remit le demandeur entre les mains du Dr Fernand C\u00f4t\u00e9, un psychiatre qui le soigna jusqu'au 7 novembre 1955.\nLe t\u00e9moignage du Dr C\u00f4t\u00e9 a fortement impressionn\u00e9 l'honorable Juge Andr\u00e9 Demers. Il r\u00e9sulte de ce t\u00e9moignage comme de celui du Dr Archambault, que Thibodeau, quoique sa sant\u00e9 fut substantiellement am\u00e9lior\u00e9e en novembre, ne pouvait pas en septembre 1955, donner un consentement valide. Le Dr MacKay, appel\u00e9 par l'intim\u00e9, dit que la psychose est un \u00e9tat d'esprit o\u00f9 le patient est hors de contact avec la r\u00e9alit\u00e9, et par cons\u00e9quent irresponsable. C'est cette preuve m\u00e9dicale qui a entra\u00een\u00e9 le juge au proc\u00e8s \u00e0 croire que l'appelant n'avait pas la capacit\u00e9 mentale voulue pour donner un consentement libre.\nApr\u00e8s avoir revu toute la preuve, j'en suis arriv\u00e9 \u00e0 la conclusion qu'il n'y a pas d'erreur, encore moins d'erreur manifeste dans le jugement de M. le Juge Deniers. Il a vu et entendu tous les t\u00e9moins; il a appr\u00e9ci\u00e9 la valeur des t\u00e9moignages rendus, et il m'est impossible de dire qu'il n'a pas eu raison. Thibodeau n'\u00e9tait pas un complet ali\u00e9n\u00e9, mais il souffrait s\u00fbrement d'une faiblesse d'esprit qui l'a emp\u00each\u00e9 de donner un consentement valide, et c'est ce qui fait que les actes attaqu\u00e9s doivent \u00eatre annul\u00e9s.\nL'appel doit donc \u00eatre maintenu, et le jugement du juge au proc\u00e8s r\u00e9tabli. L'appelant aura droit \u00e0 ses frais devant la Cour du banc de la reine et devant cette Cour.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nAttorneys for the plaintiffs, appellants: Hyde & Ahem, Montreal.\nAttorneys for the defendant, respondent: Champagne & Leblanc, Montreal.\n1 [1960] Que.

With the assistance of a loan obtained by him under the Veterans\u2019 Land Act he had a house built on a lot within the parcel, and later sold all the land with the exception of the house and lot. Subsequently his wife W issued a writ for alimony, support for an infant child and a declaration that she was the sole owner of the property and entitled to all the proceeds of the sale. The trial judge dismissed her claim to the property on the ground that she had made no financial contribution to its purchase. The Court of Appeal held that W was entitled to a one\u2011half interest in the property and the proceeds of the sale. The husband then appealed to this Court.\nHeld (Kerwin C.J. and Cartwright J. dissenting): The appeal should be allowed.\nPer Martland and Ritchie JJ.: No question of a matrimonial home arose until two years after the purchase of the land, which was a business venture by H for speculative purposes, with the added advantage that the land was suitable for the building of a house on part of it. Therefore no principle applicable to a matrimonial home which may be derived from cases such as Rimmer v. Rimmer, [1953] 1 Q.B. 63, would properly be applicable to the circumstances of this case.\nPer Martland, Judson and Ritchie JJ.: The trial judge concluded that the financial dealings between the spouses indicated no proprietary interest in the property on the part of the wife. This was not a case where the findings of fact of the trial judge should have been reversed.\nNo case has yet held that, in the absence of some financial contribution, the wife is entitled to a proprietary interest from the mere fact of marriage and cohabitation and the fact the property in question is the matrimonial home. Yet, if the principle is sound when it is based on a financial contribution, no matter how modest, there seems to be no logical objection to its application and the exercise of the same discretion when there is no financial contribution when the other attributes of the matrimonial partnership are present. Here, however, on the finding of the trial judge, the basis for the application of the rule as at present developed by the English decisions is not to be found. Rimmer v. Rimmer, supra; Hodinott v.

Appeal allowed, Kerwin C.J. and Cartwright J. dissenting.\nA. Maloney, Q.C., and P. Hess, for the defendant, appellant.\nR.N. Starr, Q.C., and J.M. Weekes, for the plaintiff, respondent.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE (dissenting):\u2014This is an appeal by the husband from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario1 in an action brought against him by his wife in which she claimed alimony and custody of an infant child of the marriage together with maintenance for his support. She also claimed a declaration that certain lands were held by the husband in trust for her; an order requiring him to pay her the monies received by him for the sale of certain parts thereof; a declaration that a mortgage given to the husband was held in trust by him for the plaintiff; an accounting of all monies paid under that mortgage; and an order declaring that part of the lands,\u2014a two-acre lot on which was situate the matrimonial home,\u2014and which was to be conveyed under a certain contract to the defendant, be conveyed to the plaintiff. The claim for alimony was dismissed at the trial and in the Court of Appeal and there is no cross-appeal, and all disputes as to the custody and support of the child have been settled between the parties.\nThis leaves for determination only the questions of ownership of the land and the mortgage money. As to these there was a difference of opinion in the Court of Appeal. Laidlaw J.A. and McGillivray J.A. decided that the property described in the statement of claim was owned by the parties in equal shares at and subsequent to the date of purchase thereof; that the wife was entitled to an equal share with the husband of the proceeds of the sale of part of the property sold by him including the proceeds of the mortgage given by the purchaser to him; and that the land and premises reserved by the husband from the sale, (the two-acre lot), belong to each of the parties to this litigation in equal shares. MacKay J.A. would have dismissed all the wife\u2019s claims in connection with the property and mortgage.\nThe three members of the Court of Appeal agreed that counsel who had formerly appeared for the husband acted improperly in moving at the commencement of the trial for a mental examination of the wife, which, he stated, was made for two purposes,\u2014to attack the credibility of the wife and also to show that the action had not been commenced \u201con properly given instructions\u201d. The trial judge permitted counsel to call Dr. Crisp although at the conclusion of the doctor\u2019s testimony the motion was dismissed. I agree with all that has been said by all the members of the Court of Appeal with reference to those actions of the husband\u2019s former counsel. The majority of the Court of Appeal considered that the trial judge, with the best intentions in the world, intervened unduly during the course of the trial. Laidlaw J.A. points out in his reasons that in the memorandum filed in the Court of Appeal counsel for the wife stated that the examination-in-chief of the plaintiff occupied 147 pages and that on 134 of them the trial judge intervened. Without attempting to assess the accuracy of these figures it is clear to me from a reading of the record that the interventions occurred on a great many occasions and I cannot but come to the conclusion that they, as well as the unwarranted proceedings by the husband\u2019s counsel, affected the conclusions of the trial judge. At p. 473 of vol. 2 of the Appeal Case in this Court, he is reported as follows:\nAs I said during the trial, I have to deal with this case on the premise that the wife was normal mentally. She refused to submit to a further physical examination to have her mental condition ascertained, so that I have to deal with her as being normal. However, there is evidence before me and I cannot say that it did not, to some extent, influence me at least in coming to a conclusion as to why the plaintiff acted as she did. I feel that paranoia has influenced the plaintiff in her dealings and relationship with her husband. She was taking psychiatric treatments for some time before November 12th, 1956. In fact, she went to see her doctor the very next day, on November the 13th, I think it was, according to the evidence, or within a few days anyway, and she saw Dr. Crisp on the 20th of November, which would only be a week later. I am of the opinion that what was in her mind was the root of all the trouble.\nThe underlining has been added but I cannot read the above extract in conjunction with the rest of the trial judge\u2019s remarks as referring only to the claims for alimony and custody and support of the infant.\nMacKay J.A. concluded that much of the blame for the trial judge\u2019s intervention should be attributed to the plaintiff\u2019s evasiveness and failure to make direct answers to questions put to her by counsel. In view of the statements made by the husband\u2019s counsel at the commencement of the trial and of the calling by him of Dr. Crisp as a witness on the motion, it is not surprising that the wife was disconcerted. In my view the actions of counsel for the defendant at the trial and the intervention of the trial judge had a direct influence on the latter\u2019s finding in connection with the property and mortgage.\nSoon after the commencement of the argument on behalf of the appellant in this Court, it was announced that we were of opinion that the evidence of Dr. Crisp was not admissible and when Mr. Maloney was replying it was made clear that that ruling applied to all of the doctor\u2019s evidence, whether given on the motion at the commencement of the trial or whether (and assuming it was not necessary for him to be re-sworn) when he was called as a witness on behalf of the defendant after the evidence on behalf of the plaintiff was completed.\nThe principles to be applied by a Court of Appeal in considering the judgment of a trial judge are set forth in the decision of the House of Lords in Hontestroom (Owners) v. Sagaporack (Owners)[2] and mentioned in Powell v. Streatham Manor Nursing Home[3], both of which cases together with the decision of the Privy Council in Calderia v. Gray[4] are referred in the decision of this Court in Lawrence v. Tew[5]. Bearing in mind these principles I find it impossible to say, in view of what is set out above, that the trial judge made full judicial use of the opportunity given him by hearing the viva voce evidence. A careful reading of the record satisfies me that the evidence detailed in the reasons of Laidlaw J.A. and in the additional reasons of McGillivray J.A. justify the following conclusions:\n(1) the wife worked and earned a considerable sum throughout the years and her cash in the bank was nearly exhausted in 1954;\n(2) while the husband was in the Air Force the wife worked and paid for help in the apartment and for the education of the daughter;\n(3) while sums of money were paid by the husband to his wife and, as he alleged, in repayment of what he considered had been loans, she had made substantial contributions to the purchase of the land and paid out of her own monies various sums for household articles and expenses;\n(4) each of the parties expended physical labour in building the house and in working the land in conjunction with others; (5) it was recognized by the husband that his wife was entitled to a one-half interest in the land when he gave her a cheque for one-half ($6,403.65) of a payment made to him and that he intended, as a result of certain misinformation given him, that $4,000 of the cheque should be free from what he thought would be subject to a gift tax.\nI am not suggesting that there is community of property in Ontario as between husband and wife and I do not rely upon the \u201cpalm tree\u201d justice referred to in some of the decisions in England mentioned in the reasons for judgment of the Court of Appeal; I place my conclusion upon the ground that there is evidence in this record that the parties considered that each was entitled to a one-half interest in the land.\nCases where a husband supplies most, if not all of the money required for the purchase of a property, and puts it in his wife\u2019s name with the result that there is a presumption of advancement, such as in Jackman v. Jackman[6], have no application to the circumstances before us.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nCARTWRIGHT J. (dissenting):\u2014The differences of judicial opinion to which this case has given rise appear to me to result from the difficulty in ascertaining the facts rather than from any question as to the applicable law.\nThe primary question is as to the intention of the parties at the time when the conveyance of the twenty-acre parcel of land was taken in the name of the husband. The analysis of the evidence made in the reasons of Laidlaw J.A. brings me to the conclusion that the down payment on the purchase of this property was made from moneys jointly owned by the appellant and the respondent. If the respondent had paid his own money into a joint account standing in the names of himself and his wife there would have been a rebuttable presumption that he was giving her a half interest in the moneys in the account. In fact more than half of the money standing in that account at the time that the down payment was paid out of it had been furnished by the wife. When the husband used moneys of which the wife was joint owner with him to purchase a property and took the deed thereof in his own name there arose a rebuttable presumption that he held as trustee for himself and his wife jointly. In my opinion the evidence taken as a whole far from rebutting that presumption supports it.\nFor the reasons given by the Chief Justice and those briefly stated above I would dispose of the appeal as proposed by the Chief Justice.\nThe judgment of Martland and Ritchie JJ. was delivered by\nMARTLAND J:\u2014I agree with the reasons given by my brother Judson and with his proposed disposition of this appeal.\nThere is also a further point which I consider to be important. The property in question here was a substantial area of suburban land, with possibilities for a considerable appreciation in value, but suitable, at the time of purchase, for operation as a small farm or market garden. At that time there was no house on the property. The appellant rented the land to a tenant for five years and later operated the farm, as such, in his spare time. No question of a matrimonial home arose until two years after the purchase of the land, when the appellant decided to build a house with the assistance available to him under the Veterans\u2019 Land Act. I regard this, as did the dissenting judgment in the Court of Appeal, as a business venture by the appellant for speculative purposes, with the added advantage that it was suitable for the building of a house on part of it.\nOn this ground alone it does not appear to me that any principle applicable to a matrimonial home which may be derived from cases such as Rimmer v. Rimmer[7], would properly be applicable to the circumstances of this case.\nThe judgment of Judson and Ritchie JJ. was delivered by\nJUDSON J.:\u2014The only remaining issue in this litigation between husband and wife relates to the ownership of a twenty-acre parcel of land in the Township of Scarborough. The husband bought this property as vacant land in 1945, for $1,940 and took the conveyance in his own name. With the assistance of a loan obtained by him under the Veterans\u2019 Land Act he had a house built on a two-acre lot within the parcel. The house was completed in 1951. In 1954 he sold all the land, with the exception of the house and two-acre lot, for $40,000. In 1957 the wife issued a writ for alimony, support for an infant child and a declaration that she was the sole owner of the property and entitled to all the proceeds of the sale. The learned trial judge dismissed her claim to the property on the ground that she had made no financial contribution to its purchase. The Court of Appeal held that she was entitled to a one-half interest in the property and the proceeds of the sale. The husband now appeals. The claim for alimony was dismissed both at trial and on appeal. The matter of custody and support of the child was settled.\nThere is a full analysis of the evidence in the reasons of the learned trial judge and in the reasons delivered in the Court of Appeal. The evidence satisfies me, as it did the learned trial judge and MacKay J.A. (dissenting in the Court of Appeal) that it was the husband who purchased this property with his own money and that there was no intention between the parties either expressed or to be inferred from their conduct and dealings that this property was to be owned jointly.\nThe wife\u2019s claim to a proprietary interest in this property is based first upon what she says was her contribution to the down payment. The total purchase price of $1,940 was to be paid as follows: $100 as a deposit; $1,440 to be secured by a mortgage given back by the purchaser; and the balance of $400, subject to adjustments, to be paid on closing. The husband paid the $100. The wife put $300 into a joint account, which the evidence indicates to have been the husband\u2019s account. This is the only deposit which the wife ever made in this account. The wife says that this $300 was her contribution to the purchase of the farm. The husband says that this money was given to him by his wife to reimburse him for moneys that she had taken from this account while he was overseas. This account had originally been in his name but when he went overseas, he put it in their joint names. The wife had the usual allowance for herself and the children and the husband made her, in addition, an assignment from his pay. He says that while he was overseas he sent certain sums of money for deposit in this joint account with the intention that he should have an emergency fund when he returned. These sums, he said, amounted to $379.74 and particulars are given in the evidence. When he returned from overseas in January 1944, because of domestic trouble, there was only $1.15 in this account. The trial judge accepted the husband\u2019s evidence and found that this $300 was not a contribution to the purchase price but was a reimbursement by the wife of these moneys. During the husband\u2019s absence overseas, the wife had been working and had kept her savings in her own account. There was ample evidence on which the learned trial judge could find as he did and I do not think that his finding constitutes reversible error.\nThe husband alone was liable on the mortgage and he paid it off out of his own monies on August 1, 1947. Until 1950 he received all the rents from the land, which was leased to neighbouring farmers. The wife never made any claim to share these rents.\nIn 1947 the husband applied under the Veterans\u2019 Land Act for assistance in the construction of a house. As required by the Act, he conveyed to the Director under the Act a parcel containing over two acres on which the house was to be built. The loan was for $6,000, of which $5,400 was for the house and $600 for equipment and stock. Nine progress payments in all were made during the course of building, the first on August 10, 1949, the last on July 17, 1952. Construction of the house began in 1948. The husband\u2019s evidence was that in 1949, the progress payments being slow and since he needed money to continue building, he borrowed sums from his wife on the understanding that they would be repaid as soon as possible out of the progress payments. In July and August 1949 the husband received from his wife two cheques, one for $400 and one for $1,000. She says that these cheques were for the purpose of paying off the National Trust mortgage on the purchase price of the farm. This cannot be so because this mortgage had been paid off by the husband two years before. The husband claims that he repaid these cheques by endorsing his progress payments under the Veterans\u2019 Land Act. He produced cheques totalling $1,545 endorsed by him to his wife and deposited by the wife in her own bank account. So far the only possible financial contribution of the wife to the purchase price appears to be the $300, on which the learned trial judge made a finding adverse to the wife.\nAfter 1950 the wife operated the vacant land as a market garden. She got the profits from this operation and also the cheques representing the proceeds of the grain crop for the years 1951 to 1954.\nIn June 1954 the husband accepted an offer to purchase the farm lands for $40,000, payable $2,000 as a deposit, $20,000 to be secured by a mortgage and the balance in cash on closing. The sale was completed on August 1, 1954; the mortgage in favour of the Director of the Veterans\u2019 Land Act was paid off, and the husband received a net amount of $12,807.30 on closing. A week after the closing he gave his wife exactly one-half of this sum, namely, $6,403.65. The husband says that this was a gift to the wife because family troubles were beginning and he was anxious to keep the household together. After this, the husband, as sole mortgagee, received and retained all monies payable under the mortgage for a period of two years and, until the institution of the action, the wife never made any claim.\nThere is also a great mass of evidence about other financial dealings between husband and wife\u2014who purchased certain articles; who provided the money for these purchases; who provided the money for a vacation in Western Canada; how the market garden was operated, and who got the money from this source. It seems to be impossible to expect any married couple to testify with certainty about these matters and the understandings behind them. During the period 1945 to 1955 the marital life of this couple seems to have been free of discord but on a consideration of the whole evidence, the learned trial judge concluded that the financial dealings between the two indicated no proprietary interest in the property on the part of the wife. There was ample evidence on which he could make this finding. The majority judgment of the Court of Appeal does, however, analyse the evidence and come to different conclusions of fact. MacKay J.A., dissenting, also on a detailed analysis of the evidence, came to the same conclusion as the learned trial judge. In my opinion, this is not a case where the findings of fact of the learned trial judge should have been reversed.\nThe learned trial judge based his judgment on the obvious principle that where a husband provides the purchase money and takes the conveyance in his own name, he will be the beneficial owner unless the wife can prove that he holds on an express trust for her, either as to the whole or part. Such proof, of course, involves compliance with the Statute of Frauds. He found as a fact that the husband did provide the purchase money and if this finding is supportable, as I think it is, there was no basis for the imposition of a trust.\nThe Court of Appeal, on the contrary, founded its judgment on its own independent finding that the wife in this case had made some financial contribution as a purchaser to the acquisition of the property and was, in consequence, entitled to a one-half interest in what, in these cases, is commonly referred to as the matrimonial home. The Court, on the basis of its own finding of fact that there was some financial contribution to the purchase price, is really doing what, according to Romer L.J., should be done when he said in Rimmer v. Rimmer[8], that \u201ccases between husband and wife ought not to be governed by the same strict considerations, both at law and in equity, as are commonly applied to strangers.\u201d This, it seems to me, is a fundamental departure in dealing with disputes between husband and wife about ownership of property and is traceable to its beginning in the dissenting judgment in Hodinott v. Hodinott[9]. The dissent was adopted in Rimmer v. Rimmer, supra; Cobb v. Cobb[10]; Silver v. Silver[11]; Richards v. Richards[12] and Fribance v. Fribance[13], with the result that, if it is found that the wife makes any contribution to the purchase of the matrimonial home, she is the owner of a one-half interest and not merely of an interest proportionate to her contribution as in Re Rogers[14].\nBut no case has yet held that, in the absence of some financial contribution, the wife is entitled to a proprietary interest from the mere fact of marriage and cohabitation and the fact the property in question is the matrimonial home. Yet, if the principle is sound when it is based on a financial contribution, no matter how modest, there seems to be no logical objection to its application and the exercise of the same discretion when there is no financial contribution when the other attributes of the matrimonial partnership are present. However, if one accepts the finding of the learned trial judge, the basis for the application of the rule at its present stage of development in England is not to be found in the present case.\nThe judicial use of the discretionary power under s. 12 of The Married Women\u2019s Property Act, R.S.O. 1950, c. 233, in property disputes between husband and wife has not developed in the same way in the common law provinces of Canada as it has in England. There is no hint of it in this Court in Minaker v. Minaker[15], and there is an implicit rejection of the existence of any such power in Carnochan v. Carnochan[16], where Cartwright J. stated that the problem was not one of the exercise of a discretionary power but one of application of the law to ascertained facts. Further, in Jackman v. Jackman[17], where the Alberta Court of Appeal, in reversing the judgment at trial, had applied the line of decisions above referred to, this Court declined to support the exercise of the discretionary power in the rebuttal of the presumption of advancement in circumstances where the husband\u2019s contribution was very large and where it should not have been difficult to draw an inference of a joint interest in the matrimonial home.\nIf a presumption of joint assets is to be built up in these matrimonial cases, it seems to me that the better course would be to attain this object by legislation rather than by the exercise of an immeasurable judicial discretion under s. 12 of The Married Women\u2019s Property Act.\nI would allow the appeal with costs and restore the judgment at trial. The order of the learned trial judge as to costs pursuant to Rule 388 should stand. In the Court of Appeal the order that the husband do pay to the wife her cash disbursements actually and properly made by her solicitor and attributable to her claim for alimony should stand but beyond this there should be no order as to costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs, Kerwin C.J. and Cartwright J. dissenting.\nSolicitors for the defendant, appellant: Whiteacre & Creighton, Toronto.\nSolicitor for the plaintiff, respondent: John M.

Custody of their male child, who was just over a year old, was granted to the mother. When the child reached the age of six years, the father sought its custody pursuant to art. 214 of the Code. The trial judge granted him the custody, and this judgment was affirmed by the Court of Queen's Bench. The mother applied for leave to appeal to this Court.\nHeld: The application should be dismissed.\nWhat was done was not illegal and obviously the Courts below decided that it was in the child's best interest not to be deprived of the custody of his father. The reason which had justified the Court in granting the custody to the mother no longer existed, since the child was older and had less need for maternal attention.

Held: The appeal should be dismissed.\nPer Curiam: The appellant\u2019s argument that streets in the matter of area but not in the matter of value must be included in computing the average value of land in the locality was rejected. \u201cValue\u201d in the context of s. 44(2) (a) of the Act means \u201cvalue in exchange\u201d, a value which streets do not have.\nWith respect to the assessment of the company\u2019s assets under s. 44(2) (d) of the Act, the assessor is not required to value these assets as part and parcel of the whole railway system and base his valuation upon the earnings of the system. The test is an appraisal on notional sale of these particular assets to another railway company and not on a notional sale of all the assets of the appellant company to another railway company.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, affirming a decision of the Ontario Municipal Board. Appeal dismissed.\nC.F.H. Carson, Q.C., Allan Findlay, Q.C., and G.P. Miller, for the appellant.\nJ.J. Robinette, Q.C., for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nJUDSON J.:\u2014The Canadian Pacific Railway Company appeals against the 1954 quinquennial assessment of certain of its property in the City of Sudbury on the ground that the assessor failed to observe the requirements of s. 44(2) of The Assessment Act. Both the Municipal Board and the Court of Appeal have confirmed the assessments.\nThe first issue is on the assessment of the roadway or right-of-way, which by s. 44(2) (a) the assessor is required to assess in the following way:\n(a) the roadway or right-of-way at the actual value thereof according to the average value of land in the locality; but not including the structures, substructures and superstructures, rails, ties, poles and other property thereon.\nThere is no dispute about the geographical limits within which land in the locality is to be taken to lie for the purpose of the computation required by the subsection. The difficulty arises from the phrase \u201caverage value of land in the locality\u201d. The assessor ignored in his computation the streets and public lanes within the area. The railway says that he is required to include them. If he does so and assesses them as of no value, as the railway says he must, the consequence will be a lower average value and a lower assessment for these railway lands. The argument is simple. Streets are land; they are not excluded from land by the interpretation section of The Assessment Act; all real property in Ontario is liable to assessment and taxation subject to certain exemptions from taxation; and by s. 4(8) streets are assessable but not taxable. Therefore streets in the matter of area but not in the matter of value must be included in computing the average value of land in the locality. Any other procedure, it is said, would involve the addition of words to the statute, the filling in of supposed gaps and the usurpation by the court of the function of the legislature. (Magor and St. Mellons Rural District Council v. Newport Corporation[1]).\nThis argument for the application of the literal or plain meaning rule to the construction of s. 44(2) (a) fails to recognize that the phrase to be construed is \u201caverage value of land in the locality\u201d and that the word \u201cvalue\u201d is not self-explanatory. Streets have value and they are land. But it is not the same kind of value as that attributable to the land which borders on the streets. The ambiguous word in the phrase is \u201cvalue\u201d. Streets have value for public use but they have no monetary worth, marketable price or value in exchange. It was for this reason that the Municipal Board upheld the assessor in excluding them from the computation.\nWords are not mathematical symbols. In every context the word \u201cvalue\u201d cannot have the same meaning or shade of meaning. As a matter of statutory construction I think the Municipal Board was correct in finding that \u201cvalue\u201d in the context of s. 44(2) (a) meant \u201cvalue in exchange\u201d for this is what the Board did when it supported the assessor in averaging the value of all those lands in the locality which have value of the nature and kind in question.\nI prefer the basis of the decision of the Municipal Board to that of the Court of Appeal, which held that land in the locality meant taxable land in the locality. There can be land in the locality which has a value in exchange and which is subject to the same assessment as other land but is exempt from taxation. The sounder interpretation, it seems to me, with respect, is to say that \u201cvalue\u201d in this context means \u201cvalue in exchange\u201d.\nThe purpose of this legislation is clear. Its purpose is equality\u2014to require the assessor to treat this kind of railway property as other property in the neighbourhood\u2014and the exclusion of public streets and lanes from the calculation of the average value of land in the locality is required if the purpose is to be attained.\nThe second issue in the appeal is on the assessment of six parcels of land used for a variety of railway purposes, most of which are essential to the continued operation of the railway. These are to be assessed under the provisions of s. 44(2) (d) of The Assessment Act, which reads as follows:\n(d) the real property not designated in clauses a, b and c of this sub-section in actual use and occupation by the Company, at its actual cash value as the same would be appraised upon a sale to another company possessing similar powers, rights and franchises.\nThis section confronts the assessor with a very difficult task\u2014an appraisal of the actual cash value of these assets on a notional sale between two railway companies. I agree with Roach J.A. that the reason for the introduction of the notional sale was to avoid any suggestion that these assets could be valued at their scrap or salvage value. Old illustrations of cases where this had to be done because of the wording of the legislation are to be found in Re London Street Railway Assessment[2], Re Queenston Heights Bridge Assessment[3], Re Bell Telephone and City of Hamilton[4].\nThe railway submits that these assets must be valued as part of a going concern and that this valuation must depend largely on the earnings of the company. Therefore, it is submitted, the assessor must begin with the last quinquennial assessment of these assets in 1949. This assessment had been confirmed on appeal to the Municipal Board. Ten per cent. should be added to this figure, because during the period 1950 to 1954 railway earnings had increased by this amount.\nI can see no reason why the assessor must take as his starting point the last quinquennial assessment of these assets. His task is defined by the subsection. The test is an appraisal on notional sale of these particular assets to another railway company and not on a notional sale of all the assets of the Canadian Pacific Railway Company to another railway company. The assessor is not required to value these assets as part and parcel of the whole Canadian Pacific Railway system and base his valuation upon the earnings of the system. The subsection does not require this and the sheer impossibility of such a task is sufficient to condemn this interpretation.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: F.H.

The trial judge found that the collision was caused solely by the negligence of the master of the tug, but found that the company was entitled to limit its liability under ss. 657 and 659 of the Canada Shipping Act, as well for the damage caused by the sinking as for the cost incurred by the appellants in removing the wreck at the direction of the river authorities. The appellants appealed to this Court.\nHeld (Locke and Cartwright JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be allowed in part. Per Curiam: The findings of the trial judge that the sinking was caused by the improper navigation of the tug and scow and that this occurred without the actual fault or privity of the respondent should not be disturbed. Accordingly the respondent is not deprived of its right to limit its liability under s. 657 of the Canada Shipping Act in relation to the claim for the loss of the dredge.\nPer Martland, Judson and Ritchie JJ.: The words \"in respect of loss or damage\" in s. 657 of the Act are not used to define the wrongful act of the shipowner whose vessel causes damage, but are used to define that kind of damage in relation to which, the wrongful act having occurred, he may limit his liability. Burger v. Indemnity Mutual Marine Assurance Company Limited, [1900] 2 Q.B. 348, applied.\nSection 659 only affords protection to a shipowner in respect of a claim for loss or damage caused to property or rights of any kind by reason of improper navigation or management of the ship. This is not to be read as applying to any kind of damage resulting from the infringement of another's rights. The section limits liability for the infringement of rights in respect of a particular kind of loss or damage, i.e., loss or damage caused to property or to rights. The \"rights\" referred to must be rights which may be subject to loss or damage.\nThe claim with respect to the expense incurred in removing the wreck is not one for damage to property. Neither is it a claim for loss or damage to the appellant's rights. Nor was there any claim in damages for damage to the property or rights of the Crown, as distinct from those of the appellants, which could make s. 659 applicable.\nThe Crown's claim, in respect of the obstruction to navigation caused by the sinking of the dredge, was for the enforcement of the statutory duties imposed and of its statutory rights created by the Navigable Waters Protection Act and not a claim for damages for damage to its own property or rights.\nTherefore s. 659 does not enable the respondent to limit its liability in respect of the claim for the cost of removing the wreck. The Urka, [1953] 1 Lloyd's Rep. 478; The Millie, [1940] P. 1; The Stonedale No. 1, [1955] 2 All E.R. 689, applied.\nPer Locke J., dissenting: The sinking of the dredge occurred through the negligence of the respondent, and there was imposed upon the owners the statutory obligation to remove the wreck. This was a direct result of the negligent act and was damage \"in respect of\" the damage to the dredge within the meaning of s. 657 of the Act and to the \"rights\" of the appellants within the meaning of s. 659. The Stondale No. 1, supra; The Millie, supra, distinguished; The Urka, supra, not followed.\nPer Cartwright J., dissenting: If damages flow sufficiently directly from a wrongful act to be recoverable in an action in tort based on that act it is not possible to say that they are not damages \"in respect of\" that wrongful act. If they were not in respect of such act they would not be recoverable.\nThe expense incurred in removing the wreck forms part of the damages for which the respondent is liable, and the respondent is entitled to limit its liability accordingly. APPEAL from a judgment of Sidney Smith D.J.A.1 Appeal allowed in part, Locke and Cartwright JJ. dissenting.\nD. McK. Brown and R. M. Hayman, for the plaintiffs, appellants.\nJ. I. Bird and F. O. Gerity, for the defendants, respondents.\nLocke J. (dissenting):\u2014This is an appeal by the plaintiffs in the action from the judgment of the Deputy Judge in Admiralty at Vancouver2 by which the respondent company and G. M. L. Harwood, the master of the tug La Dene, were held to be liable for damages arising from the collision between the scow V.T. 5, when in tow by the said tug, and the dredge Townsend owned by the appellant, Marwell Equipment Ltd. in the Fraser River on the evening of March 14, 1957. The learned judge found that the collision was caused solely by the negligence of Harwood, the master of the tug, but found that the respondent company was entitled to limit its liability to both of the appellants under the provisions of ss. 657 and 659 of the Canada Shipping Act, as well for the damage caused by the sinking as for the cost incurred by the appellants for removing the dredge and other equipment from the bed of the river at the direction of the river authorities.\nThe defendant Harwood did not appeal and the finding that he was guilty of negligence in the navigation of the La Dene, which either caused or contributed to the collision, is not disputed. The issues to be determined are as to the respondent company's right to limit its liability under the sections of the Shipping Act referred to.\nThe Marwell Company was the owner of the dredge which was at the time in question under a charter by demise to the British Columbia Bridge and Dredging Co. Ltd. The dredge was not self-propelled and it was necessary to employ tugs to place her in position. Under a contract with the British Columbia Highway Toll and Bridge authority, the last named company (to be referred to as the Dredging Company) was preparing certain test holes in the bed of the Fraser River in connection with the intended construction of the Deas Island tunnel, which has since been completed, under the south arm of the Fraser River. The dredge had been moved to the Ladner Ferry slip on March 9th and on March 12th was moved into a position located approximately 1,200 feet from the Deas Island shore on the south and something more than 600 feet from the Lulu Island shore on the north. Between the position of the dredge, as thus located, and the shore of the Deas Island there was a pipeline carried on pontoons designed to carry the sand and other material removed from the bed of the river by the dredge to be deposited on the island to the south. The south arm of the Fraser is navigable by deep sea vessels and there is a great deal of traffic both ways in that portion of the river between the sea and the Port of New Westminster and places to the east which passed the site of these operations. The requisite permission had been granted to the appellants for the carrying on of the work and the stationing of the dredge and the pipeline in the river and no question arises as to this.\nThe respondent company carries on extensive operations upon the west coast and in the Fraser River, operating a fleet of tugs employed, inter alia, by logging and lumber companies in towing scows and rafts of logs. Captain Harwood was a qualified master of long experience and had been employed by the respondent company for many years. He was not apparently assigned to any particular vessel, being employed on any of the tugs operated by his employer to which he might be directed. He had been on a holiday for the two weeks preceding the date in question but was recalled on the morning of that day and instructed to assume command of the tug La Dene at Marpole on the north arm of the river and to carry out a tow to Bellingham. He took charge of the tug at about 2.00 p.m. At about 4 o'clock that afternoon Captain Edward Y. Taylor, the senior despatcher of the respondent company, learned that the scows which were to be towed to Bellingham would not be ready and, having communicated with another company, arranged with them to tow the scows V.T. 5 and the I.T. 41 from a place near New Westminster to Duncan Bay. Taylor spoke to Harwood at some time between 4.30 and 5.00 o'clock communicating to him the changed instructions, and thereafter the latter proceeded with the La Dene to the place where these latter scows were loaded, at or near the easterly extremity of Lulu Island, arriving there at about 6 o'clock. In taking the tugs in tow deep sea gear was used, the V.T. 5 being about 300 feet behind the tug and the I.T. 41 to the rear of it. The master estimated the total length of the tug and the tow as being close to 800 feet. The La Dene started on its voyage at 8.15 p.m. According to Harwood, the visibility was first rate and objects could have been seen at 8 or 9 miles. It is common ground that at some time during the afternoon of March 13 the respondent company received a written notice from the District Marine agent of the Department of Transport at Victoria dated March 11, 1957, entitled \"Notice to Shipping\" which stated that the hydraulic dredge Townsend would be operating in the main channel of the Fraser for approximately two weeks, anchored on the centre line of the Deas Island tunnel project approximately 1,000 feet from the Canada Rice Mills and approximately 600 feet north of the Deas Island dyke, and that a floating pipeline would extend from the dredge to Deas Island. Mariners were warned to pass to the north of the dredge and to exercise the necessary caution while these operations were in progress. On the evening of March 14 when Harwood left with his tow he was unaware of these facts, Taylor, whose duty it was to inform him having failed to do so.\nThere was a strong ebb tide at the time and with the river current together ran at the rate of approximately 3 to 4 knots. The speed of the tug with the tow was approximately 4 knots through the water, giving her speed over the ground of some 7 \u00bd knots. The dredge Townsend 115 feet in length and 36 feet in breadth was anchored headed upstream and carried two red lights suspended at a height between the two forward masts of the scow, two 1,500 watt floodlights at the front of the dredge, two deck lights and two 1,500 watt floodlights at the stern. On the pontoons carrying the pipeline there were 25 watt bulbs every 50 feet, these being some 22 in number, between the dredge and the shore. These lights were carried some 7 to 8 feet above the water.\nThe position of the dredge was in the Gravesend Reach of the river and the La Dene, moving downstream toward the sea, entered the reach at a place about 2 miles from the location of the dredge. While, according to Captain Harwood, he saw these lights, other than the red lights above mentioned, he thought they were the lights of the Ladner Ferry landing which was situate roughly 800 feet in a southerly direction from the dredge and which, it was shown, were of a substantially different nature, and he did not realize that the dredge and pipeline were in the position stated until he was about 400 feet distant from them. It was then clearly too late to avoid a collision between one of the scows and the dredge.\nCaptain Leonard Griffiths was the owner of the tug Jarl which was acting as tender for the Townsend. He saw the La Dene and the tow approaching when the latter was about 1\u00bd mile distant and realized that the course it was following would take it to the south of the dredge, that is, between that vessel and the Deas Island shore. Griffiths, whose evidence was accepted by the learned trial judge, first called the La Dene on the radio but got no response and started upstream to warn that vessel, making several attempts on the way to communicate with it on the radio without getting any answer. In addition, Griffiths directed that the front side deck lights of his tug be flashed repeatedly in an endeavour to attract attention, and tried to do so by using the search light but this was of no avail. He passed the La Dene as he went upstream to a distance of some 50 to 75 feet and thereafter attempted to assist the extrication of that vessel from its position by pushing the second of the scows to the north. These efforts proved unavailing and the first of the scows hit the dredge on the starboard side causing her to sink. Captain Harwood said that he did not see the Jarl or the signals made by her described by Griffiths and the radio on the La Dene was not turned on.\nUpon these facts the learned trial judge held that Harwood should have recognized that there was an obstruction in the channel on first entering the Gravesend Reach and found that he was negligent in failing to keep a proper lookout and in failing to appreciate the significance of the lights that were exhibited when he saw them, and that his failure was the sole cause of the collision.\nCaptain Harwood had said in his evidence that had he known of the presence of the dredge and the pipeline in the river he would not have attempted to take the La Dene and its tow down the river at all, and there was evidence by other masters to the same effect. There was, however, more than 625 feet of navigable channel through which the tug and tow could have been safely directed to the north of the position of the dredge, and the finding at the trial that the sole cause of the accident was the negligence of the master shows that the learned trial judge considered that this was the case and that had the master steered a course closer to the north shore the collision would have been averted.\nThe finding that the negligence of Harwood at-least contributed to the occurrence is not questioned by the parties to this appeal: the appellant, however, contends that the respondent has not satisfied the onus resting upon it of proving that the loss of the dredge and the consequent damage occurred without its actual fault or privity and that, accordingly, the limitation of liability permitted by s. 657 of the Canada Shipping Act is not available to it. Upon this aspect of the matter the learned trial judge held that if there was fault on the part of the respondent in failing to have communicated to Captain Harwood the fact of the presence of the barge and pipeline in the river, of which it had received notice on March 13, the negligence was that of a paid employee only and was without its \"actual fault or privity\" within the meaning of that expression in s. 657.\nSection 657 of the Canada Shipping Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 29, so far as it is relevant, reads:\nThe owners of a ship, whether registered in Canada or not, are not in eases where all or any of the following events occur without their actual fault or privity, that is to say,\n* * *\n(d) where any loss or damages is by reason of the improper navigation of the ship caused to any other vessel \u2026\nliable to damages \u2026 in respect of loss or damage to vessels \u2026 to an aggregate amount exceeding thirty-eight dollars and ninety-two cents for each ton of the ship's tonnage.\nThe history of the statutory provisions permitting the owners of vessels to limit their liability in this manner is to be found in Mayers\u2019 Admiralty Law, commencing at p. 161. In England the matter was dealt with in a statute passed in 1773 and later appeared as s. 503 of the Merchant Shipping Act 1854 and as s. 502 of the Act of 1894. In an Act Respecting the Navigation of Canadian Waters, passed as c. 58 of the Statutes of Canada of 1858, s. 12 provided for the limitation, and this was repeated in a slightly varied form in c. 29 of the Statutes of 1880, R.S.C. 1886, c. 79 and R.S.C. 1906, c. 113. Each of these Canadian statutes contained the expression \"actual fault or privity\" adopted from the earlier English statutes.\nI do not find any assistance in determining the meaning to be assigned to the expression where the ship owner is a limited company prior to the decision of the Court of Appeal and of the House of Lords in Lennard Carrying Co. Ltd. v. Asiatic Petroleum Co. Ltd.3 When that case came before the Court of Appeal4 Buckley L.J. said in part (p. 432):\nThe words \"actual fault or privity\" in my judgment infer something personal to the owner, something blameworthy in him, as distinguished from constructive fault or privity such as the fault or privity of his servants or agents.\nand Hamilton L.J. said in part (pp. 436-7):\nActual fault negatives that liability which arises solely under the rule of \"respondeat superior.\" \u2026\nIn the case of a company, the \"owners\" within the meaning of the section must be the person or persons with whom the chief management of the company's business resides.\nThe facts in that case were that the appellant company was managed by another limited company and J. M. Lennard who was a director of both companies was registered in the ship's register and designated as the person to whom the management of the vessel was entrusted. It had been found that Lennard knew or had the means of knowing of the defective condition of the ship's boilers which rendered her unseaworthy, but gave no instructions to the captain or the engineer regarding their supervision and took no steps to prevent the ship putting to sea with her boilers in that condition. It had been held at the trial that the owners had failed to discharge the onus which lay upon them of proving that the loss happened without their actual fault or privity. After referring to the language of s. 502 of the Merchant Shipping Act 1894, Viscount Haldane L.C. said in part (p. 713):\nNow, my Lords, did what happened take place without the actual fault or privity of the owners of the ship who were the appellants? My Lords, a corporation is an abstraction. It has no mind of its own any more than it has a body of its own; its active and directing will must consequently be sought in the person of somebody who for some purpose may be called an agent, but who is really the directing mind and will of the corporation, the very ego and centre of the personality of the corporation.\u2026 It has not been contended at the Bar, and it could not have been successfully contended, that s. 502 is so worded as to exempt a corporation altogether which happens to be the owner of a ship, merely because it happens to be a corporation. It must be upon the true construction of that section in such a case as the present one that the fault or privity is the fault or privity of somebody who is not merely a servant or agent for whom the company is liable upon the footing respondeat superior, but somebody for whom the company is liable because his action is the very action of the company itself.\nThe language employed by Buckley L.J., by Hamilton L.J. and by the Lord Chancellor which has been above quoted was approved and adopted in the judgment of the Judicial Committee in Robin Hood Mills Ltd. v. Paterson Steamships Ltd.5\nAt the relevant time J. C. F. Stewart, who had been in the employ of the respondent in various capacities for many years including that of general manager, was the vice-president of the company and in charge of its general administration. Rod Lindsay, the general manager of the company, was absent on a holiday in March of 1957 and Stewart was discharging his duties as well as his own. He was a director and, in answer to a question put to him in cross-examination, agreed that he was discharging the functions of a managing director at the time. Stewart said that he saw the notice to shipping referred to on the afternoon of March 13. It was proven that a second copy was given to Taylor, the senior despatcher, and Stewart said that it was the latter's duty to broadcast such notices so that the information would be in the possession of the respondent's vessels, all of which were fitted with telephonic equipment. The practice in the respondent's office was to have four such broadcasts daily, one of which would be made at 4 o'clock in the afternoon. According to Stewart, at about 3.30 in the afternoon of the 14th he went to the despatcher's office and asked Taylor if he had seen the notice. For some reason, objection was made to his giving evidence as to what then took place between him and the senior despatcher, which was clearly admissible on this issue, but he was permitted to say that as a result of what Taylor said to him he was satisfied that the notice was going to be put out over the air. He did not learn that this had not been done until after the accident later that day. Taylor, who was a qualified master who had been employed by the company as a despatcher for some nine years, said that he had seen the notice to shipping on the morning of March 14. He confirmed the evidence of Stewart that the latter had come to his office just before the 4 o'clock broadcast and had mentioned this particular notice and that he, Taylor, had told him that he had forgot to broadcast it on the earlier broadcast but would do so at 4 o'clock. It was apparently after the 4 o'clock broadcast that he spoke to Harwood on the telephone, the latter being then at Marpole, and he admittedly did not then communicate to him the contents of the notice. Taylor said that he did not think he had talked to the La Dene at the time of the 4 o'clock broadcast. It is not questioned that the information contained in the notice should have been communicated to the masters of the company's vessels operating on the Fraser River and, as Taylor did not know whether Harwood had heard the 4 o'clock broadcast clearly, he should have informed him.\nWhile it was the duty of the despatchers to communicate the contents of such notices to those in charge of the respondent's ships Stewart was unable to explain why he had spoken to Taylor on the afternoon in question regarding this particular notice. The learned trial judge, however, accepted his evidence and that of Taylor that this had occurred. He found as a fact that Taylor and the other despatchers were reliable, competent and certificated men and had performed their duties for several years; that Stewart had spoken to Taylor at about 3.30 p.m. taking the copy of the notice with him, and asked Taylor if he had seen it and had then been told that he had not informed the tugs but would do so on the next broadcast which was to take place in about half an hour and that:\nWith the assurance received from Capt. Taylor that he would inform all the tugs, Mr. Stewart left the Despatch Office and had no knowledge that the information had not in fact been conveyed until after the accident.\nAfter referring to the decision in the Asiatic Petroleum Company and Paterson Steamships cases above mentioned, the judgment reads in part:\nI think it is conceded here that the alter ego of this Company consisted of Mr. Arthur Lindsay, the President, or Mr. James Stewart, the Vice President and General Manager. Mr. Lindsay may be dismissed from consideration \u2026 It seems to me that just as Mr. Stevenson was the pertinent \"heart\" in the City of Alberni case (1947 Ex. Ct. Rep. 83), so I think is Mr. Stewart in the same position here \u2026\nThe fault lay with Capt. Taylor, the senior Despatcher of the Company, and a man of very considerable experience both ashore and afloat. But he has no interest in the Company. He is not a shareholder; he is an employee, albeit an important one.\nIn view of the principles I have referred to above, it seems impossible for me to say that the Company must be held in \"fault and privity\" to his neglect and thereby barred from the indulgence provided by the relevant sections of the Canada Shipping Act.\nThe evidence appears to me to support the finding that the \"directing mind and will\" of the respondent company was at the time in question that of Stewart. I have read with care his evidence and the exhaustive cross-examination to which he was subjected. It appears to me to be strange that Stewart should on the afternoon in question have particularly mentioned the notice to shipping in question to the senior despatcher when it was that official's duty to communicate the information to the masters of the various tugs which might be operating on the Fraser River. However this may be, the learned and greatly experienced trial judge who heard Stewart and Taylor give their evidence believed them and I can find nothing in the record to justify us in interfering with his finding as to their credibility. This being so, whether or not the failure to advise Captain Harwood of the fact that the dredge was operating on the river was a contributory cause to the collision, the respondent is not, in my opinion, deprived of its right to limit its liability under s. 657 of the Canada Shipping Act.\nIt is said for the appellants that the respondent's system was defective in that proper logs were not maintained upon the tugs and that, as the evidence shows, Captain Harwood paid scant attention to radio broadcasts which he appeared to regard as something in the nature of a nuisance. The tug was well equipped with means of maintaining close telephonic communication with the headquarters of the company in Vancouver and was equipped with radar which, if used as the tug entered the Gravesend Reach, would have disclosed the presence of the obstruction in the river, and it seems apparent from the evidence that, at least so far as Captain Harwood is concerned, the regulations of the company in this regard had not been enforced. However, none of these matters contributed to the event in my opinion in view of the findings of fact that have been made.\nI have read the judgment of the House of Lords in \"The Norman\" which is now available6, where neglect was found on the part of the owners of the trawler in that Hellyer, put forward by the owners as the alter ego whose actual fault or privity would for the purpose of the action be deemed to be theirs, had been negligent in failing to communicate by wireless to the trawler information as to a rock, the presence of which was not indicated upon the available charts and the existence of which had been discovered after the vessel had sailed. The decision does not, however, assist the appellant in the present case where it was Taylor's duty, and Stewart did give express instructions, that the masters should be informed of the presence of the obstruction. It is unnecessary to discuss further the facts of \"The Norman\" case which bear no similarity to those in the present matter, other than the fact that the rock, as the dredge, was a danger to navigation.\nA further question to be determined is as to the right of the respondent to limit its liability under the provisions of the Canada Shipping Act for the costs incurred by the appellant in removing the wreck of the dredge from the river following the demand made upon it by the New Westminster Harbour Commissioners.\nSection 13 of the Navigable Waters Protection Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 193, provides, inter alia, that where the navigation of any navigable water over which the Parliament of Canada has jurisdiction is obstructed by the sinking or grounding of any vessel, the owner of such vessel shall forthwith begin the removal thereof and prosecute such work diligently to completion. Under the terms of s. 16 as amended, if an owner has failed to remove such a wreck and the Minister has caused the same to be removed and where the cost thereof has been defrayed out of public money of Canada, the amount of such cost constitutes a debt recoverable by Her Majesty in right of Canada from the owner.\nFollowing the sinking of the \"Townsend\" the New Westminster Harbour Commissioners, having jurisdiction in the matter, by a notice dated March 21, 1959, addressed to both appellants, ordered them forthwith to remove the dredge Townsend which, it was said, was causing an obstruction to navigation in the Fraser River near Deas Island, on pain that if they did not remove the same, they would be held responsible for the resulting expense.\nThe appellants removed the wreck from the river and incurred expense in respect of which they claim to recover the amount of $108,039.06. The respondent claimed to be entitled to limit its liability and has been held entitled to do so by the judgment at the trial.\nSection 659 of the Canada Shipping Act reads:\nThe limitation of the liability of the owners of any ship set by s. 657 in respect of loss of or damage to vessels, goods, merchandise or other things shall extend and apply to all cases where without their actual fault or privity any loss or damage is caused to property or rights of any kind whether on land or on water, or whether fixed or moveable, by reason of the improper navigation or management of the ship.\nThis section is in the same language as that of an amendment made to the Merchant Shipping Act, 1894 (Imp.), in the year 1900.\nThe appellants' contention is expressed in their factum in these terms:\nThe appellants submitted in the Court below, and submit in this Court that the claim for removal of the wreck constitutes a claim for damages arising out of a tort committed by respondent. Appellants' obligation arose out of the Navigable Waters Protection Act, c. 140, ss. 14 and 16. Appellants submit that the claim is not one for damage to rights in any case because appellants have no right to have their vessel positioned in the bottom of the river. On the contrary they have an obligation both at common law and by statute not to position their dredger in the bottom of the river.\nIn dealing with the question the learned trial judge distinguished the claim from that asserted in The Stonedale7 upon the ground that in that case the claim was there advanced by the Manchester Ship Canal Company, a harbour authority entitled under the Manchester Ship Canal Act, 1936, to recover the cost of removing a wreck from the harbour. Such claim was not for damages for negligence, but was to recover upon the statutory obligation imposed by the Act. In the judgment delivered by Viscount Simonds in The Stonedale this is most clearly pointed out and he referred with approval to the judgment of Langton J. in The Millie8, where the claim was of the same nature and where it had been held that the limitation permitted under the Merchant Shipping Act, 1894 (Imp.), as amended, was inapplicable.\nOn the argument before us we were referred to the decision in The Urka9, to which the attention of the learned trial judge had not apparently been directed. That case was decided by Lord Sorn in the Court of Session. In a collision in Stornoway Harbour between The Urka and a coal hulk known as The Portugal, the hulk was sunk, due to faulty navigation on the part of the vessel, which was admitted. The owner's claim for the value of the hulk and the right to limit the liability in respect of that claim was admitted. A further claim was for the cost of removing the wreck of The Portugal on the demand of the Stornoway Harbour Commissioners, and it was held that in respect to this claim s. 503 of the Merchant Shipping Act, 1894 (Imp.), did not apply. Lord Sorn was of the opinion that the claim was not in respect of \"loss of damage to property or rights\", saying that when the owners of The Portugal incurred this expenditure they were neither rescuing their property nor vindicating their rights. The learned judge said that this was the identical question decided in The Millie.\nI am unable with respect to agree with this judgment or with the reasoning upon which it proceeds. After saying that the identical question had been decided by Langton J. in The Millie it is said that while in that case there was a direct liability of the owner and the liability in the case of The Portugal was indirect the learned judge was of the opinion that this made no difference. This would appear to overlook the fact that as pointed out by the learned trial judge in. the present matter and by Viscount Simonds in The Stonedale the only claim to which the sections of the Merchants Shipping Act permitting limitation of liability apply are those for damages for negligence and the claim of the Ship Canal Company was not such a claim. In my opinion the claim for the cost of removing the wreck falls within the terms of ss. 657 and 659. By reason of the sinking of The Townsend through the negligence of the respondent the dredge was lost and there was imposed upon the owners the statutory obligation to remove the wreck. This was a direct result of the negligent act and was in my opinion damage \"in respect of\" the damage to the dredge within the meaning of s. 657 and to the \"rights\" of the appellants within the meaning of s. 659. I can see no basis for a contention that to impose a legal liability upon a third person by a negligent act is not an infringement of his rights.\nI would dismiss this appeal with costs.\nCartwright J. (dissenting):\u2014For the reasons given by my brother Locke I agree with his conclusion that we cannot disturb the findings of the learned trial judge that the sinking of the dredge Townsend was caused by the improper navigation of the tug La Dene and its tow the scow V.T. 5 and that this occurred without the actual fault or privity of the respondent, the owner of the tug and scow.\nThe claim of the appellant, Marwell Equipment Limited, hereinafter referred to as Marwell, is set out in the statement of claim as follows:\n14. The Plaintiff Marwell Equipment Limited has suffered damages in the amount of $682,041.70, particulars of which are:\u2014\n(a) Loss of dredge \"Townsend\" \u2026\u2026\u2026..\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 $ 550,000.00\n(b) Pipeline and pontoon damage \u2026\u2026.\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 7,767.30\n(c) Loss of equipment on dredge \"Townsend\u201d at time of sinking \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026................. 28,239.06\n(d) Loss of spare parts and materials on \"Townsend\" at time of sinking \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.. 7,048.48\n(e) Loss of sandsucker including cost of removal\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.. 10,105.83\n(f) Loss of rentals from \"Townsend\" for period March 15th, 1957 to November 1st, 1957 \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026. 30,000.00\n(g) Premium overtime expended during construction of Dredge \"W. G. Mackenzie\" to replace \"Townsend\" for the purpose of meeting Deas Island committment. \u2026\u2026\u2026..\u2026\u2026 48,881.03\n15. The Plaintiff Marwell Equipment Limited has also suffered the loss of $108,039.06, being the expense incurred in removal of the wreck of the dredge \"Townsend\" from the channel of the Fraser River, including cost of salvaging scrap, less the amount recovered through sale of this scrap. On the basis of the findings set out in the first paragraph of these reasons the appellant does not appear to question the right of the respondent to limit its liability in respect of any of the items claimed which may be allowed by the registrar in assessing the damages other than the item of $108,039.06 the expense incurred by the appellant in removing the wrecked dredge from the river.\nWhile the learned trial judge left it to the registrar to assess the damages, it is implicit in his reasons and was not questioned before us that the damages which Marwell is entitled to recover from the respondent include the expenses of removing the wreck. In my opinion this is clearly the right view. In The Stonedale No. 110, Singleton L.J. says at page 176:\nIf those responsible for the management of a ship are guilty of faulty navigation (or negligence) which causes damage to others, the measure of damages is governed by the ordinary rule, i.e., they are recoverable if they are the natural and probable results of the wrongful act.\nIt appears to me that it is a natural and probable result of sinking a dredge in that part of the Fraser River in which the Townsend sank that her owners will be put to the expense of removing the wreck. Indeed the whole argument before us proceeded on the basis that Marwell can recover this item from the respondent; if it were otherwise the question of the respondent's right to limit its liability in regard to the item would, of course, not arise at all.\nIn my opinion the learned trial judge was right in rejecting the argument that the case at bar is governed by The Stonedale No. 111 or by The Millie12. The cardinal difference between those cases and the case at bar is that neither of the former was and the latter is an action for damages.\nThe expense of removing the dredge with which we are concerned is merely one item among those making up the sum total of damages for which, when the reference is completed, the appellant will have judgment against the respondent. The ratio decidendi of The Stonedale No. 1 and The Millie, that the amounts there in question were recoverable not as damages but as a statutory debt, has no application in the circumstances of the case before us.\nIn The Stonedale No. 1 Viscount Simonds after referring to the anomalies which exist in this branch of the law said at page 693:\nBut, having said so much about anomalies, I think it right to repeat that I found my opinion that the appellants have no right of limitation on the plain words of the statutes.\nIt appears to me that the solution of the question before us depends on the true meaning of s. 657(1) of the Canada Shipping Act which reads as follows:\n657 (1) The owners of a ship, whether registered in Canada or not, are not, in cases where all or any of the following events occur without their actual fault or privity, that is to say,\n(a) where any loss of life or personal injury is caused to any person being carried in such ship;\n(b) where any damage or loss is caused to any goods, merchandise, or other things whatsoever, on board the ship;\n(c) where any loss of life or personal injury is, by reason of the improper navigation of the ship, caused to any person carried in any other vessel; and\n(d) where any loss or damage is, by reason of the improper navigation of the ship, caused to any other vessel, or to any goods, merchandise, or other things whatsoever on board any other vessel;\nliable to damages in respect of loss of life or personal injury, either alone or together with loss or damage to vessels, goods, merchandise, or other things, to an aggregate amount exceeding seventy-two dollars and ninety-seven cents for each ton of their ship's tonnage; nor in respect of loss or damage to vessels, goods, merchandise, or other things, whether there be in addition loss of life or personal injury or not, to an aggregate amount exceeding thirty-eight dollars and ninety-two cents for each ton of the ship's tonnage.\nIn some judgments the draftsmanship of the corresponding provision of the English Act has been subjected to criticism but on a careful analysis the purpose and meaning of the sub-section appear to me to be reasonably plain.\nThe primary purpose is to provide that in certain specified cases the liability of the owners of a ship to damages for which they would be liable under the principle respondeat superior is to be limited to amounts ascertained by reference to the tonnage of their ship. All the cases are conditioned upon the wrongful act giving rise to the right of action for damages having occurred without the fault or privity of the owners. The specified cases are those in which all or any of the events set out in clauses (a), (b), (c) and (d) occur. Once it appears that one or more of these events has occurred without the actual fault or privity of the owners their right to limit their liability is established but the amount to which it is limited will depend upon the clause or clauses under which the event (or events) giving rise to the liability for damages falls.\nThe primary purpose of the clauses introduced by the words \"in respect of\" in the two places in which they occur in the subsection is to assign the appropriate amount of limitation having regard to the event (or events) which has given rise to liability; whatever may be the aggregate amount of damages recoverable at common law it is reduced to the aggregate amount set by the sub-section.\nIn the case at bar the appropriate clause is (d) and the limitation is $38.92 for each ton of the combined tonnage of the tug and scow.\nWhat then is limited in the case at bar is the aggregate amount of the respondent's liability to damages in respect of loss or damage to the dredge. The appellant's cause of action is for damages for the wrong done it by the respondent in damaging and thereby sinking its dredge by reason of improper navigation. The reason that it is entitled to have the cost of removing the wreck added to its other items of damage is that it is a part of the damages caused to it by the respondent's tortious act. The phrase \"in respect of\" as used in the sub-section appears to me to be at least as comprehensive as the phrases \"resulting from\", \"caused by\" or \"in consequence of\". I observe that the meanings given to the phrase \"in respect of\" in the Shorter Oxford English Dictionary, 3rd edition (1947) are:\u2014\"with reference to\", \"as relates to\" \"as regards\".\nIt appears to me that all damages which Marwell is entitled to recover from the respondent for having sunk and damaged its dredge, since to be recoverable at all they must in contemplation of the law have been caused by that single wrongful act, are necessarily damages in respect of that act. I cannot follow the argument that an item of damage awarded as being caused by a wrongful act is not awarded in respect of that wrongful act. I could understand (although I would not agree with) the argument that, since at common law the owners of a vessel sunk without any fault on their part were not bound to remove the wreck, the expense to which they were put in removing it for which, in the case at bar, they are liable only by virtue of the provisions of the Navigable Waters Protection Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 193, was not a loss caused by the wrongful sinking; but if this argument were accepted the result would be that Marwell could not recover this item of expense from the respondent and no question of limitation of liability would arise in regard to it.\nIn construing an ordinary English phrase such as \"in respect of\" in one statute only limited assistance can be derived from cases construing it in other statutes or documents.\nIn Tatam v. Reeve13, a Divisional Court composed of Bruce and Wright JJ. held that the words \"in respect of any contract\" were more comprehensive than the words \"under any contract\".\nIn Lord Glanely v. Wightman14, Viscount Buckmaster at page 629 and Lord Tomlin at page 632 appear to treat the phrase \"in respect of the occupation of lands\" as the equivalent of \"arising from the occupation of lands\"; at page 637 Lord Wright holds that before an operation carried on on the land in question can be taxed as not being \"in respect of the land\" it must be shewn that the taxpayer \"is there conducting some 'separate and distinct operation unconnected with the occupation of the land' \".\nOn the other hand, in Burger v. Indemnity Mutual Assurance Company15, the Court of Appeal held that the words in a marine insurance policy agreeing to indemnify the assured against liability \"in respect of injury to such other ship or vessel itself\" were not equivalent to the words \"in consequence of injury to such other ship or vessel\" and did not cover a sum which the owners of the vessel sunk through the insured's negligence had been obliged to pay for the removal of the wreck and for which they had recovered judgment against the insured; but that decision appears to me to have turned upon the special wording of the policy and particularly on the view that if the words quoted were construed as \"in consequence of injury to such other ship or vessel\" it would render otiose some of the terms of the contract which followed. However, I have gained little help from these cases in which the phrase \"in respect of\" has been used in other contexts and I rest my judgment on what appears to me to be the meaning of s. 657(1).\nFor the reasons given by my brother Locke, I agree with his conclusion that we ought not to follow the decision in The Urka16.\nI have not found it necessary to refer to the terms of s. 659 of the Canada Shipping Act, as in my opinion, the respondent's right to limit its liability is found in the words of s. 657 ( 1 ); certainly there is nothing in s. 659 to cut down this right of the respondent.\nIn my opinion if damages flow sufficiently directly from a wrongful act to be recoverable in an action in tort based on that act it is not possible to say that they are not damages \"in respect of\" that wrongful act. If they were not in respect of such act they would not be recoverable. I can see no more reason for denying the right of the respondent to limit its liability in regard to the item of $108,039.06 than in regard, for example, to items (f) and (g) claimed in paragraph 14 of the statement of claim, set out above.\nIn my view the item of expense with which we are concerned forms part of the damages for which the respondent is liable to the appellant in respect of the damage negligently done by the respondent's tug and scow to the appellant's dredge and the respondent is entitled to limit its liability accordingly.\nI would dispose of the appeal as proposed by my brother Locke.\nThe judgment of Martland and Judson JJ. was delivered by\nMartland J.:\u2014I agree with the conclusions of my brother Locke with regard to the respondent's right to limit its liability in relation to the appellants' claim for the loss of the dredger Townsend. With respect, however, I have reached a different conclusion concerning the appellants' claim to recover the expenses which they incurred in connection with the removal of the wreck. In my opinion the limitation provisions of the Canada Shipping Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 29, are not applicable to that claim.\nSection 13 of the Navigable Waters Protection Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 193, imposed upon the owner of the dredger the statutory duty to remove it. That section provides as follows:\n13. (1) Where the navigation of any navigable water over which the Parliament of Canada has jurisdiction is obstructed, impeded or rendered more difficult or dangerous by the wreck, sinking, lying ashore or grounding of any vessel or part thereof or other thing, the owner, master or person in charge of such vessel or other thing, by which any such obstruction or obstacle is caused, shall forthwith give notice of the existence thereof to the Minister or to the collector of customs and excise at the nearest or most convenient port, and shall place and, as long as such obstruction or obstacle continues, maintain, by day, a sufficient signal, and, by night, a sufficient light to indicate the position thereof.\n(2) The Minister may cause such signal and light to be placed and maintained, if the owner, master or person in charge of such vessel or other thing by which the obstruction or obstacle is caused fails or neglects so to do.\n(3) The owner of such vessel or thing shall forthwith begin the removal thereof, and shall prosecute such removal diligently to completion; but nothing herein shall be deemed to limit the powers of the Minister under this Act. R.S., c. 140, s. 14.\nSections 14 and 15 go on to provide:\n14. The Minister may, if, in his opinion,\n(a) the navigation of any such navigable water is obstructed, impeded or rendered more difficult or dangerous by reason of the wreck, sinking, partially sinking, or lying ashore or grounding of any vessel, or of any part thereof, or of any other thing,\n(b) by reason of the situation of any wreck or any vessel, or any part thereof, or of any other thing so lying, sunk, partially sunk, ashore or grounded, the navigation of any such navigable water is likely to be obstructed, impeded or rendered more difficult or dangerous, or\n(c) any vessel or part thereof, wreck or other thing cast ashore, stranded or left upon any property belonging to Her Majesty in right of Canada, is an obstacle or obstruction to such use of the said property as may be required for the public purposes of Canada,\ncause such wreck, vessel or part thereof or other thing, if the same continues for more than twenty-four hours, to be removed or destroyed in such manner and by such means as he thinks fit. R.S., c. 140, s. 15.\n15. (1) The Minister may cause such vessel, or its cargo, or anything causing or forming part of any such obstruction or obstacle, to be conveyed to such place as he thinks proper, and to be there sold by auction or otherwise as he deems most advisable; and may apply the proceeds of such sale to make good the expenses incurred by him in placing and maintaining any signal or light to indicate the position of such obstruction or obstacle, or in the removal, destruction or sale of such vessel, cargo or thing.\n(2) The Minister shall pay over any surplus of such proceeds or portion thereof to the owner of the vessel, cargo or thing sold, or to such other persons as are entitled to the same respectively. R.S., c. 140, s. 16.\nThe appellants performed the duty imposed upon them by s. 13. Had they not done so, the Minister of Transport could have caused the removal of the dredger, pursuant to s. 14, and the Crown could have recovered, as a debt, the cost of removal from the owner or from the respondent by virtue of s. 16 of the Act, the material portions of which provide as follows:\n16. (1) Whenever, under the provisions of this Part, the Minister has caused\n(b) to be removed or destroyed any wreck, vessel or part thereof, or any other thing by reason whereof the navigation of any such navigable waters was or was likely to become obstructed, impeded or rendered more difficult or dangerous,\nand the cost of maintaining such signal or light or of removing or destroying such vessel or part thereof, wreck or other thing has been defrayed out of the public moneys of Canada, and the net proceeds of the sale under this Part of such vessel or its cargo, or the thing that caused or formed part of such obstruction are not sufficient to make good the cost so defrayed out of the public moneys of Canada, the amount by which such net proceeds falls short of the costs so defrayed as aforesaid, or the whole amount of such cost, if there is nothing that can be sold as aforesaid, is recoverable with costs by the Crown.\n(i) from the owner of such vessel or other thing, or from the managing owner or from the master or person in charge thereof at the time such obstruction or obstacle was occasioned, or\n(ii) from any person through whose act or fault, or through the act or fault of whose servants such obstruction or obstacle was occasioned or continued.\nHad the Minister taken this course and claimed the cost of removal from the respondent, it would seem clear that, applying the reasoning of the House of Lords in The Stone-dale No. 117, the respondent would not have been entitled to limit its liability under s. 659 of the Canada Shipping Act. The relevant portions of s. 657 and s. 659 of that Act are as follows:\n657. (1) The owners of a ship, whether registered in Canada or not, are not, in cases where all or any of the following events occur without their actual fault or privity, that is to say, (d) where any loss or damage is, by reason of the improper navigation of the ship, caused to any other vessel, or to any goods, merchandise, or other things whatsoever on board any other vessel;\nliable to damages in respect of loss of life or personal injury, either alone or together with loss or damage to vessels, goods, merchandise, or other things, to an aggregate amount exceeding seventy-two dollars and ninety-seven cents for each ton of their ship's tonnage; nor in respect of loss or damage to vessels, goods, merchandise, or other things, whether there be in addition loss of life or personal injury or not, to an aggregate amount exceeding thirty-eight dollars and ninety-two cents for each ton of the ship's tonnage.\n659. The limitation of the liability of the owners of any ship set by section 657 in respect of loss of or damage to vessels, goods, merchandise, or other things shall extend and apply to all cases where, without their actual fault or privity, any loss or damage is caused to property or rights of any kind, whether on land or on water, or whether fixed or movable, by reason of the improper navigation or management of the ship.\nThe question in this issue is as to whether the respondent is in a better position in relation to the claim by the appellants than it would have been had the claim been made by the Crown for expense of the removal of the dredger by the Minister of Transport.\nThe learned trial judge held that the limitation provisions of the Canada Shipping Act did apply. His reasoning on this point is as follows18:\nIt seems clear that the Marwell Company only did what it was bound to do, and undoubtedly it has a claim against the defendants. The question is, however, whether the limitation clause applies to the defendant company. The nature of the claim for reimbursement of cost of recovering a wreck has been considered in several English cases, and it has been held that since the limitation section only limits liability for damages, and the right of the authorities who have incurred expense to collect from the owner, does not sound in damages, but is based on a statutory debt, the limitation section is no defence to the claim. The \"Stondale\" No. 1, (1954) P. 338: (1955) 2 All E.R. 689.\nHere, however, the claim is not by the harbour authorities, but by the owner. And there is nothing in the Navigable Waters Protection Act that gives the owner a new right to sue the wrong-doer, so that suit cannot be based on statutory debt. Equally there is no contractual relation, so it seems that any claim against the defendants must be based in tort; cf. the reasoning of Willmer, J. (the trial Judge), (1953) 1. W.L.R. 1241) as opposed to that of the Court of Appeal in The \"Stondale\" No. 1 (supra). I therefore see no escape from the conclusion that the Marwell Company can claim its outlays from the wrongdoers as part of its damages consequent on the negligence that caused the sinking; and that involves the limitation section in the Canada Shipping Act applying for the benefit of the defendant Company. I agree that if the Minister of Transport had caused the dredger to be removed, the recovery of this expense, pursuant to s. 16 of the Navigable Waters Protection Act, either from the owner or from the respondent, would have been the recovery of a statutory debt and there could have been no limitation of liability in respect of such a claim. The appellants' claim against the respondent in this case is for indemnity for the expense of performing the statutory duty imposed upon them in consequence of the fault of the respondent's servants. I do not agree that this leads to the conclusion that the limitation provisions of the Canada Shipping Act become applicable. The respondent is only entitled to the protection afforded by them if the appellants' claim is of the kind defined in them. As Viscount Simonds said in his judgment in The Stonedale No. 1, at page 691, with reference to The Merchant Shipping (Liability of Shipowners and Others) Act, 1900, s. 1 of which is the same as our s. 659 of the Canada Shipping Act:\nThat Act, by Part 8, dealt with the subject of the liability of shipowners, and I pause to observe that the right of a shipowner to limit his liability forms no part of our common law but is entirely the creature of statute and must be found within its four corners.\nThe position in this case is that, because of the negligence of the respondent's servant, the appellants, without any negligence on their own part, have been made liable for the performance of a statutory duty imposed upon them by the Navigable Waters Protection Act. They have been required to spend money for the removal of the sunken dredge. At common law, there being no negligence on their part, that duty would not have arisen (Dee Conservancy Board v. McConnell19). Had they failed to fulfil that statutory duty the appellants, as also the respondent, could have been made liable to the Crown under that Act for the expense of the removal of the dredge by the Crown as a statutory debt. That liability could not have been limited either by the appellants or by the respondent under the provisions of the Canada Shipping Act.\nSection 657 of that Act permits limitation of liability where, by reason of improper navigation of a ship, loss or damage is caused to another vessel, but only \"in respect of loss or damage\" to that vessel. In my opinion the words just quoted are not used to define the wrongful act of the shipowner whose vessel causes damage. They are used to define that kind of damage in relation to which, the wrongful act having occurred, he may limit his liability. This he can only do in the case of a collision between vessels (apart from claims for loss of life or personal injury) where the damages are for loss of or damage to the other vessel or the goods, merchandise or other things on board it or on board his own vessel. This is not a claim for that kind of damage. The language used in the section to define those kinds of damage: in respect of which liability may be limited is not broad enough to describe the statutory obligation to raise the dredger which arose as a result of the respondent's tort.\nI find support for my view of the limited meaning of the words \"in respect of loss or damage to vessels\" in s. 657 in the judgment of the Court of Appeal in Burger v. Indemnity Mutual Marine Assurance Company, Limited20. In that case, which involved the interpretation of a policy of marine insurance, the issue was as to whether the insurer's covenant, in the event of a collision by the insured ship with another ship, to pay \"in respect of injury to such other ship or vessel itself\" would include the amount which the assured had to pay for the removal of a tug which had sunk after collision with the insured vessel. The tug owners had had to pay the cost of removal to the river commissioners, who had removed it and then asserted their statutory power to recover the expense. The tug owners, in turn, had obtained a judgment against the assured. The Court unanimously held that the policy did not cover that expense. Dealing with the words of the policy quoted above, Vaughan Williams L.J., at p. 351, said:\nThe question in this case depends on the meaning of the words \"sums \u2026 in respect of injury to such other ship or vessel itself, or to the goods and effects on board thereof, or for loss of freight then being earned by such other ship or vessel.\" It seems to me that those words, which enumerate the subject-matters against which the underwriters undertake by the collision clause to indemnify the assured, taken as they stand, are clear enough, and need no explanation. I think that prima facie it is impossible to say that a sum of money which the assured has been compelled to pay in respect of the expenses of clearing the tideway of the Tees is a sum paid \"in respect of injury to such other ship or vessel.\" Section 659 only affords protection to a shipowner in respect of a claim for loss or damage caused to property or rights of any kind by reason of improper navigation or management of the ship. I do not read this as applying to any kind of damage resulting from the infringement of another's rights. The section does not so state. It limits liability for the infringement of rights in respect of a particular kind of loss or damage, i.e., loss or damage caused to property, or to rights. The \"rights\" referred to in this section must be rights which may be subject to loss or damage.\nThe claim with which we are concerned here is not one for damage to property. That was the subject-matter of the claim for the loss of the dredger itself to which s. 657 applied. Is it a claim for loss or damage to the appellants' rights? I do not think that it is. As previously stated, the substance of the matter is that as a consequence of the improper navigation of the respondent's tug a statutory liability was imposed upon the appellants by s. 13(3) of the Navigable Waters Protection Act. The only rights created under that Act were granted to the Crown and not to the appellants. I agree with the words of Lord Sorn in The Urka21, where he says:\nIn order to come within the words of the section, the pursuers' liability for this claim must be held to be a liability in respect of \"loss or damage to property or rights,\" etc. First of all, then, can it be said that the liability is in respect of any loss or damage to property or rights of the defenders, the owners of the Portugal, who present the claim? Obviously not. The Portugal was their property, but its loss is covered by their other claim, and this claim is not in respect of any loss or damage to property of theirs. Nor can it be said to be in respect of any loss or damage to any right of theirs. When they incurred this expenditure they were neither rescuing their property nor vindicating their rights.\nWas there then, as the result of the improper navigation of the tug, any claim in damages for damage to the property or rights of the Crown, as distinct from those of the appellants, which could make s. 659 applicable? Again I do not think that there was. It was on this phase of the issue that Lord Sorn in The Urka said that the matter had been determined by Langton J. in The Millie21. The judgment of Langton J. in that case has been confirmed by the House of Lords in The Stonedale No. 1, supra. In both cases it was held that the claim of the Manchester Ship Canal Company in respect of interference with navigation in the canal by reason of the sinking of a vessel was a claim for statutory debt and not covered by the limitation provisions of s. 1 of the Merchant Shipping (Liability of Shipowners and Others) Act, 1900, which, as already noted, is the same as s. 659 of the Canada Shipping Act. In the present instance, as evidenced by the letter dated March 21, 1957, from The New Westminster Harbour Commissioners to the appellants, the Crown's claim, in respect of the obstruction to navigation caused by the shinking of the dredge, was for the enforcement of the statutory duties imposed and of its statutory rights created by the Navigable Waters Protection Act and not a claim for damages for damage to its own property or rights.\nIn my view, therefore, s. 659 of the Canada Shipping Act does not enable the respondent to limit its liability in respect of this part of the appellants' claim.\nIn my opinion, the appeal on this point should be allowed and the appeal in respect of the question of limitation of liability regarding the damage to the dredger itself should be dismissed. I think that the appellants should be entitled to their costs in this Court and in the Court below.\nRitchie J.:\u2014I agree with the conclusions of Mr. Justice Locke with respect to the respondent's right to limit its liability in relation to the appellants' claim for loss of the dredge Townsend, but I share the view expressed by Mr. Justice Martland that the appellants' claim for the costs and expenses of removing the wreck is not one to which the limitation provisions contained in s. 657 of the Canada Shipping Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 29, are applicable.\nI would dispose of this appeal as proposed by my brother Martland.\nAppeal allowed in part with costs, Locke and Cartwright JJ. dissenting.\nSolicitors for the plaintiffs, appellants: Russell & Dumoulin, Vancouver.\nSolicitors for the defendants, respondents: Campney, Owen & Murphy, Vancouver.\n1 [1960] Ex.

Her husband and two other children remained in Hong Kong. During her stay in Canada, a son, issue of her marriage, was born to her. A deportation order was made against her by a special enquiry officer under the Immigration Act. This order was quashed by the trial judge, but restored by the Court of Appeal.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nThe applicant fell within the terms of s. 5(t) of the Act and of ss. 18 and 20 of the Regulations, and has not been deprived of her liberty except by due process of law. The fact that she was the mother of a legitimate child born in Canada had no bearing on the matter.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1], reversing a judgment of King J. Appeal dismissed.\nG.A. MacKay, for the applicant, appellant.\nD.S. Maxwell and N. Chalmer, for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE:\u2014This is an appeal by Mrs. Louie Yuet Sun from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario1 reversing a decision of King J. which had quashed a deportation order made against the appellant under the Immigration Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 325. As set out in the factum of the appellant, it appears that she is a citizen of China who came to Canada as a visitor in December 1957 by way of Hong Kong. She was in possession of a passport in which was entered a Canadian non-immigrant visa issued to her in Hong Kong. She had been allowed entry into Canada for a period of six months and later her permit was extended another six months to December 1958. She had come to Canada to visit her father and brother, who live in Ottawa. Her husband, a farmer, and her two children, remained in Hong Kong. She, who is now twenty-nine years of age, and her husband, who is thirty-one years of age, were married in China in 1948. On August 18, 1958, while she was in Ottawa, the appellant gave birth to a son, a child of that marriage.\nSince the permission she had received to enter Canada had expired, the appellant reported to an immigration officer as required by the Act. She was examined by the officer who made a report under s. 23 of the Act that it would be contrary to the provisions of the Act to grant admission to or otherwise let the appellant come into Canada by reason of her coming under the prohibited classes of s. 5, para, (t) thereof, in that she could not or did not fulfil or comply with the conditions or requirements of ss. 18 and 20 of the Regulations promulgated under the Act. Subsequently an enquiry was held by a special enquiry officer, who decided that the appellant might not come into or remain in Canada as of right and that (1) she was not a Canadian citizen; (2) she was not a person having Canadian domicile; (3) she was a member of a prohibited class described in s. 5(t) of the Act in that she could not and did not fulfil or comply with the conditions or requirements of the Act or the Regulations because: (a) she did not have an immigrant visa as required under subs. 3 of s. 18 of the Regulations; (b) she did not come within the provisions of subs, (d) of s. 20 of the Regulations. He accordingly ordered her to be detained and to be deported.\nKing J. held that the appellant was not a person within the meaning and intent of s. 5(t) of the Act because she had recently given birth to a child in Canada; the child being a natural born Canadian citizen had a right to live in Canada and was entitled to the love, care and attention of its mother. The mother desired to remain in Canada because she thought it would be better for the child. No reasons were given by the Court of Appeal but upon consideration I can see no basis for the judgment of the judge of first instance. If the appellant chooses to take the child with her, the material indicates that the Hong Kong authorities are willing to receive her and the child. If, on the other hand, she chooses to leave the child here, he is entitled to remain in Canada. It is not denied that the applicant falls within the terms of the relevant sections of the Act and Regulations, and, unless the fact that she is the mother of a legitimate child born in Canada affects the matter, she has not been deprived of her liberty except by due process of law. In my view that fact has no bearing on the matter.\nAny other points raised in the Courts below were abandoned before us. The appeal should be dismissed without costs.\nAppeal dismissed without costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: McMichael, Wentzell & MacKay, Ottawa.\nSolicitor for the respondent: D.S. Maxwell, Ottawa.\n[1] [1960] O.W.N. 476.\n"

At the hearing of the application before the Labour Relations Board, respondent endeavoured unsuccessfully to have the bargaining unit described to include all employees \"on the payroll of the Moncton plant\". Pursuant to the terms of an order made on June 26, 1959, the Board's secretary conducted a mail vote, but only respondent's employees resident and employed in New Brunswick were considered by him as eligible to vote. A majority of the said employees being in favour of the union as bargaining agent, the Board issued a certification order.\nThe respondent company obtained a writ of certiorari removing the matter to the Court of Appeal, which Court granted a rule absolute and quashed the certification order. The Board then appealed to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be allowed and the order of certification restored.\nPer Kerwin C.J. and Taschereau and Cartwright JJ.: The final order for certification correctly carried out the Board's previous direction as embodied in its order of June 26, 1959. The Board never intended and never ordered that the bargaining agent should include nonresident employees.\nThe New Brunswick Labour Relations Board can have no jurisdiction over persons residing and working outside that province so as to declare that they are part of the membership of a unit of the company's employees residing and working in New Brunswick.\nIn this case the Board not only had a right to be heard in Court but was entitled to make clear exactly what had occurred and as to the position it took on the question of its jurisdiction. The Labour Relations Board of Saskatchewan v. Dominion Fire Brick and Clay Products, Ltd., [1947] S.C.R. 336, referred to.\nPer Locke, Cartwright, Fauteux, Abbott, Martland, Judson and Ritchie JJ.: The certification order should be so interpreted that the Board intended to limit its application to employees working at respondent's Moncton plant. Therefore no constitutional question as to the competence of the Board to make the order can arise.\nThere was nothing in the record to establish that the appellant acted in excess of its jurisdiction or that it declined jurisdiction, and as the order of the Board was not attacked on any other ground it was not subject to review by the Courts in proceedings by way of certiorari.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick, Appeal Division1, granting a rule absolute for a writ of certiorari.

Maikin, for Local Union No. 76, Teamsters, Chauffeurs, Warehousemen, Helpers and Miscellaneous Workers.\nThe judgment of Kerwin C.J. and of Taschereau J. was delivered by\nThe Chief Justice:\u2014Upon the application of Eastern Bakeries Limited, a Justice of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick ordered the Registrar to issue a writ of certiorari directed to the Labour Relations Board of the Province for the removal into the Court of the Board's order of July 31, 1959, certifying Teamsters, Chauffeurs, Warehousemen, Helpers and Miscellaneous Workers Local Union #76 to be the bargaining agent for certain employees employed by \"Eastern Bakeries Limited, Moncton, N.B.\", and also the application for certification, and all proceedings upon which the said order for certification was based. Such writ was to be made returnable at the next sitting of the Court of Appeal at which time and place it was ordered that the Board show cause why the said certification should not be quashed or such order made as might seem right. The writ was duly issued the next day.\nThe application for the writ was supported by the affidavit of John G. Patterson, branch manager of the company's plant at Moncton, to which was attached as Exhibit A a copy of a letter to the company, dated June 9, 1959, from the Board under the signature of its secretary, John C. Tonner, notifying the company that the Board had received an application from the union for certification as bargaining agent affecting teamsters, chauffeurs, warehousemen, helpers and miscellaneous workers Local Union #76 and \"Eastern Bakeries Ltd., Moncton, N.B.\". The letter also enclosed a copy of the application and drew the company's attention to the Board's rules as to the necessity of the company filing a notice of desire to intervene to contest or not to contest the application and file a reply there-to. Exhibit B to Mr. Patterson's affidavit is a copy of the application which was made by the Local Union for certification as a bargaining agent pursuant to the Labour Relations Act of New Brunswick, R.S.N.B. 1952, c. 124, as amended. In answer to No. 4 on the form of application for certification reading:\nDescription and location of the bargaining unit which applicant claims is appropriate for collective bargaining and for which certification is desired,\nthe applicant gave the description and location of the bargaining unit as:\nAll employees of the employer employed as driver salesmen, spare driver-salesmen, special delivery drivers and highway drivers and helpers employed at the Moncton plant of the Employer.\nIn the application the union stated that the total number of employees in the unit which it desired to represent was fifteen and the approximate total number of employees in the work, undertaking, business, plant or plants involved was seventy-five. The number of employees in the proposed bargaining unit who were members in good standing of the union was stated to be twelve or a percentage of eighty per cent. Exhibit C to Mr. Patterson's affidavit is a copy of the reply of the company to the application. That reply alleges that the description of the bargaining agent was not appropriate but in the event of certification any bargaining unit should include all such employees of the company whether at Moncton or elsewhere and requested that the Board investigate and rule that the proposed bargaining unit is not an appropriate unit for collective bargaining. Exhibit D is a copy of the Board's order, dated June 26, 1959, defining the appropriate bargaining unit as \"all driver-salesmen, spare driver-salesmen, special delivery drivers, highway drivers and driver helpers employed by Eastern Bakeries Limited, Moncton, N.B.\". Exhibit E is a copy of the Board's order, dated July 31, 1959, certifying Local No. 76 as the bargaining agent \"for all driver-salesmen, spare driver-salesmen, special delivery drivers, highway drivers and driver helpers employed by Eastern Bakeries, Limited, Moncton, N.B.\".\nThe above being the material upon which the writ of certiorari was issued, the Board submitted, as an answer, \"the attached return, being the order for certification; the application for certification, the affidavit of John C. Tonner as to the proceedings taken before the Board, and the reasons for the same\". Exhibit A to the affidavit of John C. Tonner referred to is a copy of the application to the Board for certification,\u2014already filed on the application for the writ. Mr. Tonner's affidavit stated that at the hearing part of the proceedings were recorded by a recording machine and part of the proceedings were unrecorded. Exhibit B to his affidavit was a copy, certified by him as true, of the minutes of the hearing whereby it appeared that on that occasion the solicitor for Eastern Bakeries Limited stressed that the appropriate unit should be \"All Driver-Salesmen, Spare Driver Salesmen, Special Delivery Drivers, Highway Drivers and Driver Helpers on the payroll of the Moncton, N.B. branch of the Eastern Bakeries Limited\". The minutes also show that the Board directed that the appropriate unit would be \"all employees employed as driver salesmen, spare driver salesmen, highway drivers and driver helpers employed by Eastern Bakeries Limited, Moncton branch\". Mr. Tonner's affidavit further stated:\nThat during the hearing the Board advised Eastern Bakeries Limited that it considered it had no jurisdiction in other Provinces and for the purposes of Certification, any person employed and resident outside the Province of New Brunswick was not an employee within the meaning of the New Brunswick Labour Relations Act for purposes of the application.\nFollowing the hearing, the Board made an order defining the bargaining unit and directing a vote to be taken. The company furnished a list of employees\u2014twenty-two resident and employed in New Brunswick, three resident and employed in Prince Edward Island, and thirteen resident and employed in Nova Scotia. Pursuant to the Board's decision that employees resident in Prince Edward Island and Nova Scotia were not employees for the purposes of the application, Mr. Tonner, as returning officer, ruled that those persons were not eligible to vote and he conducted a vote by mail. His return certified that the number of eligible workers was twenty-two; that the number of votes cast was eighteen and that the number who voted \"Yes\" was fourteen and that four voted \"No\".\nThe Appeal Division of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick made absolute the rule and quashed the certification order of the Board. In the reasons for judgment it is stated that the secretary, as returning officer on the vote, certified the Local Union as the bargaining agent for \"all driver-salesmen, spare driver-salesmen, special delivery drivers, highway drivers and driver helpers employed by Eastern Bakeries Limited, Moncton, N.B.\". The reasons stated that the \"special delivery drivers\" classification which had been omitted from the direction of the Board of June 26, 1959, was included in its order for certification of July 31, 1959; and later that \"the wording used by the board to define the bargaining unit can be interpreted only as including in it the non-resident employees ruled ineligible to vote\". While in the minutes of the Board the words \"special delivery drivers\" are omitted in what is stated to have been the Board's direction, the order of the Board, dated June 26, 1959, signed by the secretary and issued as a result of the meeting of that date, does include them. Subsection (1) of s. 47 of the Labour Relations Act reads:\nAny document purporting to contain or to be a copy of any rule, decision, direction, consent or order of the Board, and purporting to be signed by a member of the Board, or the secretary thereof, shall be accepted by any court as evidence of the rule, decision, direction, consent, order or other matter therein contained of which it purports to be a copy.\nIn view of all the material before the Court, it appears to be clear that the final order for certification of July 31, 1959, correctly carried out the Board's previous direction as embodied in its order of June 26, 1959. The Board never intended and never ordered that the bargaining agent should include non-resident employees.\nHowever, the Appeal Division also decided that in the number of employees hired at the Moncton branch of the company there should be included not only those who resided in New Brunswick, but also those who resided in Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island. It is stated that the Attorney General of New Brunswick was named as an intervenant in the New Brunswick Court but there is nothing to indicate that he was represented before the Appeal Division. Because of the constitutional problem that might arise he, together with the Attorney General of Canada and the Attorney General of each of the other provinces, were notified of the proceedings in this Court but only the Attorneys General of Ontario, Quebec, Saskatchewan and Alberta appeared by counsel. The union had been allowed to intervene and counsel on its behalf filed a factum and appeared. All of these, except counsel for the Attorney General of Quebec, supported the appellant while the latter supported the position of the respondent in so far as the constitutional point might be involved.\nThere is no evidence as to where the hiring of the resident employees in Nova Scotia or Prince Edward Island occurred, but it does not advance the case for the respondent if it took place at Moncton. The New Brunswick Labour Relations Board can have no jurisdiction over persons residing and working outside that province so as to declare that they are part of the membership of a unit of the company's employees residing and working in New Brunswick. The fact of proximity in the present instance does not distinguish it from the case where employees of a company in Toronto may do work similar to that of other employees of the same company in the same category residing and working in Montreal. Such latter employees could not be included by an order of the Ontario Labour Relations Board under similar legislation in Ontario for the purpose of declaring a bargaining unit. The decision of this Court in Attorney General for Ontario v. Scott2 deals with an entirely different matter.\nThe Appeal Division considered that counsel for the Board should have refrained from involvement in the controversy. In The Labour Relations Board of Saskatchewan v. Dominion Fire Brick and Clay Products, Limited3, it was held by the majority of the Court that the Labour Relations Board of Saskatchewan had a right to be heard in Court. In this particular case the Board not only had such a right but was entitled to make clear exactly what had occurred and as to the position it took on the question of its jurisdiction.\nThe appeal should be allowed and the order for certification of the Board restored. No order as to costs was made by the Appeal Division in making absolute the order nisi and quashing the certification order; nor was any order as to costs made when that Court gave leave to the Board to appeal to this Court. The parties have agreed that there should be no costs of the appeal to this Court. The judgment of Locke, Fauteux, Abbott, Martland, Judson and Ritchie JJ. was delivered by\nAbbott J.:\u2014This appeal by the Labour Relations Board of New Brunswick is from a decision of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick rendered February 12, 1960, granting a rule absolute for a writ of certiorari and quashing an order of the Board given July 31, 1959, certifying Teamsters, Chauffeurs, Warehousemen, Helpers and Miscellaneous Workers, Local Union No. 76 (which I shall hereafter refer to as the union) as bargaining agent for certain employees of Eastern Bakeries Ltd., Moncton N.B.\nThe facts are these: On June 5, 1959, the union made application under the provisions of the Labour Relations Act of New Brunswick, R.S.N.B. 1952, c. 124, for certification as a bargaining agent for all employees of the respondent company employed as driver salesmen, spare driver salesmen, special delivery drivers, and highway drivers and helpers, at the Moncton plant of the respondent.\nPursuant to the provisions of the Labour Relations Act, and rules made thereunder, appellant gave notice of the application for certification to respondent, and hearing of the application was held on June 26, 1959, at which respondent was represented by one of its officers and by counsel. Respondent had filed a reply to the application, objecting that the proposed bargaining unit was not an appropriate unit, and also submitting that it did not have the requisite number of employees.\nIn its application for certification as bargaining agent, the union asked that the bargaining unit contain only persons \"employed at the Moncton plant of the employer\". At the hearing before the Board, respondent endeavoured to have the bargaining unit described to include all employees \"on the payroll of the Moncton plant\", but the Board refused to accept that description.\nAn affidavit of the secretary of the Board filed in the present proceedings states that during the hearing the Board advised the respondent that it considered it had no jurisdiction in other provinces and, for the purposes of certification, any person employed and resident outside the Province of New Brunswick was not an employee within the meaning of the New Brunswick Labour Relations Act, for the purposes of the application. The order of the Board, made on the same day as the hearing, defined the bargaining unit in the following terms:\nAll Driver-Salesmen, Spare Driver-Salesmen, Special Delivery Drivers, Highway Drivers and Driver Helpers employed by Eastern Bakeries Limited, Moncton, N.B.\nThe order directed that a vote be taken to determine the wishes of the employees concerned.\nIn a letter dated July 2nd from the secretary of the Board to the respondent, with reference to the vote which the Board had directed to be taken, it was stated:\nThe N.B. Labour Relations Board has directed that a vote be conducted in connection with the above-mentioned application. A copy of the Board's order is enclosed.\nThis vote will be conducted by mail and those eligible to vote are all Driver-Salesmen, Spare Driver-Salesmen, Special Delivery Drivers, Highway Drivers and Driver Helpers. Needless to say the vote will be limited to employees in the above classification employed in the Province of New Brunswick.\nIt will be necessary for you to provide the writer with a list of such employees, showing their addresses, at your earliest convenience. Your early attention to this matter will be appreciated.\nA copy of the Board's order of June 26 was enclosed with this letter. In a letter to the respondent's solicitor dated July 10 the secretary of the Board stated:\nAs you are aware the Labour Relations Board of New Brunswick has no authority to certify a bargaining agent for employees in any other province.\nThe material before us establishes that at the hearing the Board made a decision that it had no jurisdiction in other provinces and that for the purposes of certification a person employed and resident outside New Brunswick was not an employee for the purposes of the application. That ruling was made in the presence of representatives of both the respondent and the union.\nSection 55(1) (a) and (f) of the Labour Relations Act provide as follows:\n55. (1) If in any proceeding before the Board a question arises under this Act as to whether\n(a) a person is an employer or employee;\n* * *\n(f) a group of employees is a unit appropriate for collective bargaining;\n* * *\nthe Board shall decide the question and its decision shall be final and conclusive for all the purposes of this Act. There is no doubt that under s. 8(1) of the Act the Board could determine as a bargaining unit a group of the respondent's employees comprising those employees employed in New Brunswick at the Moncton plant. That is what the application of the union sought. That was the kind of group which, on the basis of its decision at the hearing, the Board had decided to certify.\nRespondent furnished appellant with a list of the names and addresses of employees of its Moncton branch, of whom 22 were resident and employed in New Brunswick, and 16 outside that province. Pursuant to the terms of the order, the secretary of the Board acting as returning officer, conducted a mail vote, but only respondent's employees resident and employed in New Brunswick were considered by him as eligible to vote. A majority of the employees to whom ballots were sent, were in favour of the union as bargaining agent, and on July 31, 1959, the Board made the certification order which is the subject of the present appeal.\nUpon the view (i) that the Board was entitled to include in a bargaining unit, certified under the Act, persons who reside outside New Brunswick and (ii) that the terms of the order should be interpreted as including in it nonresident employees ruled ineligible to vote, and thereby deprived of an opportunity to express their wishes, the Court below held that \"as the condition precedent to the exercise by the Board of its jurisdiction did not exist, the certification order was made without authority and should be quashed\".\nThe respondent operates plants at various points in New Brunswick and also a plant in Nova Scotia. It would no doubt have been preferable to include in the formal order the word \"at\" immediately before the words \"Moncton, N.B.\", but it is obvious from the correspondence between appellant and respondent which is in the record, from the proceedings before the Board, and from the vote subsequently taken, that there was no doubt in the mind of the parties but that the Board intended to limit the application of the order to employees working at respondent's Moncton plant and, with the utmost respect for the learned judges in the Court below who reached a different view, in my opinion the order should be so interpreted. It follows, of course, that no constitutional question as to the competence of the Board to make the order in question can arise here.\nSince preparing these reasons, I have had the opportunity of considering those of the Chief Justice. Had the Board attempted to include in its order persons working in another province, I share his view that the Board can have no jurisdiction over such persons.\nThere was no failure to give an opportunity to be heard, and therefore no question of jurisdiction can arise on this ground. The Act imposes no obligation on the Board to adopt any particular method in order to ascertain the wishes of employees to be included in a proposed bargaining unit. Section 8(1) provides only that the Board \"shall take such steps as it deems appropriate to determine the wishes of the employees in the unit as to the selection of a bargaining agent to act on their behalf\". In my opinion, there is nothing in the record to establish that the appellant acted in excess of its jurisdiction or that it declined jurisdiction, and as the order of the Board was not attacked on any other ground it was not subject to review by the Courts in proceedings by way of certiorari.\nI would allow the appeal and restore the order of the Board. It was agreed at the hearing before us that there would be no costs on the appeal to this Court.\nCartwright J.:\u2014I agree with the reasons of the Chief Justice and with those of my brother Abbott and would dispose of the appeal as they propose.\nAppeal allowed.\nSolicitor for the defendant, appellant: Eric L.

RS.C. 1952, c. 14, ss. 16, 64.\nAlleging that a debtor had, within three months of his assignment in bankruptcy, made to the defendant a payment which constituted an illegal preference, and alleging that the trustee had refused to institute proceedings in annulment, the plaintiff was authorized pursuant to s. 16 of the Bankruptcy Act to commence this action in his own name for a declaration that the payment was a fraudulent preference and for recovery of the amount. The plaintiff commenced the action some three years after the payment, but within the year of his obtaining a knowledge thereof. The action was maintained by the trial judge and by a majority judgment in the Court of Appeal. The defendant argued that as the plaintiff was the assignee, under s. 16 of the Act, of the rights of the trustee whose rights had expired by virtue of the second paragraph of art. 1040 of the Civil Code, since he had been appointed more than a year prior to the commencement of the action, the trustee had no rights to assign and the claim was prescribed.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed and the action maintained.\nPer Kerwin C.J. and Taschereau, Fauteux and Abbott JJ.: A creditor, in the circumstances of this case, is not the assignee of the rights of the trustee. What s. 16 of the Bankruptcy Act gives to the creditor is a right to be preferred over the other creditors; and this right, which the creditor exercises by his action, is given to him by the law and not by the trustee. Since the trustee never had this right, he could not assign it to the creditor.\nAssuming, without deciding, that art. 1040 of the Civil Code could apply, the action would not be prescribed as it was taken within the year of the creditor's obtaining knowledge of the payment.\nPer Locke J.: Article 1040 of the Civil Code has no application to the cause of action referred to in s. 64 of the Bankruptcy Act, when asserted either by the trustee or under s. 16 by a creditor claiming by virtue of an assignment. It was not \"by reason of anything contained in\" section 6 of the Code, being arts. 1032 to 1040 inclusive, that the creditor sought to recover and did recover. But it was as the assignee of the right of action conferred by s. 64 of the Bankruptcy Act, which right is given alone to the trustee. The Bankruptcy Act being silent as to the delay within which the action under s. 64 must be instituted, the action, in this case, was not prescribed. APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench, Appeal Side, Province of Quebec1, affirming a judgment of Casgrain J. Appeal dismissed.\nG. Dorion, Q.C., for the defendant, appellant.\nG. Pelletier, for the plaintiff, respondent.\nThe judgment of Kerwin C.J. and of Taschereau, Fauteux and Abbott JJ. was delivered by\nFauteux J.:\u2014En octobre 1953, la compagnie Garage Causapscal Limit\u00e9e, dont les ventes d'automobiles \u00e9taient financ\u00e9es par l'appelante suivant la pratique et le mode usuels, faisait cession de ses biens. A peine dix jours avant celui de la cession, l'appelante obtenait de la compagnie un paiement de $5,702.21. Cr\u00e9ancier de la d\u00e9bitrice pour une somme de $12,000, l'intim\u00e9, dont la r\u00e9clamation fut d'abord refus\u00e9e par le syndic et plus tard admise par jugement de la Cour, n'acquit la connaissance de ce paiement qu'en f\u00e9vrier 1956. Consid\u00e9rant qu'au regard, particuli\u00e8rement, des prescriptions de l'art. 64 de la Loi sur la faillite, S.R.C. 1952, c. 14, ce paiement \u00e9tait, en l'esp\u00e8ce, un paiement frauduleux, il somma le syndic de prendre des proc\u00e9dures pour en faire d\u00e9clarer la nullit\u00e9 au b\u00e9n\u00e9fice de l'actif. Celui-ci ayant refus\u00e9 d'agir, l'intim\u00e9 se pr\u00e9valut des dispositions de l'art. 16 de la loi pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e et obtint du tribunal une ordonnance l'autorisant d'intenter, en son propre nom, des proc\u00e9dures contre l'appelante. C'est ainsi qu'apr\u00e8s avoir satisfait aux exigences de l'art. 16 et aux conditions fix\u00e9es par l'ordonnance du tribunal, l'intim\u00e9 intentait, par voie de requ\u00eate \u00e0 la Cour sup\u00e9rieure si\u00e9geant en faillite, et ce, dans l'ann\u00e9e de la connaissance acquise de ce paiement, l'action en justice conduisant au pr\u00e9sent appel.\nL'appelante contesta et apr\u00e8s enqu\u00eate et audition, le Juge de premi\u00e8re instance fit droit au recours de l'intim\u00e9. Port\u00e9 en appel2, ce jugement fut confirm\u00e9 par une d\u00e9cision majoritaire dont l'appelante se pourvoit maintenant devant cette Cour, apr\u00e8s y avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 autoris\u00e9e.\nAu seuil de la consid\u00e9ration du m\u00e9rite de cet appel, il convient de noter les faits suivants. Il est admis aux plaidoiries que la d\u00e9bitrice a bien, dans les dix jours pr\u00e9c\u00e9dant celui de la cession, fait \u00e0 l'appelante le paiement en question. Il ne fait aussi aucun doute que si ce paiement doit \u00eatre retenu comme validement fait, il aura pour effet de procurer \u00e0 l'appelante une pr\u00e9f\u00e9rence sur d'autres cr\u00e9anciers, dont l'intim\u00e9. Enfin, la preuve au dossier supporte amplement, comme il est express\u00e9ment ou implicitement reconnu par les Juges de la majorit\u00e9 en Cour d'Appel, la proposition que la pr\u00e9somption de fraude \u00e9dict\u00e9e en l'art. 64 de la Loi sur la faillite \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de tels paiements, n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 repouss\u00e9e, ainsi qu'en a jug\u00e9 le Juge de premi\u00e8re instance.\nDans cette situation, il reste \u00e0 consid\u00e9rer le principal moyen soumis par l'appelante, devant les Cours inf\u00e9rieures et en cette Cour, et voulant que les proc\u00e9dures intent\u00e9es par l'intim\u00e9 soient tardives.\nSur ce point, l'appelante argumente comme suit. L'intim\u00e9, dit-elle, qui, au d\u00e9faut d'agir du syndic, a obtenu, en vertu de l'art. 16 de la Loi sur la faillite, le droit de prendre des proc\u00e9dures, est cessionnaire des droits du syndic et ne saurait avoir, en cette qualit\u00e9, plus de droits qu'en avait le c\u00e9dant. Or, poursuit-elle, lorsqu'\u00e0 la suite de l'ordonnance du tribunal, le syndic, se soumettant aux dispositions de l'article, d\u00e9clarait c\u00e9der ses droits \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9, le syndic \u00e9tait d\u00e9j\u00e0 et depuis l'ann\u00e9e suivant le jour de sa nomination en octobre 1953, d\u00e9chu du droit de poursuivre l'appelante si l'on applique, comme on le doit, le deuxi\u00e8me paragraphe de l'art. 1040 du Code Civil.\nCet article, visant sp\u00e9cifiquement les recours accord\u00e9s au cr\u00e9ancier par le Code Civil, dans le cas des contrats et paiements faits en fraude de ses droits, se lit comme suit:\n1040. Aucun contrat ou paiement ne peut \u00eatre d\u00e9clar\u00e9 nul, en vertu de quelqu'une dea dispositions contenues en cette section, \u00e0 la poursuite d'un cr\u00e9ancier individuellement, \u00e0 moins que telle poursuite ne soit commenc\u00e9e avant l'expiration d'un an \u00e0 compter du jour qu'il en a eu connaissance.\nSi la poursuite est faite par der, syndics ou autres repr\u00e9sentants des cr\u00e9anciers collectivement, elle devra \u00eatre commenc\u00e9e dans l'ann\u00e9e \u00e0 compter du jour de leur nomination.\nMais est-il bien vrai, dans le cas qui nous occupe, que l'intim\u00e9 soit, d'apr\u00e8s l'art. 16 de la Loi sur la faillite, le cessionnaire des droits du syndic. C'est l\u00e0 la premi\u00e8re question \u00e0 d\u00e9cider. Car si cette pr\u00e9tention, sur laquelle se fonde tout le raisonnement de l'appelante, est mal fond\u00e9e, il devient inutile de poursuivre l'examen des autres questions que soul\u00e8ve ce raisonnement. Cette pr\u00e9tention s'appuie uniquement sur la partie ici soulign\u00e9e du premier paragraphe de l'art. 16 qu'il convient de reproduire au long:\n16. (1) Si un cr\u00e9ancier exige que le syndic intente des proc\u00e9dures qui, \u00e0 son avis, seraient \u00e0 l'avantage de l'actif, et que le syndic refuse ou n\u00e9glige d'intenter ces proc\u00e9dures, le cr\u00e9ancier peut obtenir du tribunal une ordonnance l'autorisant \u00e0 intenter des proc\u00e9dures en son propre nom et \u00e0 ses propres frais et risques, en donnant aux autres cr\u00e9anciers avis des proc\u00e9dures projet\u00e9es, et selon les termes et conditions que peut ordonner le tribunal; et lorsque cette ordonnance est rendue, le syndic doit c\u00e9der et transporter au cr\u00e9ancier tout son droit, litre et int\u00e9r\u00eat dans les droits incorporels ou dans l'objet des proc\u00e9dures, y compris tout document \u00e0 l'appui.\n(2) Tout profit provenant de proc\u00e9dures exerc\u00e9es en vertu du paragraphe premier, jusqu'\u00e0 concurrence de sa r\u00e9clamation et des frais, appartient exclusivement au cr\u00e9ancier intentant ces proc\u00e9dures, et l'exc\u00e9dent, s'il en est, appartient \u00e0 l'actif.\n(3) Si, avant qu'une ordonnance soit rendue en vertu du paragraphe premier, le syndic, avec la permission des inspecteurs, d\u00e9clare au tribunal qu'il est pr\u00eat \u00e0 intenter les proc\u00e9dures au profit des cr\u00e9anciers, l'ordonnance doit prescrire le d\u00e9lai qui lui est imparti pour ce faire, et dans ce cas l'avantage r\u00e9sultant des proc\u00e9dures, si elles sont intent\u00e9es dans le d\u00e9lai ainsi prescrit, appartient \u00e0 l'actif.\nLes biens du d\u00e9biteur sont le gage commun de ses cr\u00e9anciers, et, dans le cas de concours, le prix s'en distribue par contributions, \u00e0 moins qu'il n'y ait entre eux des causes l\u00e9gitimes de pr\u00e9f\u00e9rence. Dans une faillite ou cession, l'art. 16, au refus du syndic de prendre des proc\u00e9dures au b\u00e9n\u00e9fice mais aux risques et d\u00e9pens de l'actif, accorde au cr\u00e9ancier diligent qui d\u00e9sire poursuivre en son nom et \u00e0 ses risques et d\u00e9pens, une pr\u00e9f\u00e9rence exclusive jusqu'\u00e0 concurrence de sa r\u00e9clamation et des frais. C'est ce droit de pr\u00e9f\u00e9rence que l'intim\u00e9 fait valoir par ses proc\u00e9dures. Ce droit, c'est la loi et non le syndic, qui le lui conf\u00e8re. Il diff\u00e8re, d'ailleurs, essentiellement de celui que le syndic, agissant pour la collectivit\u00e9 des cr\u00e9anciers, aurait pu faire valoir au b\u00e9n\u00e9fice de l'actif. Le fait qu'au soutien des proc\u00e9dures qu'il pouvait prendre, en l'esp\u00e8ce, le syndic aurait invoqu\u00e9, comme l'a fait l'intim\u00e9 dans celles qu'il a prises, le caract\u00e8re frauduleux du paiement, permet bien de dire qu'ils avaient tous deux un moyen commun mais non un droit et un recours identiques. N'ayant jamais eu le droit et le recours de l'intim\u00e9, le syndic ne pouvait le lui c\u00e9der.\nSous l'ancienne Loi sur la faillite, S.R.C. 1927, c. 11, ce m\u00eame droit de pr\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e9tait accord\u00e9 au cr\u00e9ancier par l'art. 69; mais c'est le syndic qui le faisait valoir en son nom pour le b\u00e9n\u00e9fice du cr\u00e9ancier, lequel fournissait un cautionnement pour l'indemniser de ses frais. L'article 16 de la nouvelle loi maintient ce droit de pr\u00e9f\u00e9rence, mais prescrit que l'action pour l'exercer doit \u00eatre prise par le cr\u00e9ancier personnellement et non plus par le syndic. C'est pour cette raison que le Parlement a, par l'art. 16, oblig\u00e9 ce dernier \u00e0 c\u00e9der et transporter au cr\u00e9ancier tout son droit, titre et int\u00e9r\u00eat dans les droits incorporels ou dans l'objet des proc\u00e9dures, y compris tout document \u00e0 l'appui, lorsqu'est rendue l'ordonnance autorisant le cr\u00e9ancier \u00e0 poursuivre. Cette obligation est une cons\u00e9quence et non une condition du droit de pr\u00e9f\u00e9rence et du droit de poursuivre pour l'exercer.\nAussi bien, et en toute d\u00e9f\u00e9rence pour ceux qui peuvent avoir l'opinion contraire, la pr\u00e9tention de l'appelante ne peut pas \u00eatre accept\u00e9e.\nDans ces vues, il n'est pas n\u00e9cessaire de d\u00e9cider si les d\u00e9ch\u00e9ances sp\u00e9cifiquement \u00e9tablies en l'art. 1040 du Code Civil pour des recours qui, s'apparentant \u00e0 celui qu'autorise l'art. 16, en diff\u00e8rent, peuvent recevoir une application en l'esp\u00e8ce. Mais assumant, sans le d\u00e9cider, que tel soit le cas, d'accord avec MM. les Juges Pratte et Choquette, je dirais que le point de d\u00e9part des d\u00e9ch\u00e9ances prescrites par cet article varie selon que la poursuite est intent\u00e9e par le cr\u00e9ancier ou par le syndic. Il s'ensuivrait alors que l'intim\u00e9 ayant poursuivi dans l'ann\u00e9e de la connaissance acquise du paiement frauduleux, son action ne saurait \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme tardive aux termes de cet article.\nJe renverrais l'appel avec d\u00e9pens.\nLocke J.:\u2014In my opinion, the provisions of art. 1040 of the Civil Code have no application to the cause of action asserted by the respondent and, on that ground, this appeal should fail.\nBy the petition addressed to the judge in bankruptcy dated October 9, 1956, the fact of the payment by the bankrupt to the appellant within three months of the date of the bankruptcy was recited. It was alleged that this constitued an illegal preference, that the respondent had asked the trustee to institute proceedings against the appellant which he had refused to do, and asked authority to proceed in the petitioner's own name for the recovery of the amount. The order made by Dion J., which authorized the commencement of the action, stated that it was made under the provisions of s. 16 of the Bankruptcy Act.\nThe petition filed on January 23, 1957, alleged that the proceedings were taken pursuant to leave granted by the last mentioned order, that within three months preceding the bankruptcy the bankrupt had paid to the appellant the sum of $5,702.01 and that this payment constituted a fraudulent preference, illegal and null as against the trustee, the creditors of the bankrupt in general and the respondent in particular: that at the date of payment the bankrupt was insolvent to the knowledge of the appellant and that the trustee had transferred to the petitioner all his right, title and interest in the claim on January 23, 1957. The claim for relief asked a declaration that the payment was a fraudulent preference and for recovery of the amount so paid, with interest.\nThe assignment from the trustee, so far as relevant, read:\nJe c\u00e9de et transporte au cr\u00e9ancier Emilien L\u00e9vesque de Ste-Florence, tous mes droits, titres et int\u00e9r\u00eats dans la r\u00e9clamation que monsieur Emilien L\u00e9vesque peut avoir contre Traders Finance Corporation et ce, en vertu d'une ordonnance du Tribunal autorisant ledit Emilien. L\u00e9vesque \u00e0 intenter des proc\u00e9dures en son propre nom et \u00e0 ses propres frais et risques contre Traders Finance Corporation.\nThe learned trial judge found that the payment had been made within three months preceding the bankruptcy, that the appellant was aware that the garage company was insolvent and declared that the payment was fraudulent and void as against the trustee and the respondent as his assignee.\nArticle 1040 of the Civil Code forms part of s. 6 of the third title of the Code and reads:\nNo contract or payment can be avoided by reason of anything contained in this section, at the suit of any individual creditor, unless such suit is brought within one year from the time of his obtaining a knowledge thereof.\nIf the suit be by assignees or other representatives of the creditors collectively, it must be brought within one year from the time of their appointment.\nThe learned trial judge considered that the limitation referred to in the first sentence of the article applied and that, as it had been shown that the respondent for the first time obtained knowledge of the payment within one year of the date upon which the action was commenced, the claim was not barred.\nIt was the contention of the present appellant that this was error in that it was the second sentence of the article which applied and that, since the trustee had been appointed more than a year prior to the commencement of the action, the claim was prescribed. This argument was rejected by the learned judges of the Court of Appeal3, other than by Hyde J. who considered that the appeal should succeed on the ground that the cause of action which the trustee purported to assign had been prescribed before the assignment to the respondent was given, that accordingly the trustee had no rights to assign and the action failed.\nSection 64 of the Bankruptcy Act reads in part:\nEvery conveyance or transfer of property or charge thereon made; every payment made, every obligation incurred, and every judicial proceeding taken or suffered by any insolvent person in favour of any creditor or of any person in trust for any creditor with a view of giving such creditor a preference over the other creditors shall, if the person making, incurring, taking, paying or suffering the same becomes bankrupt within three months after the date of making, incurring, taking, paying or suffering the same, be deemed fraudulent and void as against the trustee in bankruptcy.\n(2) If any such conveyance, transfer, payment, obligation or judicial proceeding has the effect of giving any creditor a preference over other creditors, or over any one or more of them, it shall be presumed prima facie to have been made, incurred, taken, paid or suffered with such view as aforesaid whether or not it was made voluntarily or under pressure and evidence of pressure shall not be receivable or avail to support such transaction.\nThe section in terms provides that a transfer of property of the nature and under the circumstances described is fraudulent and void as against the trustee in bankruptcy. The appellant misconceived the effect of the section in alleging in his petition that the transfer was illegal and null as well against the creditors of the bankrupt in general as against himself as a creditor. The right of action conferred by the section is to obtain a declaration that the conveyance is null and void and to recover the property conveyed, and that right is given alone to the trustee. It was as the assignee of that right that the respondent sued and was found at the trial to be entitled to recover. The limitation in art. 1040 is that no payment can be avoided \"by reason of anything contained in this section\" and it is not by reason of anything contained in section 6, being art. 1032 to 1036 and 1038 to 1040 both inclusive, that the respondent sought to recover and did recover. The article, therefore, in my opinion does not affect the matter.\nIt may be said that provisions similar to those contained in the articles of the Civil Code to which I have referred are to be found in statutes of most of the provinces of Canada. They are to be found in British Columbia in the Fraudulent Preferences Act, R.S.B.C. 1948, c. 132, in Alberta in the Fraudulent Preferences Act, R.S.A. 1955, c. 120, in Saskatchewan in the Fraudulent Preferences Act, R.S.S. 1953, c. 362, in Manitoba in the Assignments Act, R.S.M. 1954, c. 11, and in Ontario in the Assignment and Preferences Act, R.S.O. 1950, c. 26. All of these statutes deal with the rights of creditors to set aside conveyances made by persons in insolvent circumstances, which have the effect of giving a creditor a preference over the others and all of them provide that, in the event of action being brought within a certain period of the date of the conveyance, it is to be held null and void. The remedies thus given are quite distinct from those given to the trustee in bankruptcy under c. 64 of the Bankruptcy Act. The right to enforce such claims by creditors does not depend upon the fact that the person making the transfer has been declared bankrupt and these rights may be enforced under the provincial statutes unless bankruptcy has intervened. This has been held in a number of cases in various provinces, which are to be found collected in the 3rd ed. of Bradford and Greenberg on the Bankruptcy Act, at p. 158 et seq. In Quebec the limitation provided by art. 1040 only refers to proceedings under the articles mentioned.\nIf it were otherwise and art. 1040 on its face applied to the cause of action referred to in s. 64 of the Bankruptcy Act, when asserted either by the trustee or under s. 16 by a creditor claiming by virtue of an assignment, it would be necessary to consider whether the article was intra vires the Legislature of Quebec. The right of action is one given by a Dominion statute and the right of the trustee and his assignee to resort to the courts is a substantive right. Article 1040, if it applied, would deprive those entitled to assert that right after a defined period. It would be necessary to consider then the effect of the decision of this Court in Attorney General of Alberta and Winstanley v. Atlas Lumber Co. Ltd.3. There, a statute of the Province of Alberta which deprived the holder of a promissory note of his right of access to the court without permission of the Debt Adjustment Board, constituted under the Debt Adjustment Act, 1937, of Alberta, was held to be ultra vires. This aspect of the matter was not raised before the courts of Quebec nor argued before us and I accordingly do no more than draw attention to the fact that, in my opinion, that question would arise if art. 1040 applied to the facts of this case.\nI would dismiss this appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nAttorneys for the defendant, appellant: Dorion, Bernier & La Haye, Quebec.\nAttorney for the plaintiff, respondent: Georges Pelletier, Quebec.\n1 [I960] Que.

It was arranged that on his return home, the deceased would write to the officer to give him the names of the legatees and that a will would be prepared by a notary. The deceased wrote and signed a letter to the trust company in which he said \"\u2026 here are the names and addresses, with amounts for my will: \u2026 Please let me hear from you shortly\". This letter was never mailed and was found after the deceased's death in his home.\nThe letter was admitted for probate as a will by a judgment of the prothonotary. The plaintiff took this action to have it set aside. The action was maintained by the trial judge and his decision was affirmed by the Court of Appeal.\nHeld: The letter did not constitute a will.\nPer Taschereau, Abbott and Judson JJ.: To be a valid holograph will, a document must be written wholly in the handwriting of the testator and signed by him, must contain an actual disposition of property rather than a mere recommendation, and must reveal an intention to make a will then and there and not in the future. Dansereau v. Berget, [1951] S.C.R. 822.\nIn the present case, the letter contained no actual disposition of property. There was no animus testandi. It merely contained instructions for the preparation of a will to be made and signed at a later date.\nPer Cartwright, Fauteux, Abbott and Judson JJ.: The defendant, who was seeking to uphold the letter as a will, had the burden of establishing the animus testandi. This burden was not transferred to the appellant by the judgment of probate rendered by the prothonotary. Dugas v. Amiot, [1929] S.C.R. 600; Latour v. Grenier, [1945] S.C.R. 749.\nIn the present case, the defendant has failed to establish that the letter had the characteristics of a will.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench, Appeal Side, Province of Quebec1, affirming a judgment of Challies J.

O'Connor, for the plaintiff, respondent.\nThe judgment of Taschereau, Abbott and Judson JJ. was delivered by\nTaschereau J.:\u2014La demanderesse-intim\u00e9e Adelaide Winfrey a institu\u00e9 une action contre la d\u00e9fenderesse-appelante, dans laquelle elle soutient que la v\u00e9rification d'un pr\u00e9tendu testament fait le 29 juillet 1956, n'est pas l'expression des derni\u00e8res volont\u00e9s de son fr\u00e8re William Constantine Winfrey, que ce document est ill\u00e9gal et nul, et qu'elle est en cons\u00e9quence la l\u00e9gataire universelle de la succession du de cujus en vertu d'un testament ant\u00e9rieur, re\u00e7u devant Me Papineau Couture, N.P., le 22 ao\u00fbt 1955.\nLe testateur William C. Winfrey \u00e9tait domicili\u00e9 \u00e0 Dundee, dans le district de Beauharnois, et vivait sur une \u00eele dont il \u00e9tait propri\u00e9taire, et l'appelante \u00e9tait sa m\u00e9nag\u00e8re depuis environ une ann\u00e9e.\nEn 1955, William C. Winfrey fit son testament devant Me Papineau Couture, dans lequel il nommait le Montreal Trust Company son ex\u00e9cuteur testamentaire, et apr\u00e8s avoir fait quelques legs particuliers, il institua sa s\u0153ur Audie Winfrey Paquin sa l\u00e9gataire universelle. La validit\u00e9 de ce testament n'est pas contest\u00e9e, mais l'appelante pr\u00e9tend que par une lettre adress\u00e9e au Royal Trust \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al, portant la date du 29 juillet 1956, mais jamais mise \u00e0 la poste, il aurait r\u00e9voqu\u00e9 ce testament et institu\u00e9 l'appelante sa l\u00e9gataire universelle.\nAvant d'\u00e9crire cette lettre, William C. Winfrey s'\u00e9tait rendu \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al o\u00f9, cette fois, il avait rencontr\u00e9 M. Edgar Ramsay, l'un des officiers du Royal Trust Company, et discuta avec lui les clauses d'un nouveau testament. Il lui dit qu'il voulait que cette compagnie de fiducie f\u00fbt son ex\u00e9cutrice testamentaire, mais il ne mentionna aucun nom de b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire, sauf \"The Montreal Chess Club\" qui devait \u00eatre un l\u00e9gataire particulier.\nIl fut convenu qu'\u00e0 son retour chez-lui, Winfrey \u00e9crirait \u00e0 Ramsay pour lui donner les noms de ceux qu'il d\u00e9sirait gratifier, et qu'un testament serait pr\u00e9par\u00e9 par Me Campbell, N.P. de Montr\u00e9al, lorsqu'il aurait re\u00e7u les instructions n\u00e9cessaires. Me Campbell avait l'habitude de se rendre souvent \u00e0 Huntingdon, non loin de la r\u00e9sidence de Winfrey, o\u00f9 il pourrait lui soumettre le testament et le lui faire signer.\nMais, il est arriv\u00e9 que le 6 ao\u00fbt 1956, Ramsay n'avait pas encore de nouvelles de Winfrey, et \u00e0 cette date il lui \u00e9crivit pour lui demander de lui faire parvenir ses instructions. Ce dernier lui aurait cependant \u00e9crit une lettre le 29 juillet 1956, qu'il n'avait pas mise \u00e0 la poste, et qui fut retrouv\u00e9e par l'appelante apr\u00e8s la mort du testateur une semaine plus tard, soit le 7 ao\u00fbt, \u00e0 l'\u00e2ge de 84 ans. Cette lettre \u00e9tait ainsi r\u00e9dig\u00e9e:\nJuly 29th 1956\nTHE ROYAL TRUST\n105 St James St\nMontreal.\nDear Sirs,\nFollowing my visit of the 24th, here are the names and addresses, with amounts for my will:\nFriends Rose and Fred Martin, St Martin, Prov. Quebec 500.00\nMrs. Ruth Paquin, niece, of San Bernadino, Calif. 1,500.00\nThe Balance of moveables and immoveables, assets, etc., to Mrs. Evelyn Dini Molinary, of Winfrey's Island and Montreal, with recommendation to give my dogs good care and have masses and also prayers said and to make donations to Jesuit College and Father Gagnon of St. Agnes Dundee, Prov. Quebec.\nPlease let me hear from you shortly,\nSincerely,\n(signed) Dr. Willie Winfrey\nL'appelante pr\u00e9tend que cette lettre constitue v\u00e9ritablement une disposition testamentaire, et c'est ce document qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 v\u00e9rifi\u00e9 et dont la demanderesse-intim\u00e9e demande la nullit\u00e9.\nJ'ai eu l'occasion d\u00e9j\u00e0 d'exprimer mes vues sur la valeur testamentaire d'une lettre-missive, et dans la cause de Dansereau v. Berget 2, je disais qu'il ne fait plus de doute qu'une lettre-missive peut constituer un testament olographe valide qui n'a pas besoin d'\u00eatre entour\u00e9 de formules sacramentelles. En effet, du moment qu'un document est \u00e9crit en entier de la main du testateur, qu'il est sign\u00e9 par lui, qu'il contient une disposition de biens \u00e0 l'exclusion de simples recommandations, qu'il r\u00e9v\u00e8le chez son auteur une volont\u00e9 de tester, et qu'il n'est pas seulement un projet, alors il est v\u00e9ritablement un testament \u2026\nJe ne puis trouver dans la lettre qui fait l'objet du pr\u00e9sent litige, rien qui puisse me justifier de dire qu'il y a eu transmission de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 et que, comme cons\u00e9quence de cet \u00e9crit, le patrimoine de la pr\u00e9tendue l\u00e9gataire universelle, appelante dans cette cause, ait \u00e9t\u00e9 confondu avec celui du de cujus. Comme le dit le vieil adage romain, pour qu'il y ait transmission, il faut que le \u00abmort saisisse le vif\u00bb, et je ne crois pas qu'une semblable op\u00e9ration l\u00e9gale se soit produite ici.\nCette lettre, \u00e0 mon sens, ne constitue qu'un projet de faire plus tard un testament; elle ne contient que de' simples instructions \u00e0 celui qui est appel\u00e9 \u00e0 pr\u00e9parer le testament qui doit possiblement \u00eatre \u00e9ventuellement sign\u00e9. Le signataire de cette missive n'a pas entendu disposer de ses biens par la lettre m\u00eame, et il y avait encore dans sa pens\u00e9e beaucoup \u00e0 faire pour accomplir la transmission compl\u00e8te de ses biens. Il manque s\u00fbrement l'\u00abanimus testandi\u00bb. Il ne s'agit que d'un projet de volont\u00e9s que Winfrey comptait ult\u00e9rieurement faire figurer dans un testament dont il remettait \u00e0 plus tard la r\u00e9alisation. (Vide Baudry-Lacantinerie et Colin, 1905, 3\u00e8 \u00e9d., vol. 11, p. 46). Nous sommes en pr\u00e9sence d'une disposition en puissance, en \u00e9laboration, o\u00f9 l'acte d\u00e9finitif et n\u00e9cessaire n'a jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 pos\u00e9.\nLa lettre elle-m\u00eame r\u00e9v\u00e8le une absence totale de finalit\u00e9 dans les desseins du testateur. \u00abVoici\u00bb dit-il \u00ables noms et adresses pour mon testament\u00bb. Il s'agit \u00e9videmment d'un testament qui est \u00e0 venir. \u00abDonnez-moi bient\u00f4t de vos nouvelles\u00bb \u00e9crit-il au Royal Trust, sans doute pour que son projet devienne une r\u00e9alit\u00e9 et que ce qu'il se propose soit un fait accompli. Il ne mentionne pas les montants des dons qu'il a l'intention de faire ni des sommes qu'il d\u00e9sire affecter \u00e0 la c\u00e9l\u00e9bration des messes qu'il demande qu'on fasse chanter pour lui. Autant d'intentions vagues qu'il fallait pr\u00e9ciser avant que ne se r\u00e9alise finalement la dispositions de ses biens.\nAnnoncer simplement \u00e0 son ex\u00e9cuteur que l'on d\u00e9sire faire certaines dispositions dans un testament qui doit \u00eatre sign\u00e9 plus tard, ce n'est s\u00fbrement pas le faire v\u00e9ritablement.\nDans l'occurrence, il ne s'agit bien que du pr\u00e9lude d'un testament, de ce qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de n\u00e9cessairement l'acte par lequel on veut instituer des h\u00e9ritiers. Il n'y a rien de d\u00e9finitif, de finalement concr\u00e9tis\u00e9, (vide Laurent, vol. 13, nos 180-189) (Fuzier-Herman, R\u00e9pertoire du Droit Fran\u00e7ais, sup. vol. 14, p. 14, n\u00b0 358). C'est donc avec raison, je crois, que la Cour sup\u00e9rieure et la Cour du banc de la reine ont maintenu l'action de l'intim\u00e9e.\nL'appel doit \u00eatre rejet\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens.\nThe judgment of Cartwright, Fauteux, Abbott and Judson JJ. was delivered by\nFauteux J.:\u2014Le 7 ao\u00fbt 1956, W. C. Winfrey d\u00e9c\u00e9dait, \u00e0 sa r\u00e9sidence, dans le district de Beauharnois, province de Qu\u00e9bec. Aux termes d'un testament authentique par lui ex\u00e9cut\u00e9 le 22 ao\u00fbt 1955, il avait institu\u00e9 sa s\u0153ur, l'intim\u00e9e en la pr\u00e9sente cause, comme h\u00e9riti\u00e8re universelle r\u00e9siduaire. Apr\u00e8s sa mort, on trouva, chez lui, l'original d'une lettre dat\u00e9e du 29 juillet 1956 et destin\u00e9e au Royal Trust. Cette lettre, enti\u00e8rement \u00e9crite et sign\u00e9e de sa main, se lit comme suit:\nJuly 29th 1956\nThe Royal Trust\n105 James St\nMontreal\nDear Sirs,\nFollowing my visit of the 24th, here are the names and addresses, with amounts for my will:\nFriends Rose and Fred Martin, St Martin, Prov.

Quebec.\nPlease let me hear from you shortly,\nSincerely,\n(signed) DR. WILLIE WINFREY\nPr\u00e9tendant que cette lettre constitue un testament olographe sous forme d'une lettre missive, l'appelante, dont le nom y appara\u00eet comme b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire, obtint, par requ\u00eate pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e le 22 ao\u00fbt 1956, un jugement du protonotaire, pour le district de Beauharnois, v\u00e9rifiant cette lettre comme testament. Quelques mois plus tard, dans une action dirig\u00e9e contre l'appelante, et en laquelle Fraser et autres furent mis en cause, l'intim\u00e9e demanda \u00e0 ce que, par jugement \u00e0 intervenir sur cette action, il soit d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que cette lettre n'\u00e9quivaut pas \u00e0 un testament, que le jugement de v\u00e9rification rendu par le protonotaire est nul et sans effet, et qu'elle est elle-m\u00eame, en vertu du testament authentique ex\u00e9cut\u00e9 le 22 ao\u00fbt 1955 par Winfrey, l\u00e9gataire universelle r\u00e9siduaire de ce dernier.\nL'appelante contesta cette demande et, apr\u00e8s enqu\u00eate et audition, la Cour sup\u00e9rieure fit droit \u00e0 l'action de l'intim\u00e9e. Port\u00e9 en appel, ce jugement fut confirm\u00e9 par une d\u00e9cision unanime de cette Cour3. L'appelante en appelle de ce dernier jugement.\nLes circonstances en lesquelles cette lettre fut \u00e9crite apparaissent aux raisons de jugement de mon coll\u00e8gue M. le Juge Taschereau et il n'y a pas lieu d'y revenir.\nEn droit. La validit\u00e9 d'un testament olographe pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 sous forme d'une lettre missive est subordonn\u00e9e \u00e0 la preuve qu'en r\u00e9digeant et signant cette lettre, son auteur avait l'animus testandi, c'est-\u00e0-dire une intention r\u00e9fl\u00e9chie, arr\u00eat\u00e9e et d\u00e9finitive de faire une disposition de ses biens \u00e0 sa mort. Cette preuve incombe \u00e0 celui qui invoque la lettre missive. Le jugement de v\u00e9rification, rendu par le protonotaire, n'a pas eu pour effet, en l'esp\u00e8ce, de transf\u00e9rer cette obligation, quant \u00e0 la preuve, \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e qui r\u00e9pudie la lettre litigieuse comme testament.

It also provided for the transfer forthwith of the claims to C and that in the event that C should not duly exercise the option thereby granted, C would, at the request of L, retransfer the claims to L.\nIn an action for the return of the claims, L alleged that the letters patent of the mining company were actually signed, sealed and issued after October 1, 1958. C contended that under s. 133 of the Companies Act of Canada the letters patent, dated September 25, 1958, were conclusive proof that the company was incorporated on or before October 1, 1958. The dismissal of the action at trial was affirmed by the Court of Appeal. The appellant appealed to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be allowed, the order of the Court of Appeal set aside, and also all of the order of the trial judge except that part permitting the appellant to amend his statement of claim.\nPer Kerwin C.J. and Taschereau, Fauteux and Judson JJ.: Sections 11, 132 and 133 of the Companies Act when read together are concerned with the status and capacity of a company incorporated under the Act. Therefore the Court was not concerned here with any question as to the right of Parliament to provide for what shall be evidence in a civil case in a provincial court.\nThe rights of the appellant and respondent must be determined by the meaning to be ascribed to clause 7 of the original agreement between them, and the appellant was not precluded by the mere production of the letters patent from showing at the trial that the respondent did not exercise the option in accordance with its terms.\nPer Locke, Cartwright, Abbott, Martland and Ritchie JJ.: The fact that the letters patent were dated the 25th of September and the company had status as from that date for the purposes of the Companies Act, in no way precluded the appellant from adducing evidence to prove whether or not the option was exercised by the respondent in accordance with the terms of the contract. APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1], affirming a judgment of Collins J. Appeal allowed.\nJ. W. de B. Farris, Q.C., for the plaintiff, appellant.\nC.W. Tysoe, Q.C. and F. U. Collier, for the defendant, respondent.\nD.S. Maxwell and G. W. Ainslie, for the Attorney General of Canada, intervenant.\nL. Tremblay, Q.C., for Attorney-General of Quebec, intervenant.\nThe judgment of the Chief Justice and of Taschereau, Fauteux and Judson JJ. was delivered by\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE:\u2014This is an appeal by the plaintiff Felix Letain against a judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia1 dismissing an appeal from the judgment of Collins J. dismissing the action. After the pleadings had been delivered the defendant Conwest Exploration Company Limited applied under Order XXV, Rule 2, of the Supreme Court Rules 1943 of British Columbia to dispose of a point of law arising under the pleadings. Collins J. decided the point in favour of the respondent and being of the opinion that such decision substantially disposed of the whole action, he thereupon dismissed the action under Rule 3 of Order XXV.\nThe action arises out of an option agreement, dated July 26, 1955, between the appellant and the respondent therein called Conwest, whereby the appellant for valuable consideration granted an option to the respondent to purchase certain mineral claims. Clause 7 of the agreement reads as follows:\nIn the event of Conwest electing to exercise fully the option hereby granted, it may do so by causing to be incorporated on or before the 1st day of October, 1958, under the Companies Act of Canada, or under the laws of such other jurisdiction in Canada as Conwest shall choose, a mining company to which reference is herein made as the proposed company, with an authorized capital comprising three million shares, either without nominal or par value, or of the par value of $1.00 each, as Conwest shall decide. The proposed company, if incorporated, shall, in due course, be organized by Conwest, whereupon the said claims and such other mineral claims, if any, as Conwest shall elect, shall be transferred to the proposed company free of encumbrance. The agreement provided for the transfer of the mineral claims to the company to be incorporated as provided in clause 7 in return for fifty thousand shares of the proposed company. It also provided for the transfer forthwith of the claims to the respondent and that in the event that Conwest should not duly exercise the option thereby granted, Conwest would, at the request of the appellant, retransfer the said claims to the appellant. Other agreements were made later between the parties but their provisions do not materially affect clause 7 of the original.\nOn September 15, 1958, the respondent caused an application to be made under the Companies Act of Canada, R.S.C. 1952, c. 53, for the incorporation under the name of \"Stikine Asbestos Company Limited\" of a mining company such as was contemplated by the option agreement. The director of the Companies Division of the Department of the Secretary of State of Canada raised a question as to the use of the word \"Stikine\" in view of the incorporation of a company with a similar name under the laws of British Columbia in 1952. It was therefore arranged that the name \"Kutcho Creek Asbestos Company Limited\" should be adopted and that name was accepted by the director on September 25, 1958. In a letter bearing that date he advised the solicitors for the applicants for letters patent that the application for incorporation, with an amendment already agreed upon, \"has been recommended for approval under the name of Kutcho Creek Asbestos Company Limited and letters patent are being prepared upon the basis of their bearing date of September 25, 1958\". In a telephone conversation of September 26, 1958, between solicitors on behalf of the applicants and the assistant director of the Companies Division, the former asked that the name read \"Letain Asbestos Company Limited\", instead of \"Kutcho Creek Asbestos Company Limited\", and on September 29, 1958, that was confirmed in a letter from the solicitors to the director enclosing the consent of Felix Letain. That consent was subsequently withdrawn.\nOn October 1, 1958, the Director wrote the solicitors the following letter:\nIn connection with the application for incorporation originally received under the name of STIKINE ASBESTOS COMPANY LIMITED, which corporate name was amended to read KUTCHO CREEK ASBESTOS COMPANY LIMITED. As intimated in my letter of September 25, 1958, the application so revised was recommended for approval under the name of KUTCHO CREEK ASBESTOS COMPANY LIMITED and letters patent were being prepared on the basis of their bearing date of September 25, 1958.\nIn the interval, Mr. Lesage received a further telephone call in which you requested that the name should be further amended to read LETAIN ASBESTOS COMPANY LIMITED, which request was confirmed by your letter of September 29, 1958. A search of the records maintained by the department does not disclose the incorporation of any Canadian company under the precise name of LETAIN ASBESTOS COMPANY LIMITED.\nThere has been submitted in support of the application a consent to the use of the personal name \"Letain: as part of the corporate name executed by Felix Letain. However, I should be obliged if the consent of Mr. Letain were supplemented by evidence to the effect that he is to be predominant in the company, a circumstance of which Mr. Hill has verbally advised Mr. Lesage.\nAccordingly, the draft Letters Patent which have been prepared and approved have been amended so that the corporate name will read LETAIN ASBESTOS COMPANY LIMITED.\nOn October 15, 1958, the solicitors wrote the Director this letter:\nre: Letain Asbestos Company Limited\nIn view of the misunderstanding which has apparently arisen over rights to use the above identified corporate name, this letter is to request you to amend the application for Letters Patent so that the corporate name reads\nKUTCHO CREEK ASBESTOS COMPANY LIMITED\napproval of which was indicated in your letter of September 25, 1958. As indicated during our telephone conversations it is most important to our client that the Letters Patent document bear a date prior to October 1, 1958 and we would most appreciate your arranging for this to be the case.\nOn October 20, 1958, the Director wrote the solicitors:\nThe application for incorporation of KUTCHO CREEK ASBESTOS COMPANY LIMITED has been approved and letters patent will be prepared upon the basis of their bearing date of September 25, 1958.\nIn the Canada Gazette of November 8, 1958, appears a notice dated October 31, 1958, by the Under-Secretary of State that under the Companies Act letters patent had been issued under the seal of the Secretary of State of Canada to Kutcho Creek Asbestos Company Limited, giving the name of the incorporators, the head office, the authorized capital and under the heading \"Date\" appears \"September 25th, 1958\". It is stated in an affidavit filed in the proceedings that in the meantime a meeting of the first directors of \"Kutcho Creek Asbestos Company Limited\" was held on or about September 29, 1958, and a meeting of the shareholders immediately thereafter on the same day. The minutes are not before us. According to the material filed this is the usual practice when the applicants for incorporation of a company under the Companies Act of Canada have been advised that letters patent will issue bearing a certain date, but it is difficult in the present case, in view of the letter to the director of October 15, 1958, to understand how the meetings of a company \"Kutcho Creek Asbestos Company Limited\" could be held on September 29, 1958. However, in view of the conclusion arrived at, it is unnecessary to pursue the matter further.\nThe writ in this action was issued December 16, 1958, and the basis of the action as developed in the pleadings is that the letters patent were actually signed, sealed and issued after October 1, 1958, the relevant date mentioned in the agreement between the parties to this litigation. The provisions of the Companies Act referred to before this Court are s. 11:\n11. The company shall be deemed to be existing from the date of its letters patent.\ns. 132 and s. 133:\n132. In any action or other legal proceeding, the notice in the Canada Gazette of the issue of letters patent or supplementary letters patent under this Part shall be prima facie proof of all things therein contained, and on production of such letters patent or supplementary letters patent or of any exemplification or copy thereof certified by the Registrar General of Canada, the fact of such notice and publication shall be presumed.\n133. Except in any proceeding by scire facias or otherwise for the purpose of rescinding or annulling letters patent or supplementary letters patent issued under this Part, such letters patent or supplementary letters patent, or any exemplification or copy thereof certified by the Registrar General of Canada, shall be conclusive proof of every matter and thing therein set forth.\nCounsel for the appellant stated that s. 132 had not been referred to in the Courts below.\nThe above provisions when read together are concerned with the status and capacity of a company incorporated under the Act and while in response to a notice that a constitutional point might be involved the Attorney General of Canada and the Attorney-General of Quebec intervened and were represented by counsel, my conclusion is that we are not concerned with any question as to the right of Parliament to provide for what shall be evidence in a civil case in a provincial court. Kutcho Creek Asbestos Company Limited is not a party to this action; it continues to exist and not one of its powers is affected. The rights of the appellant and respondent are to be determined by the meaning to be ascribed to clause 7 of the original agreement between them and the appellant is not precluded by the mere production of the letters patent from showing at the trial that Conwest did not exercise the option in accordance with its terms.\nThe appeal should be allowed, the order of the Court of Appeal set aside and also all of the order of Collins J. except that part permitting the appellant to amend his statement of claim. The precise point of law raised by the application before Collins J. is that the letters patent referred to in paragraph 14 of the amended statement of defence are conclusive proof of the fact that Kutcho Creek Asbestos Company Limited was incorporated on or before the 1st day of October, A.D. 1958, under the \"Companies Act\" of Canada and the defendant having caused such a mining company to be so incorporated is a complete defence to the claims advanced by the plaintiff in this action. That point of law is decided in the negative. The appellant is entitled to his costs here and in the Courts below.\nThe judgment of Locke, Cartwright, Abbott, Martland and Ritchie JJ. was delivered by\nRITCHIE J.:\u2014The circumstances giving rise to this appeal are very fully set forth in the reasons for judgment of the Chief Justice, which I have had the benefit of reading.\nAs I understand the matter, the sole question before this Court is the determination of the point of law raised by para. 14 of the amended defence. By this paragraph the respondent, having recited that Kutcho Creek Asbestos Company Limited, a mining company which complied with the requirements of the option agreement referred to by the Chief Justice, was incorporated by letters patent dated September 25, 1958, went on to plead:\n14. (b) That, under Sec. 133 of the said \"Companies Act\", except in a proceeding for the purpose of rescinding or annulling said letters patent, said letters patent are conclusive proof of the fact that such a mining company was incorporated prior to the said 1st day of October, 1958. The point of law so raised was set down for hearing before Collins J. who adopted the view that as the terms of the option contemplated the incorporation of a company by the respondent in which the appellant was to become a substantial shareholder, the question before him must be determined on the basis that at the time when the option was granted both parties should be taken to have been aware of the provisions of s. 133 of the Companies Act which section \"should be applied in determining the rights and obligations of the parties arising out of the option in question.\" He accordingly granted an order dismissing the action with costs.\nSection 133 of the Dominion Companies Act upon which the respondent relies reads as follows:\nExcept in any proceeding by scire facias or otherwise for the purpose of rescinding or annulling letters patent or supplementary letters patent issued under this Part, such letters patent or supplementary letters patent, or any exemplification or copy thereof certified by the Registrar General of Canada, shall be conclusive proof of every matter and thing therein set forth.\nIn appealing from the judgment of Mr. Justice Collins, it was contended that s. 133 cannot be interpreted as meaning that the date specified in the letters patent is conclusive proof of the fact that the company came into existence on that date because this very fact is made the subject of a rebuttable presumption by s. 11 of the Dominion Companies Act which provides that: \"The company shall be deemed to be existing from the date of its letters patent.\"\nIn rendering the decision of the Court of Appeal of British Columbia, Mr. Justice Sheppard held that:\nThe result is that the express words of Sec. 133 exclude any ambiguity from the phrase in Sec. 11 and that intention so expressed can be given effect to by construing the phrase \"shall be deemed\" in Sec. 11 to be conclusive, save for those exceptions provided for in Sec. 133.\nIt was also contended before the Court of Appeal of British Columbia and before this Court that because s. 133 is grouped with other sections in the Companies Act under the heading \"Evidence\" it must be regarded as legislation in relation to evidence and that to the extent that it precludes the hearing of evidence in a provincial Court concerning a provincial contract it is ultra vires. As the requisite notice to the Attorney-General had not been furnished prior to the hearing in the Court of Appeal, Mr. Justice Sheppard held that the appellant could not contend before that Court that the section was ultra vires, but he went on to say:\nThe substance of Sec. 133 would appear to be primarily not evidence but those rights which are to flow from the charter and which are sometimes called the status of the company; such status in this company is a matter exclusively for the Parliament of Canada:\n***\nIn the result it was held that:\n\u2026Sec. 133 precludes the plaintiff in this action controverting the date of incorporation appearing in the Letters Patent, and the appeal should be dismissed.\nNotice of a constitutional issue raised in this appeal was duly served pursuant to order of this Court upon the agent for the Attorney-General of each province and upon the Attorney General for Canada wherein the issue was stated as follows:\n(1) In a civil action on a contract in any Province is a party precluded by virtue of Section 133 of the Companies Act of Canada from controverting the date of incorporation appearing on the Letters Patent of the Company incorporated under the said Companies Act of Canada?\n(2) If the answer to (1) is \"yes\", is the said Section 133 ultra vires of the Parliament of Canada or is the section merely inapplicable?\nThe Attorney General for Quebec and the Attorney General for Canada intervened and were represented at the hearing before this Court.\nI agree with Mr. Justice Sheppard that s. 133 in its substance and true character is primarily concerned not with evidence but with the status of companies incorporated under the Dominion Companies Act and that the status of such companies is a matter within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Parliament of Canada, but in my view this does not, by any means, conclude the issue in the respondent's favour.\nIt is true that by conclusively fixing the status and powers of a Dominion company as being those set forth in the letters patent, except in a proceeding brought for the purpose of rescinding or annulling such letters patent, s. 133 may have an effect on the rules of evidence in provincial Courts in cases where the status of a Dominion company is in issue but this is not legislation \"in relation to\" civil rights, it is rather legislation having an incidental and consequential effect upon civil rights and as such it is within the power and authority of the Parliament of Canada (see Gold Seal Limited v. Attorney-General for the Province of Alberta[2]). By its very nature, however, such effect is limited to matters which are incidental to the true character and subject-matter of the Dominion Companies Act and in a civil action in which the status and powers of a Dominion company are not involved it cannot be extended beyond the scope and purpose of that statute so as to preclude a party in a provincial Court from adducing evidence to establish that in fact the letters patent bear an earlier date than that upon which they were actually signed and sealed.\nKutcho Creek Asbestos Company Limited is a company incorporated under the authority of the Dominion Companies Act, endowed with the characteristics enumerated in that statute and in its letters patent granted pursuant thereto, one of which is that its date of incorporation is to be conclusively taken for all purposes of its corporate dealings and activities as being the 25th of September, 1958. The date of incorporation is one of the badges of a company's status and identity, it is an integral part of its corporate personality which flows from its charter as do the other ingredients of its status, the determination of which is, as has been said, a matter within the exclusive jurisdiction of Parliament. With the greatest respect, however, it seems to me that it is not the status of Kutcho Creek Asbestos Company Limited but the actions of the respondent Conwest Exploration Company Limited which are at issue in this case, and I am unable to see how conclusive proof of the fact that the former company has acquired status with effect from September 25th for the purposes of the Dominion Companies Act can preclude the appellant from proving whether or not the latter company exercised its option on or before the 1st of October. The only method of creating a body corporate under Part I of the Dominion Companies Act is for the Secretary of State to grant a charter by letters patent under his seal of Office (see s. 5(1)). If the charter so granted bears a date earlier than that upon which the Seal was affixed, then, by virtue of s. 133, the company acquires status with effect from the earlier date. The question here, however, is not whether or not Kutcho Creek Asbestos Company Limited is to be conclusively taken as having the status of a company incorporated on the 25th of September, but rather whether or not the respondent caused it to be \"incorporated on or before the 1st day of October, 1958\" within the meaning of those words as they are used in para. 7 of the agreement pursuant to which this action is brought.\nI am of opinion that the fact that the letters patent of Kutcho Creek Asbestos Company Limited bear date the 25th of September and that company has status as from that date for the purposes of the Dominion Companies Act in no way precludes the appellant from adducing evidence to prove whether or not this option was exercised by the respondent in accordance with the terms of the contract now sued upon, and I would accordingly dispose of this appeal as proposed by the Chief Justice.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the plaintiff, appellant: Hogan, Webber, & Woodliffe, Vancouver.\nSolicitors for the defendant, respondent: Guild, Yule, Schmidt, Lane, Collier & Hinkson, Vancouver.\nSolicitor for the Attorney General of Canada: Wilbur J.
