C.J., and Strong, Fournier, Henry, Taschereau and Gwynne, JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF QUEEN'S BENCH FOR THE PROVINCE OF QUEBEC (APPEAL SIDE).\n42 & 43 vic. ch. 4, sec. 1 (P.Q.), construction of\u2014Prohibition, writ of\u2014Sale of liquors\u2014Police regulation.\nUnder the authority of the Act of the Legislature of Quebec, 42 & 43 Vic., ch. 4, sec. 1, a penal suit was. on the 20th of January, 1880, instituted against P. in the name of the corporation of Q., before the Recorder's Court of the city of Q., alleging that \"on Sunday the 18th day of January, 1880, the said defendant has not closed, during the whole of the day, the house or building in which he the said defendant, sells, causes to be sold, or allows to be sold, spirituous liquors by retail, in quantity less than three half pints at a time, the said house or building situate, &c.\" P. was convicted\nA writ of prohibition, to have the conviction revised by the Superior Court, was subsequently issued, and upon the merits was set aside and quashed.\nHeld (Per Ritchie, C. J., and Strong and Fournier, JJ.),\u2014That the provisions of the Provincial Statute 42 & 43 Vic., ch. 4, ordering houses in which spirituous liquors, &c, are sold, to be closed on Sundays and every day between eleven o'clock of the night until five of the clock of the morning, are police regulations within the power of the Legislature of the Province of Quebec, and as the complaint was clearly within the Act, the recorder could not be interfered with on prohibition.\nPer Henry Taschereau and Gwynne, JJ., That the penalty imposed upon P. by the recorder was not authorized by the statute, even if such statute was intra vires of the Provincial Legislature, and that the prohibition was therefore rightly granted.\nThe court being equally divided, the appeal was dismissed without costs. APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench for the Province of Quebec (Appeal side). The following case was submitted to the Supreme Court of Canada;\n\"At its session of 1879, the Legislature of Quebec passed an Act containing the following enactments:\n\"Every person licensed or not licensed to sell by-retail in quantities less than three half pints in any city, town or village whatsoever, spirituous liquors, wine, beer, or temperance liquors, shall close the house or building in which such person dells or causes to be sold, on any and every day of the week from midnight until five o'clock in the morning and during the whole of each and every Sunday in the year; and during the same period no person shall sell or cause or allow to be sold or delivered, in such house or building, or in any other place, spirituous liquors, wine, beer, or temperance liquors, the whole under a penalty for each and every infringement of the present provisions, of a fine not less than thirty dollars and not exceeding seventy-five dollars and costs, and in default of payment of such fine, to an imprisonment for a period not exceeding three months in the common gaol of the district in which the said infringement occurred. \"\n\"On the 18th of January, 1880, the appellant was, and had. been for some time before, keeping a restaurant within the limits of the city of Quebec..\nu Being prosecuted by the respondent before the Recorder's Court of the city of Quebec for infringement of that statute, he pleaded to the jurisdiction of the court, and especially the unconstitutionality of the Act as being ultra vires of the Legislature of Quebec. He was, nevertheless, on the 17th of February, 1880, condemned to pay of fine of $40 and $1.65 costs.\n\" The appellant sued out and obtained a writ of prohibition to prevent execution of that judgment. \"It was proved in the case, that on the day mentioned in the conviction, viz., the 18th of January 1880 the appellant was keeping a restaurant within the limits of the city of Quebec, where he used to retail spirituous liquors in quantities less than a half pint, and that, although the said day was on Sunday, he had not kept his establishment closed.\n\"On that proof the Superior Court quashed the writ of prohibition.\nMr. F. Langelier, Q. C, for appellant:\nThis appeal involves the decision of two questions of law: 1st. Can a local legislature pass a law prohibiting the sale of spirituous liquors on Sundays and at certain hours of other days? 2nd. Does the statute of Quebec 42-43 Vic, ch. 4, sec. 1, punish the selling only of liquors within the prohibited time, or also the opening of the establishment where they are sold.\n1st. Can a local legislature prohibit the sale of spirituous liquors on Sundays and at certain hours of other days ?\nIt is now beyond all doubt that local legislatures cannot totally prohibit the sale of such liquors. This court in the case of the City of Fredericton v. The Queen ([1]), has laid down as a rule. 1st. That the power to enact such a prohibition cannot belong to both the local legislatures and the Parliament of Canada. 2nd. That it belongs to the Parliament of Canada; and that ruling has been confirmed by the Privy Council in the case of Russell v. The Queen ([2]).\nThere would be no difficulty, therefore, if the statute in question contained a complete prohibition; but it is contended that the ruling of this court cannot apply to it because it does not prohibit but only restricts the sale of spirituous liquors. I submit that this is a mere quibble. A restriction is a partial prohibition; in the present case the prohibition is for Sundays and for certain hours of other days. If this reasoning was to prevail, nothing would be easier for a local legislature than to encroach upon the exclusive power of the Parliament of Canada to prohibit such trade; all they would have to do would be to prohibit the sale at all times save a few minutes every day, or every week.\nIt has been contended that such a statute is within the class of local statutes or of statutes concerning municipal institutions.\nEven were that true it would not affect the question at issue. That statute unquestionably deals with and regulates a certain trade or commerce. Therefore according to the decision in the case of Fredericton, it cannot be considered as being within the powers of local legislatures\nBut it is not true that the statute in question is a mere municipal regulation, or a law of a local nature. It is admitted to be intended to repress intemperance, to prevent drunkenness; therefore its object is one of general interest; intemp\u00e9rance and drunkenness are just as much evils in Halifax as in Quebec.\nIf the object of the law is of general interest, are the means enacted for that purpose of a local nature ? Not at all; those means consist in compelling those who sell spirituous liquors by retail, to close their establishments at certain times, and in preventing them from selling within certain hours. Now there is nothing local in those means; they would be just as effective at Winnipeg as at Charlottown. Russell v. The Queen ([3]).\nThe power to enact such a law is not included in the power given to local legislatures to regulate municipal institutions. The object of such institutions is to give to each. locality the particular regulations required by its local wants. No municipal institutions would. be needed if the making and keeping of roads, bridges, the prevention of abuses prejudicial to agriculture, could be regulated in the same manner all over the country. But they are necessary on account of the fact that a special regulation is required for each locality,\nMy second point is that even under the statute (if constitutional) the conviction is illegal.\nThe object of the statute is the prevention of drunkenness on Sundays. The means adopted to arrive at it consist in prohibiting the sale on such days of intoxicating liquors. Therefore, what it must punish is the selling, not the keeping open of the establishments where such liquors are sold. The order given to close them is only to secure the non-selling it is a mere directory enactment. Knowing that there is more danger of liquor being sold there than elsewhere, it is directed that those establishments must be kept closed.\nSo much for the spirit of the law The letter of the statute is in accordance with it. It orders first the closing of establishments where spirituous liquors are retailed, but enacts no penalty against those who keep them open. Then in another sentence it forbids the selling of such liquors either in those establishments, or in any other place under a penalty of $30 to $75 for every infrinsceriment of the present provisions. The present provisions are those prohibiting the selling, the causing to be sold, the allowing? to be sold the allowing to be delivered, spirituous liquors.\nThe statute being a penal law, it is needless to say that it cannot be extended from one case to another; the penalty it inflicts cannot be imposed for an offence for which it does not enact it\nMr. C. P. Pelletier', Q. C., for respondent:\nThe writ of prohibition is an extraordinary remedy. which cannot be used as collateral if there exists any other recourse. In the present instance, the law (42-43 Vict., ch. 4 sec. 3) seems desirous to admit such recourse, by enacting: that if a writ of certiorari is issued to have a conviction rendered under the said law revised by the Superior Court, the party convicted shall be obliged to deposit into the hands of the clerk of the inferior court the amount of the fine and costs\nThe writ of prohibition, moreover, cannot be issued after conviction, unless the want of jurisdiction of the inferior tribunal appears upon the face of the record. See High, Extraordinary Legal Remedies ([4]).\nThen as to appellant's contention that the only fact of not closing his tavern during the time prescribed for that by the statute does not constitute an offence and that according to the wording of the statute there is no offence if there is not at the same time a sale of liquors. Such pretension will be found not maintainable, if we merely refer to the preamble of the statute above cited 42\u201443 Vic. ch. 4 which reads as follows:\n\" Whereas doubts have arisen with respect to the right of certain city and town corporations, in virtue of the laws and statutes relating to them, to compel tavern keepers to close their taverns at certain hours of the day; and whereas it is expedient to dispel such doubts, and to clearly define and extend the powers which the said corporations should possess: Wherefore, &c., &c.\"\nBefore the other courts, the appellant has pretended not only that to establish an offence it would have been necessary for the respondent to prove a sale of liquors but he has also pretended that the Legislature of Quebec had no right to prohibit the sale of intoxicating liquors on Sundays. As the complaint in this case is only \" for not having closed,\" and not for \" having sold,\" if the statute is interpreted as making an offence of the mere fact of \" not closing,\" and if the conviction against the appellant is found to be valid, it is of little moment, for the ends of this case to consider the question of the prohibition of selling liquor on Sundays.\nHowever, as that incidental question has been strongly dwelt upon before the other Courts, and as the other courts have considered it with much attention it may be convenient also to consider it just now.\nAlthough the Parliament of Canada, under the power given to it to regulate trade and commerce alone, has the power to prohibit the trade in intoxicating liquors, yet the provincial legislatures, under the power given to them, may for the preservation of good order in the municipalities which they are empowered to establish and which are under their control, make reasonable police regulations, may to some extent interfere with the sale of spirituous liquors;\nThe provisions of the provincial statute 42-43 Vic., ch. 4, ordering houses in which spiritous liquors, etc., are sold to be closed on Sundays and every day between eleven o'clock of the night until five of the clock of the morning, are police regulations within the power of the legislature of the Province of Quebec\nThe reasons for arriving at this conclusion are fully stated by the Chief Justice Meredith in the case of Blouin v. The Corporation of the City of Quebec ([5]), and I rely upon that decision.\nRITCHIE, C. J.:\u2014\nI cannot see how it can be said that prohibition will not lie without first determining whether the Act is ultra vires or not, for if the Act is ultra vires, then I can see no reason why prohibition would not be a proper remedy, because there could then be no pretence that the Recorder's Court could have jurisdiction over an offence alleged to be created by a statute which had no legal existence; but holding the Act to be intra vires, I fully appreciate the position taken by Mr. Justice Ramsay, that the Recorder's Court having jurisdiction over the subject-matter legislated on, however badly it may judge, it cannot be stopped by prohibition, on the pretext that it has misconstrued the Act.\nMr. Justice Ramsay clearly acted on this view, for before holding that prohibition would not lie, he expressly held that the Local Legislature had authority to prohibit or regulate the sale of liquors in saloons or taverns on Sundays, or at particular times, as being purely a matter of police regulation, and consequently within the powers of municipal corporations.\nWhen in the case of Regina and the Justices of Kings ([6]), I was called upon to adjudicate on the right of the Provincial Legislatures to prohibit absolutely the sale of spirituous liquors, and I arrived at the conclusion that the legislative power to do this rested with the Dominion Parliament, I advisedly and carefully guarded the enunciation of that conclusion in these words: \" We by no means wish to be understood that the Local Legislatures have not the power of making such regulations for the government of saloons, licensed taverns, &c., and sale of spirituous liquors in public places, as would tend to the preservation of good order and prevention of disorderly conduct, rioting or breaches of the peace. In such cases, and possibly others of a similar character, the regulations would have nothing to do with trade or commerce, but with good order and local government, matters of municipal police and not of commerce and which municipal institutions are peculiarly competent to manage and regulate.\" I still think, as I did then, that a provision such. as section 1 of the 42 and 48 Vic., ch. 4, Quebec Act, is within the legislative authority of the Provincial Legislature, as being simply a local police regulation, and which the Local Legislature has, as incident to its power to legislate on matters in relation to municipal institutions, a right to enact.\nAs at the time of the passing of this Act and at the time of the committing of and conviction for the alleged breach of the law, there was no Dominion legislation contravening in any way the provisions of this provincial law, it is not necessary, for the purposes of deciding this case, to inquire or determine if, and in what particulars and to what extent, the legislation of either will prevail over that of the other, when the Dominion Parliament, is legislating for the peace, good order, &c, of the Dominion\u2014or on the subject of trade and commerce in connection with the traffic in intoxicating liquors\u2014should the Dominion legislation conflict with the Provincial.\nIn the view I take of the inapplicability of the remedy by prohibition, the Act being, in my opinion, intra vires, it is unnecessary to express any opinion as to the construction of the 1st sec, 42 and 43 V\u00efc., ch. 4, though I by no means wish it to be understood that I think the construction placed on the statute by the Recorder's Court incorrect. I merely express no opinion on it, as not being necessary for the determination of the case before us\nSTRONG, J.:\u2014\nI agree with the Chief Justice that the attempt to impeach the constitutional validity of the statute under which the appellant was convicted, as being ultra vires of the Legislature of the Province of Quebec, altogether fails. In the Queen v. Taylor ([7]), I expressed ray concurrence in the d\u00e9cision of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick, in -the case of the Justices of Kings, in which it was held that under the authority conferred by the British North America Act to legislate respecting Municipal Institutions, the Provincial Legislature possessed that power generally denominated the police power, to regulate the sale of spirituous and intoxicating liquors, and I adhere to that opinion. Then, I think that this appeal must be disposed of without pronouncing any opinion upon the question of statutory interpretation which was argued before us, for it is plain, as I read the authorities, that this is not a case in which the writ of prohibition will lie.\nArticle 1031 of the Quebec Code of Civil Procedure is in these words:\nWrits of prohibition are addressed to courts of inferior jurisdiction whenever they exceed their jurisdiction.\nThis is an exact definition of a writ of prohibition according to English law, and I therefore assume, in the absence of any further provision upon that head in the code of procedure and of any jurisprudence of the courts of the Province of Quebec to the contrary that the use of and the proceedings upon this writ of prohibition, which is derived from the law of England, is to be regulated by the well established practice of the English courts relating to it.\nThe office of the writ of prohibition is as in the article of the code of civil procedure before extracted is declared in so many words, to restrain inferior courts from exceeding their jurisdiction that is, not from exercising a jurisdiction which they alone can exercise if any court can exercise it at all, but from usurping jurisdiction -by encroaching upon that of other and .superior tribunals. That the proper use of the writ is restricted to such. cases as those first mentioned is shown by Mr. High in the following passage from his treatise on Extraordinary Remedies ([8]).\nIt follows from the extraordinary nature of the remedy, as already considered, that the exercise of the jurisdiction is limited to cases where it is necessary to give a general superintendence and control over inferior tribunals, and it is never allowed except on a usurpation or abuse of power, and not then unless the existing remedies are inadequate to afford relief. If, therefore, the inferior court has jurisdiction of the subject-matter in controversy, a mistaken exercise of that jurisdiction, or of its acknowledged powers, will not justify a resort to the extraordinary remedy by prohibition.\nAnd the case of Lord Camden v. Home ([9]) referred to in the judgment of Mr. Justice Ramsay in the Court of Queen's Bench, is decisive to the same effect. In that case it was expressly decided that it afforded no ground for a prohibition that a court having a special statutory jurisdiction, which it alone, to the exclusion of all other courts, possessed, had so construed a statute as to exclude from its operation a case which, upon a proper legal construction of the enactment, was embraced in its terms. Mr. Justice Ashurst there says:\nIt is admitted that the Courts of Admiralty have exclusive jurisdiction in all cases of prize; and if so, they must have the same jurisdiction over all other matters that arise incidentally, either in construing acts of parliament or proclamations, in order to form their opinion on the principal question.\nAgain, in the same case, Mr. Justice Buller says:\nIn such cases the only point for our consideration is whether the court to which the prohibition is prayed has a jurisdiction over the subject. Whatever may have passed in the several cases on this subject in the last century, the grounds for granting and refusing prohibitions are now clearly and accurately defined. If the court below have jurisdiction over the subject, though they mistake in their judgment, it is no ground for a prohibition, but is only matter of appeal. Upon the principles of these authorities it has long since been decided that this writ cannot be used as a substitute for a certiorari or an appeal for it is now well settled to be a preventive and not a corrective remedy. Applying these authorities to the present case, it is clear that in the proceedings before the Recorder of Quebec there was no such excess of jurisdiction as warranted the issuing of a writ of prohibition. It cannot be pretended that if any offence within the 42 and 48 Vic. cap. 4 sec. 1 was committed by the appellant, the Recorder's Court had not jurisdiction of it and was not bound to proceed to try and determine the complaint summarily; there was, therefore, no encroachment upon the jurisdiction of any other court in the course which was taken by the recorder. He was bound to interpret the statute and to convict or acquit according to his interpretation of it and upon the evidence before him and he did this and no more.\nTo say this is sufficient to show that the writ of prohibition issued improvidently and was properly quashed. No one can say it was not the bounden duty of the recorder to interpret the statute and proceed according to the construction he placed upon it,\u2014and if that be so to award a writ of prohibition in such a case would be to prohibit a judicial officer from doing his duty. At most, the appellant can only complain that he has been aggrieved by an erroneous judgment, not that he has been prejudiced by the sentence of a court which had no jurisdiction of the subject-matter, and his proper remedy in this case is an appeal, if one is given by statute, or a writ of certiorari to remove the conviction into the Superior Court where it may be quashed if error appears upon its face.\nI am of opinion that we ought to hold the writ of prohibition to have been properly quashed, and to dismiss the appeal.\nFOURNIER, J., concurred with the Chief Justice.\nHENRY, J.:\nIndependently of the question\u2014the main one argued before us of the constitutionality of the statute under which the prosecution in this case was commenced, there are two others demanding our previous consideration.\nThe particular section of the Act in question is as follows: [His Lordship read the section ([10])].\nThe appellant was prosecuted under that section by the respondent corporation in the Recorder's Court of the city of Quebec, and the charge against him is that\u2014\nOn Sunday, the eighteenth, day of January, one thousand eight hundred and eighty, the said defendant (now appellant) has not closed, during the whole of the day, the house or building in which he, the said defendant, sells, causes to be sold, or allows to be sold, spirituous liquors by retail, in quantity less than three half pints, at a time, the said house or building situate at the corner of St. John and St. Ursule streets, in the Province of Qu\u00e9bec.\nThe first question then is, does the charge against the appellant, as so stated, of not keeping closed on the Sunday named, his house or building, he being a person holding a license to sell spirituous liquors in quantities less than three half pints render him liable to the penalty imposed by that section; or, in case of failure to pay the fine, as therein mentioned, to be imprisoned for a period not to exceed three months. Penal statutes are to be strictly construed; and, if the construction is reasonably doubtful as to the offence created by a penal Act, we are bound by every authority, to declare it inoperative to that extent. \u00c2 penal offence must be reasonably certain; and if open to two constructions, it cannot be so. There are two provisions in the section, one obliging the keeping closed, during every Sunday, the house or building in which a person sells liquors s the other, forbidding the selling, during the same period, in such house or building, or in any other place, spirituous liquors, wine, beer or temperance drinks, \"the whole under a penalty for each and every infringement of the present provisions of a fine,\" &c. The second provision is coupled to the first by the copulative \" and,\" which makes, as I read the section, the one a part of the other, and requiring a breach of both to constitute the offence \" the whole under a penalty for each and every infringement of the present provisions.\" The penalty is for the infringement of the present provisions,\u2014that is a breach of both. When the provisions are connected by the word u and \" I read the section and construe it as if, instead of the words used, the provision was worded thus: \" and during the same period shall not sell, &c, in such house or building, or in any other place, spirituous liquors, &c., \u2014the whole, that is, for not closing the house and for selling spirituous liquors, &c, under a penalty, &c. We are to construe the language of a statute as it is commonly used and understood. We may speculate as to what the Legislature intended; but we are bound to ascertain the true meaning of a statute by its own language; and if thereby we are forced to any particular conclusion we are not permitted to say that the Legislature meant other than what the language used warrants. If the two provisions had been coupled by the disjunctive \u201c or \" with suitable accompanying language, we might be disposed; and permitted to give a different construction to that part of the section which creates the penalty for infringement. An opposite construction would be at all events, open to serious doubts, and the double penalty should not therefore be imposed.; I am. of opinion that the writ against the appellant charges no complete offence, but merely one of the two ingredients. necessary to constitute it. No offence in law: being charged there could be no valid conviction.\nThe other question, although not raised on the argument, is taken by one of the learned judges in the court below, and therefore is entitled to consideration. The learned judge referred to gave it as his opinion, that \"prohibition \" does not lie in this case and that the writ should be quashed under the decision in the case of Lord Camden v. Home ([11]), but more especially from the dicta of Mr. Justice Buller in that case I have studied that case and the dicta referred to. The learned Judge referred to, in his judgment in that case, said:\nWhatever may have passed in the several cases on this subject in the last century, the grounds for granting and refusing prohibitions are now clearly and accurately defined. If the court below have jurisdiction over the subject and though they mistake in their judgment, it is no ground for a prohibition, but is only a matter of appeal. And the rule equally clear is. that after sentence the courts of common law never grant a prohibition to inferior courts, unless the want of this jurisdiction appear on the face of the libel.\nI will deal with the matter before us in the light of the two rules so laid down.\nIn the first place, as to the jurisdiction of the Recorder's Court over the subject. If I am right in my construction of the section before given can it be said that that court had jurisdiction to try, as an offence what was not one ? The prosecution against the appellant was to cause the imposition of a penalty upon him for not keeping his house closed on a Sunday. If that was per se an offence for which no penalty was imposed, how could the Recorder's Court give itself jurisdiction to try what was not an offence and to impose a penalty, under circumstances unauthorized by the section ? As I construe the statute, he would have jurisdiction only where the two provisions were alleged to have been infringed. I think, therefore, the prohibition in this respect was properly awarded, and the want of jurisdiction was sufficiently apparent on the face of the process by which the prosecution was commenced. I think this case is therefore within the terms of the two legal propositions asserted by Mr. Justice Butter.\nThe writ of prohibition in this case was issued after judgment. Lloyd, in his treatise on the writ of prohibition, at page 11, says:\nNo prohibition, therefore, can go before the commencement of the action, but as soon as the action is commenced, for instance, as soon as the plaint is entered in the new county courts, the application may be made. * * * This, however, can only be done in cases where the defect of jurisdiction appears on the face of the pleadings.\nAt page 12:\nIt has long been settled that whenever the want of jurisdiction appears on the face of the proceedings, prohibition will go after judgment. It is thus laid down in all the old authorities, and this doctrine has been frequently confirmed since, and is now fully established in practice.\nSo, if the matter be apparent on the face of the proceedings, it will go after appeal, though the parties have thereby affirmed the jurisdiction of the inferior court Gouche v. Bishop of Londan ([12]).\nIn Buggin v. Bennett ([13]), Lord Mansfield said:\nIf it appears, on the face of the proceedings, that the court below have no jurisdiction, a prohibition may issue at any time, either before or after sentence, because all is a nullity; it is coram ron judice.\nThere is a case to be found Jones v. Owen ([14]) where prohibition was granted by the Court of Queen's Bench in 1848 which overrules the judgment attributed to Mr. Justice Butter and which goes to show that the writ is grantable, even if the court to which it is directed had\n(1) See Roberts v. Humby, 3 M & W.120; Jones v. Jones, 17 L. J. Q. B. 170. jurisdiction over the subject-matter, and that even after the judgment was executed.\nSeveral other cases with, the same result are cited by Lloyd.\nI am of opinion the writ of prohibition in this case was properly issued after judgment.\nI am, for the reasons I have given, \"of the opinion that the appeal herein should be allowed, and that the prohibition should be sustained with costs.\nTASCHEREAU, J.:\nThis Act 42 and 43 Vic. ch. 4 sec. 1 enacts that: [His Lordship read the section 1.1 Under the said Act, the present appellant has been prosecuted for that:\nOn Sunday, the eighteenth day of January, one thousand eight hundred and eighty, the said defendant (now appellant) has not closed, during the whole of the day, the house or building in which he the said defendant, sells, causes to be sold or allows to be sold spirituous liquors by retail in quantity less than three half pints at a time, the said house or building situate at the corner of St, John and St. Ursule streets, in the city of Quebec.\nAnd, on the 17th day of February, 1880, was condemned for the said offence to pay a fine of $40 and $1.65 for the costs, and in default of payment of the said sums, to an imprisonment in the common gaol of the district of Quebec for a term of two months.\nOne of the grounds (one taken at the trial before the Recorder) upon which the appellant impugns that conviction is that it is not authorized by the statute as no penalty is, as he contends, imposed thereby, for keeping open on Sunday a house or building where liquors are usually retailed; his contention being that the penalty imposed by this latter part of the section for every infringement of the present provisions, must be read as applying only to the selling, the causing to be sold, the allowing to be sold, the allowing to be delivered, spirituous liquors, in such house or building or in any other place.\nI think that this objection is well taken. The clause is ambiguous and. the appellant is entitled, to the strict construction that must be given to all penal statutes. Assuming, but without deciding, that it had power to do so the Legislature has no doubt made it an offence to keep a tavern open on Sunday, but, as I read this statute, no penalty is provided for that offence. it, then, is simply an indictable misdemeanor, according to the Federal Act by which it is decreed that \"any wilful contravention of any Act of the Legislature of any of the provinces within Canada, which is not made an offence of some other kind, shall be a misdemeanor and punishable accordingly.\u201d\nI am of opinion, consequently, that the penalty imposed upon the appellant by the Recorder, and that the conviction against him is not authorized by the statute, and that it is a complete nullity. The Recorder cannot have had jurisdiction to impose a penalty that the statute does not authorize. The whole proceedings before him were corami non judice, even if the Act in question was intra vires. In the Province of Quebec, there are a number of cases where the prohibition has been held to lie in such a case. I would not, in fact have any doubt upon the subject if it was not for what has been said by some of my learned brethren.\nAnd while it is undoubtedly true that after a court has proceeded as far as verdict and judgment, or sentence prohibition will not lie for a want of jurisdiction not apparent upon the record, yet the rule is supported by an overwhelming array of authority, that where the defect or failure of jurisdiction is apparent upon the face of the proceedings which it is sought to prohibit, the superior tribunal may interpose the extraordinary aid of a prohibition at any stage of the proceedings below, even, after verdict, sentence or judgment ([15]).\nIn Buggin v. Bennett ([16]), Lord Mansfield says:\nIf it appears upon the face of the proceedings that the court below have no jurisdiction, the prohibition maybe issued at any time, either before or after sentence, because all is a nullity\u2014it is coram non judice.\nI am of opinion to allow the appeal.\nGWYNNE, J.:\nI am of opinion that the statute in question, namely, 42nd and 43rd Vic. ch. 4 sec. 1 of the Province of Quebec does not impose the penalty in that section mentioned, upon the person who, although licensed to sell spirituous liquors in quantities in that section mentioned, does not close the house or building in which he sells, or causes to be sold, such liquors during the whole of the Sunday, unless such keeping open, which I take to be equivalent to not closing such building, is accompanied by the sale or delivery in such house or building, of some spirituous liquor, wine, beer or temperance liquor. The words of the statute, shortly expressed, so far as is necessary for the decision of the point in question, are ([17]). [His Lordship read the words of the statute].\nIt appears to me to be free from reasonable doubt that this language does not profess to impose the penalty upon the person so licensed to sell for the not closing alone, without more, of the house or building in which the sale usually takes place. If the Legislature contemplated making the not closing, without more the house or building during the whole of Sunday a distinct offence in itself, subjecting the proprietor of the house or building to the penalty, such intention, to say the least, is very inadequately expressed, and I confess, that to my mind, it is not clear what would constitute the offence in the absence of the fact of any liquor being sold or delivered to any person in the house or building; for example, whether, if the licensed person usually sells the liquors in a room or shop forming part of the house in which he lives the whole house is to be closed, so that nobody, not even the proprietor can enter or leave it or if the door from the street into the room or shop in which the liquors are usually sold, constitutes the sole mode of egress and ingress for the proprietor, between the house and the street must that door be so closed that the proprietor himself shall not pass out of it, although to go to church or on his return re-enter his house by it ? Or if the liquors are all kept in cases behind a bar or counter, would the statute be sufficiently complied with by keeping the cases and the bar or counter locked ? Or should the keeping closed be considered as being directed against all persons frequenting the house for the purpose of procuring spirituous liquors there ?\nBut we are not now, in my opinion, called upon to decide what state of facts would constitute the committal of the offence of not closing, if not closing, without more, be an offence under the statute, but whether it is made by the statute an offence in itself and subject to the penalty mentioned in the statute and in my opinion it clearly is not\u2014the words \"the whole\" in the sentence which enacts \" the whole under a penalty for each and every infringement of the present provisions of a fine,\" &c, &c., seem, I think, to express the intention of the Legislature to be that to subject a person to the penalty he must be guilty of a violation of the whole of what is prescribed and prohibited in the section; so, likewise, the use of the words, \" every infringement of the present provisions,' indicates an intention to attach the penalty to each infringement of all the provisions of the section. The penalty is not imposed upon every infringement of any of the present provisions, but upon every infringement of the provisions in the plural; that is, of both the provisions of the section, viz.:\u2014on the keeping open and selling.\nSo reading the Act, it is plain that the complaint charged no offence cognizable under the statute, and the prohibition was therefore rightly granted; and inasmuch as there is no pretence that any spirituous liquor was sold or delivered to any person on the occasion referred to in the complaint the case does not in my opinion, raise the question whether the statute which prohibits such sale or delivery be or be not ultra vires of the Provincial Legislature and I do not think that we are called upon to express an opinion upon a point which the facts of the case do not raise and Which is. therefore, unnecessary for the decision of the case before us, and this is the course we pursued in a recent case from New Brunswick.\nThe appeal, in my opinion, should be allowed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed without costs.\nSolicitors for appellant: Montambault, Langelier and Langelier.\nSolicitors for respondent: Pelletier and Chouinard.\n[1] 3 Can.

J. Ritchie, C.J., and Strong, Fournier, Henry, and Gwynne, J J.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF QUEEN'S BENCH FOR THE PROVINCE OF QUEBEC (APPEAL SIDE).\nArticles 803,103 1\/2: C. C. P. Q.\u2014Donation in marriage contract\u2014Proof of insolvency of donor at date of donation necessary to set aside.\nOn 28th June, 1876, L. et al sold to M. T. a property for $12,250, of which price $3,789 were paid in cash. On 16th June, 1879, E. T., daughter of M. T., married J. K., and in their contract of marriage M. T. made a donation to his daughter, E. T., of certain property of considerable value, and remained with no other property than that sold to him by L. et al. In July, 1881, L. et al brought an action to set aside the gift in question, claiming that, the property sold having become so depreciated in value as to be insufficient to cover their claim for the balance remaining due to them and secured only by the property so sold, the gift in this marriage contract had reduced M. T. to a state of insolvency, and had been made in fraud of L. et al, and that at the time the gift was made M. T. was notoriously insolvent. M. T. pleaded, inter alia, denying averments of insolvency, fraud, or wrong-doing. The only evidence of the value of the property still held by M. T. at the date of the donation, 16th June, 1879, was the evidence of an auctioneer, who merely spoke of the value of the property in November, 1881, and that of a real estate agent, who did not know in what condition the property was two years before, but stated that it was not worth more than $6,000 in November, 1881, adding that he considered property a little better now than it was two years before, although very little changed in price.\nHeld (reversing the judgment of the court below),That in order to obtain the revocation of the gift in question, it was incumbent on the plaintiffs to prove the insolvency or d\u00e9confiture of the donor at the time of the donation, and that there was no proof in this case sufficient to show that the property remaining to the donor at the date of his donation was inadequate to pay the hypothecary claims with which it was charged.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench for Lower Canada (appeal side) ([1]), affirming the judgment of the Superior Court.\nThis was an action brought to set aside a gift made by Martin Treacey to his daughter Ellen Treacey and to her husband John Killoran, contained in their marriage contract executed 16th June, 1879, to which Martin Treacey was a party for the purpose among other things of conveying to them, in consideration of their marriage, property of considerable value.\nThe wrong which Liggett et al complained of was, that having sold Martin Treacey a property on the 28th June, 1876, which had only been partly paid for, a balance remained due to them thereon secured only by the property so sold, which having become depreciated in value was insufficient to cover their claim, that the gift in this marriage contract had reduced Martin Treacey to a state of insolvency and had been made in fraud of Liggett et al whose claim remained unsatisfied; they further alleged that at the time the gift in question was made, Martin Treacey was notoriously insolvent, that he had remained in possession of the property so given, the same as before the date of the gift, and that a year had not elapsed since they, Liggett et al, had become aware of the existence of the donation; they therefore claimed that the donation in question should be set aside and annulled.\nThe defendants each pleaded separately, but to the same effect, by a special categorical denial of each of the averments in the declaration, especially the averments of insolvency, fraud, or wrong-doing. The facts shown in evidence were that by deed dated the 28th June, 1876, Liggett et al. had sold Martin Treacey a property for $12,250, whereof $3,787 were paid in cash, and the balance was made payable to the acquittal of Liggett et al, viz: $403 to A. M. Foster, 1st November, 1876, and the balance to the Liverpool, London & Globe Insurance Co. as follows, viz: $4,030 on the 1st July, 1878, and $4,030 on the 1st July, 1883.\nThat the contract of marriage complained of was made 10th June, 1876, and contained a large amount of valuable property which Martin Treacey thereby transferred to his daughter and son-in-law, and was duly registered.\nThat besides the property he gave to his daughter and her husband, Mr. Treacey held no other than that sold to him by Liggett et al. ; also that they had taken judgment against him for the first instalment due under his deed of purchase, and seized and sold his moveables; further that since his daughter\u2019s marriage, she and her husband had lived on the property he had given her.\nThere was no proof of fraud or collusion on the part of the daughter or of her husband.\nAs to proof of the value of the property still held by Martin Treacey at the date of the donation 16th June, 1879, two witnesses were examined on the 12th November, 1881.\nWilliam J. Shaw, auctioneer, stated that on that day, 12th November, 1881, sub-divison No. 40, No. 1206 St. Ann's ward, he considered worth about $6,000.\nOliver W. Stanton, real estate agent, being examined, stated that he considered about $6,000 a very fair value of No. 1206 sub-division 40, St. Ann's ward. The houses, he said, were in bad order and the building also.\nHe was asked: \u201cIs it worth to-day as much as it was two years ago ? A. I did not see it two years ago.\u201d\n\u201cQ. Supposing the property to be in the same state, was it more valuable two years ago than to-day? A. No; I consider property a little better now than it was two years, ago, although there is very little change in price.\u201d\nThe Superior Court rescinded the donation made by contract of marriage to the female appellant by her father Martin Treacey, and that judgment was affirmed by the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench for Lower Canada (appeal side.)\nFrom these judgments the appellants, Dame Ellen Treacey et vir, as well for themselves personally as beneficiary heirs to the estate of the late Marlin Tracey, appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nThe question which arose on this appeal was, whether the respondents had proved their averment in their declaration, that Martin Treacey was at the date of the said donation, and before, notoriously insolvent, en d\u00e9confiture and unable to pay his debts, and were entitled under art. 803 C. C. to obtain the revocation of the gift. Other points were argued by counsel but the court did not think it necessary to express any opinion on them.\nMr. Doutre, QC., and Mr. Joseph for appellants, and Mr. Branchaud for respondents.\nRitchie, C.J.:\u2014 .\nThe whole question turns on whether Martin Treacey was solvent at the time he made this conveyance, or whether making the conveyance which he did rendered him insolvent. For the reasons given by Mr. Justice Cross, and with which I entirely agree, and to which I have nothing to add, I think this appeal should be allowed. That is to say, I am of opinion that the insolvency of the party was not established. Strong, J:\nFor reasons substantially the same as those given by Mr. Justice Cross, I am of opinion that we ought to allow this appeal. Without entering upon a consideration of the important point of law which is dealt with in the opinion of the learned Chief Justice of the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench, but assuming, for the present purpose, that the law is as he states it, that a donation of immovable property by a father to his daughter, on the occasion of her marriage, is to be considered a gratuitous alienation, I am still of opinion that the proof in the present case is inadequate to invalidate the gift made by Martin Treacey to his daughter. Article 803 of the Civil Code provides that:\nIf at the time of the gift, and deduction being made of the things given, the donor were insolvent, the previous creditors, whether their claims are hypothecary or not, may obtain the revocation of the gift, even though the donee were ignorant of the insolvency.\nFraud must be proved, and is not to be presumed. Therefore, it was incumbent on the respondents to show that the property remaining to Martin Treacey, after he had made this donation to his daughter, was inadequate in value to pay the hypothecary claims of the respondents with which it was charged.\nThis property had been sold by the respondents to Martin Treacey, on the 28th June, 1876, for $12,250, of which price $3,787 had been paid in cash. There is a presumption, therefore, that on the day of donation by Martin Treacey to his daughter, the 10th of June, 1879, the property still remained of more than sufficient value for the residue of the unpaid purchase money.\nThe question we have to decide is, therefore, reduced to this: is it sufficiently proved that the property on the 10th June, 1879, was so reduced in value as to be worth less than the portion of the sum remaining unpaid, in other words, is the prim\u00e2 facie presumption destroyed by the counter testimony of witnesses ? Only two witnesses were examined on the point of value.\nWilliam J. Shaw's evidence is not material, since he merely speaks of the value at the date of his examination, which was the 12th November, 1881.\nStanton, a real estate agent, says that $6000 was the fair value at the date at which he speaks\u2014in November, 1881. He says, he did not know the property two years ago. He then adds, he considers property a little better (when he speaks) than it was two years ago.\nIt appears to me, that this evidence of a single witness is much too vague and general to repel the fair inference arising from the circumstance of the sale in 1876, especially considering the well known fluctuations in the value of land in cities and towns in this country. It is true, that the only way of fixing a valuation in questions of this kind is by the estimation of persons having dealings in real estate, or otherwise experienced in its value, like the witness; but, certainly, it would be most unsafe to act on evidence like this, when it must have been easily within the power of the respondents, upon whom the burden of proof lay, to establish the value at the date of the marriage settlement by the evidence of witnesses who knew the property at that time. I doubt, indeed, if such evidence as this ought to be acted on, even in a case where there was no such criterion of the value afforded as there is here by the price agreed to be paid under the previous sale, to which the creditors were parties, but under the circumstances of the present case it seems clear to me, that there is not such distinct and clear proof of insolvency as is required to warrant the revocation of the donation.\nI think the appeal should be allowed, and the action dismissed with costs in this court and the court below. FOURNIER, J.:\nLe 28 juin 1876, les Intim\u00e9s vendirent \u00e0 Martin Treacey, un des Appelants, un lot de terre avec b\u00e2tisses, pour la somme de $12,250, \u00e0 compte de laquelle ils re\u00e7urent au moment de la passation de l\u2019acte de vente $3,787. La balance \u00e9tait payable avec int\u00e9r\u00eat \u00e0 7 p. c. comme suit: $403.00 \u00e0 A. M. Foster avec int\u00e9r\u00eat au 1er novembre 1876, $4,030.00, le 1er juillet 1878, et $4,030, le 1er juillet 1883.\nLe 19 juin 1879, Martin Treacey intervint au contrat de mariage de sa fille, Ellen Treacey, avec John Killoran, et lui fit donation de toutes ses propri\u00e9t\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019exception de celle qu\u2019il avait achet\u00e9e des Intim\u00e9s. Ceux-ci ont, par leur action en cette cause, demand\u00e9 la revocation de cette donation, comme faite en fraude de leur droit, et parce qu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque de cette donation, le donateur Martin Treacey \u00e9tait notamment insolvable et en d\u00e9confiture. Cette derni\u00e8re all\u00e9gation \u00e9tant la base principale de l\u2019action, il est important de la donner textuellement, afin de faire voir clairement la position prisepar les Intim\u00e9s:\nThat the said Martin Treacey was at the date of the said donation and before notoriously insolvent, en d\u00e9confiture, and unable to pay his debts, and has ever since remained so to the full knowledge of the said Ellen Treacey and husband, who acted with the said Martin Treacey in fraud and collusion, to impair the interests of the said Plaintiffs.\nThat by the said deed of donation which was gratuitous and made by the said donor and accepted by the said donee fraudulently and with intent to defraud the said Plaintiffs in particular, the said donor divested himself in favor of the said donee, of a property which was the common pledge of his creditors.\nIls ont de plus all\u00e9gu\u00e9 que l\u2019existence de cette donation n\u2019\u00e9tait parvenue \u00e0 leur connaissance que depuis moins d\u2019un an.\nLes Intim\u00e9s ont par des d\u00e9fenses s\u00e9par\u00e9es ni\u00e9 sp\u00e9cialement toutes les all\u00e9gations de la d\u00e9claration et plus particuli\u00e8rement celles concernant la fraude et l\u2019iusolyabilit\u00e9. Ils ont aussi invoqu\u00e9 la prescription intro-duite par l\u2019art. 1040 C.C.\nLe jugement de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure, confirm\u00e9 par celuide la Cour du Banc de la Reine, a maintenu l\u2019action et' annul\u00e9 la donation tout en ordonnant la discussion des autres biens de Martin Treacey.\nLa question tr\u00e8s controvers\u00e9e de savoir si la donation contenue dans un contrat de mariage doit \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9e faite \u00e0 titre gratuit ou on\u00e9reux, a \u00e9t\u00e9 discut\u00e9e par plusieurs des honorables juges appel\u00e9s \u00e0 decider cette cause.\nCette question qui pourrait \u00eatre de la plus haute importance en certains cas, \u00e0 cause de la diff\u00e9rence de la preuve que la loi exige suivant le caract\u00e8re de l\u2019acte, n\u2019en a aucune dans la pr\u00e9sente cause; car la prevue est tout \u00e0 fait insuffisante pour \u00e9tablir les allegations de fraude, d\u2019insolvabilit\u00e9 notoire et d\u00e9confiture qui sont les \u00e9l\u00e9ments essentiels de l\u2019action r\u00e9vocatoire. Si la preuve en e\u00fbt \u00e9t\u00e9 faite, il est indubitable que le jugement rendu en cette cause aurait bien jug\u00e9, mais il est \u00e9vident que cette preuve fait d\u00e9faut.\nD\u2019abord quant \u00e0 la preuve de fraude et de collusion de la part d\u2019Ellen Treacey et de son mari, il n\u2019y a pas eu la moindre tentative de la faire. Quant \u00e0 la prevue de l\u2019insolvabilit\u00e9, \u00e0 la date de la donation, il n\u2019y en a aucune preuve non plus, si ce n\u2019est celle que les Intim\u00e9s pr\u00e9tendent tirer de l\u2019admission de faits des Appelants, que Martin Treacey n\u2019avait pas \u00e0 cette \u00e9poque d\u2019autrepropri\u00e9t\u00e9 que celle achet\u00e9e des Intim\u00e9s (\u201cno other property but the one purchased from plaintifs in this cause.\u201d)\nCette admission qui ne fait pas mention des propri\u00e9t\u00e9s mobili\u00e8res, ne fait pas preuve d\u2019insolvabilit\u00e9 et encore moins de d\u00e9confiture. Pour suppl\u00e9er \u00e0 cette insuffisance et dans le but d\u2019arriver, faute de preuve directe, \u00e0 prouver l\u2019insolvabilit\u00e9, les Intim\u00e9s ont fait entendre deux t\u00e9moins au sujet de la valeur de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 en question. M. J. Shaw, l\u2019un d\u2019eux qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 entendu, le 12 octobre 1881, estime la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 en question \u00e0 $6,000. L\u2019autre, Olivier W. Stanton, l\u2019estime aussi \u00e0 $6,000. Il dit que les b\u00e2tisses \u00e9taient en mauvais ordre. A la question qu\u2019on lui a faite pour savoir si cette propri\u00e9t\u00e9 valait autant il y a deux ans, il r\u00e9pond qu\u2019il ne l\u2019a pas vue \u00e0 cette \u00e9poque Elle pouvait alors valoir beaucoup plus, si elle \u00e9tait en bon ordre, mais le t\u00e9moin n\u2019en sait rien. Ainsi ces deux t\u00e9moins ne font mention de la valeur de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 en question qu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque de leur examen, le 12 novembre 1881. Ce qu\u2019elle pouvait valoir plus de deux ans auparavant, \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque de la donation du 16 janvier 1879, ils n\u2019en savent rien. Devonsnous pr\u00e9sumer que cette propri\u00e9t\u00e9 vendue $12,253 le 28 janvier 1876, n\u2019en valait plus que $6,000 le 16 janvier 1879, 3 ans apr\u00e8s? Non, car lorsqu\u2019il s\u2019agit de prouver l\u2019insolvabilit\u00e9, c\u2019est Police accident report from New York State Department of Motor Vehicles dated des preuves directes qu\u2019il faut le faire. Aucune tentative n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite de la part des Intim\u00e9s pour prouver la valeur de cette propri\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque de la donation D\u2019apr\u00e8s la mani\u00e8re qu\u2019ils ont fait leur preuve ils semblent avoir compl\u00e8tement perdu de vue que le fait essentiel \u00e0 prouver \u00e9tait la valeur \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque de la donation, afin de d\u00e9montrer que d\u00e9duction faite des propri\u00e9t\u00e9s donn\u00e9es il ne restait plus assez de biens \u00e0 Martin Treacey pour payer ses dettes. Ils semblent aussi avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 sous l\u2019impression que dans un cas comme celuici, de simples pr\u00e9somptions seraient suffisantes pour faire la preuve requise, mais ils ont oubli\u00e9 qu\u2019il s\u2019agit dans cette cause de faire annuler un acte solennel entre non commer\u00e7ants, et qu\u2019ici les pr\u00e9somptions ordinaires, suffisantes lorsqu\u2019il s\u2019agit de l\u2019annulation d\u2019actes de commer\u00e7ants en fraude de leurs cr\u00e9anciers, ne peuvent recevoir aucune application.\nIl faut encore remarquer que quant \u00e0 la preuve de l\u2019in-solvabilit\u00e9, il n\u2019en est pas de m\u00eame que pour celle de la fraude; si celle-ci, faute de preuve directe, peut \u00eatre prouv\u00e9e par des preuves indirectes, il faut au contraire pour \u00e9tablir l\u2019insolvabilit\u00e9 ou la d\u00e9confiture, des preuves directes et positives.\nPardessus dit ([2]):\nLa d\u00e9confiture est la position du non-commer\u00e7ant qui se trouve par l\u2019accumulation de condamnations ou de poursuites dirig\u00e9es contrelui, hors d\u2019\u00e9tat de payer ce qu\u2019il doit.\nQu\u2019un simple particulier laisseprononcer contre lui des condamnations, ne paie personne, quoiqu\u2019il ait des meubles ou des immeubles, il ne sera pas en d\u00e9confiture, car ses cr\u00e9anciers peuvent le saisir, l\u2019exproprier. Il n\u2019y a de d\u00e9confiture que l\u00e0 seulement o\u00f9 la discussion.de tous les biens ne produit pas l\u2019acquittement de toutes les dettes.\nSi telle e\u00fbt \u00e9t\u00e9 la position de Martin Treacey le 16 juin 1879, il e\u00fbt \u00e9t\u00e9 facile d\u2019en faire la preuve par la production de condamnations et de poursuites dirig\u00e9es contre lui, et en constatant d\u2019une mani\u00e8re pr\u00e9cise la valeur, \u00e0 cette \u00e9poque, de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 qui lui restait, apr\u00e8s la donation,\u2014la valeur de ses biens meubles et le montant exact de ses dettes; on pouvait ais\u00e9ment Police accident report from New York State Department of Motor Vehicles dated ce proc\u00e9d\u00e9 arriver \u00e0 faire la preuve n\u00e9cessaire d\u2019insolvabilit\u00e9. Cette preuve les Intim\u00e9s s\u2019\u00e9taient engag\u00e9s \u00e0 la faire par les all\u00e9gations de leur d\u00e9claration. En basant, comme ils l\u2019ont fait, leur action sur l\u2019art. 1034, ils devaient prouver l\u2019insolvabilit\u00e9 de Martin Treacey \u00e0 la date de l\u2019acte de donation dont ils se plaignent. Un autre article non moins positif sur ce point, rendait encore cette preuve obligatoire. L\u2019article 1034 C. C. dit:\nSi, au temps de la donation et distraction faite des choses donn\u00e9es, le donateur n\u2019\u00e9tait pas solvable, les cr\u00e9anciers ant\u00e9rieurs, hypoth\u00e9-caires ou non, peuvent la faire r\u00e9voquer quand m\u00eame Insolvabilit\u00e9 n\u2019aurait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 connue du donataire.\nLa preuve faite ne justifie nullement le principal consid\u00e9rant du jugement d\u00e9clarant \u201cqu\u2019il a \u00e9t\u00e9 prouv\u00e9 \u201c que le d\u00e9fendeur Martin Treacey s\u2019est rendu insolvable par la donation dont il est question en cette \u201ccause, et qu\u2019il \u00e9tait insolvable lors de Vinstitution de la \u201cpr\u00e9sente action, et que les immeubles qui lui restaient \u201cn\u2019\u00e9taient pas suffisants pour assurer le paiement de ses \u201cdettes et nomm\u00e9ment de la cr\u00e9ance des demandeurs.\u201d\nQuant \u00e0 la derni\u00e8re partie de ce consid\u00e9rant declarant Martin Treacey insolvable lors de l\u2019institution de l\u2019action qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 signifi\u00e9e plus de deux ans apr\u00e8s la date de la donation, il est \u00e9vident qu\u2019elle doit \u00eatre sans effet sur le sort de cette cause, car elle est en contradiction manifeste avec les articles 1034 et 803, exigeant la preuve de l\u2019insolvabilit\u00e9 \u00e0 la date de l\u2019acte attaqu\u00e9. Mais elle fait voir que les honorables juges qui ont rendu ce jugement n\u2019ont pas trouv\u00e9 de preuve au dossier les autori-sant \u00e0 d\u00e9clarer que l\u2019insolvabilit\u00e9 existait au temps de la donation. Dans la premi\u00e8re partie du consid\u00e9rant, quoiqu\u2019il soit d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que Martin Treacey s\u2019est rendu insolvable par la donation en question\u2014il n\u2019est pas dit quand cet effet s\u2019est produit. Est-ce au moment de la donation ? - si c\u2019est l\u00e0 l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation qu\u2019il faut donner au jugement, il est clair qu\u2019il n\u2019y a aucune preuve pour justifier cette conclusion. Pour en arriver l\u00e0, il faudrait, comme il a \u00e9t\u00e9 dit plus haut, avoir un \u00e9tat exact de la position de Martin Treacey au temps de la donation. Il faudrait \u00eatre en \u00e9lat de dire si, apr\u00e8s d\u00e9duction faite des propri\u00e9t\u00e9s donn\u00e9es il ne lui restait pas assez de biens pour payer ses dettes. Il n\u2019y a dans le dossier aucune preuve quelconque sur laquelle on puisse baser cette op\u00e9ration. Pourtant, d\u2019apr\u00e8s l\u2019article 803, c\u2019est la mani\u00e8re de constater l\u2019insolvabilit\u00e9. Cette premi\u00e8re paitie du consid\u00e9rant n\u2019est pas plus justifi\u00e9e par la preuve que la seconde.\nDe l\u2019existence, reconnue par la Cour, de l\u2019insolvabilit\u00e9 de Martin Treacey, lors de la signification de l\u2019action a-t-on voulu en induire qu\u2019il en r\u00e9sultait une pr\u00e9somption de fraude comme celle dont Ricard fait mention dans son Trait\u00e9 des Donations ([3])?\nIl y a peu d\u2019analogie entre les deux cas. Dans celui dont parle Ricard il s\u2019agissait de savoir si la donation \u00e9tait sujette \u00e0 l\u2019insinuation. Il est vrai qu\u2019il dit que \u201c le sort de la contestation fut sur ce qu\u2019il y avait une pr\u00e9somption violente que le p\u00e8re avait fait \u00e0 son fils, par son contrat de mariage, la donation dont il s\u2019agissait, en fraude de ses cr\u00e9anciers, en cons\u00e9quence de ce qu\u2019elle contenait tous les immeubles qu\u2019il poss\u00e9dait et qu\u2019il avait fait banqueroute un an apr\u00e8s.\u201d Il y a cette diff\u00e9rence importante dans le cas pr\u00e9sent, que la donation n\u2019est pas de tous les immeubles\u2014et que l\u2019insolvabilit\u00e9 n\u2019est survenue que plus de deux ans apr\u00e8s la donation dont il s\u2019agit,\u2014tandis que dans le cas cit\u00e9 par Ricaid la banqueroute avait lieu un an apr\u00e8s, et que la donation \u00e9tait de tous les immeubles. L\u2019insolvabilit\u00e9 survenue \u00e0 une \u00e9poque rapproch\u00e9e des actes all\u00e9gu\u00e9s pourrait bien former une pr\u00e9somption de fraude,\u2014prouver l\u2019intention de fraude, consilium fraudis,\u2014mais cela seul ne suffirait pas pour faire prononcer la nullit\u00e9, il faudrait encore pour se conformer \u00e0 une autre condi-tion essentielle de l\u2019action r\u00e9vocatoire, prouver que cette insolvabilit\u00e9 est la cons\u00e9quence Je ces actes afin d\u2019\u00e9tablir le pr\u00e9judice caus\u00e9, eventus damni, sans lequel l\u2019action ne peut exister.\nAubry et Rau ([4]) disent \u00e0 ce sujet:\nL\u2019exercice de l\u2019action Paulienne suppose avant tout un prejudice caus\u00e9 aux cr\u00e9anciers qui l\u2019intentent, et ce p\u2019\u00e9judice ne se comprend que moyennant le concours des trois conditions suivantes:\nIl faut, en premier lieu, que les biens du d\u00e9biteur soient insuffisants pour le paiement de ses dettes. Si son insolvabilit\u00e9 ne se trouvait encore, ni \u00e9tablie par sa d\u00e9confiture, ni l\u00e9galement presume \u00e0 raison de sa faillite, le cr\u00e9ancier demandeur devrait pour la justification de son action, discuter au pr\u00e9alable les biens du d\u00e9biteur \u00e0 l\u2019exception cependant de ceux dont la discussion pr\u00e9senterait trop de difficult\u00e9s.\nIl faut, en second lieu, que le pr\u00e9judice soit r\u00e9sult\u00e9 pour le cr\u00e9ancier de Pacte contre lequel son action eat dirig\u00e9e, en d\u2019autres termes, que le d\u00e9biteur ait \u00e9t\u00e9 audessous de ses affaires d\u00e8s avant la passation de l\u2019acte attaqu\u00e9, ou que du moins son insolvabilit\u00e9 en ait \u00e9t\u00e9 la cause reconnue.\nChardon dit ([5]):\nDe m\u00eame que le dessein de tromper, sans un pr\u00e9judice effectif n\u2019autorise pas l\u2019action r\u00e9vocatoire, le pr\u00e9judice \u00e9prouv\u00e9 ne permet de l\u2019accueillir qu\u2019autant qu\u2019il a \u00e9t\u00e9 la cons\u00e9quence d\u2019une intention hostile; Consilium fraudis, et even tus damni. L\u2019article 1167 du Code civil offre le m\u00eame sens, puisqu\u2019il n\u2019autorise les cr\u00e9anciers \u00e0 critiquer que les actes faits par leurs d\u00e9biteurs en fraude de leurs droits.\nLes cr\u00e9anciers doivent donc prouver, et le dommage qui leur est fait, et l\u2019intention qu\u2019a eue leur d\u00e9biteur de le leur faire. Il est essentiel de faire cette preuve.\nBedarride dit ([6]):\nLa seconde condition impos\u00e9e au cr\u00e9ancier suivant l\u2019action r\u00e9vocatoire, est de prouver l\u2019insolvabilit\u00e9 du d\u00e9biteur. Cette action est essentiellement subsidiaire. Elle ne peut \u00eatre exerc\u00e9e que pour amener le paiement que les biens restants sont, par leur insuffisance, dans l\u2019impossibilit\u00e9 d\u2019effectuer. Il faut donc pr\u00e9alablement \u00e9tablir cette insuffisance.\nCette condition se justifie avec autorit\u00e9 par cet autre principe que, pour intenter une action, il ne sut pas d\u2019avoir qualit\u00e9, qu\u2019il faut surtout y avoir int\u00e9r\u00eat.\nChardon dit encore ([7]):\nPour \u00e9tablir la fraude du donateur, il suffit de prouver son infortune au moment de la donation, parce qu\u2019en effet si alors ses dettes surpassaient son avoir, il ne pouvait en rien donner qu\u2019au prejudice de ses cr\u00e9anciers. C\u2019est donc ce pr\u00e9judice que doit prouver celuiqui se plaint.\nDemolombe dit ([8]):\nLe pr\u00e9judice \u00e9prouv\u00e9 par les cr\u00e9anciers, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire l\u2019insolvabilit\u00e9 du d\u00e9biteur r\u00e9sultant de l\u2019acte qu\u2019ils attaquent, telle est donc la premi\u00e8re condition, sous laquelle l\u2019action Paulienne est recevable. Aussi, le premier moyen du tiers d\u00e9fendeur est-il, en effet, luim\u00eame tir\u00e9 de l\u2019absence de pr\u00e9judice et de la solvabilit\u00e9 du d\u00e9biteur. Le tiers d\u00e9fendeur peut, en cons\u00e9quence, \u00e0 moins que le d\u00e9biteur ne se trouve d\u00e9j\u00e0 en \u00e9tat de faillite ou de d\u00e9confiture ouverte, demander qu\u2019il soit pr\u00e9alablement discut\u00e9 dans ses biens.\nC\u2019est en ce' sens que l\u2019on a dit, avec raison, que l\u2019action Paulienne est seulement subsidiaire ; en ce sens qu\u2019elle ne peut \u00eatre exerc\u00e9e qu\u2019\u00e0 d\u00e9faut ou en cas d\u2019insuffisance des autres biens du d\u00e9biteur bonis ejus excussis.\nComme on le voit par ces autorit\u00e9s qu\u2019il, serait facile de multiplier, la condition premi\u00e8re, comme le dit Demolombe, sous laquelle l\u2019action des Intim\u00e9s \u00e9tait recevable \u00e9tait le pr\u00e9judice lui r\u00e9sultant de l\u2019acte de donation attaqu\u00e9. Ils ne pouvaient exercer leur action qu\u2019en cas d\u2019insuffisance des autres biens de Martin Treacey, constat\u00e9e par une discussion pr\u00e9alable de ses biens Cette condition est exig\u00e9e par les autorit\u00e9s ci-dessus cit\u00e9es,\u2014\u00e0 moins que le d\u00e9biteur ne soit d\u00e9j\u00e0 en faillite ou en d\u00e9confiture ouverte. Non seulement les biens de Martin Treacey n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 discut\u00e9s avant l\u2019\u00e9manation de l\u2019action r\u00e9vocatoire, mais la preuve de son insolvabilit\u00e9 au temps de la donation, condition essentielle du succ\u00e8s de leur action, n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 faite.\nQuant \u00e0 la question de savoir si les Intim\u00e9s devraient discuter les biens de Martin Treacey avant de porter leur action, je ne crois pas que les circonstances de cette cause m\u2019obligent \u00e0 la d\u00e9cider Cependant, je ne puis m\u2019emp\u00eacher de reconna\u00eetre que les autorit\u00e9s cit\u00e9es plus haufrqui comptent parmi les plus consid\u00e9r\u00e9es, sont en faveur de la discussion et la consid\u00e8rent obligatoire, \u00e0 moins que le d\u00e9biteur ne soit en faillite ou en d\u00e9confiture ouverte. Mais comme d\u2019apr\u00e8s la preuve en cette cause, on pouvait consid\u00e9rer Martin Treacey comme insolvable \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque de l\u2019\u00e9manation de l\u2019action, cette circonstance rendait, suivant l\u2019opinion de Demolombe, l\u2019action recevable. Mais pour r\u00e9ussir \u00e0 faire annuler la donation attaqu\u00e9e, il aurait fallu \u00e9tablir par des preuves directes et positives, que cette insolvabilit\u00e9 remontait \u00e0 la date de la donation attaqu\u00e9e, ou que la donation ellem\u00eame \u00e9tait la cause de l\u2019insolvabilit\u00e9.\nEn outre des observations que j\u2019ai faites sur la nature de la preuve de l\u2019insolvabilit\u00e9, je dois d\u00e9clarer que je concours dans celles qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faites sur le m\u00eame sujet par l\u2019honorable juge Cross.\nPour tous ces motifs je suis d\u2019opinion que l\u2019appel doit \u00eatre re\u00e7u.\nHENRY, J.:\u2014\nI am entirely of the same opinion. I think the party was bound to prove that at the time of the transfer from Treacey to his daughter and her husband he was insolvent. I may say that no such evidence has been given. We are asked to presume that because one man put a valuation of $6,000 on the property two years and a-half afterwards, therefore it was not worth $8,000 at the time of the conveyance. It is a principle that not only must fraud be alleged, but it must be also proved. He undertakes to assert that that was a fraudulent and illegal transaction, and that the party became insolvent by the mere fact of making that transfer. Now, have we any reason to assume fraud ? On the contrary, I think we are bound to assume the reverse on this occasion. At the time of the transfer he paid nearly onethird of the whole amount, leaving $8,000 due. At the time of the donation we could hardly assume that the property had fallen so much in value as to be worth no more than $6,000, that is, depreciated in value to the extent of one-half. I think if property went down by degrees and had two years to go down after the transfer of this property, we may assume that at the time this donation was made it had not got down to the depth of $6,000. I see no reason for imputing fraud in this case. He, the father of Mrs Killoran, was growing old, he had no wife and but one daughter. He was making provision for his daughter and probably for his own support in his old days. I cannot, under the circumstances, imagine, without express proof of fraud, that we are justified in assuming it. I think the appeal ought to be allowed with costs.\nGwynne, J.:\nI concur in the opinion that the plaintiffs have wholly failed to prove the case stated in their declaration.\nThe object of the action is to have a donation of realty, made by one Martin Treacey to his daughter Ellen on the occasion of her marriage, declared to be fraudulent and void and set aside, to enable the plain-tiffs to recover thereout a balance due by the father upon a purchase of other property made by him from the plaintiffs three years previously to the daughter\u2019s marriage, and for securing which balance, amounting to two-thirds of the purchase money, the plaintiffs at the time of the sale to Martin Treacey had taken back from him a mortgage upon the property sold by them to him.\nThere are three paragraphs in the declaration upon which the plaintiffs rest their right to obtain the relief sought by the action, upon their establishing any one of which they would be entitled to recover. The first is:\nThat the said Martin Treacey made the said donation to the said Ellen Treacey, his daughter, with a view to defraud the said plaintiffs in depriving them of the means of securing the payment of the said balance of the said price of sale herein above recited, the said defendants knowing well at the time that the property sold under the deed of sale was, and is, insufficient to secure the payment.\nThe second paragraph is: That the said Martin Treacey was at the date of the said donation, and before, notoriously insolvent, en d\u00e9confiture; that is to say, hopelessly insolvent and unable to pay his debts, and has ever since remained so to the full knowledge of the said Ellen Treacey and husband, who acted with the said Martin Treacey in fraud and collusion to impair the interests of the said plaintiffs.\nThe third paragraph is:\nThat by the said deed of donation, which was gratuitous and made by the said donee fraudulently and with intent to defraud the said plaintiffs in particular, the said donor divested himself in favor of said donee of a property which was the common pledge of his creditors.\nIt will be observed that in none of these paragraphs do the plaintiffs seek to avoid the contract in virtue of the provisions of the 1084th article of the civil code, namely, that the donation was gratuitous and that the donor was insolvent at the time of making it, although that is really the sole ground upon which the respondents rest their contention, that the judgment of the court below should be supported. The ground relied upon in the first of the above paragraphs states nothing affecting the solvency of Martin Treacey. It charges that the donation was made with intent to defraud the plaintiffs who were his creditors by mortgage. Unless made with intent to defraud, it could not be avoided at the suit of a creditor of the donor, but the paragraph proceeds to specify the particular mode whereby this intent to defraud was to be carried out, namely, that by this donation the plaintiffs would be deprived of the means of securing the balance due to them on their said mortgage security, the defendants well knowing at the time of making the donation that the property held by the plaintiffs in mortgage was insufficient to secure payment of the money secured by the mortgage. The gist of this paragraph plainly is that the intent to defraud charged in it is manifested by the knowledge imputed to Marlin Treacey, that at time of making the donation, he well knew the property held by the plaintiffs in mortgage was insufficient to secure payment of the mortgage debt. Now, not to rest upon the absence from this paragraph, and indeed from the \u2019 declaration, of an averment (to bring the case as stated in this paragraph within the 1038th section of the civil code, namely, that beside having been made with intent to defraud, the donation would have the effect of injuring the creditor,) to the effect that the donor had no property out of which the alleged deficiency of the mortgaged property to pay the mortgage debt could be supplied other than the property donated, it is sufficient to say in answer to the case as alleged in this paragraph, that there has been no evidence offered of a character sufficient to establish that Martin Treacey had any such knowledge as is imputed to him, or that he entertained any intent to defraud the plaintiffs when he made the donation, or that he made it with that intent. Indeed there is no sufficient evidence, that as a matter of fact, at the time of the donation in June, 1879, the property purchased by Treacey from the plaintiff in 1876 was not worth the two-thirds of the purchase money for which he purchased the property.\nThe charge as alleged in the second of the above paragraphs is\u2014not only that prior to and at the date of the donation Martin Treacey was notoriously and hope-lessly insolvent and unable to pay his debts, but that such his insolvency was well known to the donee and her husband, who acted together with Martin Treacey in fraud and collusion in accepting the donation from him with intent to injure the plaintiffs. Of this knowledge in Ellen Treacey and her husband and of the constructive fraud and collusion charged, there is not any evidence whatever offered, nor, indeed, is there sufficient evidence of the alleged insolvency of Martin, assuming such insolvency alone to be sufficient to avoid the donation. Martin Treacey appears to have had no debt but that to the plaintiff, and which was secured by a mortgage. It is difficult to understand how a person owing no debts whatever, except one amounting only to two-thirds of the purchase money of a piece of property purchased by him, and which two-thirds was secured by mortgage upon the whole of the property, the purchase of which constituted the debt, can be ? aid to have been notoriously and hopelessly insolvent. There is no evidence whatever in my opinion sufficient to establish the averment that Marlin Treacey was insolvent when he made the donation to his daughter, nor of any fraudulent intent whatever in the daughter accepting the donation. The plaintiffs therefore failed to establish any one of the grounds upon which their claim to the relief they have prayed is based, and it is unnecessary to determine the point upon which there appears to be a conflict of opinion, whether the law of the Province of Quebec in regard to donations by a parent by way of provision for a daughter upon her marriage and for her husband and their children, is different from the law of France and that of England in which marriage is deemed to constitute valuable consideration.\nThe appeal, in my opinion, should be allowed with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellants: Doutre & Joseph.\nSolicitors for respondents: Judah & Branchaud.\n[1] 3 Dorion\u2019s 6 B.

Ritchie, C.J., and Strong, Fournier, Henry and Gwynne, JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF QUEEN\u2019S BENCH, MANITOBA (IN EQUITY).\nProperty\u2014Offer to sell\u2014Acceptance on completion of title\u2014Specific performance.\nOn the 26th of January, 1882, McI. wrote to H. as follows: \u201cA. McI. agrees to take $35,000 for property known as McM. block. Terms\u2014one-third cash, balance in one year at eight per cent, per annum. Open until Saturday, 28th, noon.\u201d On the same day H. accepted this offer in the following terms: \u201c I beg to accept your offer made this morning. I will accept the property known as McM. block, being the property on M. street, for $35,000, payable one-third cash on completion of title, and balance in one year at eight per cent. You will please have papers and abstract submitted by your solicitor to N. F. H., Esq., 22, D. block, as soon as possible, that I may get conveyance and give mortgage.\u201d On a bill for specific performance, the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench (Man.) decreed that H. was entitled to have the agreement specifically performed.\nHeld\u2014(Ritchie, C.J., and Fournier} J., dissenting), that there was no binding, unconditional acceptance of the offer of sale, and therefore no completed contract of sale between the parties.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench Manitoba, (equity side), dismissing an appeal from a decree made in the cause by Mr. Justice Dubuc in favor of the respondent.\nThis was a suit by the plaintiff (respondent) against the defendant (appellant) for the specific performance of an alleged contract, with compensation, or alleged defects in the subject-matter of sale.\nThe prayer of the bill and defendants answer, as well as the documentary evidence relied on by the parties and the decree of Mr. Justice Dubuc, are given at length in the judgment of Ritchie, O.J., hereinafter given. A hearing of the cause, by way of appeal against Mr. Justice Dubuc\u2019s judgment and decree, took place before the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench (in equity), Chief Justice Wood and Mr. Justice Dubuc being present, and the court being equally divided, the appeal from the decree was dismissed with costs.\nThe defendant thereupon appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nMr. Lash, Q.C., for appellant:\nThere was no subsisting contract between the parties to this suit because there is a variance between the proposition of the defendant and the alleged acceptance thereof by the plaintiff. The plaintiff, in lieu of a cash payment, proposes a delay until completion of title, and introduced a new condition, viz., a conveyance and mortgage. Oriental Inland Steam Company v. Briggs ([1]); Crossley v. Maycock ([2]); Hussey v. Horne-Payne ([3]).\nThe plaintiff was aware of the fact that the property in question was leased, and having bought with this knowledge, he cannot now object to take the property subject to such leases.\nIf the plaintiff is entitled to specific performance of the agreement it can only be decreed on the terms that the property is to be taken as it stands without compensation.\nThe defendant further submits that the decree in the court below, if any were granted in favor of the plaintiff, should have been merely one for specific performance without compensation and giving to him the costs of the suit. Mr. Dalton McCarthy, Q.C., and Mr. A. F. Mclntyre for respondent:\nThere was a complete contract satisfying the statute of frauds made between the appellant and respondent for the sale and purchase of the property in question by the appellant\u2019s proposal or offer of the 26th of January, 1882, and by the respondent\u2019s acceptance of the same date. The acceptance is unconditional, and the latter part of the respondent\u2019s letter of acceptance does not, as argued by the appellant, contain any proposal to vary or add any new term to the agreement between the parties, for the suggestions made are those attaching by law to the contract, Fry on Specific Performance (1).\nThe argument of the appellant that it is not an unconditional acceptance is not sustained by authority, the case of Crossley v. Maycock (2), relied upon by the appellant, is not an authority under the circumstances of this case. There were terms sought to be imposed, not usual but special. This case is more like the case of Lewis v. Bras (3), where similar words to those used here were not held to affect the unconditional nature of the acceptance, and see Lord Cairns\u2019s reasoning in his judgment in Hussey v. Horne-Payne ([4]); 2 Dart on V. & P. ([5])\nThere is no new term where the acceptance merely proceeds to treat, as in this case, of the way in which the contract was to be carried out.\nThe respondent is not only entitled to specific performance, but is entitled to compensation as given him by the decree, because the property was leased and he had no notice.

Cox ([8]).\nMr. Lash, Q.C., in reply.\nRITCHIE, C J.:\u2014\nThe plaintiff in this suit prays:\n1. That the agreement may be specifically performed, or if it shall appear that the defendant is unable to wholly perform the said contract by reason of the said leases, that it may be specifically performed as far as he is able with an abatement out of the purchase money for the loss occasioned to the plaintiff by the existence of the said leases, and for that purpose that ail proper directions may be given and accounts taken.\n2. That it may be referred to the master of this court to enquire as to the title of the defendant to the said lands, and to fix a sum proper to be allowed the plaintiff as an abatement out of the said purchase money on account of the existence of the said leases.\n3. The plaintiff hereby offers to perform the said agreement on his part, or if the same cannot be specifically performed completely by the defendant, to perform the same to the extent to which the defendant may be entitled.\n4. That the defendant may be ordered to pay the plaintiff\u2019s costs.\n5. That the plaintiff may have such further and other relief as the nature of the case may require.\nThe defendant (appellant) in answer to the plaintiff\u2019s bill in this suit claims, that at the date of the filing of the said bill there was no contract in existence between him and the plaintiff, that there was at no time a contract sufficient to satisfy the requirements. of the Statute of Frauds, but merely a proposal made on the one hand and not accepted in the terms in which such proposal was made on the other hand.\nThe following correspondence took place between the parties:\nWinnipeg, 26th January, 1882.\nI, Alex.

Mclntyre, Esq., City,\nDEAR SIR:\u2014Mr. Nelson Hood has requested us to write to you upon the subject of the sale of land by you to him. He has deposited with us a marked cheque payable to your order for the amount of the first payment. We have no instructions from you in the matter, but are informed by Mr. Hood that you referred him to us. Will you kindly inform us as to whether you have instructions for us?\nYours truly,\nBain & Blanchard.\nThe decree of Mr. Justice Dubuc was as follows:\nThis court doth declare that the agreement in the pleadings mentioned was duly entered into by the defendant, and that the plaintiff is entitled to have the said agreement specifically performed, and to compensation for the difference between the rents under the existing leases of said property and the rents which might have been obtained on renting and giving possession of the same at the beginning of May last; and also for any damages sustained by the plaintiff by reason of the said agreement not being specifically performed, and doth order and decree the same accordingly.\nAnd this court doth further order and decree, that it be referred to the Master of this court to take accounts and make inquiries as follows:\nAn inquiry what leases affecting the property in question were in existence at the date of the said agreement extending over the first of May last, and what compensation or abatement ought to be allowed in respect thereof.\nAn inquiry what damages have been sustained by the plaintiff by reason of defendant not having specifically performed the said agreement.\nAnd this court doth further decree that the said Master do tax to the plaintiff his costs of, and incidental to, this suit and of the said reference.\nAnd let such sum or sums as shall be allowed to the plaintiff on said inquiries, together with the amount of his said costs, be deducted for the purchase of the said lands.\nAnd upon the plaintiff paying to the defendant the balance which shall be certified to be due to him in respect of such purchase money after such deduction as aforesaid, this court doth order and decree that the defendant do execute a proper conveyance of the said lands in the pleadings mentioned to the plaintiff, or to whom he shall appoint, such conveyance to be settled by the said Master.\nAnd this court doth further order and decree that at the time of execution and delivery of the said conveyance, the defendant do deliver to the plaintiff, upon oath, all deeds and documents in his possession or control relating to the title of the said lands.\nI think this was a good acceptance of this offer, that where a party offers to sell for a certain sum and his terms are one-third cash, balance in one year at 8 per cent, per annum, and this offer is accepted on completion of title, it becomes a concluded agreement, and that it cannot be said, in my opinion, in this case, that this acceptance is subject to any condition whatever, suspending the operation of this acceptance until anything was done which the law did not require to be done. Supposing the acceptance had been simply\u201d I accept your offer,\u201d the contract is complete; and the purchaser? on paying or tendering the cash, is entitled to have the property conveyed and possession given to him, and the seller, not having stipulated for any security for the balance, it may be very questionable whether under this agreement he is entitled to demand it, not having required it by the terms of the proposal, but having on receipt of the one-third trusted to the Personal security of the buyer under the agreement. But it is not necessary to discuss the question, the buyer having been willing, on the title being completed, to give a mortgage for the balance. I do not think, under such an offer and acceptance, he could, on receiving the one-third in cash, not only refuse to give the buyer a title, but also retain the possession of the property whereby he would have the use of one-third of the purchase-money and interest for a year on the balance, and likewise the possession and use of the property in addition. I think the contract contemplated, and the parties intended thereby, that the sale was to be an immediate sale as affects both parties, to take effect from the time of the making of the cash payment of one-third; that when this was paid the vendee was to have a title to the property and possession given to him, and as regards the latter part of the acceptance, asking for papers and abstracts, it was nothing more than that he might have the title investigated in the usual way by his own solicitor, that he might get the conveyance and give his mortgage, which was clearly in the interest of the vendor, as it removed any doubt as to his right to a mortgage security for the balance of the purchase money.\nIn the absence in the contract of any statement as to the title which is to be shown by the vendor, I think the purchaser\u2019s right to a good title is implied by law, and before he is compelled to pay the purchase money he has a right to require that a good title should be shown, or at any rate, to use plaintiffs expression, to \u201chave the papers and abstracts submitted,\u201d to enable him to have the title investigated and get a conveyance and give a mortgage.\nAs regards the leases, I think the purchaser would be bound to take the property, subject to the leases of which he had notice, as existing in the property when the offer and acceptance was made. As to any others, if any, he might be entitled to an abatement or compensation in case the value of the property was in fact depreciated thereby.\nSTRONG, J.:\u2014\nI am of opinion that this appeal should be allowed and the decree of the court below reversed upon the ground that there never was any completed contract of sale between the parties. This is the first and principal reason assigned for the dissenting judgment of the late Chief Justice of Manitoba, and I entirely concur in the conclusion to which he came that there was not such an acceptance of the defendants offer of the 26th of January, 1882, and the 24th February, 1882, as to constitute a binding agreement for the sale of the property in question.\nThe defendants offer of the 26th January, 1882, is as follows:\nWinnipeg, 26th January, 1882.\nI, Alex. Mclntyre, agree to take $35,000 for property known as the \u201c McMicken block.\u201d Terms, one-third cash, balance in one year at 8 per cent, per annum. Open until Saturday, 28th noon.\nAlex. Mclntyre.\nWitness\nW. N. Hood\nIt is said that this offer was accepted by the letter of the plaintiff addressed and sent to the defendant on the same day, and which is in the following words:\nJanuary 26,1882.\nDEAR SIR:\u2014I beg to accept your offer made to me this morning. I will accept the property known as \u201cMcMicken block\u201d being the property on Main street to the north of Horsman store, on the west side of it, 49 to 50 feet and 120 feet, for thirty-five thousand dollars ($35,000), payable one-third cash on completion of title and balance in one year at 8 per cent. You will please have papers and abstract submitted by your solicitor to N. F. Hagel, Esq, 22 Donaldson\u2019s block, as soon as possible, that I may get conveyance and give mortgage.\nI am, sir,\nYours truly,\nWm. Nelson Hood.\nWitness:\nW. N. Hood,\nJames A. Miller,\nAlex, Mclntyre,\nCity.\nI do not consider this letter as equivalent to a simple acceptance in terms of the defendants offer, but as containing counter proposals which are not compiled in the proposition of the defendant, and to which the defendant never acceded. The offer was to sell for one-third cash, \u201cbalance in one year at 8 per cent, per annum.\u201d By his letter the plaintiff proposes that the purchase money shall be \u201cpayable one-third cash on completion of title and balance in one year at 8 per cent.\u201d These are not the same terms proffered, by the defendant. The condition precedent to the payment of the \u2153 cash, that the title should be completed is a variation from the offer, and an agreement concluded on the basis of it would not be the same contract as would have been constituted by a simple acceptance of the defendants proposition. The expression one-third cash, I construe as an elliptical form of expression for\u201d one-third cash down at the time of acceptance of the offer.\u201d And if the proposal had been expressed in this way, there could be no doubt that the stipulation for the payment of one-third of the purchase-money would not have been subject to the condition precedent of a good title being shown, but would have been a payment in the nature of a deposit to be made immediately on the acceptance of the offer. I can attribute no other meaning to one-third cash than that just mentioned, and if this is so, it is manifest that the plaintiff\u2019s letter was not such an absolute and equivocal accession to the terms proposed, as to constitute an agreement between the parties according to the well understood and elementary principles of the law of contract. If there had been a simple acceptance of the defendants offer, the plaintiff would, of course, have had a right to insist on a good title being shown before completion, this would have been an implied term of the contract, as in every case of an agreement for the sale of real property, but what I hold is, that we cannot imply that such good title was to be shown prior to the payment of the one-third of the purchase-money which was to be paid in cash.\nFurther, I am of opinion the concluding paragraph of the plaintiff\u2019s letter of the 26th January, asking that the abstract and papers be sent to Mr. Hagel that he might get conveyance and give a mortgage, also amounts to a proposal of terms neither expressed nor implied in the defendants offer. If there had been a contract on the basis of a simple acceptance of the defendants terms, the defendant would not have been bound to complete by a conveyance until the two-thirds (residue) of the purchase money was paid, and this payment was postponed for a year, he could not have insisted on im-immediate completion, and compelled the defendant to accept a mortgage as security for this deferred payment, for such a mode of carrying the contract into execution would not have been stipulated for; and in the course of some years experience in Courts of Equity, I have never heard it even seriously argued that a purchaser, the payment of whose purchase money is postponed, has, without an express provision to that effect in the contract, a right to demand immediate completion by a conveyance, on the terms of securing the deferred purchase money by mortgage. No authority for such a proposition can be found, and the ordinary practice of Courts of Equity is against it. I, therefore, consider the words:\u2014\u201dthat I may get conveyance and give mortgage\u201d read in connection with the other part of the letter, as a proposal to carry out the contract in a different manner from that which was implied in the defendants offer and consequently in this respect again the acceptance was subject to a variation of the terms on which the defendant offered to sell.\nThen on the 24th of February, 1882, the defendant wrote and sent to the plaintiff this letter:\nWinnipeg, 24th February, 1882.\nWm. Nelson Hood, Esq.:\nI beg to notify you that I have been and am now ready to carry out my offer, dated the 26th January, 1882, in reference to the sale of the McMicken block, without any variation or qualification, and I also hereby notify you that if the terms of such offer are not complied with on or before Monday next, the 27th instant, at 12 o\u2019clock, noon, I shall consider such offer on my part rescinded. You will please take notice and govern yourself accordingly.\nYours, & c.,\nAlex. Mclntyre.\nIt is clear upon the evidence that there never was any acceptance of the original offer as repeated in this letter for two reasons. First, Mr. Blanchard, to whom on the 25th of February the plaintiff handed a cheque and communicated what it is contended constituted an acceptance, is not found to have been the defendants solicitor or agent, or to have had any authority to receive the acceptance of the option, and, secondly, for the reason already mentioned as applicable to the first offer, that the cheque was, as stated in the plaintiffs own evidence, not to be handed over to the defendant \u201c until the papers were made and everything completed to the satisfaction of my solicitor,\u201d conditions which would have rendered the contract an entirely different one from that which the defendant had proposed to enter into. That the plaintiff did not intend by his communication to Mr. Blanchard simply to accept the defendants terms, but only proposed to pay the $11,666: upon the immediate completion of title and delivery of possession, to which the defendant had never proposed to assent is, also, evident from plaintiff\u2019s letter of the 27th of February, in which he says: \u201cI handed Mr. Blanchard a cheque on the 25th which he holds upon satisfactory completion of title and delivery of possession.\u201d I do not, of course, doubt that if Mr. Blanchard had had authority to act for the defendant, and there had been an unqualified acceptance of the defendants proposition, that acceptance, though verbal, would have been sufficient to constitute a contract binding on the defendant under the Statute of Frauds, but the evidence shows there never was such an acceptance. In my opinion, the decree should be reversed and the bill dismissed, with costs to appellant in both courts.\nFOURNIER, J.:\u2014\nLa demande en cette cause a pour objet de faire sp\u00e9cifiquement d\u00e9cr\u00e9ter l\u2019ex\u00e9cution (sp\u00e9cific performance) de la vente d\u2019un certain terrain, situ\u00e9 dans la cit\u00e9 de Winnipeg, connu sous le nom de McMicken\u2019s Block Un d\u00e9cret \u00e0 cet effet n\u2019est accord\u00e9 que lorsqu\u2019il y a un contract formellement conclu entre les parties dont il y a un \u00e9crit, avec en outre l\u2019accomplissement des autres formalit\u00e9s voulues par le Statute of Frauds, concernant les ventes d\u2019immeubles.\nCelle dont il s\u2019agit a \u00e9t\u00e9 effectu\u00e9e au moyen des deux \u00e9crits ci-apr\u00e8s cit\u00e9s.

I will accept the property known as McMicken\u2019s Block, being the property on Main street to the north of Horsman\u2019a store, on west aide of it, 49 to 50 feet by 120, for thirty-five thousand dollars ($35,000), payable 1-3 cash on completion of title, and balance in one year at 8 per cent.

Mclntyre, Esq.\nCity.\nLe principal moyen de d\u00e9fense offert par l\u2019appelant, est une d\u00e9n\u00e9gation du contrat all\u00e9gu\u00e9, \u00e0 laquelle il a ajout\u00e9 comme second moyen de d\u00e9fense, que les formalit\u00e9s de la section 4 du Statute of Frauds n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 observ\u00e9es.\nHood ayant sign\u00e9 comme t\u00e9moin \u00e0 cette d\u00e9claration de Mclntyre, on soul\u00e8ve la pr\u00e9tention que cet \u00e9crit ne contient pas de la part de ce dernier une offre l\u00e9gale de vendre, et que partant l\u2019acceptation que Hood en a faite le 22 janvier 1882, ne peut constituer un contrat, attendu qu\u2019il n\u2019y aurait pas eu offre de vendre. Cet \u00e9crit, quoique dans une forme assez singuli\u00e8re, n\u2019en contient pas moins un consentement (I agree) de prendre la somme de $35,000 pour la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 connue sous le nom de McMicheris Block, ainsi que les autres conditions pour en faire une offre de vente. Il est difficile de voir quelle diff\u00e9rence il y aurait entre les deux propositions, si au lieu de I agr\u00e9e to take $35,000, Mclntyre avait dit I agr\u00e9e to sell for $35,000. Est-ce que dans l\u2019un comme dans l\u2019autre cas, il ne serait pas oblig\u00e9 d\u2019effectuer la vente sur l\u2019accomplissemen des conditions contenues dans cet \u00e9crit? Ce langage entre hommes d\u2019affaires me para\u00eet suffisant pour constituer une offr&de vente. Il serait extraordinaire, pour le moins, de pr\u00e9tendre que Mclntyre, qui para\u00eet \u00eatre un homme tr\u00e8s entendu dans les affaires, avait simplement voulu par cet \u00e9crit faire une d\u00e9claration de ses intententions au sujet du McMicken\u2019s Block, non \u00e0 quelqu\u2019un en particulier, mais au public en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, comme une sorte d\u2019annonce Cet \u00e9crit a \u00e9t\u00e9 par lui remis \u00e0 Hood comme contenant les bases d\u2019apr\u00e8s lesquelles il \u00e9tait pr\u00eat \u00e0 traiter avec lui pour sa propri\u00e9t\u00e9. D\u2019ailleurs par sa lettre du 24 f\u00e9vrier, l\u2019appelant n\u2019a-t-il pas consid\u00e9r\u00e9 son offre du 22 janvier comme obligatoire, et ne s\u2019est-il pas d\u00e9clar\u00e9 pr\u00eat \u00e0 s\u2019y conformer? Elle est ainsi con\u00e7ue:\nWinnipeg, 24th February, 1882.\nWm. Nelson Hood, Esq.\nI beg to notify you that I have been and am now ready to carry out my offer dated the 26th of January, 1882, in r\u00e9f\u00e9rence to the sale of the McMicken Block, without any variation or qualification, and I also hereby notify you that if the terms of such offer are not com-plied with on or before Monday next, the 27th inst., at 12 o\u2019clock, noon, I shall consider such offer on my part rescinded. You will please take notice, and govern yourself accordingly.\nYours, & c,\nALEX. McINTYBE.\nApr\u00e8s une d\u00e9claration aussi claire, peut-on encore mettre en doute son intention de faire une offre de vente qui devenait obligatoire pour lui si elle \u00e9tait r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement accept\u00e9e. En effet que manque-t-il \u00e0 cette proposition, si elle est accept\u00e9e, pour en faire un contrat complet dont l\u2019ex\u00e9cution puisse \u00eatre ordonn\u00e9e par la cour de chancellerie? Ne contient-elle pas tous les \u00e9l\u00e9ments d\u2019un contrat parfait? La propri\u00e9t\u00e9 qui en fait l\u2019objet, si elle n\u2019est d\u00e9crite. d\u2019une mani\u00e8re bien pr\u00e9cise et d\u00e9taill\u00e9e est, au moins, facile \u00e0 identifier et \u00e0 rendre certaine, et cela suffit pour l\u2019accomplissement de la condition que l\u2019objet de la vente doit \u00eatre certain. Le prix en est fix\u00e9 \u00e0 $85,000. Les conditions de paiementsont \u00e9galement bien d\u00e9finies, savoir:\u2014un tiers comptant et la balance dans un an avec int\u00e9r\u00eat \u00e0 8 pour cent. Toutes les conditions requises pour qu\u2019une cour puisse ordonner l\u2019ex\u00e9cution d\u2019un tel contrat se trouvent donc r\u00e9unies dans celui dont il s\u2019agit. Evidemment la condition de l\u2019\u00e9crit exig\u00e9 par la section 4 du Statute of Frauds a \u00e9t\u00e9 satisfaite par l\u2019offre \u00e9crite et sign\u00e9e par l\u2019appelant. Il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas n\u00e9cessaire que l\u2019acceptation f\u00fbt par \u00e9crit, mais elle l\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 comme on le voit5 par l\u2019exhibit No. 2.\nL\u2019offre ainsi faite devait demeurer ouverte jusqu\u2019au 28 janvier \u00e0 midi. Il para\u00eet qu\u2019elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 imm\u00e9diatement accept\u00e9e. Si l\u2019acceptation ci-dessus cit\u00e9e ne contient pas quelque condition ou addition qui soit une d\u00e9viation \u00e0 l\u2019offre faite, elle a d\u00fb op\u00e9rer un contrat parfait entre les parties. L\u2019appelant nie qu\u2019elle ait pu avoir cet effet, pr\u00e9tendant que cette acceptation n\u2019est pas sans condition comme elle aurait d\u00fb l\u2019\u00eatre afin de pouvoir r\u00e9clamer l\u2019ex\u00e9cution.\nCependant en recevant cette acceptation le jour m\u00eame de son offre, l\u2019appelant ne fit aucune objection \u00e0 l\u2019insertion des mots \u201c on completion of title,\u201d qu\u2019il veut maintenant faire consid\u00e9rer comme une nouvelle condition qui lui permet de retirer son offre. Ce n\u2019est que le 24 f\u00e9vrier suivant qu\u2019il a cru trouver l\u00e0 un moyen de se d\u00e9gager du contrat op\u00e9r\u00e9 par l\u2019acceptation de l\u2019intim\u00e9, et c\u2019est alors qu\u2019il \u00e9l\u00e8ve pour la premi\u00e8re fois cette objection. En premi\u00e8re instance devant l\u2019honorable juge Dubuc elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9e; mais en appel devant d\u00e8ux juges seulement de la cour du Banc de la Reine de Manitoba (le troisi\u00e8me se trouvant pour cause d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat incomp\u00e9tent \u00e0 si\u00e9ger dans cette cause), l\u2019honorable juge en chef a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u2019une opinion contraire \u00e0 celle de son coll\u00e8gue, La cour se trouvant alors \u00e9galement partag\u00e9e, le jugement de premi\u00e8re instance s\u2019est trouv\u00e9 confirm\u00e9. D\u2019apr\u00e8s l\u2019honorable juge en chef l\u2019acceptation aurait d\u00fb \u00eatre simplement \u201c \/ accept your offer\u201d au lieu de la lettre ci-dessus, dans laquelle l\u2019intim\u00e9, apr\u00e8s les mots one-third cash, a ins\u00e9r\u00e9 ceux-ci \u201c on completion of title.\u201d Il consid\u00e8re l\u2019insertion de ces mots comme une modifi-\u2019 cation de l\u2019offre qui justifie l\u2019appelant \u00e0 en refuser l\u2019ex-\u00e9cution. Ce motif est-il s\u00e9rieux en fait? L\u2019appellant pouvait-il un seul instant s\u2019imaginer que l\u2019acheteur paierait un prix aussi \u00e9lev\u00e9 ppur cette propri\u00e9t\u00e9 sans avoir la certitude d\u2019avoir un titre valable? En consentant \u00e0 payer comptant, \u00e9tait-il n\u00e9cessaire d\u2019ajouter qu\u2019il ne se d\u00e9partirait de son argent que sur l\u2019exhibition d\u2019un titre suffisant. Cette condition quoique non \u00e9nonc\u00e9e alors, est une de celles qu\u2019il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas n\u00e9cessaire de formuler. Puisque l\u2019intim\u00e9 achetait et payait, il devait avoir un titre. Sans titre il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas acheteur. En supposant que l\u2019acceptation e\u00fbt \u00e9t\u00e9 telle que le voulait l\u2019honorable juge en chef, I accept your offer, l\u2019intim\u00e9 aurait-il \u00e9t\u00e9 pour cela priv\u00e9, au moment du paiement, du droit de dire, \u201c Voici mes deniers, montrez moi votre titre \u201c? Certainement non, et si le titre exhib\u00e9 n\u2019e\u00fbt pas \u00e9t\u00e9 satisfaisant, n\u2019aurait-il pas \u00e9t\u00e9 justifiable de garder ses deniers. Pour avoir mis l\u2019appelant sur ses gardes, en ins\u00e9rant dans son acceptation les mots on completion of title, il n\u2019a fait alors que ce qu\u2019il aurait eu le droit de faire plus tard, ce que d\u2019ailleurs la loi pr\u00e9sume dans le silence des parties.\nIl n\u2019est pas correct de dire d\u2019une mani\u00e8re absolue qu\u2019un contrat fait comme l\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 celui dont il s\u2019agit, ne peut contenir aucune autre condition que celle que l\u2019on peut trouver dans l\u2019\u00e9crit qui en constate l\u2019existence. Au contraire, \u00e0 moins d\u2019une d\u00e9claration expresse excluant formellement toutes conditions implicites, celles que la loi pr\u00e9sume ordinairement, se trouvent comprises dans un tel contrat. Voici ce que dit \u00e0 ce sujet \u201c Fry, on Sp\u00e9cifie Performance\u201d sec. 223: Besides the express terms of the contract, there are others which, in the absence of any expression to the contrary, are implied by presumption (4, note). With regard to such terms, therefore, whether they be necessary terms or not, the silence of the contract does not render it incompl\u00e8te.\nDans le No. suivant, 224, l\u2019auteur va plus loin, en d\u00e9clarant que dans tout contrat pour la vente d\u2019immeubles, il y a la condition implicite de fournir un bon titre.\nIn every contract for the sale of land, a condition is implied for a good title (No. 8), and for the delivering up of the deeds, so that when this was prevented by the accidental destruction of the deeds subsequent to the contract, it was held that the vendor could not enforce the sale.\nDans une cause r\u00e9cemment d\u00e9cid\u00e9e dans la division de la cour de chancellerie par Fry, J., ce principe a \u00e9t\u00e9 confirm\u00e9.\nIl est \u00e9vident d\u2019apr\u00e8s cette autorit\u00e9 que l\u2019insertion des mots \u201c on completion of title \u201c ne peut aucunement affecter la validit\u00e9 de l\u2019acceptation, puisque la loi pr\u00e9sume l\u2019existence de cette condition. Ce principe a \u00e9t\u00e9 reconnu par Fry, J., en ces termes ([9]):\nFry, J.: When the contract is silent as to the title which is to be shown by the vendor, and the purchaser\u2019s right to a good title is merely implied by law, that l\u00e9gal implication may be rebutted by shewing that the purchaser had notice before the contract that the vendor could not give a good titfe.\nIl n\u2019y a rien dans la preuve en cette cause qui puisse r\u00e9futer ou contredire la pr\u00e9somption l\u00e9gale, parce qu\u2019il n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 aucunement question du titre ni d\u2019objections \u00e0 sa validit\u00e9. Il y a eu silence absolu \u00e0 cet effet. La pr\u00e9somption l\u00e9gale doit donc avoir son effet.\nCe principe a aussi \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9 par Lord Cairns dans la cause de Hussey v. Horn-Payne, o\u00f9 l\u2019honorable Chancelier fait au sujet des mots \u201csubject to the title being approved by our Solicitor,\u201d le raisonnement suivant pour d\u00e9montrer que ces termes ne constituaient pas une condition modifiant le contrat ([10]). R\u00e9futant l\u2019objection que l\u2019acceptation contenait en r\u00e9alit\u00e9 la constitution d\u2019un arbitre de la volont\u00e9 arbitraire duquel devait d\u00e9pendre l\u2019ex\u00e9cution du contrat, il dit:\nI feel great difficulty in thinking that any person would have intended a term of this kind to have that operation, because, as was pointed out in the course of the argument, it would virtually reduce the agreement to that which is illusory. It would make the vendor bound by the agreement, but it would leave the purchaser perfectly free\u2026\u2026\u2026.. My Lords, I have great difficulty in thinking that any person would agree to a term which would have that operation. But it appears to me very doubtful whether the words have that meaning. I am disposed rather to look upon them,\u2014and the case which was cited from Ireland would be authority, if authority were needed for that. view,\u2014I am disposed to look upon the words as meaning nothing more than a guard against its being supposed that the title was to be accepted without investigation, as meaning in fact the title must be investigated and approved of in the usual way, which would be by the Solicitor of the purchaser\u2026\u2026\u2026..\nCe raisonnement est tout \u00e0 fait applicable au cas actuel. Dans la cause de Lewis v. Brass, les mots suivants ajout\u00e9s dans l\u2019acceptation d\u2019une offre pour l\u2019ex\u00e9cution de certains travaux, the contract will he pre-pared by, ne furent consid\u00e9r\u00e9s que comme sugg\u00e9rant un mode facile de mettre \u00e0 ex\u00e9cution les intentions des parties, et non pas comme une condition additionnelle. Les raisonnements, faits par les honorables juges dans cette cause confirment la position prise par l\u2019Intim\u00e9 dans celle-ci.\nPour ces motifs, je suis d\u2019avis que l\u2019appel doit \u00eatre renvoy\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens.\nHENRY, J.:\nI may say, in setting out, that I entirely concur in the views expressed by my learned brother judge Strong and in those of the Chief Justice of Manitoba, on record in this case. I adopt, in fact, their reasoning for the conclusions at which they have arrived. If we look at this offer we will see that it is a very bald one, terms one-third cash, and the balance in one year at 8 per cent. That offer was made on Thursday, the 26th of January, and was to remain open until the following Saturday, the 28th, at noon\u2014that is, two days. It is very precise as to time, and the party was bound, if he wanted to purchase, to accept within the time limited. However, on the same day the party accepted that offer, and it is for us to consider whether he did accept it in its legal consequences and result. The offer that he makes in acceptance is limited to the payment of one-third cash on the completion of the title. Now, there is no such term in the offer, that it shall be one-third cash on the completion of the title, nor can it be said that that would not be a deviation from the terms of the offer; but we are told that the party had a right, before he paid his money, or any of it, to see that the title was good. But the acceptance adds something else. I admit that the party would have a right to see that the title was good, and a right to reasonable information as to that from the party selling and a reasonable time to investigate before paying his money, and possibly, under the circumstances, it might be said to apply to the first deposit That, however, is a question that is not necessary to be decided, because he says, \u201cyou will please have papers submitted as soon as possible that I may get conveyance and give mortgage.\u201d\nThere is nothing in the original offer that he was to get a conveyance on the payment of that money. His first duty was to tender one-third of the money as agreed upon, and he could not upon acceptance of it, say to the seller,\u201d Give me a deed and I will give you a mortgage,\u201d when it is not mentioned in the agreement. If he wanted to have these as a part of the terms of the contract, it was his business to have had them inserted in the offer that he was present at the drawing up of, and became a witness to; or if he added these as terms, it was his business to see that there was an acceptance from the seller upon these added terms to form between the parties a binding contract. Now, we are told that the party had a right to get a deed and give a mortgage, but I maintain that he had no such right. There may be reasons why the party who offered to sell the property should say \u201cno, when I am paid the whole of the money, I will give you the title.\u201d He might have said \u201cI do not consider one-third payment sufficient security for me, if I have to wait a year for the balance.\u201d Properties were jumping up and down in Manitoba at the time. There was a good deal of speculation, and if the boom was over a depression was likely to take place What right had he to say: \u201cMr. Mclntyre, I will give you one-third of the purchase-money, but you must depend upon the value of the property in twelve months for the balance?\u201d No such bargain was entered into; no such agreement was thought of or spoken of by either of the parties. I, therefore, take it, there was no valid acceptance of the offer in any way unless there was evidence of acquiescence in it afterwards by the seller, Mclntyre. I can see no such evidence, and I have come to the conclusion, therefore, for the reasons already given at length by my brother Strong, and very fairly and properly put in the judgment of the learned Chief Justice, that the appeal should be dismissed with costs of both courts.\nGWYJNNE, J:\u2014\nI concur in the judgment read by my Brother Strong and in the judgment of the late Chief Justice of Manitoba. If I had arrived at a different conclusion I should be of opinion that the plaintiff below has shewn no case of deceit or even of with-holding of knowledge as to the nature of the tenancies to warrant any abatement from the price of the property. The objection is not that the introduction of the words \u201con completion of title\u201d makes the acceptance defective, but the question is whether the defendant\u2019s offer was that he should receive the cash payment on the completion of the title or upon acceptance of the offer.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellants: S.

Both lots had formerly belonged to one person, and there was no exact indication of the true boundary line between them. F. being about to build, employed a surveyor to ascertain the boundary. The surveyor went to the place, and asked C. where he claimed his northern boundary was. C. pointed out an old fence, running part of the way across the land between the lots and an old post, and said the line of the fence produced to the post was his boundary line. The surveyor then took the average line of the fence and produced it till it met the post. He staked out this line, C. not objecting. A few days afterwards, T., with his architect and builder, went on the ground, and, in the presence of C, the builder again marked out the boundary by means of a line connecting the surveyor\u2019s marks, C. not objecting. Excavating was commenced according to that line immediately, and T\u2019s house was built according to the line on the extreme verge of T\u2019s land. The first time that C. raised any objection to the boundary so marked was when the walls of T\u2019s house were up and ready for the roof and considerable money had been expended in building.\nHeld,\u2014That C. was estopped from disputing that the line run by the surveyor, was the true line.\nPer Strong, J.: When lands are described by reference to a plan, the plan is considered as incorporated with the deed, and the boundaries of the lands conveyed as defined by the plan are to be taken as part of the description. In construing a deed of land not subject to special statutory regulations, extrinsic evidence of monuments and actual boundary marks is inadmissible to control the deed, but if reference is made by the deed to such monuments and boundaries, they control, though they may call for courses, distances, or computed contents which do not agree with those in the deed.\nIn 1861, W.D.P., who owned a piece of land bounded on the south by Queen street, on the east by William street, on the west by Dummer street, and running north some distance, laid out the southerly portion into lots depicted upon a plan, which plan showed the boundary line between the plaintiff\u2019s and defendant\u2019s lots to be exactly 600 feet from Queen street. There were no stakes or other marks on the ground to indicate the boundaries of the lots or the extent of the land so laid out. Many years afterwards the remaining land to the north of the parcel so laid out, was laid out into lots so depicted on another plan, and a street was shewn between the northerly limit of the first plan and the southerly limit of the second plan. The actual distance, however, of this street from Queen street was greater than the first plan on its face shewed it to be, and the parties owning lots on the first plan appeared to have taken up their lots as if Queen street and the street on the north of the first plan were actual limits of the plan.\nPer Strong, J.: 1. The true boundary line between the plaintiff\u2019s and defendant\u2019s lots was a line commencing at a point 600 feet from Dummer street, as measured on the ground at the time when the plan was made; but in the absence of evidence showing a measurement on the levelled street, that point could not be accepted as the true point of commencement of the boundary in question.\n2. Inasmuch as the conveyances to the parties were made according to the first plan, the second plan could not be invoked to aid in ascertaining the limits of the lots so conveyed. Where there is a direct conflict of testimony, the finding of the judge at the trial must be regarded as decisive, and should not be overturned in appeal by a court which has not had the advantage of seeing the witnesses and observing their demeanor while under examination.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario reversing a decree of Vice\u2011Chancellor Blake in favor of respondent.\nThe plaintiff and the defendant owned adjoining properties abutting on the west side of Simcoe street, in the city of Toronto, and running through to the east side of William street. The plaintiff\u2019s lot was known as No. 9, and is north of those of the defendant which are Nos. 7 and 8. Simcoe street was formerly called William street, and the street now called William street was formerly called Dummer street.\nThe plaintiff, in his bill of complaint, alleged that he acquired lot No. 9 from one J.A. Temple, who had upon it a brick house, which he had built close to the southern boundary of the lot as ascertained for him by a surveyor named Wadsworth, but which the defendant alleges encroaches 4 inches on his lot No. 8; and that the defendant had commenced to erect walls, which, to the extent of 4 inches, come across the line to which the said house extends.\nThe bill also alleged that the defendant was aware of Wadsworth\u2019s survey, and of the erection of the house by Temple on the faith of the correctness of the boundary then ascertained, but did not object until the walls of the house were nearly, if not quite completed, when, for the first time, he informed Temple that he claimed that the wall encroached on him 4 inches; and it sets out attempts, on the part of the plaintiff, to arrange the matter without litigation. The prayer was (1) for a declaration that the 4 inch strip is part of lot 9, and belongs to the plaintiff; or (2) that, if part of lot 8, it now belongs to the plaintiff in consequence of Temple\u2019s improvements, and the defendant\u2019s conduct; or (3), that in any event it may be declared to belong to the plaintiff, subject only to his paying its value; and (4), that defendant may be ordered to deliver up possession, and may be restrained from continuing to build or from otherwise trespassing; and (5), for further relief.\nThe defendant by his answer asserted that the encroachment, by the plaintiff\u2019s wall, is 4\u00be inches at the east and 4 inches at the west part of it.\nBy the 3rd paragraph, in answer to the 4th paragraph of the said bill, he says: \u201cbefore the survey therein referred to was made, I told the gentleman who was making the same that a fence which was then standing, and which pan east and west from a point distant about 77 feet, 8 inches from Simcoe street to the eastern boundary of William street (formerly Dummer street), was claimed by me as the true line between the land claimed by me, and that which \u00cf claim to belong to the plaintiff; and that there was a space of 5 feet 10 inches between the north wall of my house and the land which I claim to belong to plaintiff; and I also pointed out to the said surveyor a post which was then and I believe and charge the fact to be, had been since the year 1855, standing on the west side of Simcoe street, and which I then told the said surveyor I claimed to be the north-east boundary of my land, and I believe and charge the fact to be that the said surveyor made his survey on the line of such fence, and that on the plan which the said surveyor made, and which was furnished to James A Temple, in the said bill named, the said space of 5 feet and 10 inches was shown thereon as being the distance between my said wall and the south boundary of the plaintiffs land.\u201d\n\u201c4. In answer to the fifth paragraph of the said bill, I believe, and charge the fact to be, that the said Temple did not adopt the said survey made for him as shown on the plan when he commenced to erect the brick dwelling in the said bill referred to, but that the said Temple, with the aid of the builder whom he had employed, laid out a new line which the said Temple adopted as the south boundary of his land.\u201d\nThe defendant also denied the charge of dilatoriness in giving notice to Temple, and alleged that he notified him promptly, and before he had begun to build the walls of his house, that he was encroaching; and he tells a very different story from that told by the plaintiff, about the exertions made to come to an amicable settlement. He admitted building his walls on the four inch strip, but said he did not interfere with the plaintiff\u2019s wall, and had no intention of injuring it. The answer stated a survey made at the instance of the defendant, at which Temple and his surveyor were present by appointment, by which the boundary was ascertained, as now claimed by the defendant. That was after Temple\u2019s house was built. Other facts were alleged for the purpose of showing acquiescence by Temple and by the plaintiff in the result of that survey. The defendant also set up title under the Real Property Limitations Act.\nThe cause was heard in November, 1880, before Blake, V.C., who made a decree for the plaintiff, from which the defendant appealed to the Court of Appeal for Ontario, which court reversed the decree. V.C. Blake dismissed the plaintiff\u2019s bill.\nThe documentary and oral evidence is reviewed at length in the judgments hereinafter given.\nMr. Robinson, Q.C., and Mr. Armour, for appellant, contended that the conduct of the respondent before, at, and, about the time of running the line and building estops him from now disputing the said line, even if it ever encroached upon his land, and from, in fact, attack- ing the quiet possession of the land, having by his former acts, induced the appellant\u2019s predecessor in title to believe such land was his own, and to incur great expense; that the evidence showed the line was a conventional one, and that the finding of the learned judge of the facts upon which he made his decree should not have been disturbed by the Court of Appeal.\nDr. McMichael, Q.C., and Mr. Hoskin, Q.C., for respondent, contended that as the evidence showed that the respondent never consented to any deflection from the true boundary line, and as there was evidence that the true line had not been followed, he cannot be held to have assented because he believed their representation or to be estopped from claiming the true line.\nRITCHIE, C.J.:\u2014\nThe action in this case was brought in consequence of the defendant\u2019s interfering with the southerly wall of the plaintiff\u2019s house. The defendant and the plaintiff were proprietors of lots of land in the city of Toronto, adjoining each other, and the difficulty arises between them as to the dividing line between those lots. A great deal of evidence was gone into in the case for the purpose of discovering, if it were possible, (which might not be a very easy task) exactly to an inch where the dividing line of those lots was, but I think that was a discussion wholly foreign to this case, which I think should be determined on another point altogether. I think it is clear law, well established at any rate in the Lower Provinces where I came from, and I believe it must he established every\u00bb where, that where there may be a doubt as to the exact true dividing line of two lots, and the parties meet together and then and there determine and agree on a line as being the dividing line of the two lots, and, upon the strength of that agreement and determination, and fixing of a conventional boundary, one of the parties builds to that line, the other party is estopped from denying that that is the true dividing line between the two properties.\n[The learned Chief Justice after reviewing the evidence and Vice-Chancellor Blake\u2019s judgment concluded as follows:\u2014]\nI think, what took place in this case between the parties amounted to the establishment of a convential boundary or division line, of the respective properties of plaintiff and defendant, from rear to front, and I think the evidence clearly shows that the building of plaintiff\u2019s was erected on such line, so agreed on as such dividing line, and that the plaintiffs building is therefore now on plaintiff\u2019s lot.\nI therefore think that the judgment of Vice-Chancellor Blake was right, and that it should not have been reversed.\nSTRONG, J.:\nThe dispute which has led to the litigation out of which the present appeal arises is in respect of a piece of land 4 inches in width, and 120 feet in depth, the value of which, according to the respondent\u2019s estimate, is ascertained by the fact that he offered to sell 5 feet of the land, of which this 4-inch strip forms part, at the price of $50 per foot. On the part of the appellant\u2019s testator (the original plaintiff by whom this suit was instituted), the contention had a substantial object, and there can be no reproach against him of having acted in a spirit of unreasonable litigiousness, for had he conceded to the respondent the claim which he makes to this four inches of land, it would have involved the necessity of either pulling down the south wail of the dwelling house, which has been built; to the extent of 15 feet and 9 inches, on this 4-inch strip, or of accept- ing the offer which the respondent made of allowing the house to stand as it had been built, on the condition that it should never be used for any purpose but that of a dwelling house, the plaintiff, however, in this last alternative not to have an absolute title, but merely a license to use the 4 inches as a site for the wall of the house, the acceptance of which would have seriously interfered with the plaintiff\u2019s title to the house, and might have rendered it unmarketable, so far as the plaintiff and his predecessor in title are concerned. There does not seem, therefore, to be anything unreasonable in the position which he assumed; and as regards the respondent, if he is able to show that the four inches in question were originally his property, he is, as the Court of Appeal say, entitled to insist that the evidence which would deprive him of it and vest it in his neighbour should be very full and convincing.\nThe land in dispute is part of park lot number 12, in the city of Toronto, which was originally granted by the Crown to the Hon., William Dummer Powell, who, in 1831, caused a plan to be prepared by Mr. Chewett, a surveyor, showing a sub-division of a portion of this park lot into streets and building lots. This plan is registered in the registry office of the city of Toronto, and it shows a street now called Simcoe street, running north from Queen street (formerly Lot street) and another street, originally Dummer street, to the west of Simcoe street, also running north from Queen street, and between these two streets two ranges of 23 lots each, one range fronting on the west side of Simcoe street, and the other on the east side of Dummer street, each lot being 60 feet in width and 120 feet in depth, and each tier of lots commencing at a distance of 120 feet from Queen street, this intermediate space of 120 feet being taken up by a tier of lots fronting on Queen street, 100 feet in depth, and a lane 20 feet wide in the provisions of the statute are shown to have been contravened. Under the circumstances I think we are to take the execution as good, and, I therefore, concur with the Chief Justice that this appeal should be dismissed.\nTASCHEREAU, J, concurred.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellants: MacLaren, MacDonald, Merritt and Shepley.\nSolicitors for respondents: Thomson and Henderson.\n",

Ritchie, C.J., and Strong, Fournier, Henry, Taschereau and Gwynne, JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.\nCompany\u201427 & 28 Vic., ch. 23\u2014Shareholder, liability of\u2014Estoppel\u2014Mortgagee of shares.\nThe Ontario Wood Pavement Company, incorporated under 27 & 28 Vic., ch. 23, with power to increase by by-law the capital stock of the company \u201cafter the whole capital stock of the company shall have been allotted and paid in, but not sooner,\u201d assumed to pass a by-law increasing the capital stock from $130,000 to $250,000 before the original capital stock had been paid in. P. et al, execution\u2014creditors of the company, whose writ had been returned unsatisfied, instituted proceedings by way of sci. fa. against A. as holder of shares not fully paid up in said company. It appeared from an examination of the books that the shares alleged to be held by A. were shares of the increased capital and not of that originally authorized.\nHeld (affirming the judgment of the Court of Appeal) that as there was evidence that the original nominal capital of $130,000 was never paid in, the directors had no power to increase the stock of the company, and as the stock held by A. consisted wholly of new unauthorized stock, P. et al were not entitled to recover. (Gwynne, J., dissenting, on the ground that the objection not having been taken by the defendant or tried, the court, under sec. 22, ch. 38 R.S.O., should put the questions of fact upon which the validity and sufficiency of the objections suggested by the court rested, into a course for trial in due form of law.)\nWhere a statutory liability is attempted to be imposed on a party which can only attach to an actual legal shareholder in a company, he is not estopped by the mere fact of having received transfers of certificates of stock from questioning the legality of the issue of such stock.\nPer Strong and Henry, JJ., (Gwynne, J., contra), that although A., a mortgagee of the shares and not an absolute owner, had taken a transfer absolute in form and caused it to be entered in the books of the company as an absolute transfer, he was not estopped from proving that the transfer of the shares was by way of mortgage. (23 of sub\u2011sec. 19, of sec. 5, 27 & 28 Vic., ch. 23).\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal[1] for Ontario, reversing the judgment of the Court of Common Pleas[2]. The facts and pleadings are fully stated in the opinions of the judges on the present appeal.\nMr. Bethune, Q.C., for appellants, and Mr. Robinson, Q.C., and Mr. MacLennan, Q.C., for respondent.\nThe points relied on and the cases cited are reviewed in the judgments.\nRITCHIE, C.J.:\nThis is an action brought by writ of scire facias by the appellants, who are creditors of the Ontario Wood Pavement Company of Toronto, a body corporate, to recover against the respondent the amount unpaid by him upon the one hundred and eleven shares held by him in the stock of the company.\nThe company was incorporated under a statute of the late Province of Canada, passed in the 27th and 28th years of Her Majesty\u2019s reign, chap. 23. The appellants recovered judgment on the 28th of July, 1874, against the company.\nAn execution issued by them against the company was returned nulla bona, and this action was commenced: on the 22nd September, 1875, by scire facias.\nTo the said scire facias the respondent pleaded, amongst other defences:\n1. For a first plea to the plaintiffs\u2019 declaration, that he was not a stockholder of the said \u201cThe Ontario Wood Pavement Company, Toronto,\u201d as alleged.\n2nd. And for a second plea, the defendant says that there is not still due and unpaid by him on the capital stock of the said company the sum of $8,880 or thereabouts, or any sum whatever, as alleged.\n3. And for a third plea, the defendant says that one George Arthurs was the holder of 111 shares of the capital stock of the said company, amounting to the sum of $11,100, and was entered on the books of the said company as the holder thereof, and on the said books the said shares were entered as shares fully paid up; and the defendant says that he purchased the said shares from the said George Arthurs in good faith and for valuable consideration, believing the same to be fully paid up shares, and without any notice or knowledge that the same were not, in fact, so fully paid up, and the defendant says that the last mentioned shares are the same shares as in the declaration mentioned.\n4. And for a fourth plea, the defendant says that the said writ of fieri facias has not been returned \u201cnulla bona\u201d by the said sheriff, as alleged.\n5. And for a fifth plea, the defendant says that the stock held by him, and referred to in the declaration, was and is so held by him as trustee merely and not otherwise; and other than such stock so held by him as aforesaid, the defendant never had and has not now any shares or stock in the said company.\n6. And for a sixth plea, the defendant says that one George Arthurs, being indebted to the defendant in a large sum of money, and being the holder of the shares in the declaration mentioned, transferred the same to the defendant as collateral security merely for such indebtedness and not otherwise; and the defendant accepted the said shares, and has always held and now holds the same as such collateral security merely and not otherwise; and other than the said shares, the defendant never held and has not now any shares or stock in the said company.\nIssue was joined upon these defences, and the cause came on to be tried before Mr. Justice Galt, at Toronto, on the 20th June, 1878.\nThe appellants proved their judgment, writ of fi. fa. and return nulla bona, and that shares of the stock in the company stood in the defendant\u2019s name as holder in his own right on the books of the company.\nThe following is the certificate of stock held by defendant:\nOrganized under 27-28 Vic., ch. 23, statutes of Canada.\nNo. 69\n111 shares.\nShares $100 each.\nThe Ontario Wood Pavement Company, of Toronto.\nThis is to certify that James Austin, Esq., of Toronto, is owner of one hundred and eleven shares in the capital stock of the Ontario Wood Pavement Co., of Toronto, transferable only on the books of the company, in person or by attorney, in the presence of the president or secretary, on the surrender of this certificate.\nIn testimony whereof the said company have hereunto caused their corporate seal to be affixed, and these presents to be signed by the president; and secretary.\nToronto, Ont., September 29th, 1871.\nH. Lloyd Hime, John Lamb,\nSecretary. Vice-President\nLIMITED.\nThe learned judge at the trial found that the stock in the books of the company appeared to be paid up, but in reality there was only ten per cent. in money paid on the stock.\nHe further found that the stock was only transferred to the respondent by way of security for the amount of Mr. Arthurs\u2019 debt, and that the respondent never intended to incur any responsibility with regard to any unpaid balance that might be due upon the stock.\nA verdict was entered for the respondent. A rule nisi was obtained in the Court of Common Pleas to set aside that verdict, which rule is as follows:\nit is ordered that the defendant, upon notice to be given to his attorney or agent, do show cause on the first day of Michaelmas Term next why the verdict for him, obtained in this cause, should not be set aside, and a verdict entered for the plaintiffs for $1,603, and interest from July, 1874, upon the ground that the verdict is contrary to law and evidence, and pursuant to leave reserved and the Law Reform and Administration of Justice Acts, or why a new trial should not be had between the parties, on account of the improper admission of evidence as to an alleged arrangement among the original shareholders as to the stock in question, and as to the terms on which the defendant accepted the stock.\nAnd in the meantime that all proceedings be stayed.\nThat rule was made absolute on the 27th of June, 1879.\nThe Court of Common Pleas then gave judgment[3].\nWilson, C.J., states that the questions for decision are:\nFirstly. Did the defendant take the shares from Arthurs as collateral security for the debt which Arthurs owed to him, and continue to hold them as such until the commencement of this action?\nSecondly. If he did, should the fact that he was not absolute owner of the stock have appealed in the transfer of such stock to him or in the books of the company?\nThirdly. If it should, then, inasmuch as it did not so appear, had the defendant notice of those shares being in fact unpaid?\nAnd the learned Chief Justice held:\u20141st. That the defendant took the shares as collateral security; 2nd. That the fact that he was not absolute owner should have appeared on the books of the company; 3rd. As this did not appear, and assuming as found by the judge who tried the case, that the stock had not been paid up, and that the defendant had notice of this fact, he decided that, in accepting an absolute transfer, defendant took upon himself the full responsibility of a shareholder.\nMr. Justice Galt concurred in this view, and the rule was made absolute. On appeal to the Court of Appeal for the province of Ontario, that court avowedly decided the case on a point not taken in the courts below nor in the reasons of appeal. It is thus stated by Mr. Justice Burton:\nThe defendant is sued in this proceeding by a judgment creditor of the Ontario Wood Pavement Company, whose execution was returned unsatisfied. It was claimed that the shares which had been transferred to the defendant by a transfer absolute in form, but which was intended to be as security only, were issued as paid-up stock to some of the contractors. It was not made very apparent upon the first argument how this was; but after the argument, Mr. Justice Cameron sent for the transfer book, from which it clearly appears that the stock held by the defendant consists wholly of new stock under the by\u2011law of the 6th February, 1871, which recited that the whole of the original capital stock, amounting to $130,000, had been allotted and paid in, and that the company had determined to increase the capital stock to $250,000, and enacted that it should be increased accordingly.\nOf the original stock of $130,000, $70,000 was first subscribed, and $7,000, or 10 per cent., paid. The subscription was subsequently made up to the full amount, of which the patentees took 920 shares, and in consideration of the other shareholders paying an additional 10 per cent., they agreed to pay up the balance of their shares.\nThis was carried out in the manner described in Scales v. Irwin[4].\nIn point of fact then the recital was untrue. The original stock was not fully paid up, and the right to pass the by-law increasing the capital stock never arose.\nThe question is, how far the present defendant, who pleads that he never was a stockholder, is in a position to raise that defence.\nThe power of the directors to increase the capital stock is derived from sub\u2011sections 16, 17 and 18, of section 5 of the Act 27th and 28th Victoria, ch. 23, and arises only after the whole capital stock has been allotted and paid in, but not sooner, so that the by-law itself was in excess of the power of the directors; and it would seem by the 18th sub-sec. that the by-law, even when passed, is not to have any force or effect whatever, until after it has been sanctioned by a two-thirds vote of the shareholders at a meeting duly called, nor until a copy has been filed with the provincial secretary, and notice under his signature inserted in the Gazette, and from that time the new stock becomes subject to all the provisions of law in like manner as though the same had formed part of the stock of the company originally subscribed.\nThe directors have no power to issue these shares, and there is no proof of the steps preliminary to the by-law becoming operative having been taken; and no shares having been legally issued, it is impossible to say that the defendant was a shareholder, unless on the ground of estoppel.\nAnd on this question of estoppel the court held that the defendant was not estopped, by acceptance of the transfer, from questioning the legality of the issue, and on the ground that the plaintiff here is asking for a statutory remedy against a shareholder, and has failed to show that the defendant comes within the statutory definition they thought the case failed, and it became unnecessary to consider the points argued upon the appeal as opened.\nMr. Justice Patterson says:\nThis appeal turns upon a question not raised in the court below, and only suggested after the first argument before us. Had we only to consider the questions dealt with in the court below, my present opinion is that we ought to dismiss the appeal. The consideration which I have given to those questions has not led me to doubt the correctness of the judgment pronounced upon them. I cannot say, however, that I have considered them as maturely as if they were now to govern our decision.\nUpon the newly suggested point, viz., the status of the defendant as a shareholder, I do not see how the plaintiff can succeed.\nIt is plain from the evidence in Scales v. Irwin[5], which is taken as evidence in this case, that the original nominal capital of $130,000 was never paid. The power to make a by\u2011law for increasing the capital stock was, by sub-sec. 16 of sec. 5 of the statute 27 and 28 Vic., ch. 23, to arise \u201cafter the whole capital stock of the company shall have been allotted and paid in, but not sooner.\u201d\nIt also appeared from an examination of the books of the company, and the correctness of the deduction has not been impugned, that the company assumed to increase the capital, notwithstanding that the original capital had not been paid, and that the shares alleged to be held by the defendant are shares of the increased capital, and not of that originally authorized.\nMr. Justice Cameron concurred, without fully con- sidering whether defendant might not have shown he was a mortgagee not liable to calls.\nThe judgment proceeds solely on the ground that the defendant is not a shareholder.\nThis is arrived at by assuming that it clearly appears that the stock held by defendant consisted wholly of new stock. And assuming that the old stock was not all paid up as plaintiff\u2019 contends, and as the court below, and I think he, has established, the court held that the directors had no power to issue new shares till the old were all paid up; and also because section 18 requires a by-law increasing the capital stock to be sanctioned by a two-third vote of the shareholders and a copy to be filed with the provincial secretary and notice under his signature inserted in the Gazette before such a by-law could have any force or effect\nHad this case rested on the facts as they appeared in the Common Pleas, I should not, as at present advised, be disposed to disturb the judgment of that court. But, I cannot see how the difficulty suggested in the Court of Appeal, on which the judgment of that court is based, can be got over.\nIt seems to be clear, that Mr. Justice Cameron was right in the conclusions he arrived at, that the stock held by Austin was new stock issued under the by-law of 6th February, 1871, on the assumption that the old stock or previous issue had been allotted and paid in; if this was not all so allotted, as plaintiff now contends and claims to have established, the issue of the alleged new stock was clearly invalid and bad, and the defendant was not a shareholder in the company. But independent of this, the issue of the so-called \u201cnew stock\u201d was also invalid and of no effect, by reason of a non-compliance with the provisions of the Act of Incorporation, without which a by-law such as that of the 6th February, 1871, for increasing the capital, could have, by the express terms of the Act, no effect whatever.\nI quite agree with the court below, that when a statutory liability is attempted to be imposed on a party which can only attach to an actual legal shareholder in a company, he is not estopped, by the mere fact of having received transfers or certificates of stock he supposed to be in existence, from questioning the legality of the issue of such stock and from showing that he never was in law a shareholder liable to the debts of the company, because there never was any legal stock by which he could become a legal shareholder, so that he never filled the character to which alone the statutory remedy was given. The issue is clearly raised by defendant\u2019s second plea, in which he alleges \u201cthat there is not still due and unpaid by him on the capital of the said company the sum of $8,880, or thereabouts, or any sum whatever, as alleged,\u201d and which is necessarily so, if he is not a stockholder in the company.\nSTRONG, J.:\u2014\nThis is a proceeding by scire facias by the appellants as judgment creditors of the \u201cOntario Wood Pavement Co., of Toronto,\u201d a joint stock company incorporated under the statute 27 and 28 Vic., ch. 23, to have execution against the respondent as a shareholder whose stock has not been paid up for the amount of their judgment; a writ of fieri facias issued against the company having been returned wholly unsatisfied. The declaration alleges the respondent to be the holder of one hundred and eleven shares of $100 each in the capital stock of the company, upon which there still remains unpaid $8,880 or thereabouts. The respondent pleaded several pleas to the following effect: That he was not a shareholder as alleged. That no sum whatever remained due and unpaid on his stock. That the shares were entered on the books of the company as paid up. That the respondent purchased the shares in good faith, believing the same to be paid up shares, and without notice that they were not so paid up. That the writ of fieri facias against the company had not been returned nulla bona. That the respondent held the shares as a trustee only. That one George Arthurs, being indebted to the respondent in a large sum of money, and being the holder of the shares in question, transferred the same to the respondent by way of collateral security to secure the debt, and the respondent now holds the shares as collateral security, and not otherwise. Upon these pleas issue was taken. At the trial before Galt, J., it was proved that the respondent took a transfer of the shares as collateral security for a debt due to him by George Arthurs and held them as a mortgagee, and not absolutely, and other facts as hereinafter stated were established in evidence. The learned judge before whom the cause was tried without a jury found a verdict for the respondent, reserving leave to the appellants to move to enter a verdict for the amount of their judgment, $1,603, and interest, if the court should be of opinion that, under the evidence given, the respondent was liable. A rule nisi having been obtained to enter a verdict accordingly, it was made absolute by the Court of Common Pleas. From this decision the respondent appealed to the Court of Appeal for Ontario, which court reversed the judgment of the Court of Common Pleas and ordered the rule nisi to be discharged. The present appeal is from the latter judgment.\nThe Court of Common Pleas, whilst holding that the respondent was, in fact, a mere mortgagee of the shares, held he was nevertheless in law liable as an absolute holder of them, inasmuch as it did not appear on the books of the company that they had been transferred to him by way of security, and that he was not entitled to avail himself of the provision contained in the latter part of clause 29 of the general provisions for the regulation of companies, prescribed by section 5 of the Act under which the company was incorporated, by which it was enacted that no person holding shares as collateral security should be personally subject to liability for calls, but that the person pledging such shares should be considered as holding the same, and should be liable as a shareholder accordingly. The Court of Appeal expressed no opinion upon the point which formed the ratio decidendi of the judgment of the Common Pleas, but founded their judgment upon a ground which does not appear to have been taken in the court below, viz. that there could be no liability upon the shares in question, even assuming the respondent to be an absolute holder of them, for the reason that they were void as having been illegally issued, being shares not in the original and legal capital of the company, but in an addition to the original capital which the directors had purported to make, but which increase or addition not having been made in conformity to the provisions of the statute but in direct violation of its terms, was wholly void.\nThe facts relating to the formation of the company, the increase of the capital, and the issue and transfer of the shares in question, as they appeared in evidence at the trial of this action, and upon the trial of the cause of Scales & Irwin[6], a proceeding similar to this, and the evidence in which was, by consent, read at the trial of the present case, may be summarised as follows: The Ontario Wood Pavement Co was incorporated in February, 1871, by letters patent issued under the authority of the statute already referred to[7]. The capital of the company was originally fixed at $130,000. Of this amount $70,000 was subscribed before the issuing of the patent, viz.: $35,000 by William Wallace Perkins and Francis B. Fisher, the owners of the patent for the invention which the company was formed to work, and $35,000, by seven subscribers of $5,000 each. George Allan Arthurs and Humphrey Lloyd Hime, hereafter to be mentioned as the persons from whom the respondent acquired the shares in respect of which he is sued in this action, were original subscribers each for $5,000. Ten per cent. upon the original subscriptions for shares was paid in in cash previously to the issue of the patent. Subsequently to the issuing of the charter of incorporation, and on the 6th of February, 1871, at a meeting of shareholders of the company held at the Rossin House, in Toronto, a resolution was passed which stands recorded in the minute book of the company in the following words:\nOrdered that the offer of Messrs. William W. Perkins and Francis B. Fisher, representing the patentee of the Monitor Wood Pavement, to sell to this company the exclusive right to use and enjoy all the benefit of the said invention in the city of Toronto, for the sum of thirty-one thousand dollars in cash and nine hundred and twenty shares of the paid up capital stock of this company, be accepted, and the secretary-treasurer is hereby authorized to pay over to the said W.W. Perkins and F.B. Fisher, for the said assignment of the said patent, the said sum of thirty-one thousand dollars and nine hundred and twenty shares of paid up stock of the said company (such shares to include the three hundred and fifty shares subscribed by the said W.W. Perkins and F.B. Fisher) are hereby allotted to the said W.W. Perkins and F.B. Fisher, to be issued to them upon the due execution and registration of an assignment to the company of the said patent right for Toronto.\nThe following by-law for the increase of the capital stock of the company was then introduced and adopted:\nNo.13\u2014A By-law to increase the Capital Stock of the Ontario Wood Pavement Company of Toronto.\nWhereas the whole capital stock of the said company, amounting to one hundred and thirty-thousand dollars, has been allotted and paid in; and whereas the said company have determined to increase the capital stock to the amount of two hundred and fifty thousand dollars, in order to the due carrying out of the objects of the company;\nIt is therefore enacted by the said the Ontario Wood Pavement Company of Toronto, that the said capital stock of the said company shall be and is hereby increased from the sum of one hundred and thirty thousand dollars, or thirteen hundred shares of one hundred dollars each, to the sum of two hundred and fifty thousand dollars, or two thousand five hundred shares of one hundred dollars each.\nDated this 6th day of February, A.D., 1871.\nConfirmed. (Signed), JOHN LAMB, Vice President.\nH. LLOYD HIKE, Sec.-Treas.\nAt the same meeting a transaction was agreed to and carried out, which is thus described by Mr. Hime, who acted as the secretary of the company, in his evidence already referred to given in the case of Scales v. Irwin\nThe seven shareholders, that is all the members of the company but the two holders of the wooden pavement patent right, were to pay in an additional ten per cent. upon their stock, which would be equal to $3,500, and in consideration of that being done, the patentees of the right, who it was said had a large cash claim against the company for the price of the right which they had sold to the company, over and above their paid up stock of $35,000, were to pay up the balance of the unpaid stock of the seven shareholders, equal to $28,000, out of this cash claim. In pursuance of that arrangement each of the seven shareholders gave his cheque for the balance of his unpaid stock. The cheques were handed to Mr. Hime, the secretary, at that meeting. The secretary passed in the cheques to the patentees who accepted them and gave receipts to the company, or the shareholders, for the amount of the cheques. The patentees then handed back the cheques to the secretary with the receipts and the secretary delivered back the cheques to the shareholders who gave them.\nThe original subscribers for shares other than Perkins and Fisher, and three other persons, Messrs. McMullin, Attwell and Smith, who would appear to have become subscribers for original shares after the charter was obtained, paid in in cash an additional ten per cent. on the nominal value of their shares, making in all 20 per cent. Each of the original subscribers of 50 shares thus paid in $1,000, but, except in the manner described in the passage from Mr. Hime\u2019s evidence in Scales v. Irwin, above extracted, there never was any payment of the residue of the amounts for which the shares were issued. There is no proof that the patent or patents which Perkins and Fisher were to assign to the company in consideration of their 972 shares, and of the $31,000 in cash, out of which the unpaid balances due upon the shares of the other original subscribers were to be considered as paid, were ever so assigned. The only evidence on this point is an instrument dated the 9th of February, 1871, which has been put in evidence and is printed at p. 25 of the case. It purports to be an agreement between the respondent, James Austin, of the first part, and the seven original shareholders, Perkins and Fisher the patentees, and the three other persons already named, Messrs. McMullin, Smith and Attwell, who, it is to be inferred, became subscribers for shares after the letters patent of incorporation were issued; and after a recital that Edgar McMullin had executed a transfer of even date to the said James Austin of the exclusive right to make use and vend in and for the whole of the Province of Ontario, except the city of Toronto, the new and useful improvement in the article now in use for paving streets, called or known as \u201cThe Monitor Wooden Sectional Pavement,\u201d for which letters patent were granted to the said Edgar McMullin on the 0th December, 1870, and that the said James Austin had agreed to hold the transfer of the letters-patent upon the trusts thereinafter contained, it was witnessed (amongst other things), that the said James Austin did thereby covenant and agree with the parties to the said agreement of the second part, that he, the said James Austin, should and would hold and stand possessed of the transfer and assignment of the said letters patent and all rights thereunder in trust for the sole benefit of the parties of the second part severally and their executors, administrators or assigns, in equal portions or shares. The company was no party to this instrument, and it contained no trust in favor of the company but an absolute and exclusive trust for the several individual shareholders, and the company consequently acquired no interest or benefit under it. This, for all that appears, may not have been the only patent assigned, and there may have been other assignments of the right to use and vend this patent as regards the city of Toronto, but I repeat there is no evidence of any such assignment and nothing to show that the company ever acquired any right to an interest in any patent, or that the agreement to assign the patent to the company referred to in the resolution of the meeting at the Rossin House was in any way carried out. At the time of the passing of the by-law of the 6th February, 1871, the whole of the shares in the original capital stock of $130,000 had been allotted, $35,000 of it having been taken up by the seven original shareholders who subscribed before the issue of the letters patent incorporating the company, $92,000 by the patentees, and the residue of the $3,000 it must be presumed had been allotted to the gentlemen who had become shareholders subsequently to the original subscription. All subsequent issues of shares are, therefore, to be ascribed to the additional capital of $120,000 which this by-law of the 6th February, 1871, assumed to authorize the directors to raise.\nMr. George Allan. Arthurs was one of the original shareholders and, from the evidence, he appears to have acquired subsequently to the organization of the company and the adoption of the by-law relating to the increase of its capital, a large number of other shares in addition to those he originally held. Being indebted to the respondent and being pressed by him for security, Mr. Arthurs, on the 29th September, 1871, executed a transfer to the respondent of 83 shares in this company then standing in his name in the books of the company, and also procured Mr. Atwell to execute a transfer to the respondent of 28 shares. Both these transfers were absolute on their face, but as well the learned judge before whom the action was tried, as the Court of Common Pleas, have, upon satisfactory and conclusive evidence, determined them to have been intended by way of security only. Neither the transfers nor the certificates for the shares which were delivered to the respondent describe the shares as fully paid up, and the only reasons which the respondent gives for the belief which he states he had, that the shares were paid up shares upon which he could incur no liability, are that they were represented by Mr. Arthurs, and also by Perkins, one of the persons interested in the patents, to be so paid up, and further, that he had a conversation about the shares with Mr, Hime, the secretary of the company, or some one in his office, which the respondent, in his evidence, states as follows:\nI think I spoke to Mr. Hime about it, and he told me it was paid up stock; I think it was in his office; I think I asked if it was paid up stock. I do not know whether it was Mr. Hime or the young man in his office that I asked. I never addressed any communication on the subject to the board of directors as a board.\nAll of these one hundred and eleven shares transferred to the respondent are clearly shown, by the exhibits which had been put in evidence at the trial, and which the Court of Appeal called for, to have been shares, not of the original capital, but of the additional capital which was assumed to be authorized by the by-law of the 6th February, 1871. At the time this by\u2011law was passed, the original capital had, as before stated, all been taken up. It therefore follows that all shares originally issued subsequent to that date are prim\u00e2 facie at least, to be presumed to be attributable to the added capital. All the one hundred and eleven shares in respect of which it was sought to make the respondent liable in this action are easily traced to original issues of shares made subsequently to the 6th February, 1871.\nFor the 83 shares directly transferred to the respondent by Arthurs\u2014the latter held and handed over two certificates, Nos. 37 and 38\u2014for 60 shares and 23 shares respectively. The counterfoil of the certificate book shows that these 83 shares were shares which had previously been held under certificate No. 52, which had been cancelled, the following words being printed and written on the counterfoil:\u2014\u201cThis certificate is issued on account of cancelled certificate No. 52.\u201d Then the counterfoil of No. 52 shows that certificate to have been for 550 shares, issued by the company as original shares to H.L. Hime, on the 20th February, 1871, the same day as that on which the transfer to Arthur was made. As regards the other 28 shares, the counterfoils of the same book show that for the shares which were originally issued to Atwell on the 20th February, 1871, three certificates Nos. 47.48 and 49 were given, comprising respectively 9,10 and 9 shares, and that these shares were transferred directly by Atwell to the respondent. Upon presenting the certificates for the 111 shares, of which he had secured a transfer from Arthurs, they were, according to the ordinary course of business, cancelled, and a new certificate was issued to the respondent\u2014the counterfoil of the latter showing, as in former cases, that it was issued on account of the previous certificates Nos. 37, 38, 47, 48 and 49. In this way the shares which the respondent now holds under the transfer from Arthurs and Atwell, are clearly traced and identified as shares which were allotted and issued for the first time subsequent to the passing of the by-law of the 6th February, 1871, and consequently at a date subsequent to that at which the whole of the original capital of $130,000 had been subscribed for and allotted. The conclusion is, therefore, inevitable, that these were shares in the increased amount of capital which the by-law was intended to authorize as an addition to that provided for at the time of the formation of the company.\nThe company, having performed some small contracts in the latter part of 1871, stopped their operations and virtually failed. The appellants are judgment creditors of the company, who, having had an \u201cexecution on their judgment against the company returned nulla bona,\u201d have taken this proceeding by scire facias, under sub-sec. 27, sec. 5, of the Act, to enforce their judgment against the respondent, as a holder of unpaid shares.\nIt was contended at the argument that these shares were, in the hands of the respondent, to be considered as paid up shares, and that the case of McIntyre v. McCracken[8], as decided in this court, was an authority for the respondent in this respect. A consideration, however, of the principle of the decision in that case, will show that it can have no application to the facts before us in the present appeal. McIntyre v. McCracken, following many English authorities, merely decided that the holder of shares which had been originally issued by the company as paid up in full could not be made liable, either to the company or to the creditors of the company, as for a debt due in respect of the shares, regarding them as having been issued as unpaid shares. In such a case, the directors who issue the shares are no doubt guilty of a breach of trust, and the shareholder who takes them is a participator in such breach of trust, and may be made jointly liable with the directors therefor. But the remedy is the usual equitable remedy in such cases, of a decree for the restoration of the property (the shares) illegally alienated, or of their value in the event of their having passed into the hands of a bon\u00e2 fide purchaser without notice[9]. This remedy can be enforced by a suit in the name of the company and, in the case of a winding up under the English Companies Act, by the official liquidator suing in the name of the company. It cannot, however, be made available by a judgment creditor against a holder of shares improperly issued as paid up, by treating such shares as unpaid, and making the holder thereof liable thereon under the 27th clause of the general provisions of sec. 5 of the Act under which this company was incorporated. That clause is as follows:\u2014\nEach shareholder, until the whole amount of his stock has been paid up, shall be individually liable to the creditors of the company to an amount not paid up thereon, but shall not be liable to an action therefor by any creditor before an execution against the company has been, returned unsatisfied in whole or in part, and the amount due on such execution shall be the amount recoverable with costs against such shareholders.\nIt is manifest that this provision cannot entitle a creditor of the company to enforce a payment against a holder of shares issued as paid up, though such issue was a breach of the duty of the directors of the company. There can be no liability to payment unless there is a debt to be paid, and there can be no debt if there is no contract to pay. Then, in the case of an agreement to take unpaid shares, and an issue of the shares upon the terms of such agreement, it cannot be said that there was any contract to pay for the shares so issued. To fix the shareholder with a liability in such a case would be to impose upon him a contract he never entered into. The only contract is to take paid up shares, and, as shown by Mellish, L.J., in Carling\u2019s case, no other contract can be presumed in order to make the shareholder liable. The principle is concisely stated in the following passage extracted from the judgment of Mellish, L.J., in the case just referred to, he says:\u2014\nIf, therefore, the case depends on a contract between them and the company, the contract must either be approbated or reprobated. If the contract was a contract that they would take paid up shares, we cannot convert that into a contract to take unpaid shares.\nThis, also, appears to be one of the rationes decidendi of the case of Waterhouse v. Jamieson[10], although that case may also be supported on another ground hereafter to be considered, for Lord Chelmsford, in his judgment, rests the decision expressly on the ground that no shareholder can be called upon to do more than perform his contract with the company, and \u201cthat you cannot, alter the terms of the agreement under which you seek to fix a person with liability\u201d[11]. This was also the the ground of Lord Justice Turner\u2019s decision in Currie\u2019s case[12].\nThere are, no doubt, American authorities which, at first sight, are contradictory to those just mentioned. But on examination it will be found that, so far from controverting these principles, they proceed upon a doctrine which is not applicable in our law. In a very recent case in the Supreme Court of the United States, Scovill v. Thayer[13], this question was under consideration, and Mr. Justice Woods, in delivering the judgment of the court, says:\u2014\nNo suit could have been maintained by the company to collect the unpaid stock for such a purpose. The shares were issued as full paid on a fair understanding, and that bound the company. In fact, it has been held in recent English cases that not only is the company, but its creditors also, are bound by such a contract.\nAnd he refers to Carling\u2019s case, Currie\u2019s case, and Water house v. Jamieson, already cited and then proceeds:\u2014\nBut the doctrine of this court is, that such a contract, though binding on the company, is a fraud in law on its creditors, which they can set aside; that when their rights interfere and their claims are to be satisfied, the stockholders can be required to pay their stock in full. The reason is that the stock subscribed is considered in equity as a trust fund for the payment of creditors.\nAnd the learned judge then refers to cases in support of this last proposition; and, amongst others, to Wood v. Dummer[14], which is the leading authority. In the ease of Wood v. Dummer, Mr. Justice Story, for the first time, determined that the capital and assets of a corporation were to be considered as a trust fund for the payment of its creditors. It follows, as a necessary consequence of this principle, that any unauthorized application of the capital or assets is a breach of trust as regards the creditors, and is of no avail against them, though authorized by all the shareholders of the corporation, and not merely by the directors or governing body, and that holders of unpaid shares, though issued as paid up, can still be made liable by creditors for the nominal value of the shares. This doctrine has not been adopted by the English courts as part of the general law, and, except in so far as the Companies Acts and the enactments relating to the winding up of insolvent companies have otherwise-provided, the property of a corporation or joint stock company is not regarded as a trust fund for the payment of its general creditors\u2014nor have creditors any other or greater rights in respect of such property than every creditor has against the property of an individual debtor[15]. This being the state of the law, it is out of the question to say that the American rule, sound and wholesome as it undoubtedly is, can be applied here without legislative authority\u2014a legislative provision applying it to all corporations and joint stock companies might perhaps be considered a very beneficial alteration of the law\u2014but without statutory authority it is beyond the power of the courts to adopt and act upon it. To do so would be nothing less than to assume legislative powers. The result is, that whilst in England, when a winding-up order has been made, the official liquidator as representing the company can, by a proceeding in equity, make directors, who have, by gratuitously issuing shares as paid up, been guilty of a breach of trust, liable for the value of the shares, and also make the holders of such shares who have taken them directly from the company, or with notice, liable to the same extent as participators in such breach of trust, and thus recover the value of the shares as part of the assets to be applied for the benefit of creditors, and whilst in the United States the creditors, as cestui que trusts of the assets, have a direct remedy against unpaid shareholders, though they hate contracted to take paid up shares and nothing else, in the present state of our law neither of these remedies is attainable, and creditors have neither a direct remedy to compel holders of paid up shares to make good the breach of trust in which they have concurred, nor can they, for the reason already given, make the shareholders liable as upon a contract to the terms of which they never agreed.\nIf the statute contained anything which would enable the court to say that either expressly or by implication a holder of shares issued as paid up, though in truth unpaid, should be liable, then, undoubtedly, there would be a liability, not founded on contract, but on the statute. The statute does not, however, contain any provision, either expressly or by implication, which can be so construed. The words \u201cnot paid up,\u201d in the 27th sub-sec, must mean and are to be read as implying a debt to the company \u201cnot paid up,\u201d and it is out of the question to say, upon the reasoning already stated, that there can be any debt to the company when the contract has been to take paid up shares and nothing else.\nThere is, however, another ground of defence in the present case, for which Waterhouse v. Jamieson, McCracken v. McIntyre, and other cases, are invoked as authorities. It is said the respondent took the shares in question for valuable consideration, believing them to be paid up, and without notice to the contrary. Prim\u00e2 facie all purchasers and transferees of shares take them cum onere, and are bound by all legal and equitable liabilities attached to them.\nWhen, however, shares improperly issued as paid up have come into the hands of a subsequent transferee as a bon\u00e2 fide purchaser for value, who has taken them upon the representation of the proper officers of the company made to him directly, either in answer to enquiries or otherwise, or upon the faith of a written representation appearing on the certificates, that the shares are paid up, it is well established that no liability, either at law or in equity, attaches to the shares in the hands of such an innocent purchaser. Numerous cases, both in England and the United States, warrant the decision of this court in McCracken v. McIntyre, to the effect just mentioned, and it is manifest that were it not for such a rule the transfer of property in shares would be so affected as greatly to impair its value[16].\nThe right to the benefit of this protection thus afforded to bon\u00e2 fide purchasers is, however, liable, as in all other similar cases, to be defeated by notice, pro- vided such notice emanates from a person qualified to give it, and is sufficient to convey to the purchaser before he pays his money a knowledge of facts which constitute a prim\u00e2 facie case of liability. There is, however, no necessity for notice, unless the transferee can show that he took the shares as paid up shares upon the faith of representations to that effect, not representations by his vendor or immediate transferor, but upon representations by the company, made through its properly authorized officers, either in writing on the certificates or otherwise, or verbally in response to enquiries. If the shares are purchased as paid up, in reliance merely upon the assurance of the transferor or of some third person, that they are paid, it is manifestly impossible that such representations can have any effect on the liability of the purchaser to the company or its creditors. In such case, as prim\u00e2 facie in all cases, he takes the transfer subject to all liability which attached to the shares in the hands of the transferor. In order to require notice there must be an equity in favor of the purchaser which notice is required to countervail, and that can only arise from some representations made by the company in the way already indicated.\nThen, coming to the application of these principles of law to the facts of the present case, it is at once apparent that they afford no defence to the respondent. Assuming that the shares in question were part of the original capital of $180,000, it cannot be disputed as a fact that these shares were not originally issued as unpaid; that, on the contrary, they were shares, as were all the shares of the original capital, allotted on the understanding, agreement and contract that they were to be paid for in full, and the only pretence for saying that they were subsequently paid up, is the fraudulent and illegal contrivance of a colorable payment which was resorted to at the meeting at the Rossin House; which, upon its face was, as all the courts below have held, no payment at all, and of which, as I shall have to consider it a little more fully hereafter in connection with another part of the case, I need say no more about at present. This is sufficient to show that the first point adverted to before, as established by Carling\u2019s case, McCracken v. McIntyre, and other cases, that the shares having been originally issued as paid up shares there never was any contract, express or implied, to pay for them, is entirely inapplicable here. Equally clear is it that the defence of purchase for valuable consideration without notice, pleaded by the third plea on the record, is not established. That plea, may possibly not be good on general demurrer, and it may be said, as issue has been taken on it, and as this is an appeal from a decision on a motion for a new trial, or to enter a verdict, and as there has been no motion for judgment non obstante, it is only open to us to enquire if there was, in fact, notice to the respondent, and that it is not open to this court to determine that the facts proved do not show a case entitling the respondent to notice as a condition of his liability. The answer to this, however, appears to be, first, that we must so construe the plea as to read it as setting up a good legal defence, which would require us to add to the allegation that the respondent purchased believing the shares to be paid up shares the implied allegation, \u201cand having good reason for so believing,\u201d or some equivalent statement But it would seem that we are relieved from all difficulty on this head by the 1st section of the statute of 1880, which would authorize us now, if the decision of the appeal depended on it, to make all such amendments of the record as might be necessary to raise the substantial questions of law as well as of fact which are essential to the determination of the real questions in dispute between the parties. Then, if the propositions of law which have been before stated are correct, it was incumbent on the respondent, before he was in a position to say that he purchased the shares under such condition as entitled him to hold them free from all liability which had attached to them in the hands of the persons from whom he acquired them unless notice could be proved by the appellants, to show that he purchased on the faith of a representation made by the company or its officers that the shares had been paid up. There is, however, no proof that any such representation was ever made. The respondent clearly was not justified in relying on the statement of Mr. Arthurs to that effect, nor was Perkins, if he ever in fact told the respondent that the shares were paid up, in a position to make such a representation. He was merely one of the directors, not a managing officer entitled to speak for the company on such a matter, and a statement made by him did not warrant the respondent in neglecting the obvious means of ascertaining the fact by an enquiry of the secretary or other proper officer of the company.\nThere is nothing to be found in the evidence shewing that any such enquiry was made, except the following passage in the respondent\u2019s own evidence. He says:\nI think I spoke to Mr. Hime about it and he told me it was paid up stock. I think it was in his office I think I asked if it was paid up stock. I do not know whether it was Mr. Hime or the young man in his office that I asked. I never addressed any communication on the subject to the board of directors as a board.\nThis is entirely insufficient to show that any representation was, in fact, made by Mr. Hime or by any official of the company. Mr. Hime was examined as a witness, but says nothing about any inquiry of this kind by Mr. Austin. There is, therefore, an entire absence of evidence to show that Mr. Austin, the respondent, when he took the transfer, had any just grounds for believing the stock to have been paid up. He must, therefore, be considered, so far as he is to be treated as an absolute transferee of valid shares, as having taken the transfer subject to the same liabilities the shares were subject to in the hands of Arthurs, and it was not requisite to prove notice to him in order to fix him with liability.\nIn the case of Waterhouse v. Jamieson, it will be found that the certificates for the shares transferred expressly stated that they were paid up, and\u2019 in every case, when notice to the transferee has been considered requisite, there was either this fact, or a representation to the same effect, shown to have been made by some authorized officer of the company.\nIf the shares transferred to Mr. Austin have been successfully identified as shares not of the original capital of $130,000, but of the additional $120,000, by which the stock was pretended to be increased by the by-law of the 6th February, 1871, passed at the Rossin House meeting, there is really no shadow of a pretence for saying that they were paid up. As regards the shares in the original $130,000 stock, it is true that there was a simulation of payment by the transaction relating to the transfer of the patents, and the alleged assumption of the liability for the debts of the original subscribers by the patentees over and above the 20 per cent. actually paid in cash. But as regards the added amount of $120,000 it is not shown that there was even a resolution of the shareholders, or even of the directors\u2014ineffectual though they would both have been\u2014that the shares were to be considered as paid up. Nothing is said as to it except the statement of Mr. Hime that all the shares were entered as paid up in the books of the company, which have so mysteriously disappeared. The evidence of Perkins as well as that of Mr. Hime himself, shows that these shares were not paid up in cash. There is nothing to show that the shareholders, as a body, or the directors, ever authorized such an entry, and we must, in the absence of the books, regard it as extremely improbable that any such entry was ever made, or come to the conclusion that if it was made it was false and fraudulent. These considerations, coupled with the fact that the shares are most satisfactorily traced back and ascertained to form part of the pretended additional stock under the authority of the by-law, make the presumption inevitable that no representation was ever made, to Mr. Austin, by any one having authority from the company to make it, that the shares he was about taking a transfer of were actually paid up.\nThis disposes conclusively of the points which were made at the argument, based on the authority of Carling\u2019s case and McCracken v. McIntyre, and of the propositions that the shares were either issued as paid up, or were, in fact, paid up subsequently to their issue, as well as of the argument founded on the insufficient proof of notice.\nThere remains to be considered the_ two questions which were discussed in the courts below; the legal consequences of the transfer having been by way of mortgage or security merely\u2014which was alone argued and adjudicated upon in the Court of Common Pleas\u2014and the question of the respondent\u2019s liability in case it appears as a fact that the shares were part of the added capital provided for by the by-laws, this latter being the only point decided by the Court of Appeal.\nThe learned judge before whom the cause was tried found that the \u201ctransfer was made to Mr. Austin as security for Mr. Arthurs\u2019 debt to him,\u201d and this finding was confirmed by the Court of Common Pleas. The evidence, that of the respondent himself and of Mr. Leys, who acted as the solictor of Mr. Arthurs, was amply sufficient to warrant these findings.\nThe fact being then established that the respondent was a mere mortgagee of the shares and not an absolute holder, and the statute (sub\u2011sec. 29, sec. 5), containing the express enactment\u2014\nThat no person holding such stock as collateral security shall be personally subject to such liability, but the person holding such stock shall be considered as holding the same and shall be subject to liability accordingly\u2014\nthe question arises whether the respondent has, by taking a transfer absolute in form, though intended to operate as a security merely, and by causing it to be entered in the books of the company as an absolute transfer, incurred liabilities to the company and its creditors which the statute in the provision just cited expressly declares he shall not be subject to as a mortgagee merely. The Court of Common Pleas determined this point against the respondent, and held that, as he had caused this transfer to be entered on the books as an absolute transfer, he must be held to be an absolute holder of the shares, and that it was not open to him to show, in answer to the action of the appellants, that he was but a holder of it for the purposes of collateral security. A careful consideration of the statute has led me to form a contrary opinion, for the following reasons. The statute contains nothing expressly requiring that the entry or registry in the books of the company should show the nature of the transaction to be a mortgage or pledge in order that the mortgagee or pledgee should be able to entitle himself to the protection accorded by the 29th clause of sub-sec. 19 of sec. 5. If, therefore, we are to hold, as the Court of Common Pleas has done, that the respondent was bound to see that his transfer was registered as a mortgage, and that by not having done so he has lost the right to avail himself of the exemption from liability conferred on mortgagees by the 29th clause, it can only be on the principle that such registration is required by implication, or because the respondent is estopped from showing the facts as they really were. To warrant us in adding a clause to the statute by implication, something more than mere inconvenience must be shown. It must appear that such proposed addition is a necessary incident or a logical consequence of the express enactments of the statute, but nothing of the kind is established here. It is said that the transfer must be taken to be an absolute transfer unless it is registered in the books of the company as a mortgage only, for the reason that the right to vote would appear by the books to be in the transferee, and not, as the statute says it shall be, in the mortgagor. This, however, is merely to suggest an inconvenience. The statute does not say that the entries of transfers on the books of the company shall be conclusive as to the ownership of shares, for the purpose of determining the right to vote. Therefore, to say that a mortgagor or pledgor is to be excluded from voting because the transfer to the mortgagee or pledgee is registered as an absolute title, is to assume the very question now in dispute, which is, whether the mortgage character of the transfer may be shown by parol evidence, although it is absolute in form, and has been registered as such. In the case of the right of a registered holder of shares to vote being challenged on the ground that he is a mere mortgagee, the right, as in many other cases to be easily supposed, must, for the reasons to be presently given, depend upon actual facts aliunde the entry in the company\u2019s books.\nThe 23rd clause of sub-section 19, however, seems to be decisive in favor of the respondent. It enacts that:\nSuch books shall be prim\u00e2 facie evidence of all facts properly purported to be thereby stated in any suit or proceeding against the company or against any shareholder.\nThe statute itself, therefore, contains an enactment which destroys the argument that the entry or registry as an absolute transfer is to be conclusive and binding on the transferee; for in saying that the books are to be prim\u00e2 facie evidence only, it necessarily implies that they may be controverted or explained by other proof. It is therefore impossible, in the face of this express declaration that the books are to be prim\u00e2 facie evidence, to say that they are to be conclusive evidence.\nThe whole argument, which appears to me to be fatal to the appellants\u2019 contention, may be resumed thus: The respondent\u2019s liability depends upon whether he was an absolute holder of the shares, or a mortgagee merely. If there was nothing in the statute as to the effect of the books as evidence, and apart from the question of estoppel, to be considered hereafter, that question would have to be determined like every other question of mortgage or no mortgage, by the proof of facts according to the general rules of evidence, and in the circumstances of the present case, by the parol testimony of witnesses. The statute, however, does make an exception to the general rules of evidence, by declaring that the books shall be evidence of all facts purporting to be thereby stated in any suit or proceeding against any shareholder, but only to a limited extent; that is to say, they shall be prim\u00e2 facie evidence, which expression ex vi termini necessarily implies that a fact established by them may be rebutted. Let us suppose that the converse case had arisen and that instead of being, as it is in the present case, the mortgagee whom the creditor seeks to make liable, it was Arthurs, the mortgagor, could it for be a moment pretended that he was not liable, under the express provision of the statute that the holder of shares who transfers them by way of pledge or mortgage only shall be considered as being still the holder, and shall continue liable in respect of them accordingly, merely by reason of the transfer being absolute in form, and the entry or registry being limited to the particulars of the transfer? Surely not. Then; if parol evidence would be admissible to show that Arthurs was liable as mortgagor, it is clear that the same kind of evidence must be admissible to prove that the respondent is not liable as mortgagee, the only alternative being one that the statute does not contemplate, save in the single case provided for by clause 21, of a transfer executed but not registered\u2014a double liability to creditors on the part of both mortgagor and mortgagee. It appears to me, therefore, not only that the proper construction of the statute is that which the learned counsel for the respondent have contended for, but that, having regard to the exigencies of business, which frequently make it necessary, in the course of transactions entered into upon sudden emergencies and requiring immediate despatch, that shares shall be transferred by way of security by informal instruments, prepared without professional assistance, it is a more convenient construction than that which would make the intervention of a legal agent indispensable in every case for the due protection of the mortgagee. In the late case of Burgess v. Seligman[17] the Supreme Court of the United States held that parol evidence was admissible to show a transfer of shares, absolute in form to have been intended by way of security merely.\nAnother and distinct ground for the same conclusion is that, whilst the statute by sec. 5 sub\u2011sec. 29 provides in the terms already mentioned that the mortgagee shall not be liable, it also provides by sec. 5, sub-sec. 25, that the company shall not be bound to see to the execution of any trust, whether express, implied, or constructive in respect of any shares. The just inference from this is that the company are entitled to refuse to register a transfer of shares as a mortgage, as they certainly are entitled to refuse to register a transfer as being made in trust\u2014for I am of opinion that the word \u201ctrust\u201d in this 25th sec is not used in any technical or narrow sense, but generally as embracing all transfers other than those for the behoof of the transferee absolutely. The transfer in the present case was therefore registered in the only form in which the company could have been legally compelled to register it.\nThe objection that the respondent is estopped by the registry of the transfer as an absolute assignment, seems as little founded as the one already discussed and disposed of. Indeed, the answer already given to the contention based upon the statute, involves a refutation of this one also. The indispensable elements of an estoppel in pais are well established to be that there must be a positive representation made by the party whom it is sought to bind, with the intention that it shall be acted on by the party with whom he is dealing, and the additional fact that the latter shall have so acted upon it as to make it inequitable that the party making the representation should be permitted to dispute its truth, or do anything inconsistent with it. It may be conceded that if it had been shown that the respondent had actually represented himself to be an absolute holder of the shares in question, and the appellants, creditors of the company, had brought their action relying on the truth of that assertion, the respondent would have been concluded from contradicting his representation and from showing the facts as they really were, upon the ground that the bringing the action was such an acting on the representation induced by the conduct of the respondent in making it as to constitute an estoppel[18]. But granting that the second ingredient of an estoppel in pais, that just adverted to, is sufficiently established, the very foundation upon which such a mode of concluding the rights of parties rests is wanting, for where is to be found the representation or statement of the respondent which must be the basis of the estoppel? The only pretence of which the facts admit for saying that the respondent ever represented himself to be an absolute holder of the shares in question is, that he in effect did so by causing himself to be entered on the books of the company as a transferee of them, without showing by the same entry that the transfer was by way of mortgage merely. But the effect to be given to such an entry or registry is, as already pointed out, expressly declared by the 23rd clause of sub-sec. 19 to be, that it shall be prim\u00e2 facie evidence only against the shareholder, the words prim\u00e2 facie indicating, as already shown, that it is not to be conclusive or binding, but may be contradicted, qualified, or explained by evidence on the part of the shareholder. Consequently, such an entry can have no greater effect than a written representation directly made by the shareholder to the creditor, that he was a transferee of the shares, but reserving to himself the right of showing in what character he held them, and of thus qualifying or explaining the instrument of transfer, could have had, and in the case supposed there could, of course, be no ground for saying that any binding representation had been made. In short, the argument by which it is sought to show that the respondent is concluded by an estoppel is directly met by the clause of the statute already referred to, which expressly warns the creditor not to rely on the entry in the books as a statement intended to be conclusive.\nTo establish an estoppel, it is indispensable that the appellants should show that a binding representation of the character in which the respondent held the shares should be made. The only evidence of such a representation is the entry in the books, and the statute expressly says that such an entry shall be only prim\u00e2 facie evidence, which is equivalent to saying that it shall not have a conclusive or binding effect. Therefore to give it such a conclusive operation would be directly to contravene the statute.\nIt is not pretended that the plaintiffs became creditors upon the faith of the appellant\u2019s name appearing in the shares\u2019 account contained on the books, or that they ever inspected the books before permitting the company to incur liabilities to them. Indeed, they had no right to inspect the books until after they became creditors. There is a marked difference in this respect between the provisions of the English Companies Act and the statute, which applies in this case, for by the English Act the shares registers are made public records and are open to public inspection on the payment of a very small fee; but by this statute of 27 and 28 Vic., ch. 23, as already noticed, a public inspection is not authorized, and a party must be a creditor before he has a right to examine the share book.\nThe reasons given in the American cases for holding that the mortgagee\u2014transferee of shares who registers absolutely is liable upon the principle of estoppel as holding himself out as an absolute owner of the shares cannot apply in the present case. This doctrine is apparently derived from the law of partnership, which, although affording an analogy in the case of a joint stock company which is said to be a compound of a partnership and a corporation, can have no application to the case of a corporation whose creditors in certain events are entitled to a statutory subrogation to the rights of the corporation against the shareholders, since the liability of the shareholders de- pends upon the letter of the statute. But if such a principle was generally applicable to a corporation it could not apply to a company incorporated under this statute in the face of the warning contained in the provision that the books were to be prim\u00e2 facie evidence only; that they were not to be conclusively relied on; and in the present case at all events it could not be said that there was any holding out a representation sufficient to found an estoppel, since the transfer was registered in the only form in which the company was bound to register, and, as it must be assumed, would have consented to register a transfer by way of security.\nThe consequence is, that neither by the statute nor by the application of the doctrine of estoppel is the respondent precluded from showing, by parol evidence, the fact that he was a mere mortgagee of the shares and as such not liable for further payments, and that fact he has, to the satisfaction of all the courts before which this cause has come, sufficiently established by evidence which could leave no doubt in any judicial mind.\nFor these reasons I come to the conclusion that if the decision of this appeal depended upon the single question which the Court of Common Pleas considered, 1 should be compelled, with great respect, to differ from the opinions of the learned judges of that court.\nThe Court of Appeals, however, decided in the respondent\u2019s favor, upon another ground already stated, and I concur with that court, for the reasons which they gave, in holding that the appellants were not entitled to recover. It requires very little in the way of argument to show that the pretended increase of the capital stock of the company from $180,000, the amount at which it was originally fixed by the charter, to $250,000, under the by law of the 6th February, 1871, was wholly illegal and void. The 16th clause of the general provisions which the statute enacts this com- pany shall be subject to, and which it requires to be set forth and embodied in the letters patent, is as follows:\nThe directors of the company, if they see fit at any time after the whole capital stock of the company shall have been allotted and paid in, but not sooner, may make a by-law for increasing the capital stock of the company to any amount which they may consider requisite, in order to the due carrying out of the objects of the company, but no such by law shall have any force or effect whatever, until after it shall have been sanctioned by a vote of not less than two-thirds in amount of all the shareholders, at a general meeting of the company duly called for the purpose of considering such by-law, nor until a copy duly authenticated shall have been filed, as Hereinbefore mentioned, with the Provincial Secretary or such other officer as the Governor in Council may direct.\nThese requirements were beyond all question not complied with. First, it does not appear that the meet-of shareholders at which the by-law was adopted or confirmed, was called for the purpose of considering the by-law. Then it is not shown that a copy was filed with the provincial secretary. But even if these objections could have been surmounted by supplying the defects in the evidence, there would remain the fatal and insurmountable objection that an indispensable condition precedent to the right of the company to increase its capital had not been complied with. The whole of the original capital had not been paid in.\nFrom the statement of the evidence already given, it is apparent that there is no pretence for disputing this fact. The pretended payment of the amounts of the shares which had been allotted at the date of the Rossin House meeting, the 6th February, including the 920 shares subscribed for by the patentees, was, as it was found by the learned judge before whom the action was tried, wholly illusory. Had it been found that the patentees actually assigned to the company valuable patents for the price agreed on, and that they had then agreed that their account should be debited with the amounts due in respect of the shares held by the other subscribers as well as themselves, there might have been some ground for considering whether there had been a bon\u00e2 fide payment in full or not. But there is not a scintilla of evidence to show that the patents were ever transferred to the company. From the only assignment given in evidence, it appears that the contrary was the fact, for instead of being an assignment to the trustees in trust for the company in its corporate capacity, it was an assignment to the trustees in trust for certain named shareholders of the company. It does not, therefore, appear that any property in the patents ever passed to the company. This being so, it is manifest that the handing of the cheques to the patentees (as they have been called) and by them back to the company, as described in Mr. Hime\u2019s evidence, was a mere manipulation of pieces of paper in the form of cheques and which were never intended to be used as cheques, and could have had no legal effect whatever. It therefore follows that the entries made in the books showing that the shares were paid up were fraudulent, and if so the officers making the same incurred the penalties enacted by the 24th clause of the 19th general provisions of the charter for making false entries in the books of the company. The by-law purporting to provide for the increase of the capital stock was, therefore, wholly ultra vires and void, and there never was any increased capital, and the pretended shares which the company afterwards assumed to allot, and which are referable to the increased capital, never had any real existence.\nThen the Court of Appeal have found that the respondent\u2019s shares are attributable to this illegal capital, and a careful examination of the evidence will demonstrate that this conclusion is entirely correct.\nIt appears very clearly from the exhibits called for by the Court of Appeal, and particularly from the counterfoil of the certificate book, that all the 111 shares held by the respondent, and which were transferred to him by Arthurs, either directly or procured by him from Attwell, were shares which had been originally allotted and issued by the company on the 20th February, 1871. Then it is also shown by the books of the company, which, as already repeatedly shown in discussing another branch of the case, are by force of the statute prim\u00e2 facie evidence in any suit or proceeding against the company or any of its shareholders, that the whole of the original shares amounting to $130,000 had been subscribed and allotted at the time the by-law of the 6th of February was passed, for this fact is recited in the by-law, and the by-law is duly recorded in the minute books of the company. Moreover, Mr. Hime in his evidence states the same thing. There being no evidence to controvert this the conclusion is inevitable that all of the certificates delivered to the respondent were for shares in the void and illegal capital.\nIt only remains therefore to enquire what must be the legal effect of this state of facts. Upon this point also I entirely concur in the conclusion of the learned judge of the Court of Appeal, for nothing can be clearer that no legal liability can be attached to the mere holding of certificates for void shares\u2014which are nothing more than certificates for shares which do not exist and which never existed.\nThis is a proposition of law so self-evident that it seems superfluous to cite authority in support of it. I may, however, refer to Lord Justice Lindley\u2019s work on Partnership[19], where it is laid down that:\nThe holders of shares which the company have no power to issue in truth hold nothing at all and are not contributories. The only possible ground for holding them to be contributories would be by applying to them the doctrines by which a person who holds himself out as a partner incurs liabilities as if he were a partner. These doctrines would probably suffice to render an apparent member of an unincorporated insolvent company liable as a contributory in it; but they have little if any bearing on the statutory liability of persons to be made contributories in incorporated companies, in respect of shares which do not exist in point of law.\nAnd that the doctrine of estoppel has no application in such circumstances is apparent from the case of the Bank of Hindustan v. Alison[20], a case which, it is true, was subsequently found to have been decided on in an erroneous statement of facts, but which has not, so far as I have been able to ascertain, ever been questioned as an authority for the doctrine in support of which it is now referred to. In Scovil v. Thayer[21], the Supreme Court of the United States decided this point in the same way.\nFor the foregoing reasons I am of opinion that the judgment of the court below must be affirmed and this appeal dismissed with costs.\nFOURNIER, J.:\u2014\nIl est clair que remission des actions dont il est question en cette cause a \u00e9t\u00e9 ill\u00e9galement faite. Le pouvoir donn\u00e9 aux directeurs, en vertu de l\u2019acte 27 et 28 Vict., c. 23, d\u2019augmenter le stock d\u2019une compagnie ne peut \u00eatre exerc\u00e9, en vertu des sub-sections 16, 17 et 18 de la section 5, qu\u2019apr\u00e8s que le capital originaire a \u00e9t\u00e9 enti\u00e8reinent r\u00e9parti (allotted) et pay\u00e9. Il est bien \u00e9tabli que tel n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 le cas pour le montant du capital originaire de $130,000. Les actions de Austin sont d\u00e9montr\u00e9es faire partie de la nouvelle \u00e9mission du stock, en vertu du by-law du 6 F\u00e9v. 1871, et sont en cons\u00e9quence nulles, parce que le by-law lui-m\u00eame est nul comme fait en contravention au statut. Austin n\u2019a jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 de fait l\u00e9galement actionnaire dans la compagnie. Pour cette raison, je suis d\u2019avis que l\u2019appel doit \u00eatre renvoy\u00e9, HENRY, J.:\u2014\nThere are two issues joined on the pleadings in this case to which I turn my attention. In the first place, to ascertain whether under these two issues the plaintiffs in this action have established a right to call upon the defendant to pay the judgment debt set out in their declaration. Having satisfied my mind as to those two issues, I concluded that it was unnecessary to go into any of the subsiduary ones, I therefore did not perhaps sufficiently consider the question of estoppel, but still at the same time I formed the opinion that the doctrine of estoppel was not applicable to the position of the respondent here. He had received shares as paid up shares, and there was no action taken by him which the plaintiffs in this action could say affected their conduct, and therefore one of the principles on which the doctrine of estoppel was set up was wanting; the evidence on one point was altogether absent.\nThere are two points, however, of importance to be considered, and I so thought on the argument\u2014that was in the first place whether this respondent was the holder in his own right of shares of the company. My learned brethren who have preceded me have decided that he was not, and in that conclusion I entirely concur. The whole of the stock he held was stock issued which subsequently was shown, on the evidence that was given in another case, referred to, and part of the evidence in this case, to have been issued irregularly and illegally, and it is clear that the party holding stock can in such case say to the company: \u201cYou had no right to issue that stock, I am not a stock holder,\u201d and if he can say that to the company, he can say it to the creditors of the company, and it is a good answer to an action brought by the creditors, for it is only the owner of stock\u2014that is stock legally issued\u2014that can be made answerable. Now in the case of the Bank of Hindustan v. The Imperial Sank of China[22], the court allowed interest on money had that been paid by the party who purchased stock from one of the companies, that stock having been illegally issued. The decision of the court was, that he was entitled, not only to get back the money that he had paid for it, but also interest upon that money. I consider, then, that the party here was not answerable to the parties in this action for the stock, but, after the exhaustive judgments that have been read, I will not go into the matters referred to in the judgments which have preceded mine.\nAs to the second point I may say generally I consider that under the law, the mortgagee of stock is not answerable to the creditors, he is the mere holder of stock under a lien, and is not the owner, and that the owner is not discharged from his liability to pay up the balance of the stock to the company or for the debts due by the company. I think, therefore, that Arthurs is the owner of the stock here, with a legal lien upon it by the transfer. The question is, was the evidence here sufficient to establish legally that proposition? I consider that it was. I do not consider that it was necessary that it should have been so entered in the books of the company. As my learned brother Strong said, there is prim\u00e2 facie evidence of what they contend, but the mere fact of its being made prim\u00e2 facie evidence shows that it is capable of being rebutted. Here the party has rebutted it by oral testimony. Now, it is well known that a deed absolute on its face may be shown by parol evidence to have been as between the parties only, a mortgage. I consider here, then, that as between Arthurs and the respondent, notwithstanding what was entered in the book, and notwithstanding that he became by the issue of a certificate to him subsequently nominally the owner of the stock, it was competent for Arthurs at any time to have said to the respondent, \u201cReturn me this stock. Here is the money you advanced me on account of it, and here is the amount for which I gave it to you as security.\u201d It was therefore to all intents in law a mortgage. I do not think the intention of the statute was to hold persons in that situation answerable for the debts of the company. That principle is well seen in the legislation in regard to mortgages on ships. There it is declared specially that mortgagees shall not be considered owners for the purpose of debts, or for any other purposes than as the mere holders of security. The same principle that we find in the legislation on this point, I think, is perfectly applicable in cases of joint stock companies. So, to say that if it should become necessary to alter the dealings between Arthurs and the respondent, that that should be shown in the books, I do not think is a proposition that is well grounded. It can be shown independent of the books altogether, and no matter what the entries in the books are, the true position between Arthurs and the respondent, I consider, can be and has been established by oral evidence. Therefore, I think, in the first place, this party was not the owner of the stock, because it was not good stock. It was stock that was issued illegally for several reasons that have already been pointed out in the judgments in the court below, and in the judgments that have been delivered here to-day, and that I consider would be sufficient to answer the plaintiffs claim, but as mortgagee again I consider he was not answerable. Under all the circumstances, the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nTASCHEREAU, J.\u2014I am of opinion to dismiss this appeal with costs.\nGWYNNE, J.:\u2014\nI have been unable to bring my mind to the same conclusion as that arrived at by my learned brothers in this case.\nThe action is in the nature of Scire facias quare executionem non, brought by the plaintiffs as judgment creditors of the Ontario Wood Pavement Co. against the defendant as a shareholder in the company, and claiming satisfaction of their judgment out of the monies remaining unpaid upon the shares held by the defendant in the capital stock of the company under the provisions of the Statutes of Canada, 27th and 28th Vic., ch. 23, the 27th section of which enacts that:\nEach shareholder, until the whole amount of his stock has been paid up, shall be individually liable to the creditors of the company to an amount equal to that not paid up thereon; but shall not be liable to an action therefor by any creditor before an execution against the company has been, returned unsatisfied in whole or in part; and the amount due on such execution shall be the amount recoverable with costs against such shareholder.\nTo an action alleging the defendant to be a holder of shares in the company upon which a sum still remained unpaid more than sufficient to satisfy a judgment recovered by the plaintiffs, which remained unsatisfied, and that a fieri facias, issued to obtain satisfaction of the judgment out of goods and chattels of the company, had been returned nulla bona, the defendant pleaded as follows:\n1. That he was not a stockholder in the said company as alleged.\n2. That there is not still due and unpaid by him on the capital stock in the said company any sum whatever.\n3. That one George Arthurs was the holder of 111 shares of the capital stock of the said company amounting to the sum of $11,100, and was entered on the books of the said company as the holder thereof, and on the said books the said shares were entered as shares fully paid up, and that the defendant purchased the said shares from the said George Arthurs in good faith and for valuable consideration, believing the same to be fully paid up shares, and without any notice or knowledge that the same were not so fully paid up.\n4. That the said writ of fieri facias in the declaration mentioned, has not been returned nulla bona as alleged.\n5. That the stock held by him and referred to in the declaration was and is held by him as trustee merely and not otherwise, and other than such stock so held by him as trustee, the defendant never had and has not any shares or stock in the said company.\n6. That one George Arthurs being indebted to the defendant in a large sum of money, and being the holder of the shares in the declaration mentioned, transferred the same to the defendant as collateral security merely for such indebtedness and not otherwise, and the defendant accepted the said shares and has always held and now holds the same as such collateral security merely and not otherwise, and other than the said shares the defendant never held and has not now any shares or stock in the said company.\nIssue having been joined upon these pleas, the case came down for trial before Mr. Justice Galt, without a jury, under the provisions of the consolidated statutes of Ontario[23]. At the trial a Mr. Hime, who had been one of the directors, and also secretary of the company, was called as a witness, and the transfer of shares book kept by him as secretary of the company having been produced, it appeared that the shares held by the defendant were shares assigned to him by prior holders. The transfers assigning the shares to the defendant were as follows:\nTRANSFER No. 27.\nFor value received, I, George A. Arthurs, of Toronto, do hereby assign and transfer to James Austin, of Toronto, eighty-three shares of capital stock of the Ontario Wood Pavement Co., of Toronto, standing in my name in the books of the company.\nIn testimony whereof I have signed these presents at Toronto this twenty-ninth day of September, A.D. 1871.\nWitness\u2014H. Lloyd Hime. Geo. A. Arthurs.\nTRANSFER No. 28.\nFor value received, I, William J. Attwell, of Montreal, do hereby assign and transfer to James Austin, of Toronto, twenty-eight shares in capital stock of the Ontario Wood Pavement Co., of Toronto, standing in my name in the books of the company.\nIn testimony whereof I have signed these presents at Toronto this twenty-ninth day of September, A.D. 1871.\nWitness\u2014H. Lloyd Hime. W. J. Attwell,\nper his Attorney.\nGeo. A. Arthurs.\nThe evidence given by this witness in another case of Scales v. Irwin[24], was read as if taken in this suit. From that evidence and the evidence given by him in the present suit it is sufficient to say that in substance it was to the effect that Mr. Arthurs was an original shareholder in the company. In fact he was one of the original subscribers named in the agreement upon which the letters patent issued. That agreement was signed by him as a subscriber for fifty shares of $100 each in a capital stock of $130,000, and, at the time of the transfer of the 111 shares to the defendant, Arthurs appeared in the books of this company to be holder of 1G3 shares. That, in fact, although the capital stock of $ 130,000 as originally contemplated had not been paid up in full, nor had more than 10 per cent. thereof been paid, an arrangement was come to by and between the original subscribers, of whom Arthurs was one, whereby the original capital stock should appear to be paid in full, although, in fact, no more than 10 per cent. had been paid upon it, in order that the company should pass a by-law, which accordingly they did pass, increasing the capital stock to $250,000. This arrangement, it may be added, was decided in Scales v. Irwin to have been in substance a fraudulent device to defeat the claims of creditors of the company, like the plaintiffs in this suit, obtaining payment of their just demands against the company. The defendant having been called upon to produce, did produce the certificate issued to him by the company upon the assignment to him by Arthurs of the 111 shares, which certificate is as follows:\nThis is to certify that James Austin, Esquire, of Toronto, is owner of one hundred and eleven shares in the capital stock of the Ontario Wood Pavement Co, of Toronto, transferable only on the books of the company in person or by attorney in the presence of the president or secretary on the surrender of this certificate.\nIn testimony whereof the said company have hereunto caused their corporate seal to be affixed, and these presents to be signed by the president and secretary.\nToronto, Ont., September 29th,.1871.\nH. Lloyd Hime, John Lamb,\nSecretary. Vice-President.\nA Mr. Perkins was examined as a witness to show Arthurs\u2019 connection with the company, and the manner in which, and the extent to which, he became interested therein, and also to show the defendant\u2019s knowledge of the condition in which the stock held by Arthurs stood when the defendant took an assignment of the one hundred and eleven shares. The witness was himself one of the original promoters of the company, and a subscriber to the agreement upon the strength of which the letters patent issued incorporating the company, to the amount of $18,000 dollars, or 180 shares. He says that Arthurs was one of the original promoters of the enterprise of the company, and was a shareholder at the outset. He received about ten or eleven thousand dollars of the stock par value, he subscribed for it, over one hundred shares, the fact is his actual subscription did not exceed ten thousand dollars of the stock par value, but he had more stock than he subscribed for, and he paid on that subscription not to exceed 10 per cent. in cash, that was all he ever paid in any shape. Again he says:\nMr. James Austin was solicited by Mr. George A. Arthurs and myself to become one of the parties to the organization of the company, to become one of its directors and stockholders. Mr. Arthurs and myself told Mr. James Austin repeatedly how the company was to be organized, and how it was organised. I was in the habit of visiting Mr. Austin\u2019s and Mr. Arthurs\u2019 houses in Toronto, during the winter of 1870 and 1871 and nearly always meeting Mr. Austin at Mr. Arthurs\u2019 house when I was there. Mr. Arthurs was Mr. Austin\u2019s son-in-law.\nAgain he says:\nOn several different occasions in the presence of Mr. Arthurs I requested Mr. Austin to become one of the directors of the company and to invest money in the enterprise. I stated to him that only 10 per cent. of the amount of the subscription would be called for in cash, as that was all any of the subscribers were to pay; that the balance of the subscriptions to stock would be considered paid by the conveyance of the patents to the company. Mr. Austin always declined to become one of the shareholders, stating that he had no time to give to it, and that he was engaged in the organization of a banking company at the same time. He asked during these conversations how this stock was to be paid and made all enquiries as to its conditions, and I told him, and Mr. Arthurs told him that with the exception of the 10 per cent. in cash, the balance was to be paid by patents\u2014the transfer of patents to the company. Mr. Austin did not at that time become a shareholder. The organization of the company was perfected and the stock issued upon the basis I have stated. Mr. Arthurs was one of the directors of the company and received the amount of stock subscribed for by him. The 10 per cent. paid in was by arrangement with Mr. Austin deposited to the credit of the Company in the Dominion bank, of which Mr. Austin was president, the arrangement was made with Mr. Austin for this deposit by Mr. Arthurs, Mr. H.L. Hime and myself. Mr. Austin was told by me and the others were with me that this 10 per cent. so deposited was all the money that was to be paid on account of stock subscriptions. The deposit was placed there to the credit of the Ontario Wood Pavement Co., of Toronto. Late in the summer, or early in the fall, I think it was in September, (I am not certain) of the year 1871, Mr. Austin came to me and stated that Mr. Arthurs was owing him a considerable sum of money, I think $10,000. I am not certain that he did state any sum, and Mr. Austin stated that Mr. Arthurs wanted him take or had offered him this Wood Pavement Co\u2019s, stock as a payment or part payment on account of his indebtedness, and asked me what I thought of it, the prospects of the company, and the value of the stock. He asked me how Arthurs obtained the stock and if it was fully paid stock. I told him that it was issued as fully paid stock, and that the certificates so stated on their face, that the company had some valuable contracts, or were about getting them. I do not remember whether at that time the contracts had been actually obtained by the company, but they were obtained at about that time. Mr. Austin knew at that time whether the contract had been obtained at the time or not, he was perfectly conversant with the operations of the company and its prospects. At this interview, that is at its conclusion, Mr. Austin stated to me that he considered the stock a good investment at fifty cents on the dollar, and that he thought he should take the stock from Mr. Arthurs,\nAnd being asked:\nDid Mr. Austin advance any money to Mr. Arthurs to help him to make the 10 per cent. payment on his, Arthurs\u2019, stock?\nThe witness answered as follows:\nWhen Mr. Arthurs made his last payment on account of the 10 per cent. that he paid on his stock subscription, he handed me a cheque for an amount considerably less than the amount that would have completed his payment, with the request that I would hand it to Mr. Austin for deposit in the Dominion bank to the credit of the Wood Pavement Co., and to ask Mr. Austin to deposit for him Mr. Arthur, the balance to make up the sum required to be paid. It was necessary that the full amount should be paid that day, in order to answer the requirements of the charter of the company\/so much had to be deposited, subsequently Mr. Austin, as president of the Dominion bank, certified that the amount required by law to be deposited had been deposited within the time required.\nThe defendant having been called as a witness on his own behalf, the following question was put to him:\nDid you know anything about whether this stock was or was not paid up?\nTo which he replied: I\u2019knew nothing about it, when I took the stock I asked Perkins and Arthurs, and Perkins told me that there was nothing but paid up stock, that it was all paid up.\nTo the following question:\nMr. Perkins in his evidence says that he told you all about the details of the company\u2019s affairs, is this correct?\nHe replies:\nI do not think he ever told me anything about it, I had no reason to ask him. He may have talked over a lot of things that I took no interest in. I do not know, I have no recollection of it. He told me that the stock was paid up; whether he had reference to the directors or the shareholders stock, I do not know. That was just before 1 took this stock. No one told me before I took it that the stock was not fully paid up. 1 never heard that. If I had been told I would have been a little more particular in having it marked on the thing itself.\nAnd being asked;\nHave you not ascertained since this matter has been under discussion that you did arrange to get the 10 per cent. that he (Arthurs) paid in to get it from your bank?\nHe answers:\nI know nothing of it, I have heard it stated so in Perkins\u2019s evidence, but it is not true.\nTo the question:\nCan you swear positively that it is not true?\nHe answers:\nNo, I cannot. I have not looked into the bank books to ascertain. Without search among my bank books and papers, I will not swear that X did not, but I believe that I never did. It is a good many years ago. I have still my cheques. I am still president of the Dominion bank. I may have given Mr. Arthurs a cheque for some money, but for what I do not know. I cannot swear positively that there is no material there to show that I did.\nBeing asked:\nWhy did you not search when you saw what Perkins stated?\nHe replied:\nI did not think his evidence was reliable. I do not think he is a reliable man. I took this stock only as security, and X thought it was paid up stock. I did not think there was any liability on my part, or I would not have touched it at all And being asked:\nDid you think, as a matter of fact, that he (Arthurs) had put $10,000 or $11,000 into that concern in money to pay that stock up?\nHe replies:\nI did not think so at that time. I thought the probability was that there was some arrangement between them. 1 did not know what that arrangement was. Probably that he should be paid something for his services. I had heard that, I thought he had paid some cash on it, but I did not know what he had paid. 1 did not think he had paid the whole $10,000 or $11,000. I did not know anything about it, and therefore I had no right to think. He might or he might not. I do not know that it was that which made me enquire from Perkins. I never saw the books of the company. I think I spoke to Mr. Hime about it, and he told me it was paid up stock. I think it was in his office. I do not know whether it was Mr. Hime or the young man in his office that I asked. I never addressed any communication to the board of directors as a board.\nBeing asked:\nWill you swear that Perkins did not say to you that it was issued as paid up stock, was not that the way of it?\nHe replied:\nHe said it was all paid up stock, I could not undertake to remember the very words that Perkins used; I will not swear what was the expression he used, but I know that he led me to believe that the stock was paid up. He intended to convey that idea to me I know, because 1 told him that I was going to take the stock as security. I took the stock because I could get nothing else. I did not think it was worth much, I thought it was worth probably thirty cents on the dollar, at all events I thought it was better to take that than take nothing. There was no arrangement between my son-in-law and me about this stock.\nAgain he says:\nThere was no instrument in writing showing the arrangement between Mr. Arthurs and myself.\nArthurs\u2019 solicitor, through whom the arrangements had been completed, having been asked as a witness by the defendants, said:\nMr. Arthurs was indebted to Mr. Austin, and wanted to give him security for what he owed him. He had an interest in his father\u2019s estate and some other claims. The proposal was that he should transfer these to Mr. Austin as security for what he owed him. The transfer was made. The bargain itself was not put in writing. The transfers of the different properties were put in writing, Mr. Arthurs would transfer the stock and interest in his mother\u2019s estate; there was no writing showing the transaction except the transfers. There was no writing to show that it was a security.\nWitnesses were called by the defendant to impeach the credibility of the witness Perkins, but nothing turns now upon this evidence, for Mr. Justice Galt, before whom the case was tried, considered such evidence to be unimportant, as he said it was not upon Perkins\u2019 evidence he should decide the case.\nA document was given in evidence by the plaintiff, dated the 9th February, 1871, and made between the defendant of the first part, John Lamb, James David Edgar, John Day Irwin, David Galbraith, James Sauin Mc Murray, Humphrey Lloyd Hime, James Edward Smith, George Allan Arthurs, Edgar McMullan, William Jesse Allswell, William Perkins, and Francis Burton Fisher, of the second part, whereby the respondent became trustee of the letters patent for the \u201cnew and useful improvement on the art now in use for paving streets called the monitor wooden sectional pavement,\u201d upon the trusts therein declared in favor of the Several parties of the second part, the persons then constituting the Ontario Wood Pavement Co., of Toronto.\nAt the close of the trial Mr. Justice Galt rendered a judgment in the following words:\nI find that by the books of the company the stock appeared to be paid up, but that in reality there was only 10 per cent. in money paid on the stock. I find that the transfer was made to Mr. Austin as security for the amount of Arthurs\u2019 debt to him. I find that the defendant never intended to incur any responsibility with regard to any unpaid balance that might be due upon this stock. This finding and the one before it are subject to the objection taken by Mr. Bethune, that parol evidence is not admissible to prove that Mr. Austin held it merely as security. Therefore I find a verdict for the defendant, but the plaintiff, of course, can move to enter a verdict for the amount of $1,603 and interest from July, 1874, if the court shall be of opinion that under the evidence given Mr. Austin is liable.\nUpon a rule nisi obtained to set aside this verdict for the defendant and to enter a verdict for the plaintiff, pursuant to leave reserved and the Law Reform and Administration of Justice Acts, the Court of Common Pleas, in which court the action was brought, after argument, made the rule absolute whereby it was ordered that the verdict be set aside and a verdict entered for the plaintiffs for $1,603, with interest thereon from the 25th day of July, 1874, the court being of opinion that the defendant was liable to the plaintiffs under the provisions of 27th and 28th Vic., ch. 23, as the transfer to him was absolute and not stated to be by way of security, and as the defend ant had procured to be issued to him a certificate to the effect that he was absolute owner of the stock; and the court held that he did not come within the protection of the final clause of sec. 29 of the Act. The court were also of opinion that upon the evidence the defendant, at the time of the transfer of the shares to him, had actual notice that they were not, in fact, paid up in full Mr. Justice Galt, who tried the case and who also gave judgment upon the rule, when pronouncing his judgment, said[25]:\nI entered a verdict for the defendant at the trial on the ground that the transfer was made to him as security for the amount of Mr. Arthurs\u2019 to him, and because he never intended to incur any responsibility with regard to any unpaid balance that might be due upon the stock. The transfer of the stock in question was absolute on its face, and there was nothing on the books of the company to show that Mr. Arthurs retained any interest in it. He had, as far as the books of the company were concerned, ceased to be a shareholder, and the stock is in the name of the defendant.\nThe learned judge might have added, that no instru- ment, or writing of any nature, had ever been signed by either of the parties to the transfer to show that any intention was entertained by either of them at the time of the transfer that the transfer should be anything different from, or have any effect different from, what upon its face it purported to be, and to have\u2014that is to say, to be, and to have the effect of, an absolute unconditional transfer to the defendant as sole owner of the shares in his own right and to his own sole use The learned judge, drawing attention to the clauses of the Act, arrives at the same conclusion as the learned Chief Justice of the court had done, that the defendant, by accepting an absolute transfer of the shares, took upon himself the responsibility of a shareholder.\nFrom this judgment the defendant appealed to the Court of Appeal for Ontario, in which court it was contended that the judgment was erroneous for the following reasons: that, as contended upon behalf of the defendant, the stock was, in fact, shown to have been fully paid up; that the mode of payment was a matter of agreement between the company and the shareholder; that it was for the company to say what equivalent they should accept for stock, whether money or money\u2019s worth, property, services, &c., and that it was not disproved that in some way or other the stock in question was paid and satisfied to the company; that if, as between the shareholder and the company, the stock is paid up or satisfied, there is no principle upon which it can be questioned by a creditor; that if questionable for want of bona fides between the company and the shareholder, yet it is not so against a transferee for value in good faith without notice; that the defendant had no notice that the shares were not fully paid up; that the stock was held by the defendant as security only, and that he is protected by section 29 of the Act; that the judgment complained of pro- ceeds upon the assumption that the Act required that the fact that the stock is held as security should be in writing and appear in the company\u2019s books; that there is no such requirement in the statute\u2014nor does the law require it; that the intention of the legislature was to make beneficial ownership the condition of liability to creditors; that the restriction adopted by the judgment is unnecessary and productive of inconvenience and injustice, and would interfere with that freedom in the use of property which trade and commerce require.\nNow, from the above statement of the matter presented by the defendant himself to the several courts for adjudication, it is obvious that his sole contention at the trial, and on the argument of the rule nisi to set aside the verdict then rendered for the defendant, and upon the appeal from the rule absolute of the Court of Common Pleas setting it aside and ordering a verdict to be entered for the plaintiffs, was that the shares transferred to the defendant were shares which were paid up in full and which were acquired by him as such and as collateral security only for a debt due to him by the assignor of the shares, and that under these circumstances he was, by the 29th section of 27 and 28 Vic., ch. 23, exempt from liability.\nSuch a point as that upon which the Court of Appeal for Ontario proceeded, while declining to express any judgment upon the point which was submitted to it by the defendant in the case as settled upon his appeal, never had been suggested in any stage of the cause, and the facts, upon the assumption of the establishment of which, by entries in the books of the company unexplained, the judgment of the court is rested, never had been tried in the court below, or found to be existing facts, nor had any question been submitted by the defendant in the action (the now appellant) relating to the point upon which the judgment of the Court of Appeal was given. The point, in fact, first suggested itself to one of the learned judges of the Court of Appeal, who, after the argument had taken place upon the case as settled between the parties and the reasons of appeal submitted therewith, sent for the transfer book of the company, from a perusal of which the court arrived at the conclusion, that the shares which the defendant insists he holds in good faith, as fully paid-up shares and as security for a debt due to him, are in reality no shares at all, and that his security for his debt, equally as his responsibility to the plaintiffs, is a delusion. In pronouncing the judgment of the Court of Appeal, Mr. Justice Burton shows how the point arose. He says there:\u2014\nAfter the argument Mr. Justice Cameron sent for the transfer book from which it clearly appears that the stock held by the defendant consists wholly of new stock, under the by\u2011law of the 6th February, 1871, which recited that the whole of the original capital stock, amounting to $100,000, has been allotted and paid in, and that the company had determined to increase the capital stock to $250,000, and enacted that it should be increased accordingly. Of the original stock of $130,000, $70,000 was first subscribed, and $7,000 or 10 per cent. paid. This subscription was subsequently made up to the full amount of which the patentees took 920 shares, and, in consideration of the other shareholders paying an additional 10 per cent., they agree to pay up the balance of their shares. This was carried out in the manner described in Scales v. Irwin, reported in 34 U.C.Q.B. 545. In point of fact then the recital was untrue, the original stock was not fully paid up, and the right to pass the by-law to increase the capital stock never arose.\nThen at the close of the judgment he says:\nThe defendant is entitled upon this objection to have the judgment reversed and this appeal allowed, but, as the point upon which we have decided the case was not taken in the court below nor in the reasons of appeal, it should be without costs.\nNow, assuming it to have been clearly established, as alleged in this judgment, and in that of Mr. Justice Patterson, that the shares transferred to the defendant consisted wholly of new stock, purported to be issued under the authority of the by-law of the 6th February, 1871, it does not appear to me to be so clear that the court was justified in giving to the defendant, as against the claim of the plaintiffs, the benefit of an objection never made by him, but suggested by the court itself, while certain matters of fact upon which the validity and sufficiency of the objection must necessarily rest had never been brought into contestation and tried. Assuming that there does appear in the books of the company sufficient to warrant the conclusion at which the court arrived as a conclusion of fact, the utmost which, under the circumstances, I think, the court should have done was under the provisions of the 22nd sec. of ch. 88 of the Revised Statutes of Ontario to have put the questions of fact upon which the validity and sufficiency of the objection suggested by the court rested into a course for trial in due form of law, as they never had been tried, and to have thus given to the plaintiffs an opportunity to produce evidence, if they could, for the purpose of establishing that the defendant had such knowledge of the acts of Arthurs in the organization of the company, and of his participation in the acts of the members of the company which made the issue of the shares illegal, as should preclude him from setting up the illegality of those acts to deprive himself of the shares for the purpose of defeating the plaintiffs\u2019 action. The plaintiffs have, as it apppears to me, just reason to complain that the objection taken by the Court of Appeal upon which the plaintiffs\u2019 action has been dismissed never was taken by the defendant or triad, and that they have been deprived of all opportunity of offering evidence of the defendant having had such knowledge of the participation of Arthurs in the illegality attending the issue of the shares as should deprive him of all benefit from the objection. The objection to the stock issued under authority of the by-law of the 6th February, 1871, whereby the capital stock of the company was increased from $130,000 to $250,000 is, that the increase was made contrary to the provisions of the 16th sec. of 27th and 28th Vic., ch. 23, whereby the directors were authorized to pass a by-law for increasing their capital stock beyond the amount of $130,000 originally authorised when the whole of the original capital should be allotted and paid in, and not sooner. The reason, therefore, for the second issue having been ultra vires of the directors is, that the whole of the original capital was not paid in, although it was recited in the by-law that it was, and such recital was untrue. Now the evidence in this case and in Scales v. Irwin, which was read by agreement in this case, is in my judgment sufficient to establish, as it appeared to the court in that case, that the device whereby it was sought to make it appear that, contrary to the fact, the whole original capital was paid up, was a fraudulent device designed for the express purpose of endeavouring to protect the shareholders in this company from the claims of judgment creditors of the company like the plaintiffs. Arthurs was a party to that fraudulent contrivance, and if the plaintiffs\u2019 claim were now asserted against him, if he were now the holder of the shares which he transferred to the defendant, I am not prepared to assent to the proposition that he could be heard to set up as a defence to the plaintiffs\u2019 claim the nullity of the issue brought about by his own participation with his co-directors in the fraud which caused the nullity of the issue; and if the defendant had notice of the fraud of Arthurs and his co-directors, and took the transfer of the shares with knowledge of such fraud, I am not prepared to say that it would be competent for him, any more than it would be for Arthurs, to set up and rely upon the fraudulent conduct of the latter for the purpose of defeating the plaintiffs\u2019 claim. Whether the defendant had or had not notice of the fraudulent design and contrivance of Arthurs and his co-directors, is a question which never has been tried, and, in my opinion, it should be tried before the defendant can be relieved from liability to the plaintiffs upon the ground upon which the judgment of the Court of Appeal has proceeded.\nMr. Justice Burton, in his judgment above quoted from, says:\nIf, in the present case, the defendant had known all about the manner in which the increased stock had been issued, and with that knowledge had accepted the\u2019 transfer, it might well be that he might be estopped from setting up the want of power in the directors as a defence to an action by the company, or on an application to place him on the list as a contributory on winding up, but nothing of the kind is established here.\nBut that nothing of the kind is established here may well be attributed to the fact that no such objection as that under consideration was ever made by the defendant, who alone could make it if it could be made at all. The plaintiffs had only to give\u2014as they did give\u2014evidence that the defendant appeared to be a holder of shares in the capital stock of the company, the whole of which was not paid up, and the unpaid amount of which was sufficient to satisfy the plaintiffs\u2019 judgment in whole or in part. Having presented such a prim\u00e2 facie case the onus lay upon the defendant to make such a defence as he intended to rely upon as displacing such case. Not having made any of the nature of the objection to the plaintiffs\u2019 recovery which was taken by the Court of Appeal for Ontario, and upon which that court gave their judgment, it is not surprising that matters which would be only applicable for the purpose of displacing such objection do not appear in the evidence which was taken in respect of an wholly different defence, and upon an wholly different issue. But without going so far as to say that sufficient does appear to attribute to the defendant knowledge of the fraudulent design of the original shareholders in making arrangement for the distribution of the original capital stock and, for its increase, I think I am justified in saying that there does appear much in the evidence as taken which, unless it should be satisfactorily explained, tends to such a conclusion, and which should be submitted to a proper tribunal for enquiring into the truth of the matter before the defendant should have the benefit of being considered to be, equally as if he had been proved to be, a transferree of the shares without notice of such fraud, upon an issue raising that question. The evidence of Mr. Perkins is of a nature, as it appears to me, to require a better answer than has been offered to it. Mr. Hime was referred to by Perkins as having been present at some or one of the conversations testified to by Perkins, as having been had between him and Arthurs and the defendant, and if called, as he might have been by the defendant, he could have confuted or confirmed Perkins upon the matter in connection with which he had referred to Hime; and, if Perkins be a credible witness, the extent of the defendants knowledge of the organization of the company, and of the distribution of the shares and of the number originally agreed to be taken by Arthurs, and upon which he paid the 10 per cent. thereon through the defendant, as is said, into the Dominion bank, has to be considered before the defendant can be relieved from liability in this action, if knowledge should be brought home to him of facts which would subject Arthurs to liability to the plaintiffs if he was the defendant in this action, and still the holder of the shares transferred by him to the defendant. The answers of the defendant to the questions put to him relative to his assistance to Arthurs to enable him to pay the 10 per cent. on the stock subscribed for by him, and of which he agreed to become the holder are, to my mind, by no means satisfactory.\nIn the absence of any contention having been raised by the defendant of the nature of that suggested by the Court of Appeal on his behalf as against the plaintiffs\u2019 claim, I am of opinion that that court should have given to the plaintiffs, and that they should now have, if they desire it, an opportunity to have an enquiry made and issue joined and tried, as to the knowledge or notice the defendant had, if he had any, of such acts of Arthurs in connection with the organization of the company and the distribution of the shares therein, as if he (Arthurs) was still the holder of the shares in question and defendant in this action would deprive him of the right to insist that the shares were illegally issued, and that he was not, for that reason, liable to the plaintiffs in respect of them. The liability or non-liability of the defendant, in case he had such knowledge, raises a question which I do not think the record and evidence as they stand warrant the expression of an opinion upon, and as the defendant himself never suggested the defence now relied upon on his behalf, I think he should be ordered to pay all the costs of the former trial and of this appeal; for considering the case upon the basis upon which it was presented by the defendant himself for trial and was tried, and upon which it was argued in the Court of Common Pleas, upon which basis alone it was also presented to the Court of Appeal, I am of opinion that the judgment of the Court of Common Pleas is put upon sound principles and ought to be sustained.\nI am of opinion that the 29th section of 27th and 28th Vic., ch. 23, applies only to mortgagees or trustees appearing upon the books of the company so to be, and to cases where shares appear to have been pledged as collateral security, the owner of the shares still appearing on the books of the company to be the proprietor thereof, subject to the pledge, and does not apply to the case of shares absolutely transferred upon the books of the company from one person to another, as the unconditional owner thereof, whatever secret understanding there might be between the parties, that the transferee should hold the shares so transferred as a pledge only, and collateral security for a debt. I am of opinion, however, that the proper inference to be drawn from the evidence in this case, is that there was no agreement between Arthurs and the defendant, that the latter should hold the shares transferred to him as a pledge only, or as a collateral security for the debt due to him by Arthurs, but that the intention of both parties to the transaction was, that the defendant should be, in fact, as upon the books of the company he appeared to be, absolute proprietor of the shares transferred, the transfer of which, as of the interest in lands, transferred in like manner, the defendant took in substitution for the original debt, and as he himself says in his evidence, \u201cbecause he could get nothing, and that it was better to take what he got than take nothing.\u201d\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellants: Bethume, Moss, Falconbrigde Hoyles.\nSolicitors for respondent: Rose, Macdonald, Merritt & Coatsworth.\n[1] 7 Ont.

The master found that $453.20 was due to the defendant by the plaintiff. The master disallowed to the plaintiff the amount of a note for $510, and interest thereon as barred by the Statute of Limitations; and reduced the interest on a sum of $3,000 advanced from twenty-four per cent. to six per cent. after judgment had been recovered. The note of $510 was dated 18th November, 1861, and was payable with interest at the rate of $10 per week from the 23rd November, 1861. On the 6th March, 1867, the defendant, who had been sued by the plaintiff for certain other claims, entered into agreement with him in order to relieve him from the pressure of execution debts, paid him $2,000 on account of his indebtedness, and got time for the balance. The plaintiff made no demand at the time to be paid this note, and did not instruct his attorney who acted for him to seek payment of it until 1870.\nHeld,\u2014That the evidence shewed an appropriation by respondent of the $2,000 on account of the debts for which he was being pressed, and as the note for $510 was not included in such debts, the master was right in treating it as barred by the statute of limitations.\nAnother note dated 11th January, 1862, payable to and endorsed by one S.H., was for $3,000 with interest at the rate of two per cent. per month until paid. By a covenant for payment contained in a mortgage deed of the same date, given by the defendant to the plaintiff as a collateral security for the payment of this note, the defendant covenanted to pay \u201cthe said sum of $3,000 on the 11th day of July, 1862, with interest thereon at the rate of twenty-four per cent. per annum until paid.\u201d A Judgment was recovered upon the note, hut not upon the covenant. The master allowed for interest in respect of this debt six per cent, only from the date of the recovery of the judgment.\nHeld,\u2014That the proper construction of the terms of both the note and covenant as to payment of interest was that interest at the rate of twenty-four per cent. should he paid up to the 11th July, 1862, and not that interest should be paid at that rate after such day if the principal should then remain unpaid.\nAPPEAL from two judgments of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, the first of such two judgments having been delivered on the 20th day of May, 1879, allowing (in part) the appeal of the above-named respondent from the judgment of the Hon. Vice-Chancellor Proudfoot dismissing an appeal by the said respondent from the report of the master at St. Catharines; and the second of such judgments having been delivered on the 28th day of November, 1881, dismissing the appeal of the above-named appellants, from an order made in chambers by the Hon. Mr. Justice Patterson, amending the certificate issued by the Registrar of the court pursuant to the above first recited judgment.\nThe facts and pleadings sufficiently appear in the judgment of Strong, J., hereinafter given.\nMr. Dalton McCarthy, Q.C., for appellants, and Mr. James Bethune, Q.C., for respondent.\nIn addition to the cases reviewed in the judgments hereinafter given the learned counsel cited and relied on the following cases:\u2014Morrison v. Robinson[1]; Mills v. Fawkes[2]; Simpson v. Ingham[3]; Keene v. Keene[4]; Howland v. Jennings[5]; Dallby v. Humphrey[6]; New Marsh v. Clay[7]; Peters v. Anderson[8]. The judgment of the court was delivered by\nSTRONG, J.:\u2014\nThis suit was originally instituted in the Court of Chancery for Ontario by the appellants\u2019 testator against the present respondent, John Charles Rykert, and Thomas Burns. The Bill alleged that the plaintiff had recovered a judgment against the respondent and had issued execution against lands thereon, and that certain lands which had been conveyed to Burns by one Page were so conveyed in trust for the respondent and in fraud of the plaintiff. It was declared by the decree that the lands in question were held by Burns as trustee for the respondent, subject only to the amount due by the respondent to Burns in respect of money advanced by him to the respondent for the purpose of the purchase of these lands, and that subject to that amount the lands were liable to a charge for the amount of the plaintiff\u2019s execution. The decree then directed an account to be taken of the sum due to Burns and for redemption by the respondent, and in default a sale to raise the amount found due, and also for an account of all the dealings between the plaintiff and the respondent, and for a sale of the lands in default of payment of any balance found due to the plaintiff. The sum found due to Burns has been paid off, and his rights are no longer in question. The Master proceeded to take the account directed by the decree between the plaintiff and the respondent, and found that the sum of $458.20 was, at the date of the report, (the 12th of November, 1877,) due to the respondent by the plaintiff. The accounts were complicated, and the Master\u2019s duty was rendered very difficult by the irregular and confused manner in which the accounts had been kept by the plaintiff. The report, however, is very full and clear, and is further elucidated by a judgment which the Master has appended to it. Both the plaintiff and the respondent appealed to the Court of Chancery against this report. The respondent\u2019s grounds of appeal were all disallowed by the learned Vice Chancellor by whom the appeal was originally heard, and there was no further appeal from his decision in this respect, save as regards the respondent\u2019s first exception to the report. But upon this point, which related to the amount for which a mortgage for $3000 was to stand as security, the Court of Appeal confirmed the Master\u2019s finding, which, as mentioned, had been approved by the Vice Chancellor, and this last decision is not impugned upon the present appeal to this Court. The plaintiffs grounds of appeal were three in number and were as follows:\u2014\n(1.) Upon the ground that the Master should hare allowed to the plaintiff the amount of the $510 note and interest thereon.\n(2.) Because the Master should not have reduced the interest upon the $8000 advanced, to six per cent., after judgment had been recovered upon the note given as one of the securities therefor, but should have allowed interest at the rate of 24 per cent. upon such advance.\n(3.) Because the Master should have allowed to the plaintiff the costs of the various actions brought by the plaintiff against the defendant Rykert.\nThe last of these grounds was disallowed by the Vice Chancellor, and his judgment in that respect was not appealed from. The first and second grounds of appeal were allowed, and against that decision the respondent appealed to the Court of Appeal, whose decision upon these points is the subject of the present appeal.\nI will consider the questions thus raised in the order in which they have been stated. The promissory note for $510 was dated the 18th of November, 1861, and was payable with interest at the rate of $10 per week from the 23rd November, 1861, The Master found that this note was barred by the Statute of Limitations, and that the plaintiff failed to show that it was taken out of the operation of the statute by the application of part of a sum of $2,000 paid by the respondent to the plaintiff on the 6th March, 1867. The Vice-Chancellor held that the appropriation made by the plaintiff of a portion of the $2,000, as indicated by the plaintiff\u2019s books, to the payment of the note in question was a valid appropriation, and that the evidence was insufficient to establish a prior payment or satisfaction of the note, The Court of Appeal, though expressing no opinion upon the Statute of Limitations beyond an intimation favourable to the view taken by the master, determined that the circumstantial evidence sufficiently established a presumption of payment long before the payment of the $2,000 on the 6th March, 1867.\nThe circumstances which the court rely on as warranting this inference are that the note was evidently intended to be a short transaction from what appears on its face, that the interest was to begin to run five days after its date, thereby implying that it was to be-paid in the five days, and also from the fact admitted by the plaintiff, that he had held a bundle of collateral securities for this note which he had given up to the respondent for the reason alleged by him that he considered them of little or no value, and from the keeping back the note, when all other demands held by the plaintiff were put in suit, as well as the plaintiff\u2019s silence regarding this note when the arrangement of the 6th March, l867, was completed, and the omission of this note from the statement on which that agreement was based. I am far from saying that these circumstances are not sufficient to justify the conclusion which the court came to, that there had been a payment, I am of opinion, however, that the Statute of Limitations is a much more satisfactory basis for the decision of this objection to the master\u2019s report. For I think with the master, and upon the authority of the cases referred to in his judgment, particularly that of Shaw v. Picton[9], that the proper conclusion from the evidence is that there was an appropriation by the respondent of the $2,000 to the payment of the judgments which excluded any right of the plaintiff to make another subsequent application. The law as to the imputation of payments is well settled to be that a debtor owing several debts has, in the first place, the option of ascribing a payment which he makes to any of the several debts as he may think fit, the rule being solvitur in modum solventis. This general rule is, however, subject to certain limitations, one of which is, that the appropriation by the debtor, must be made at the time of payment, and that he cannot make a subsequent appropriation as the creditor may. But the specific appropriation need not be shown by any express declaration, it may be inferred from facts and circumstances, and in such case it becomes a question of fact to be determined by a jury in the action at law, and in every case by the tribunal to which the decision of questions of fact is referred. In the present case it was therefore for the master to say upon the evidence whether the respondent, when he made the payment of the $2,000, on the 6th March, 1867, intended with the knowledge of the plaintiff to apply that payment to the judgments which the plaintiff had recovered against him, or whether he paid it on account of his general indebtedness to the plaintiff, as well demands in judgment as those not so included, leaving the plaintiff to make such specific application of it as he might think fit. The master has found that the respondent did intend an application of the payment to the judgments, and I think there is ample evidence to support his finding. The arrangement for giving the respondent time, of which the payment of this $2,000 formed part, was made with Mr. Currie, the attorney of the plaintiff, in the actions on which the judgments had been recovered. Mr. Currie knew nothing of this note for $510; it had not been put in his hands for collection by the plaintiff, and was not mentioned to him by the plaintiff in the course of the negotiations which led to the agreement of the 6th March, 1867. The respondent is proved to have applied to Mr, Currie for a statement of the plaintiffs claims, and Mr. Currie accordingly gave hid the memorandum, exhibit H, which specifies certain claims, all of which had passed into judgment. Mr. Rykert swears that he supposed this note was paid, and although he may have been wrong as to the fact, there is nothing to induce the supposition that he considered the note was then an existing debt, which is sufficient for the present purpose. When therefore Mr. Rykert in the words of the agreement of the 6th March, 1867, \u201cpaid the plaintiff the sum of $2,000 on account of his indebtedness,\u201d it is a fair assumption, and an inference which a jury would be justified in making, and I have no doubt would make, that the indebtedness referred to was that stated in Mr. Currie\u2019s memorandum, exhibit H, save the judgment against Mrs. Rykert, and the costs which were to be paid to Mr. Currie, and were expressly excepted from the agreement. I think this conclusion is also confirmed by the agreement itself, which provides that if any of the instalments shall not be paid on the day the same becomes due, all the indebtedness in arrear may at once be \u201cenforced.\u201d The word \u201cenforced,\u201d thus used, implies a reference to debts upon which judgment had already been recovered, rather than to general liabilities never put in suit. In the case of Shaw v. Picton[10], Messrs. Howard & Gibbs, solicitors, having themselves large demands against Lord Alvanley upon bill transactions with himself, and also as agents for several other persons to whom Lord Alvanley had granted annuities, for which Lord Foley was surety, caused an application to be made to Lord Alvanley and Lord Foley on behalf of the annuitants, and Lord Alvanley in consequence of that application paid to Howard & Gibbs certain sums of money without making any express appropriation of them at the time of payment. It was held by the Court of King\u2019s Bench that Lord Alvanley ought to be considered as having appropriated the payment on account of the annuitants. The principle of that decision may be generalized by saying, that where there are several debts and in consequence of pressure in respect of one of them the debtor makes a payment, without expressing any specific appropriation, he will be implied to intend an application of the payment to the debt for which he was being pressed. And applying the principle so extracted from the case of Shaw v. Picton to the facts of the present case, it seems very clear that the respondent making the agreement of the 6th March, 1867, and the payment of the $2,000 in pursuance of its terms, in order to relieve himself from the pressure of execution debts, must be taken to have intended that payment to be applied to those debts, and not to a debt which was not brought to his attention, which he swears he believed to have been paid, and for the payment of which the plaintiff made no demand, and which he had not even instructed the attorney who acted for him to seek payment of. Therefore, even assuming that this note for $510 had not been paid previously to the 6th March, 1867, a point upon which I express no opinion varying from the conclusion arrived at by the Court of Appeal, I am of opinion that there never was any partial payment on account to take it out of the Statute of Limitations, and that the master was consequently quite right in treating it as barred by that statute.\nThe remaining question which we are called upon to decide is that raised by the plaintiff\u2019s second objection to the report, upon his appeal to the Court of Chancery, relating to the rate of interest to be allowed upon a promissory note for $3,000, upon the judgment recovered on that note, or upon a collateral covenant of the same tenor as the note. The note in question was dated the 11th January, 1862, was payable to and endorsed by one Sheldon Hawley, and is for $3,000 \u201cwith interest at the rate of 2 per cent. per month, until paid.\u201d The covenant for payment contained in the mortgage deed of the same date given by Mr. Rykert as collateral security for the payment of the same amount, is for payment of \u201cthe said sum of $3,000 on the 11th day of July, 1862, with interest thereon at the rate of 24 per cent. per annum until paid.\u201d A judgment was recovered upon the note, but not upon the covenant. The master allowed the plaintiff for interest in respect of this debt, 6 per cent. only from the date of the recovery of the judgment. The Vice-Chancellor held that the plaintiff was entitled to interest on the judgment at the rate of 24 per cent. and directed the report to be varied accordingly. The Court of Appeal, however, determined that this was incorrect, and upon the authority of Cook v. Fowler[11], held that upon the judgment the plaintiff must be restricted to the statutory rate of interest from the date of signing judgment. If the true construction of the contract as to interest embodied in this promissory note was, that interest should be paid at the rate of 24 per cent. after the date of payment fixed in the instrument itself and up to the date of actual payment, it may, upon the authority of Popple v. Sylvester[12], decided since the judgment of the Court of Appeal, be doubted if Cook v. Fowler authorised such a decision, for according to this case of Popple v. Sylvester it would seem that the recovery of the judgment only merged the principal and interest due at the date of the judgment, leaving the contract to pay interest at the larger rate still operative as to subsequently accruing interest. This, however, is a point which I merely notice in passing, for it does not call for any determination in the view which I take of the proper constructions of the terms of both the note and covenant as to the payment of interest at the rate of 24 per cent. The question as to the rate of interest recoverable on the covenant was not originally before the Court of Appeal at all. The master\u2019s report was final as to all matters of account between the parties, and it had not been objected to by the plaintiff, as one of his grounds of appeal, that the master had omitted to bring this covenant into account.\nBut upon the court determining that the plaintiff was only entitled to 6 per cent. interest on his judgment, it was suggested by counsel, that he was at all event\u2019s entitled to 24 per cent. in respect of the collateral covenant contained in the mortgage which had never passed into judgment, and upon this the court, at the request of the parties, and in order to make a final disposition of this long pending litigation, and assuming (erroneously, I think,) that the plaintiffs claim on the covenant was not concluded by the report, undertook the decision of the question of the rate of interest recoverable under the covenant, and held that upon the covenant the plaintiff was entitled to receive 24 per cent. until actual payment. I am not able to agree with the Court of Appeal in the construction which they place upon the stipulation as to interest contained in this covenant. It appears to me that the proper construction of the words in which that provision is expressed, \u201cThe said sum of $8,000 on the 11th day of July, 1862, with interest at the rate of 24 per cent. per annum until paid,\u201d is that interest, at the specified rate, is to be paid up to the 11th day of July, 1862, the day fixed for payment by the terms of the covenant, and that it is not to be interpreted as a covenant for payment of interest at the rate of 24 per cent. after the 11th day of July, 1862, if the principal should then remain unpaid. I should have arrived at this conclusion without authority, for I take it that in the absence of express words showing that the parties contemplated payment, not ad diem but post diem, we ought not to presume that they intended to make provision for a breach of the covenant, and I should have thought that a proper and salutary construction, requiring as it does parties who stipulate for a larger amount of interest than the usual and legal rate to make clear by precise and unambiguous language what their intention was. The point, however, seems to be covered by direct authority. In the case of the European Central Railway Co., the Court of Appeal[13], speaking through Bramwell, L.J., determined that a debenture by which a joint stock company covenanted for the payment of the principal on the 11th of October, 1865, and the interest (at the rate of 6 per cent) to be payable in the meantime half yearly at the several dates; \u201cexpressed in the interest warrants thereunto annexed until the repayment thereof,\u201d meant interest at the rate of 6 per cent. until the day fixed for payment of the principal, and was not to be construed as a covenant for the payment of interest at that rate after a default in the payment of principal at the day named. So far as I can see, this decision did not proceed either upon the expression \u201cin the meantime\u201d or upon the reference to the interest warrants attached to the debenture, but determined broadly that the words \u201cuntil the repayment thereof\u201d meant payment at the day fixed, That this is the true exposition of the case referred to is, however, conclusively shown by Mr, Justice Fry in the late case of Popple v. Sylvester[14] (which was cited for the plaintiff upon the point that interest was recoverable upon the note notwithstanding the recovery of judgment), for in that case the learned judge distinguishing the case of the European Central Railway Co. from that before him, where he held that a covenant very differently worded was sufficiently comprehensive to embrace subsequent interest, says:\u2014\nI ought, perhaps, to make a remark upon the case of the European Central Railway Co.13 There the covenant being to pay the principal sum, with interest, \u201cuntil repayment thereof,\u201d the court held that these words meant \u201cuntil the day fixed for payment,\u201d and therefore they held that there was no covenant to pay beyond the day fixed for repayment of the principal. Here I have held that there is an express covenant to continue the payment of interest so long as the security should continue.\nThen applying the decision in the European Central Railway Co., as explained by Fry, J., to the present case, we must come to the same conclusion, for it is impossible to found any argument upon any difference or distinction between the words \u201cuntil repayment thereof,\u201d which were those of the covenant then under consideration, and the words \u201cuntil paid,\u201d which are those of the covenant before us in the present case. The result is that all the objections taken by the plaintiff to the master\u2019s report on the appeal to the Court of Chancery ought to have been disallowed and the order of the Court of Chancery of the 29th day of June, 1878, and the certificate of the Court of Appeal must both be varied accordingly.\nThe point which arose before the Court of Appeal on the motion to vary the certificate, and on the appeal from the order on that motion as to the credit to the respondent for the $912.70 and the interest on it, does not in this disposition of the appeal arise, and need only be noticed for the purpose of pointing out that all question as to it, must be considered as now concluded by the master\u2019s report, and I do this only to prevent any future misunderstanding and further delay in ending this long, protracted litigation. The question as to this $912.70 only became incidentally of importance upon the adjudication of the Court of Appeal, that the plaintiff was entitled to 24 per cent upon the covenant until payment. It appeared that the master had given credit to the respondent for a sum of $912.70, as having been received by the plaintiff, on the 20th May, 1862, being the balance of a mortgage made by one Servos to the respondent, and by the respondent transferred to the plaintiff as collateral security for a less sum than was secured by the original mortgage by Servos, that this balance was the surplus remaining in the plaintiff\u2019s hands after he had realized the mortgage, and paid himself out of the proceeds the debt which it was given to secure. In other words, and in the language of the judgment of the Chief Justice in the Court of Appeal, this amount of $912.70 should, in fact, be treated as a payment made by the respondent on the 20th May, 1862, and applicable as such upon his mortgage to the plaintiff for $3,000. It further appeared that the master instead of making a rest at this date of 20th May, 1862, and deducting this credit of $912.70 from the amount of principal then due, in respect of the $3,000 debt, carried on the interest account at 6 per cent. on the full amount of the latter debt, and also calculated interest at 6 per cent. on the payment of $912.70. There was no appeal against the report in respect of this disposition of this surplus of the Servos mortgage, and the report in respect of it, and as regards the date at which the master gave the credit, stands confirmed, When, however, the Court of Appeal altered the report as to the rate of interest to be calculated on the debt secured by the note and covenant from 6 to 24 per cent., upon the submission of the parties already noticed, it became a matter of justice to the respondent and properly incidental to this variation of the report in that respect, that in order to give the respondent the benefit of the master\u2019s finding of the payment of this amount at the date named, that they should direct an equivalent rate of interest, (at 24 per cent.,) to be calculated on this payment, and this was done by an order made in chambers by Mr. Justice Patterson to that effect, which was subsequently affirmed on appeal to the full court. In the view which I have stated as to the construction of the covenant and the plaintiff\u2019s right to interest under it at 24 per cent., no necessity arises for varying the report by calculating interest at 24 per cent. on this credit of $912.70.\nThe conclusion is that, in my opinion, the report should stand in all respects confirmed, and that for the reasons given by the learned master.\nThe orders of both courts below should be varied in the manner already indicated, and the plaintiff\u2019s appeal from the report should be dismissed with costs in the Court of Chancery, and the respondent should also have his costs of the appeals both in the Court of Appeal and in this court.\nHENRY, J.:\u2014\nThis is an appeal from two judgments of the Court of Appeal for Ontario\u2014the first of such two judgments having been delivered on the 20th day of May, 1879, allowing (in part) the appeal of the above named respondent from the judgment of the Hon. Vice-Chancellor Proudfoot, dismissing an appeal by the said respondent from the report of the master at St. Catharines, and the second of such judgments having been delivered on the 28th day of November, 1881, dismissing the appeal of the above named appellants, from an order made in chambers by the Hon. Mr. Justice Patterson, amending the certificate issued by the registrar of the court pursuant to the above firstly recited judgment.\nThe matter in controversy in the suit having been referred to a master, he gave a judgment which was appealed from by both parties, and a judgment was subsequently given by Vice\u2011Chancellor Proudfoot. From that judgment both parties appealed, and after argument the Court of Appeal for Ontario passed judgment, as appears by the following, certificate of the registrar of that court:\u2014\nThis is to certify that after hearing counsel on the thirteenth day of May, 1879, as well for the appellant as for the respondent, upon the petition and appeal of the above-named appellant complaining of an order of the Court of Chancery of Ontario, bearing date the twenty-ninth day of June, 1878, and praying the some might be reversed or varied, or that such other order in the premises might be made as to this court should seem meet; whereupon and upon hearing read the reasons of appeal filed by the appellant, as also the reasons against such appeal filed by the respondent, this court was pleased to direct that the matter of the said petition and appeal should stand over for judgment; and the same having come on this day for judgment it was ordered and adjudged by the said court that the said petition and appeal should be and the same were allowed as to the five hundred and ten dollars ($510) note mentioned in the fourth reason of appeal put in by the said appellant. And this court doth declare that the said note was paid by appellant, and this court doth dismiss all the other grounds of appeal mentioned in the said reasons of appeal, but declares and directs that the sum -of nine hundred and twelve dollars and seventy cents (912.70), being the amount received by the respondent in respect of the Servos mortgage as stated and shown in the master\u2019s report, he applied in reduction of the three thousand dollar ($3,000) loan in the master\u2019s report mentioned and interest thereon, and he credited to the said appellant upon the said mortgage as and when the same was received by the respondent, and with these declarations and directions this court doth refer the said cause back to the Master of the said Court of Chancery at St. Catharines, to review his said report as directed by the order appealed from. And this court doth not see fit to give to either party any costs of or in respect of this appeal.\nOn an application of the respondent to correct the foregoing certificate made to Mr. Justice Patterson, he, alter hearing counsel for both parties, made the following order:\u2014\nUpon the application of the above-named appellant, upon reading the notice of motion served herein on the ninth day of November, A.D., 1880, for an order correcting the certificate, signed by the registrar of this court, setting forth the judgment of this court upon this appeal. Upon reading the said certificate and the various proceedings in connection with this appeal, and upon hearing counsel for the parties.\nIt is ordered that the certificate signed by the registrar of this court, setting forth the judgment of this court upon this appeal be amended by substituting the words \u201cof the twentieth day of May, A.D. 1862,\u201d for the words \u201cand when the same was received by the respondent.\u201d\nDated this 20th day of November, 1880.\nAn appeal wag taken from that order and after argument the court gave judgment against the appellant, as will appear by the following certificate:\u2014\nMonday, the twenty-eighth day of November, 1881.\nThis is to certify that after hearing Counsel on the twenty-first day of December, 1880, as well for the appellant as the respondents, upon the application of the above named respondents by way of appeal from the order made herein in Chambers by the Hon. Mr. Justice Patterson, on the twentieth day of November, 1880, directing the amendment in certain particulars of the Certificate signed by the Registrar of this Court, setting forth the judgment of this Court upon this appeal, whereupon and upon hearing read the notice of this application and the various proceedings had and taken in connection with this appeal, this Court was pleased to direct that the matter of the said application by way of appeal as aforesaid, should stand over for judgment and the same having come on this day for judgment,\u2014\nIt was ordered and adjudged by the said Court that the said application by way of appeal as aforesaid should be, and the same was, dismissed with costs to be paid by the respondents to the appellant forthwith after taxation thereof.\nThe appeal to this Court is therefore from these two judgments.\nThe first of the judgments disposed of the claim of the appellant on the note for $510 of the respondent declaring that the same was paid. It also declared that $912.70, being the amount received by the (then) respondent, the present appellant, in respect of the Servos mortgage, as shown and stated in the master\u2019s report, be applied in reduction of the $3,000 loan in the master\u2019s report mentioned and interest thereon, and to be credited to the appellant (now respondent) upon the said mortgage, as and when the same was received by respondent (now appellant,) and the cause was referred back to the master to review his report as directed by the order appealed from.\nThere was no appeal from that judgment, and I think it must stand, under any circumstances, as respects the question of the $510. The present appellants, or rather the original plaintiff, submitted to that judgment, and but for the motion on the part of the respondent to amend the certificate the cause would have been immediately remitted back to the master. It appears, therefore, that the only question open is the one raised by the appeal from the order of Mr. Justice Patterson.\nBefore considering that matter I may say that the real merits of the controversy as to the $510 are not easily ascertained, and if the question were open, I would incline to sustain the judgment. A plaintiff to recover should prove his claim in such a manner as to leave no reasonable doubts as to right to recover, and that has not been done in this case. I consider the matter opened up by the appeal in this case is but the question of the date from which the present respondent should be allowed interest on the $912.70 before mentioned. The judgment that he was to be so allowed from the time \u201cwhen the same was received by the respondent,\u201d (now appellant,) was not appealed from by the appellant, and is not therefore open for consideration. Is then the judgment to amend the certificate or formal judgment within the power of the court? It seems that the certificate in question was not in accordance with the view of the Court as to the point in question, and the amendment was made to bring them into harmony. It was, as I understand it, a mistake of the Registrar in certifying the judgment of the Court of Appeal to the court below, and if he made a mistake in stating the judgment, I am of opinion for the reasons given in the judgment of Mr. Justice Patterson and that of Mr. Justice Burton for the full Court, that the amendment is justifiable.\nWe are then to consider the matter as if the certificate had been originally right, and as there was no appeal from the judgment, but merely from the judgment as to the amendment, there is nothing further in my opinion to be considered. I think, therefore, the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs\nSolicitors for appellants: St. John & O\u2019Connor.\nSolicitors for respondent: Rykert & Ingersoll.\n[1] 19 Grant 480.\n[2] 5 B. & C. 461.\n[3] 2 B. & C. 65.\n[4] 3 C.B.N.S. 144.\n[5] 11 U.C.C.P. 272.\n[6] 37 U.C.Q.B. 64.\n[7] 14 East 239.\n[8] 5 Taunt. 596.\n[9] 4 B. & C. 715.\n[10] 4 B. & C. 715.\n[11] L.R. 7 H.L. 27.\n[12] 22 Ch.

St. O. ch. 118, sec. 2.\nIn a deed of assignment for the benefit of creditors, the following clause was inserted:\u2014\u201cAnd it is hereby declared and agreed that the party of the third part, the assignee, shall, as soon as conveniently may be, collect and get in all outstanding credits, &c., and sell the said real and personal property hereby assigned, by auction or private contract, as a whole or in portions, for cash or on credit, and generally on such terms and in such manner as he shall deem best or suitable, having regard to the object of these presents.\u201d No fraudulent intention of defeating or delaying creditors was shown.\nHeld,\u2014affirming the judgment of the court below\u2014that the fact of the deed authorizing a sale upon credit did not, per se, invalidate it, and the deed could not on that account be impeached as a fraudulent preference of creditors within the Act R.S.O., ch. 118, sec. 2.\nAPPEAL from the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1], dismissing an appeal from the judgment of the Court of Common Pleas refusing a rule nisi to set aside the verdict entered for the plaintiff.\nThis was an interpleader issue.\nThe defendant sued Cornish & Co., and on the sixth day of January, 1881, obtained judgment against them for $1,032.21. On the twenty-eighth day of December, 1880, and before the defendant obtained his said judg- ment, Cornish & Co. made and executed a deed of assignment of their property to the plaintiff as trustee, for the benefit of their creditors, and plaintiff contended that he entered into possession under the said deed. On the sixth day of January, 1881, the defendant issued execution on his said judgment, and placed the same in the sheriff\u2019s hands. The sheriff seized the goods mentioned in the deed of assignment to the plaintiff, and the plaintiff claimed to be entitled to them as against the defendant. Upon the application of the sheriff an interpleader issue in the Common Pleas was directed. The issue was tried before Chief Justice Wilson at the York spring assizes, 1881, and a\u2019 verdict entered for the plaintiff. The defendant moved for a rule nisi to set aside said verdict, and to enter a verdict for the defendant, which rule was refused. The defendant appealed to the Court of Appeal, which court gave judgment in favor of plaintiff and dismissed the appeal. The defendant then appealed against such last mentioned judgment to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nMr. Gibbons for appellant:\nThe assignment is invalid, because it permits the trustee to sell on credit.\nThis permission in such deed has been held by the Supreme Court of New York, and by decisions in various other states, to invalidate the deed. See Perry on Trusts[2] and cases there cited.\nIf the trustee is allowed to sell \u201con credit\u201d there is no certainty that the creditor will ever get anything.\nThe debtor may name his own trustee; transfer all his estate to him; and that trustee may sell the whole out to some one else on credit, and the creditor must stand still and wait the result of the new risk.\nIt is submitted that he is not called upon to take this risk, and that the result of the American authorities is founded on the best of reasons, and that the safe rule is, \u201cthat the law will not uphold the transaction when it attempts to confer an authority or discretion upon the assignee more extensive or liable to greater abuse than that which the law itself possesses through its agents and ministers. The assignment to be good, must devote the debtor\u2019s estate unreservedly and un-conditionally to the payment of his debts.\u201d Murphy v. Bell[3].\nIn no class of trusts should the powers of trustees be more strictly limited than in the case of trusts for creditors. Experience has taught that it is not wise that trustees should sell on credit, without being personally responsible in case of loss.\nIt is submitted also that creditors holding securities upon property of the debtor, should only rank for the deficiency over the value of such security. All bankrupt laws, which profess to make an equal distribution of the insolvent\u2019s estate, contain provisions for the valuation of such securities; and it is submitted that an assignment which makes no such provision, is not within the meaning of the provision in the statute.\nThe usual answer to this contention is, that the creditor holding security has his remedy on the covenant for the full amount, and so should rank.\nIf that rule were to govern, there is no reason why, as is provided in this deed, the joint creditors should not rank on the private estates of the respective partners, until after private creditors are paid in full. They have the covenants of both partners, and would, if they obtained prior execution, have priority as to the separate estates over creditors of such separate estates.\nIf the equitable doctrine is to be followed, then it is unjust that the secured creditor should rank for his whole debt; and the legislature has always, when it attempted an equitable distribution, so viewed it.\nThe learned counsel referred also to the following cases: Nicholson v. Leavett[4]; In re Swoyer\u2019s Appeal[5]; Porter v. William[6]; Mussey v. Noyes[7]; Sutton v. Hanford[8]; Pierce v. Brewster[9]; Barney v. Griffin[10]; Hutchinson v. Lord[11].\nMr. Foster for respondent:\nThe assignment is valid. The objection that the assignment empowers the trustee to sell on credit or for cash, and so enables him to delay creditors, was not taken at the trial or on the application for the rule nisi, or as a ground of appeal, but was started, for the first time, in the reply on the argument in appeal. It is not open to the appellant; at least, the respondent is entitled to the benefit of this on the question of costs.\nBut admitting the appellant is at liberty to avail himself of this ground of objection at this stage, it is not tenable. A power to sell on credit is and has been in unquestioned use in the English forms of assignment for the benefit of creditors. See Janes v. Whitebread[12]; Forsyth on Composition[13]. Such a sale by an assignee may be an act of good faith and a proper exercise of discretion. Bump on Fraudulent Conveyances[14]. The power to sell on credit does not necessarily delay creditors; it more frequently facilitates the distribution of the assigned property; it increases the amount of the fund beyond what would be produced by a sale for cash only; it is in some cases essential to the due execution of the trust; it would be implied on the ordinary principles which govern the duties of trustees, were it not given; and an authority which the law would give by implication cannot be regarded as illegal and fraudulent when given in terms. Nicholson v. Leavitt[15].\nBut the power in question is coupled with a stipulation that in selling the assignee is to have regard to the object for which the assignment was made; so that his discretion is not unfettered as regards the term of credit. Nor is he relieved from the responsibility of taking adequate security; so that an abuse of trust in this particular would expose him to personal liability for loss. Fraud depends not on the fact so much as on the character of delay and the motive which actuated it.\nThough Nicholson v. Leavitt[16], decides against the validity, in the State of New York, of an assignment containing a power to sell on credit, yet Rogers v. DeForest[17] is an adverse decision of great weight. The former case was expressly dissented from by the Ohio Court of Appeals\u2014Conkling v. Conrad[18], and is contrary to the decisions in many other States. See also Burrill on Assignments[19]; Perry on Trusts[20]. But the decisions against the validity of the power in question are inapplicable to the present case owing to the difference between Rev Stat. Ont., ch. 118, and the statutes under which they were pronounced.\nThe bon\u00e2 fides of the assignment not being impugned, the power to sell on credit does not take the assignment out of the saving clause in the Act.\nMetcalf v. Keefer[21]; Gottswalls v. Mulholland[22]; Greenshields v. Clarkson[23]; Meux v. Howell[24]. Then as to the objection that the deed does not provide for a proper distribution of the surplus assets of the partnership among the private creditors of each creditor, the clause is the usual one given in precedents.\nMoreover, in directing that the separate creditors of the individual partners shall be satisfied primarily from the separate estate of each partner respectively, and restricting them to such separate estate, unless the joint estate be more than sufficient to pay the joint creditors, then the assignment provides not only a just and reasonable mode of distribution, in accordance with relative legal rights, but also that which the law sanctions and requires\u2014Baker v. Dawbairn[25], and which prevailed under the Insolvent Act[26]. Were the assignment silent as to the mode of distribution, the mode set forth would be taken to have been intended. Murrill v. Neil[27]. That the rights enforceable by the joint creditors by execution are restricted, is not a valid objection in the face of the statutory recognition of assignments for the benefit of creditors. The form adopted is usual. Burrill on Assignments[28].\nRITCHIE, C.J.:\u2014\nThis is an appeal from the Court of Appeal for Ontario. It is an interpleader issue to test the ownership of a certain stock of goods, formerly the property of the firm of Cornish & Co., retail dealers, carrying on business in the city of Toronto. The plaintiff claims under an assignment from Cornish & Co., for the general benefit of creditors, dated the 28th December, 1880. The defendant claims under an execution placed in the sheriff\u2019s hands on the 7th January, 1881. The issue turns on the validity of the assignment to the plaintiff. The defendant contends that the assignment is invalid, because it permits the trustee to sell on credit.\nThe clause in question is as follows;\nAnd it is hereby declared and agreed that the party of the third part, his heirs, executors or administrators, shall, as soon as conveniently may be, collect and get in all outstanding credits and sums of money due to the parties of the first part, or either of them, and sell the said real and personal property hereby assigned, by auction or private contract, as a whole or in portions, for cash or on credit, and generally on such terms and in such manner as he shall deem best or suitable, having regard to the objects of these presents.\nI cannot think that this clause necessarily invalidates this deed. Would any prudent man convey his property for the benefit of his wife or child and require that the property should, on sale, be sold for cash? Is it not for the benefit of the estate and of the creditors that the trustee should have this discretionary power, which he can only exercise in good faith and having due regard to the object of the conveyance. Every trust deed for sale is upon the implied condition that the trustees will use all reasonable diligence to obtain the best price, and that in the execution of the trust they will pay equal and fair attention to the interests of all persons concerned. If they fail in reasonable diligence; if they contract under circumstances of haste or improvidence; if they make a sale to advance the purpose of one party interested at the expense of another, or in contravention of the fair and honest object of the deed, they would be amenable to the law. So far from this power, honestly and fairly acted upon, defeating or delaying creditors, it might be the means of enabling the trustee to realize on the property, when compelling him to sell for cash might not only delay creditors for want of cash purchasers, but defeat creditors by causing the property to be sacrificed for less than its value by selling for cash when a sale on credit would enable its fair value to be obtained. Assuming the transaction to be bon\u00e2 fide and the trustee honest, I think the insertion of such a clause can be looked on in no other light than a prudent precaution to enable the property to be realized to the best advantage for the benefit of the creditors.\nI desire by no means to be understood as saying that such a clause as this, taken in connection with other circumstances, may not be matter proper to be considered in determining the intention and effect of the deed as bearing on the rights of creditors; but in this case no fraud in fact is attempted to be shown; and, I think, this deed, so far from exhibiting on its face a fraudulent intention of defeating or defrauding creditors, exhibits an honest intention by the debtor of appropriating his property to be distributed for the benefit alike of all his creditors, and as Lord Ellenborough remarked of the assignment in Pickstock v. Lyster[29] so it may be said truthfully of this: \u201csuch an assignment is to be referred to an act of duty rather than of fraud, when no fraud is proved, The act arises out of a discharge of the moral duties attached to the character of the debtor, to make the fund (here the property) available for the whole body of creditors;\u201d and as Bayley, J., says:\nThis conveyance so far from being fraudulent was the most honest act the party could do. He felt he had not sufficient to satisfy all his debts, in the absence of a bankrupt law, he proposes to distribute his property in liquidation of them, and so prevent one execution creditor from sweeping away, (as this execution creditor proposes doing,) the whole to be detriment of his co-creditors.\u201d\nAnd in this case it would be most unreasonable to set aside this deed, made for the equal benefit of all the creditors, at the instance of this judgment creditor, and allow him to come in and sweep the whole property into his own pocket. In this case no inference whatever can be drawn that this assignment was intended to defeat or delay creditors and therefore void. The property, it is admitted, is insufficient to pay the creditors in full; there can therefore be no resulting trust for the benefit of the debtor, except a benefit can enure to the debtor and his creditors from realizing as much as possible and as soon as possible from the property. \u2018There are no reservations to the debtor, no exclusion of creditors who do not comply with certain conditions,; and no release insisted on by the debtor; all the property is devoted to the payment of the creditors, and in the realization of it no other discretion is vested in the trustee than that which every prudent owner desiring to realize the largest amount would exercise. The clause complained of under these circumstances was but to enable the property to be made available in the most judicious manner, for the benefit of the creditors, by not compelling the trustee to sacrifice the property for cash when a much more judicious and profitable disposal might be made by selling on credit, whereby the fair value of the property might be obtained, when by selling for cash there would be a ruinous loss, such as too often results from a forced cash sale, or by delaying creditors by keeping the property on hand till a suitable cash purchaser could be found, when a fair sale on reasonable credit could be readily effected. This amounts to no more in effect than giving a trustee power to sell in such manner as he may think proper, and we have the case of Boldero et al. v. The London and Westminster Loan & Discount Co., limited[30], where such a deed was held not to be void under the 13 Eliz., ch. 5.\nDebtors in insolvent circumstances executed a deed by which they conveyed ail their estate to trustees on trust to sell in such manner as they might think proper, and to divide the residue of the proceeds, after paying expenses, rateably among the creditors, parties to the deed, and, if the trustees thought fit, creditors who refused or neglected to execute, and, if the trustees thought proper, but not otherwise, to pay the dividends on debts due to non-assenting creditors to the debtors. The deed provided for the payment of maintenance to the debtors, if the trustees thought fit, and the executing creditors respectively indemnified the debtors and the trustees in respect of the bills of exchange and promissory notes made or endorsed to them respectively by the debtors in respect of the schedule debts:\u2014and Pollock, B. said:\nThe defendants further rely on the general tendency of the deed itself and argue that on the whole the deed sweeps away all that the creditors have to look to, and so defeats the claims of such of them as are not assenting. But we are here dealing, not with the Bankruptcy law but with the statute of Elizabeth, and without going back to older cases, as Lord Justice Giffard pointed out in Alton v. Harrison[31], the statute of Elizabeth does not touch the question of equal distribution of assets; this assignment, therefore, though it preferred certain creditors and tended to defeat the others might be good.\nIf such a deed as the one objected to in this case was held good, surely the one we are dealing with cannot be complained of.\nTo use the language of Ashhurst, J., in Estwick v. Cailland[32], \u201cit appears to be a fair transaction calculated to answer a fair and legal purpose by legal means. I can discover no evidence of fraud or design to defeat or delay creditors in any part of the transaction\u201d but the exact opposite.\nAll the other points were disposed of on the argument and satisfactorily in the court below.\nI am of opinion the appeal should be dismissed with costs. STRONG, J.:\u2014\nAt the argument, I had some doubt upon the point raised by this appeal, which subsequent consideration has however entirely removed. Pickstock v. Lyster[33] having shown that an assignment for the benefit of creditors generally was not avoided by the 13 Elizabeth, but was good against a particular execution creditor of the assignor, I think it must necessarily follow that every power or trust conferred upon the trustee for creditors which is for their benefit must also be valid. I cannot agree that a clause which invests such a trustee with a discretionary power, which so far from being necessarily prejudicial to the general body of creditors is actually essential to their protection, renders the assignment invalid merely because it \u201chinders and delays\u201d them. It is to be presumed that the trustee will do his duty, in other Words, that he will execute the trust in the interest of the creditors exclusively, and that he will not sell on credit unless it is for their benefit that he should do so. If he fails in his duty, or proposes to act in contravention of it his conduct can be controlled by a Court of Equity, who can also supersede him in the office of trustee.\nEvery argument adduced in support of the contention that such a clause as this necessarily makes an assignment fraudulent strikes at the doctrine of Pickstock v. Lyster, for so soon as it is once admitted that a particular creditor may lawfully be hindered or delayed by an assignment for the whole body of creditors, it necessarily follows that every reasonable and useful power for the protection of the whole body of creditors must also be valid. It would, therefore, be impossible to hold this deed void for the reasons assigned without impugning the authority of Pickstock v. Lyster, which I am not prepared to do. Whilst I thus hold as to the effect of such a clause as this in the abstract, I do not of course mean to say that a clause authorizing a sale on credit may not, coupled with other circumstances, lead to an inference of fraud which would invalidate the deed of assignment: all I mean to determine is, that by itself such a provision does not make the deed illegal. I am of opinion that this is the law under 13th Elizabeth, and that we need not seek the aid of the Provincial statute to enable us to reach such a decision.\nI am of opinion that the appeal must be dismissed with costs.\nFOURNIER, J., concurred.\nHENRY, J., stated that as no case of fraud or collusion had been made out, he was of opinion that the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nGWYNNE, J.:\u2014\nI concur in the opinion that this appeal should be dismissed.\nThe clause at the end of the second sec. of chap. 118 of the Revised Statutes of Ontario appears to me to have the effect of giving statutory recognition to a doctrine already well established by the decisions of the courts, viz.: that a deed of assignment made by a debtor for the purpose of paying and satisfying rateably and proportionably, and without preference or priority, all the creditors of such debtor their just debts, shall not be construed to be a deed made either to defeat or delay the creditors of such debtor, or to give one of such creditors a preference over another. Unless then there be something on the face of the deed which is assailed here as being void against creditors which ex necessitate rei has the effect of raising a presumption juris et de jure that the intention of the debtors in executing the deed was to defeat or delay their creditors in the sense in which such an act is prohibited by the statute\u2014for there is no suggestion that the deed gives to any creditor a preference over another\u2014the question of intent was one of pure fact to be passed upon by the jury who tried the issue, and the proper way of submitting that question to them would be to say, that if they should find the intent of the debtors in executing the deed was for the purpose of paying and satisfying rateably and proportionably and without preference or priority all the creditors of the defendants their just debts, they should find that it was not made with the faudulent intent which is prohibited, and that they should render their verdict for the plaintiff.\nThe words of the deed as affects the selling on credit in short substance are, that the trustee shall, as soon as conveniently may be, collect and get in all sums of money due to the debtors and sell the real and personal property assigned by auction or private contract as a whole or in portions for cash or on credit and generally on such terms and in such manner as he shall deem best or suitable having regard to the object of these presents; such object, as expressed in another part of the deed, being to pay and divide the proceeds among all the creditors of the grantors rateably and proportionably according to the amount of their respective claims.\nThis language, as it appears to me, merely expresses an intention that the trustee may at his discretion, sell for cash or on credit, accordingly as he shall deem best calculated in the interest of the creditors, to realize the largest amount for general distribution among them rateably and proportionably, according to the amount of their respective claims.\nTo hold that this clause in the deed operates so as to compel the court to hold as an incontrovertible conclu- sion of law that the deed was not made and executed as in its terms it professes to be for the purpose of paying and satisfying rateably and proportionably all the creditors of the debtors their just debts, but was made and executed with intent to defeat and delay such creditors, appears to me to involve a manifest perversion of the plain language of the deed, and such a construction of the clause in question is not warranted by any decision in the English Courts, or in those of the Province of Ontario, from which this appeal comes, and there is in my judgment nothing in it which so recommends it as to justify us in making a precedent by its adoption. If it be said that the clause in question, although not operating as such a conclusion of law, at least affords evidence of the deed having been executed with an intent to defeat and delay creditors, and not for the purpose of paying and satisfying the creditors their just debts rateably and proportionably, and for that reason was proper to have been submitted to the jury to be taken into consideration by them, the answer is, that such a point should have been made at the trial, and not for the first time, as it was here, in the Court of Appeal for Ontario in the argument of the counsel for the appellant in his reply. And as the jury have rendered a verdict for the plaintiff, they must on this appeal be taken to have found as matter of fact that the deed was not executed with intent to defeat and delay creditors, but was executed for the purpose of paying and satisfying them their just debts rateably and proportionably.\nUnless there be something on the face of the deed which in law nullifies and avoids it, the verdict of the jury in maintaining its validity must be upheld. Upon this appeal nothing as it appears to me is open to the appellant to contend font the points contained in his motion in the Common Fleas Division of the High Court of Justice for Ontario for a rule for a non-suit or judgment to be entered for the defendant, the judgment of which Court refusing such rule, sustained by Court of Appeal for Ontario, is what is before us, and I am of opinion that the verdict of the jury should be upheld, and that the rule moved for was properly refused.\nI have, however, carefully perused the judgments in the case of Nicholson v. Leavitt, so much relied upon by the learned counsel for the appellant, as it was decided in the Court of Appeals for the State of New York, as reported in 6 N.Y.R. 510, and also the same case as decided in the Superior Court of that State and reported in 4 Sandf. 254. The Court of Appeals when reversing the judgment of the Superior Court seem to me to rest their judgment in a great degree upon a proposition which they lay down, to the effect that a debtor might with equal justice prescribe any period of credit which to him should seem fit, as that which the trustee should give upon sales of property assigned to him, as assume to vest in him a discretion to sell upon credit, if such a mode of selling should seem reasonable and proper and in the best interests of the creditors.\nWith the utmost respect for the high authority of the Court of Appeals for the State of New York, this seems to me to be equivalent to saying, that to express an intent of vesting in the trustee authority and permission to exercise his best judgment by selling on credit, if such mode of disposing of the property should seem to be in the interest of the creditors, whose trustee he is made, and to express an intent of divesting such trustee of all such authority and to prescribe to him a rigid unalterable course, which, in the discharge of his trust, he must pursue against the dictates of his own judgment, and against the will of the creditors whose trus- tee he is made, are one and the same thing. There are other parts of the reasoning upon which this judgment is rested which seem to me to lead to the conclusion that delaying a creditor in obtaining satisfaction of his debt by the particular process of execution in a suit at law is equally a defeating and delaying of him within the prohibition of the statute as the vesting the trustee with authority in his discretion to sell upon credit, if such would be a reasonable and proper course to pursue in the interest of the creditors, would be, and that the former is not within the prohibition of the statute is established in our courts beyond all controversy.\nUpon the whole, therefore, after a careful perusal of both judgments, I must say that that of the Superior Court is, in my opinion, based upon much sounder reasoning, and is more reconcilable with the English authorities than is that of the Court of Appeals, and I think it to be a sound rule to lay down as governing all cases like the present, that an assignment of property by an insolvent debtor can never be declared void under the statute in question here, if in the opinion of the tribunal for determining matters of fact in each case, the actual intent of the debtor, as matter of fact, in executing the deed was, as the jury must be taken to have found to be the fact in this case, to provide for the payment and satisfaction of the creditors of the debtor rateably and proportionably without preference or priority according to the amount of their respective claims; and, in my opinion, the mere fact that the deed contains a clause authorizing the trustee in his discretion to sell the property assigned, or any part of it, on credit, if such a mode of selling it should seem reasonable and proper and in the interest of the creditors, does not justify as a conclusion of law an adjudication that the grantor\u2019s intent in executing the deed was not to provide for such payment, but on the contrary, in violation of the provisions of the statute in that behalf, was to defeat and delay his creditors.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellant: Gibbons, McNab & Mulkern.\nSolicitors for respondent: Foster, Clarke & Bowes.\n[1] 8 Ont.

grant\u2014Plan\u2014Evidence\u2014Boundaries\u2014Deseription\u2014Riparian proprietor\u2014Diversion of water.\nOne piece of land cannot be said to be burdenedby an easement in favor of another piece when both belong absolutely to the same owner, who has, in the exercise of his own unrestricted right of enjoyment, the power of using both as he thinks lit and of making the use of one parcel subservient to that of the other, if he chooses so to do,\u2014and if the title to different parcels comes to be vested in the same owner, there is an extinguishment of any easements which may previously have existed, a species of merger by which what may have been, whilst the different parcels were in separate hands, legal easements, cease to be so, and become mere easements in fact\u2014quasi easements.\nIf the quasi servient tenement is subsequently first conveyed without expressly providing for the continuance of the easements, there is no implied reservation for the benefit of the land retained by the grantor, except of easements of necessity, and no distinction is to be made for this purpose between easements which are apparent and those which are non\u2011apparent\nIf the dominant tenement is first granted, all quasi easements which have been enjoyed as appendant to it over a quasi servient tenement retained by the grantor, pass by

River Maitland, the boundary of said Block on the river side being high water-mark.\nHeld,\u2014That the lateral or riparian contact of the land with the water would suffice to entitle the appellant to object to any unauthorized interference with the flow of the river in its natural state.\nIn 1859 the then owners of part of the lands in question had a plan prepared and registered, and in 1871 they conveyed a parcel which they described as Block F.\nHeld,\u2014That it must be presumed they intended to convey the same parcel of land shown on said plan as Block F with the same natural boundaries as those thereon indicated.\nThe evidence of professional draughtsmen was properly admitted to show what, according to the general practice and usage of draughtsmen in preparing plans, certain shadings and marks on said plan were intended to indicate.\nWhen a close or parcel of land is granted by a specific name, and it can be shown what are the boundaries of such close or parcel, the governing part of the description is the specific name, and the whole parcel will pass, even though to the general description there is superadded a particular description by metes and bounds, or by a plan which does not show the whole contents of the land as included in the designation by which it is known.\nAPPEAL by the above named appellant (defendant) from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, dated the 29th June, A.D. 1882, affirming a decree pronounced in the Court of Chancery for Ontario, in favour of the respondent (plaintiff), on the 8th day of April, A.D. 1880, at the examination of witnesses and hearing at Goderich, before His Lordship Vice-Chancellor Proudfoot.\nThe substance of the plaintiff\u2019s bill of complaint is, that upon the 4th day of July, 1859, the Buffalo & Lake Huron Railway Company, being the owners of certain lands upon both sides of the river Maitland, demised a part thereof to the plaintiff by an indenture of lease of that date, whereby it was witnessed that for the several considerations therein expressed, the said company did demise to the plaintiff, and did agree to sell to him the lands and premises following, situate in the town of Goderich:\nA mill site on the river Maitland, also the easement and privilege of constructing and maintaining a dam upon and across the said river so high as to take up eight feet of the fall of the said river, but no more, also the easement and privilege of constructing and maintaining a sufficient head race from the said intended dam to the said mill site,also the easement and privilege of a roadway leading through the lands of the said company from the said mill site to the boundary of the lands of the said company in the direction of North street, also the easement and privilege of constructing a switch from the said mill site to the main line of the said railway of the company near Goderich Harbour, in so far as the same shall run on, over, or through the lands of the said company, which said lands, &c.., are more particularly described and pointed out on a plan thereof to be annexed, and in the following description, that is to say\u2014Description of mill-race: Commencing at a point on the southerly edge of the channel, known as the Blind Channel, and forming part of the river Maitland, the aforesaid point being due West 295 feet from a point in the centre line of North street, produced at the distance of 2,314 feet from the flagstaff on the centre of the courthouse; thence due north 9 \u00b0 50\u2019, 199 feet to an angle; thence due north 50\u00b0 7\u2019 east, 279 feet 5 inches to an angle; thence due north 32\u2019 minutes east, 291 feet 2 inches to an angle; thence due north 34\u00b0 46\u2019 east, 259 feet 6 inches to an angle $ thence due north 13\u00b0 31\u2019 east, 495 feet 4 inches to an angle; thence due north 49\u00b0 25\u2019 east, 103 feet 7 inches to an angle; thence due north 60\u00b0 2\u2019 east 110 feet 8 inches to an angle; thence due north 79\u00b0 18\u2019 30\u201d east 319 feet 3 inches, more or less, to the head gates of the race; thence easterly across the head gates 107 feet, more or less, to the high water-mark caused by a dam giving a head of 8 feet of water at the mill; thence westerly and southerly along that high water-mark on the easterly side of the mill-race following the various windings of the high-water mark aforesaid on the natural bank adjoining the said race to the northerly limit of the railway embankment; thence south westerly along that limit to its intersection with the blind channel of the river Maitland; thence north easterly along the southerly edge of the blind channel aforesaid, following its several windings to the place of beginning.\nThen follows a description of the mill site as follows:\u2014\nCommencing at a point on the easterly edge of the mill race, which point is 320 feet on a course due north 50\u00b07\u2019 east from a point in the production of the centre line of North street northerly 2,559 feet from the flag staff on the centre of the court house in the town of Goderich; thence due north 50\u00b07\u2019 east 260 feet to an angle; thence due north 39\u00b0 53\u2019 west 333 feet to an angle on the edge of the mill race in a southerly direction, following the various windings thereof to the place of beginning, the whole containing an area of one acre: To have and to hold the said, demised lands, &c.., and premises unto the plaintiff, his executors, administrators and assigns for and during and unto the full end and term of seven years to commence and be computed from the day the flouring mill intended to be erected on the said mill site shall have commenced working, but in any event from the 1st day of May next ensuing the date of the said indenture of lease. Yielding and paying therefor yearly and every year of the said term of seven years, the clear yearly rent or sum of $100 by equal half yearly payments of $50 each, to fall due and be payable at the beginning and middle of each year.\nAnd it was by the said indenture declared and agreed that the plaintiff, his heirs, executors or assigns should, between the day of the date of the said indenture and the 1st day of May next ensuing, at his or their own proper cost, charge and expense, put up, erect, build and construct a flouring mill on the said mill site with all necessary works, easements, and appurtenances, and during the said term thereby granted at his or their own proper costs and charges, construct, build and maintain the said dam, mill and all and singular other the works, easements and appurtenances without any charge whatever to the said company; and that notwithstanding anything in the said indenture contained, the said company should retain and possess absolute and unconditional power and control over the said river and the waters thereof above the backwater caused by the said dam so to be erected by the plaintiff as aforesaid, and also below the said mill site, and should also have the right of using the said river and the waters thereof for machinery or water purposes, or otherwise, as the said company should think fit, however not wasting the water of the said river below the said head race, but having the right of operating such water in the dam or head race of the said plaintiff as to the said company should seem fit: Provided further that the said plaintiff, his heirs, &c.., should have the right to purchase the said demised premises at and for the sum of $5,000, at any time during the continuance of the said term, upon giving to the said company six months\u2019 notice thereof in writing to end before or at the time of the expiration of the term thereby granted; and that if he or they should not elect so to purchase, he or they should, at the expirration of the said term, have the privilege of re-renting the same demised premises for a further term of three years by giving six months notice thereof to end before or along with the said term of seven years at and for the annual rent which would be equivalent to the interest at six per cent. per annum on the said $5,000 to be paid half-yearly at the times thereinbefore provided for payment of rent during the said term of seven years, with liberty to him or them to purchase the said redemised premises during the said second term on the same terms and conditions as above provided, with respect to purchasing during the said first term, but that in case the said plaintiff, his heirs, etc., should not at the expiration of the term or terms aforesaid, purchase the said demised premises, all the erections, improvements and fixtures thereon erected, put and placed during the continuance of the said terms, should belong to, and form part of the said lands and freehold, and at the expiration of the said term or terms, as the case might be, or sooner determination of the term by the said indenture granted, revert to and become the absolute property of the said company.\nThe bill then avers that the plaintiff was let into possession of the said premises by the said company, and that he and his assigns have ever since been in uninterrupted possession and enjoyment of the said lands and of the said easements and privileges, including the easement and privilege of erecting and maintaining a dam across the said river so high as to take up 8 feet of the fall of the said river, but no more, also of the easement and privilege of constructing and maintaining a sufficient head-race from the said intended dam to the mill site, and that soon after the plaintiff had acquired the said property, he commenced in the year 1859 making extensive improvements thereon, and built a large flour and grist mill and salt manufactory thereon, and that he and the successive owners thereof spent large sums of money in order to render them available for the purposes for which they were purchased, and in constructing and maintaining the head of eight feet of water for the said mills and works, and that at the time the plaintiff procured the said lease of the said lands and easements with the right of purchase from the Buffalo & Lake Huron Railway Company, and for a long time prior thereto, and ever since the waters of the said river reached the plaintiff\u2019s mill-race and dam by a channel which branched off from the main channel of the river within a short distance of the bridge across the said river; and that in the year 1861 the plaintiff cleared out the said channel at considerable expense and built a dam near the said bridge and thereby caused the water to flow through the said channel in a sufficient volume to produce the head of eight feet to which he was entitled. And the bill charged that the plaintiff was entitled to maintain that dam, and to have the said channel kept in its accustomed condition, and to have the water to flow therein to the plaintiffs mill And the bill alleged further, that the plaintiff expended the sum of $12,000, or thereabouts, in improving, constructing and perfecting a race-way from the said channel to his mill; and that the plaintiff and the successive owners have been in uninterrupted possession and enjoyment of the said channel and raceway for the purposes of the said mills and other works since the year 1861, and until destroyed on the 11th day of February, 1880, when the defendant, with a number of men and horses employed by him, commenced, without any right or authority, and in violation of the plaintiffs rights, to fill up with timber, planks, earth, and stones, the mouth of the said channel, through which the waters of the said river flowed to the plaintiffs said mill, and on the 12th day of February, 1880, the said laborers of the defendant, acting under his instructions, unlawfully and in violation of the plaintiff\u2019s rights, pulled down the dam so erected by the plaintiff for the purpose aforesaid, and used the stone and gravel from the said dam in blocking up the said channel, therewith forming a permanent impediment to the flow of the water through the said channel.\nThe bill further alleged that while the plaintiff was in possession as aforesaid, he, with the concurrence of the Buffalo & Lake Huron Railway Co., by an indenture dated the 9th of November, 1866, assigned the said lands and premises to one Alex. T. Paterson, and that afterwards, by an indenture of bargain and sale, bearing date the 3rd day of February, 1873, the said lands in pursuance of the said contract were conveyed to the said Paterson in fee simple by the G.T. Ry. Co. of Canada, who had acquired all the property and rights of the Buffalo & Lake Huron Railway Co., and that Paterson, by an indenture dated the 22nd of August, 1873, conveyed to one Tew, who, by an indenture of the 4th of December, 1875, conveyed the same to the plaintiff together with said easements and privileges; and that the successive owners, under the said respective deeds, respectively entered into the actual possession of the said lands, easements and privileges, and actually enjoyed the same; and that the said several deeds are all registered in the registry office of the county of Huron, in which said lands are situate. And the bill prayed that the defendant might be perpetually restrained by the order and injunction of the Court of Chancery from keeping the said channel blocked up and from in any way interfering with the flow of water therein, and for an account of the damage sustained by the plaintiff by reason of the said conduct of the defendant.\nTo this bill the defendant filed a long answer, in which he sets up his right to do the acts complained of at the places stated in the bill; and therein he denies the plaintiff\u2019s right to the easement as claimed by him. The short material substance of his answer is, that the defendant, is seised in fee of a piece of land situate on one side of the river Maitland, and abutting thereon, and known as part of block F, in the northerly part of the town of Goderich, and of a piece of land opposite thereto, on the other side of the river Maitland, called the Great Meadow, situate in the township of Colborne, and that in virtue of such seisin he is seised of the bed of the river at the place where the said dam was situate; and that in virtue of such seisin he did the acts complained of, as he insists he lawfully might, for the reason that, as he alleges, the said dam was wrongfully erected on lands whereof he was seised in fee, and wrongfully obstructed the flow of the waters of the river in their natural course past the defendant\u2019s said land and another piece of land lower down the said river, called block A, whereof the defendant is also seised in fee; and the defendant alleges and insists that the acts and conduct of the plaintiff in erecting the said dam and in excavating the channel, which is situate on land whereof the defendant alleges that he is seised in fee, being part of the piece of land called block F, and in drawing off the waters of the river through the said channel from above the said dam, were unauthorized acts of trespass committed by the plaintiff without the authority of the then owners of the soil where the same were committed, and that in fact the plaintiff had no right whatever to the easement and privilege as claimed by him of maintaining the said dam and the channel leading therefrom as excavated by him, either by grant or prescription, although title by the latter mode is not asserted in the bill, but title by grant only is. The defendant closes his answer by praying by way of cross relief against the plaintiff that he may be ordered to remove the said dam near the said bridge as an unlawful obstruction in the said river, and that he may be restrained from continuing the use of the said artificial channel through the portion of block F, whereof the defendant is seised in fee, and from otherwise diverting or interfering with the natural flow of the river in its proper and natural channel past and along the lands on the north and south banks of the said river, whereof the defendant is seised in fee.\nThe following description of the locus will be better understood with the aid of the sketch on the next page.\nThe river Maitland flows westward into Lake Huron, into which it empties about half a mile to the west of respondent\u2019s mill. Maitland bridge is situated about half a mile to the eastward of the mill. The river is not navigable. Its north bank, from the bridge to the lake, is composed of the parcel of land called \u201cThe Great Meadow,\u201d which begins at the bridge and runs westerly along the river until it meets block \u201cA,\u201d which forms the remainder of the bank to the lake. Beginning again at the bridge, and running westerly along the south bank, it is comprised of blocks \u201cF\u201d and \u201cE,\u201d which carries us below or to the westward of the lands and easements in dispute.\nThe river forms the boundary between the township of Colborne, on the north, and the town of Goderich on the south. The respondent\u2019s mill and the so-called channel in dispute are upon the south bank in the town of Goderich. The dam is across the main channel of the river, near the bridge. In the river, but nearest the Colborne shore, is an island called \u201cC.\u201d The appellant, at the time the alleged wrongful acts complained of were committed, was the owner, in fee simple, of said block \u201cA,\u201d \u201cThe Great Meadow\u201d and island \u201cC,\u201d in the township of Colborne, and of blocks \u201cE\u201d and \u201cF\u201d in the town of Goderich, except such portions thereof as the respondent was entitled to.\nThe town of Goderich is built upon a plateau, about 100 feet above the river. Descending towards the river, a second plateau, some 30 or 40 feet above the river, is reached. This is block \u201cF.\u201d To the westward, and on a lower level by several feet, is block \u201cE.\u201d Between blocks \u201cE\u201d and \u201cF\u201d there was originally a dry or blind channel of the river, forming a natural boundary. This has been enlarged and deepened, and in the accompanying sketch is called \u201cMill Pond.\u201d In the description by metes and bounds, in respondent\u2019s title, it is called \u201cMill Race.\u201d The banks of block \u201cF\u201d are precipitous towards the river. Towards its easterly end and down stream for about 100 yards after descending to nearly the level of the river, there is a small shoal or flat before the actual waters of the river, in the main channel, are reached. This shoal or flat is of varying width, but not exceeding at any point 100 feet. To the westward, after passing this shoal or flat, the waters of the river formerly washed the high and almost precipitous banks of the upper table-land composing block \u201cF\u201d down to the limits of block \u201cE.\u201d\nIn 1859, when the respondent\u2019s title began, the south bank of the river was a forest. No mill had ever been built, nor dam nor race-way constructed, but the whole was in a state of nature. The respondent\u2019s lessors, the railway company, then owned blocks \u201cE\u201d and \u201cF,\u201d and island \u201cC,\u201d and \u201cThe Great Meadow,\u201d and the bed of the river, but they never owned block \u201cA,\u201d nor did they ever own the land forming the north bank of the river above the bridge, although they owned block \u201cD,\u201d upon the south bank.\nThe material portions of the titles of the plaintiff and defendant to the various properties may be briefly set out.\nThe plaintiff\u2019s title is as follows:\u2014\n1. The lease of the 4th July, 1859, from the Buffalo & Lake Huron Railway Company hereinbefore fully set out.\n2. Deed, dated the 11th July, 1864, executed by plaintiff Platt, authorizing Alexander Thomas Patterson to receive a deed from the Buffalo & Lake Huron Railway Company.\n3. Assignment of lease, dated 1st October, 1864, by Platt to Patterson, assigning lease of 4th July, 1859.\n4. Lease dated 9th November, 1866, between the Buffalo & Lake Huron Railway Company, of the first part, Platt, of the second part, and Patterson of the third part. After reciting that the original lease had been assigned by Platt to Patterson in trust by way of collateral security, the railway company demised the premises described in the original lease to Patterson for a new term of three years from the 1st day of May, 1867, and it was thereby agreed that \u201cthe demise thereby granted and the rights and liabilities of the party of the third part thereunder, should in all respects be subject and according to all the provisions, promises, covenants, stipulations, conditions, limitations and agreements contained in the original lease, including the right to purchase the demised premises within the term of three years, (as in the lease mentioned) excepting the right of renewal.\u201d 5. Deed dated the 3rd February, 1873, The Grand Trunk Railway Company of Canada to Alexander T. Patterson. This recites that \u201cwhereas the Buffalo & Lake Huron Railway Company did sell to one Samuel Platt, etc., certain lands hereinafter described, and whereas the said Platt did transfer all his rights in and to said lands to the party of the second part, who is now at the execution hereof to pay the purchase money and interest now unpaid, and who desires the conveyance for the said lands to be made to him, and whereas by the statute 33 Vic. ch. 49, of the Parliament of Canada, and the agreement therein referred to, the title to the said lands is now vested in the Grand Trunk Railway Company of Canada\u201d and then proceeds to grant to the party of the second part, his heirs and assigns, in consideration of the sum of $5,700, the same lands as in the original lease, by the same description, as far as the description of the mill site.

Davis, Esquire, provincial land surveyor, for William Warren Street and others, as an addition to the said town of Goderich, and as shown on the map or plan hereunto annexed, and which said parcels or tracts of land and premises may be more particularly known and described as follows; that is to say:\u2014Commencing at a point on the easterly limit of \u201c Saw Mill Road,\u201d said point being due S. 19 degrees W., 1 chain and 35 links from the south-westerly angle of the property known as the late John Galt\u2019s; thence due N. 67 degrees and 50 minutes E., 23 chains and 75 links, more or less, to the easterly limit of said lot number 39, and up to the property known as the said late John Galt\u2019s; thence due south 22 degrees and 10 minutes E., 4 chains and 60 links, more or less, to the high water mark of the river Maitland, thence southwesterly, following the high water mark of the river Maitland, a distance of 27 chains, more or less, to its intersection with the easterly limit of \u201cSaw Mill Road;\u201d thence north\u2011easterly along said limit of road, 5 chains, more or less, to the place of beginning. The whole containing an area of 9 acres, 3 roods, 1 perch, be the same more or less, as before stated.\u201d\nOn the 8th day of April, A.D. 1880, the case was heard before Proudfoot, V.C.\nAt the trial, the title of appellant to the lands comprising the north bank of the river was proved, and in fact not disputed. His title to blocks E and F, subject to the exceptions and reservations before mentioned, was also proved.\nAs the appellant, in his answer, admitted the commission of the alleged trespasses, he was called upon to begin; he did so, and after putting in his title deeds and the several maps in evidence, and calling two Provincial Land Surveyors to identify and locate upon the grounds the several parcels, the learned Vice-Chancellor held that he had established a, prim\u00e2 facie title, and the respondent was then called upon to prove his title.\nThis he proceeded to do, by putting in the original lease to him, the renewal lease, the conveyance to Patterson, and the several mesne conveyances to him.\nUnder these he claimed title by express grant, or failing that, then by implication.\nHe also set up a title to the use of the easements in question by prescription, upon which evidence was given by a number of witnesses, and a further title by license from and acquiescence by the railway company, the common grantor.\nHe further contended that block F did not extend to the river, or that if \u201cit did the appellant\u2019s title was limited to that part colored pink, attached to the conveyance to Ross, appellant\u2019s predecessor in title, and that such part colored pink did not include the land covered by the raceway or channel in question.\nHe further claimed that with repect to the appellant\u2019s ownership of the parcels called The Great Meadow and Island C on the north bank, that the easements in question having been open, apparent and continuous, when the conveyance by the common grantor was made in 1871, were impliedly reserved, and that the Registry Act had no application.\nAs against block A he claimed title by prescription.\nThe learned Vice-Chancellor delivered his judgment, finding that block F extended to the river; that appellant was the owner of it to the river; that the channel in question was therefore upon appellant\u2019s lands; that such channel was artificial; that there was no title by prescription made out, but that respondent had acquired a right under the several leases and conveyances to him, \u201c and under the subsequent dealings between him and the railway company,\u201d to the easements in question as against the appellant. He made no mention in his judgment of the appellant\u2019s rights as owner of the lands on the north bank.\nFrom the learned Vice-Chancellor\u2019s decision the appellant appealed to the Court of Appeal, and that court, after two arguments, unanimously dismissed his appeal with costs.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by their Lordships Mr. Justice Burton and Mr. Justice Patterson. From the judgment of the Court of Appeal the defendant appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nMr. Garrow for appellant:\u2014\nThe appellant claims to be the owner of the locus in quo, the soil of the raceway in question, by virtue of his ownership of block F.\nThe respondent makes no claim to the land. He only claims an easement. It, of course, is not decisive of his right to the easement of this raceway for the appellant to establish his ownership of the soil.\nThe title to the easement may remain untouched. Their lordships in appeal apparently overlooked this in their consideration of the boundaries on the river side of block F. The original lease only demised easements; the grant to Patterson is of easements (so far as the locus in quo is concerned), and respondent, in his bill of complaint, only claims easements.\nBut the appellant\u2019s right to put the respondent to proof of his title to these easements, in so far as his ownership of block F is concerned, depends upon his establishing that that block extends to the river, and thus embraces the soil of the raceway.\nThe appellant\u2019s rights as owner of the north bank stand upon a different footing. The easements claimed are a dam and race, by means of which the waters are diverted from the north bank as well as from the south bank.\nAs against the north bank, therefore, the respondent would in any event be bound to prove his title to these easements.\nIf, however, block F extends to the river, and the appellant is entitled to it to the river, and the respondent has not made out his title, there is an end of the case, and a consideration of the questions arising from the ownership by appellant of the north bank becomes unnecessary. The first question, therefore, is: What, as a matter of fact, is the northerly limit of block F?\nThe learned counsel went very fully into the evidence and submitted that block F was, at the time of the conveyance to Ross, a perfectly defined parcel, having for its northerly limit, from block E to the Maitland bridge, the main channel of the river Maitland, and that the finding of the Court of Appeal to the contrary is erroneous.\nAssuming that the previous proposition is established, the next question is: Did the conveyance to Ross grant to him block F to its northerly limit, the river? Again, without reference to the title to the easements claimed by respondent, it is submitted that this must be answered in the affirmative.\nThe learned counsel went fully into the evidence on this point.\nThe river, as a natural boundary of block F, should be preferred if any doubt:\u2014Angell on Watercourses[1]; Juson v. Reynolds[2].\nThe intention of the parties expressed in the conveyance must govern. White v. Bass[3]; Dodd v. Burchell[4]; Taylor v. Corporation of St Helens[5]; Gillen v. Hayes[6].\nThe right of the respondent to purchase was to have been exercised during the term, and time was of the essence, and until the right was exercised, the relationship of vendor and vendee did not exist. Ball v. Canada Co.[7]\nIf conveyance executed in pursuance and fulfilment of original contract, it must be construed as giving only the same rights as the original contract. Wood v. Saunders[8]. There having been no express reservation, the only ground upon which a reservation can rest is by implication. Goddard on Easements[9].\nHere the conveyance to Ross, was of the quasi servient tenement, the grantors retaining the quasi dominant tenement, and there was no reservation of the easements now claimed. Edinburgh Life Ass. Co. v. Barnhart[10]; Suffield v. Brown[11]; Wheeldon v. Burrows[12]; Allen v. Taylor[13].\nThe cases of Young v. Wilson[14], and Watts v. Kelson[15] are relied upon by respondent, as being at variance with the law as laid down in Suffield v. Brown, above cited.\nIn the former case Vice-Chancellor Proudfoot declined to follow the judgment of Lord Westbury in Suffield v. Brown, because the easement in question in that case was not apparent and continuous, as in Young v. Wilson[16]. On rehearing the Chancellor dissented from the the judgment of the court Vice-Chancellor Blake evidently felt himself constrained by, as he says, the weight of authority, to refuse to follow Suffield v. Brown, but he upheld the original judgment upon other grounds as well, in which also Vice-Chancellor Proudfoot concurred. Wheeldon v. Burrows had not then been decided, affirming, as it does, the judgment of Lord Westbury, not only so far as applicable to the class of easements in question in Suffield v. Brown, but as applicable to apparent and continuous easements, as in the present case, and as in the case itself of Wheeldon v. Burrows.\nIt is true that in Watts v. Kelson the Lords Justices, in the course of the argument, express themselves as satisfied with the case of Pyer v. Carter[17], but, as pointed out by the judges of the same court when considering these remarks in the latter case\u2019 of Wheeldon v. Burrows, there is nothing in the considered judgment in Waits v. Kelson affecting or weakening Lord Westbury\u2019s judgment in Suffield v. Brown.\nMoreover, Watts v. Kelson was a case of implied grant, not, as here and in Wheeldon v. Burrows, implied reservation, and quite different principles were therefore involved.\nIt is submitted, therefore, that the law must be taken to be as laid down in Wheeldon v. Burrows, and that, if so, it is conclusive against the implied reservation by the Grand Trunk Railway Co. of the easements in question on the sale and conveyance to Ross in June, 1871, of block F.\nAgain, assuming that the easements in question were reserved in the conveyance to Ross it is clear that they did not \u201cpass to Patterson by the subsequent conveyance in 1873, and in law they were thereby extinguished. After the conveyance to Ross they existed, if at all,\u2019 not as quasi but as real legal easements, with the usual legal incidents, one of which was, that it was essential to their maintenance that they should be appurtenant to a dominant tenement. Goddard on Easements.[18]\nAfter June, 1871, the only land owned by the railway company in the vicinity of the easements in question was the respondent\u2019s mill site. When that was finally granted to Patterson, without these easements being included, the servient tenement was relieved of their burden and they ceased to exist.\nThe appellant further contends that even if the courts should be of opinion that there was a reservation of the easements in question, as against block \u201cF,\u201d that there is clearly no room for such a conclusion in considering the several conveyances of the parcels on the north bank, viz., Island C, and The Great Meadow. Such conveyances are absolute in form and contain no reservation or exception whatever; and the foregoing argument against implied reservation applies with additional force in considering the title to these parcels.\nBy means of the dam and race claimed by respondent there was a diversion of the water of the rivers from the main channel which affected Island C, The Great Meadow and Block A upon the north bank.\nThe appellant submits that there is no room upon the facts for the application of the principle of \u201creasonable user,\u201d as suggested by Mr. Justice Burton in his judgment, and for which he cited Embry v. Owen[19].\nThat was a case of the extent of the right of a person having an undoubted title in respect of which the right was exercised, a right to abstract running water for the purposes of irrigation.\nHere we say the respondent has no title whatever, upon which to base his alleged right to use the water as he does, and where he does.\nEven if he has the right as against the south bank that is insufficient. He must possess a title as against both banks, otherwise he has no right to maintain the dam to divert the water, or even to maintain the artificial race, constructed in the bed of the river, without the dam such a construction, even if it did not, as it does, divert the waters out of their ordinary channel is an unlawful encroachment upon the alveus and actionable, without showing special damages\nBickett v. Morris[20]; Lord Norbury v. Kitchen[21]; Kirchoffer v. Stanbury[22]; McArthur v. Gilles[23]; Penn- ington v. Brinsop Hall Coal Co.[24]; Holker v. Porritt[25]; Clowes v. Staffordshire Potteries Co.[26]; Angell on Watercourses[27]; Goddard on Easements[28].\nThe question is, has the respondent a right to divert at all. If he has such right we do not claim that he has used it excessively. Our contention is, that he has no right or title to the easements he claims, and therefore no right to divert at all.\nThis confines the question to whether he has proved his alleged title as he was bound to do, a question evidently not considered, but assumed in the Court of Appeal,\nThere is equally little support for the supposed dilemma into which Mr. Justice Patterson suggests the appellant may be forced, i.e., that of contesting the respondent\u2019s title, under his title deeds, at the peril, if it should be found that they do not cover the locus in quo, of its being held that respondent\u2019s trespass, in constructing the race and dam in question, amounted to a taking possession of the land itself, and that he had therefore acquired a title by prescription, the limit being ten years in that case, while in the case of easements it is twenty.\nIt ought to be sufficient answer to this to say that the respondent in his bill only claims casements.\nBut further, until the conveyance to Patterson in 1873, he was only a tenant to the R.R. Co., and therefore by his encroachments for the benefit of the demised premises was acquiring no title as against them. Earl of Lisburn v. Davies[29]; Whitmore v. Humphries[30].\nUntil June, 1871, the R.R. Co owned the whole.\nThe bill of complaint was filed on the 26th February, 1880. So that in no possible view of the matter could any title by prescription to the locus in quo be sustained, even if the date of its origin would be taken to be when the several tenements were severed\nThen, has respondent acquired a prescriptive right to divert the water, as against block A, owned by appellant?\nThe title to this block was not derived from the railway company, and the respondent\u2019s only title therefore must be by prescription.\nIn the judgments of their lordships in the Court of Appeal it is apparently taken for granted that respondent has such title, or, at least it is stated briefly that the evidence clearly shows that he has such a title.\nThe first answer to this alleged right is that it is no part of the case made by the respondent in his bill of complaint. The appellant, in his answer, sets up his rights as owner of block A. The respondent did not amend his bill claiming a prescriptive right as against that block. He simply joined issue. The appellant was therefore only bound to prove his title, which he did.\nThe second answer is, that the evidence does not show that the respondent has such prescriptive right, but shows the contrary.\nIf, on the pleadings, the point was open to respondent, the burden of proof was, of course, clearly upon him.\nHe was bound to prove and has failed to prove that he had, for a period of twenty years prior to the interruption by appellant, enjoyed, as of right, easements the same in extent and character as those with which appellant interfered. Bealey v. Shaw[31]; Ruttan v. Winans[32]; Hunt v. Hespeler[33]; McKechnie v. McKeyes[34]. The learned counsel went fully into the facts bearing on this point\nMr. Maclennan, Q.C., and Mr. M.G. Cameron, for respondent:\nIn answer to the first contention, viz., that the channel in dispute is upon appellant\u2019s land, the respondent contends that such is not the case.\nCounsel for respondent went fully into the maps, descriptions and evidence on this point.\nIn answer to the second contention of the appellant, viz., that as owner of the lands on the north side of the river, called the Big Meadow, Island C and block A, his riparian rights are injuriously affected by the diversion of the water into the raceway of the respondent near the Maitland bridge, the respondent contends: That there is no evidence of diversion, and that the evidence is the other way. As to the Big Meadow and Island C, the appellant\u2019s title comes through persons who purchased from the railway company on the 3rd of June, 1871, and block F and the respondent\u2019s lands and easements were also purchased from the same company; the Big Meadow and Island C, having been purchased at a date subsequent to the grant by the railway company to respondent, of the right to the easement to use the water, as he is now using it, the appellant cannot stand in any better position than the railway company, who owning, as they did, the lands on both sides of the river, and the bed of the stream, had a right to divert the water from the Big Meadow and Island C.\nAs to block A the appellant\u2019s deed carries his land only to high water mark, so that it is only when the river is at its highest point that he has any riparian rights whatever, and the evidence shows that when the water is high there is no diversion at all by the plaintiff, and no occasion for it; the plaintiff\u2019s dam and raceway are then overflowing, and there is no evidence of diversion affecting block A at any time.\nIf there is any diversion, which we deny, it is quite clear from the evidence that respondent has established a prescriptive right so to divert it.\nThe evidence is undisputed, that whatever diversion there was began in 1859 and continued for more than 20 years, up to the time of the obstruction by the appellant.\nIt is also clear from the evidence that about Christmas, 1859, the respondent made the dam of loose stones across the river, near the bridge thrown down by the appellant, and that he had maintained that dam there ever since, and from that time the water has flowed through the channel in dispute to his milk, and they were driven thereby, and have been driven thereby, without interruption, up to the date of the obstruction by the appellant.\nThe respondent admits that the embankment as it exists at present, and within which the raceway is confined, was not completed throughout its whole extent until within 20 years, but we say that that cannot and does not impair respondent\u2019s title by prescription, because early in 1859 the respondent had dammed the river to its full breadth, including the present race\u2011way, and by letting the old dam go, and, instead thereon using the raceway within the embankment, and at the same time keeping the river dammed to its full breadth, as the respondent did, he merely narrowed \u2018 the limit over which he exercised his easement, and the respondent would not lose his prescriptive right because the dam was carried away, and rebuilt in the same or another place, if it was not altered or increased to the detriment of the owner of the servient tenement, the right claimed by respondent being to raise a dam so high as to take up eight feet of the fall of the river. There is no evidence to show that a greater burthen was thrown on the servient tenement by the alteration within 20 years. It was diminished, and the right by prescription is still good, though only to the extent to which it was reduced by the alteration. Harvey v. Walters[35]; Thomas v. Thomas[36]; Rex. v. Tippelt[37].\nThe right to a water course is not destroyed by an owner\u2019s altering the course of the stream. Hall v. Swift[38].\nThe alteration here was made long before the appellant or his grantor acquired any right whatever.\nAlteration in the condition or character of a dominant tenement, to extinguish an easement, must be of a nature and of a character which will inflict serious injury on the servient tenement, by increasing the burthen of the easement; and if the burthen is enlarged, and the user of the right totally changed from that originally contemplated by the grantor of the privilege, the easement will be extinguished. Goddard on Easements[39].\nThe respondent is in possession of the raceway in dispute in one of two ways: either by express grant from the railway company, or as a trespasser. If the has shown a clear title by prescription; if the latter, the appellant must also fail, because the respondent has been in possession, even according to appellant, who says he finished building the channel in 1865, over ten years, and has thus acquired a title as owner of the soil by the Statute of Limitations.\nThe respondent also claims the easement of constructing a dam in the river Maitland, so that he may obtain a head of 8 feet of water at his mills, by express grant, and the appellant, who claims under the railway company, is precluded from: asserting a right inconsis- tent with the existence and maintenance of the said dam and raceway. Hendry v. English[40]; The Rochdale Canal Co. v. King[41]; Goddard on Easements[42]; Edinburgh Life Assurance v. Barnhart[43]; Brewster v. The Canada Co.[44]\nThe license, although verbal, is sufficient, and is irrevocable, if coupled with a grant; or if the licensee, acting upon the permission granted, has executed a work of a permanent character, and has incurred expense in its execution. Nichol v. Tackabery[45]; Winter v. Brockwell[46]; Woods v. Leadbetter[47].\nThe evidence also clearly shows that at and long before the appellant, or those under whom he claims, purchased, the respondent openly and continuously used the dam and raceway in dispute, and, therefore, that he purchased subject to the easement of respondent.\nThe authorities show that when there is a continuous and apparent user, it is immaterial whether the dominant or servient tenement be first sold, and that a grant of the easement must be implied in favor of the dominant tenement. Young v. Wilson[48]; Richards v. Rose[49]; Penningtan v. Galland[50]; Ewart v. Cochrane[51]; Watts v. Kelson[52]; Shory v. Piggott[53]; Pyer v. Carter[54]; Dodd v. Burchell[55]; Wadsworth v. McDougall[56]; Diamond v. Reddick[57]; Hickman v. Lawson[58]; Watson v. Traughton[59]. The easement to which the respondent claims to be entitled is, in its nature, continuous. There is this \u201cclear distinction between easements, such as rights of way, or easements used from time to time, and easements of necessity, or continuous easements. The former do not pass unless the owner, by appropriate language, shows an intention that they should pass, but the latter will pass by implication of law without any words of grant. Polden v. Bastard[60].\nBut whatever might have been the result between the appellant and the railway company, if the matter had been between them, it is clear that the railway company could not sell, or the appellant acquire, the servient lands otherwise than subject to respondent\u2019s easements.\nIt is no answer to the respondent\u2019s claim to say that if the supply of water running through the race-way in question to the respondent\u2019s mill was cut off, possibly some other supply might be obtained. It is clear here that no supply of water equally convenient could have been obtained, and it is sufficient to show that. Watts v. Kelson[61]; Morris v. Edgington[62].\nThe case of Wheeldon v. Burrows is not an authority against respondent\u2019s contention, nor does it alter the law as laid down in Young v. Wilson. In the former case, the easement was not necessary to the reasonable enjoyment of the property granted, but one respecting lights, where no easement by implication would arise on the severance of the tenements.\nIt makes no difference whether the easement had a legal existence before the severance of the tenements. Gale on Easements[63]; Dart on Vendors and Purchasers[64]; Davies v. Sear[65]. Suffield v. Brown and Crossley & Sons v. Lightowler do not affect this case, as the easement there was neither apparent nor continuous, and not one of which the purchaser would necessarily have notice.\nThe rule under which a man is prevented from derogating from his own grant has no application to this case, except in favor of the respondent\nRITCHIE, C.J.: delivered judgment, stating in substance that he had come to the conclusion the plaintiff had failed to show title to the strip of land on which the head-race was made or to the easements in question; that in his opinion block F came to the river; and that, even if block F did not come to the river, the plaintiff had no right to maintain the obstruction at the stone dam, and so divert the water of the Maitland river from the Great Meadow, Island C, and block A.\nSTRONG, J.:\u2014\nIn considering this case it will be convenient in the first place to ascertain what (if any), on the 3rd June, 1871, the date of the several conveyances to Ross, McDonald & Smith, was the title of the respondent to the mill, lands and easements, now claimed by him, for it is manifest that the respondent can have no more extensive rights against the appellant deriving title from the railway company, through Ross and the other grantees mentioned, than he had against the railway company at the date referred to, except in so far as such rights were either expressly or by implication of law reserved to the railway company in the deeds mentioned, and were subsequently vested in Patterson under the deed of the 3rd February, 1873 By following this order it will be possible to disembarrass the case of several questions, relating to equitable acquiescence, prescription, and the Statute of Limitations, which have given rise to much controversy in the court below, but which are, as will be shown (with the exception of the single point of prescription, so far as it relates to one parcel of the appellants\u2019 land on the north bank of the river\u2014block A,) irrelevant to the decision of the present appeal.\nBy the original lease of the 4th of July, 1859, the mill site, lands and easements appendant to them were demised by the Buffalo and Lake Huron Railway Company to the respondent for the term of seven years from the 1st of May, 1860.\nThe lease contained a provision giving the lessee an option to purchase the fee in the demised premises, at any time during the currency of the lease, upon giving the lessors six months notice in writing to end before or at the expiration of the term, and also a covenant for renewal for the further term of three years, with liberty to the lessee, or his assigns, to purchase the re-demised premises during the second term, on the same terms and conditions as had been provided with respect to the purchase during the first term of seven years; and it also contained a clause in these words:\u2014\nIn case the said party of the secnd part shall not, at the expiration of the term or terms aforesaid, or sooner determination of these presents, purchase the said demised premises, all the erections, buildings, improvements and fixtures thereon erected, built, put and placed during the currency of the said term or terms, shall belong to and form part of the said lands and freehold, and at the expiration of the said term or terms, as the case may be, or sooner determination of these presents, revert to and become the absolute property of the said party of the first part.\nBy an indenture dated the 9th day of November, 1866, made between the Buffalo and Lake Huron Railway Company, of the first part, the respondent, of the second part, and A.T. Patterson, of the third part, after reciting that the original lease had been assigned by the respondent to Patterson, in trust by way of collateral security, the Railway Company demised the premises to Patterson for a new term of three years from the 1st day of May, 1867, and it was thereby agreed that \u201cthe demise thereby granted, and the rights and liabilities of the party of the third part thereunder should in all respects be subject and according to all the provisions, promises, covenants, stipulations, conditions, limitations and agreements contained in the original lease, including the right to purchase the demised premises within the term of three years (as in the lease mentioned) excepting the rights of renewal.\u201d The renewed term expired on the 1st of May, 1870. There is no evidence to show that the option of purchasing was exercised before the expiration of the term, or that the time for exercising it had been in any way extended. The respondent, it is true, remained in possession, but the mere fact of possession cannot be sufficient to shew that he ever elected to purchase, so as to create a contract between himself and the railway company. The right of purchase expired with the term, for it is clear, both upon principle and authority, that, in the case of all such unilateral stipulations, time is strictly regarded[66]; moreover, by the terms of the provision for purchase contained in the lease, time was made essential, for the right was conditional upon giving notice six months at least before the end of the term, so that, if the general law were not as it undoubtedly is, the parties must be held to have made time of the essence by the terms in which their agreement is expressed. It cannot, therefore, be open to doubt or question, that from the 1st May, 1870, when the term expired, until the 3rd June, 1871, when the several parcels, blocks E and F, Island C, and the Great Meadow, were respectively sold and conveyed by the Grand Trunk Railway Company (who had purchased from and acquired all the rights of the Buffalo and Lake Huron Railway Co.) to the parties under whom the appellant claims, the respondent was in possession as a mere tenant at sufferance, having no other right or title either at law or in equity. Upon the evidence this conclusion is inevitable, unless indeed we are, without proof, to make conjectures in favor of the respondent\u2019s case. It is out of the question to say that any presumption of an exercise of the option of purchase, or of its extension in point of time, or of the making of a new agreement for the purchase of the property, can, in the absence of all other proof, be inferred from the mere fact of the holding over after the time had expired; such possession can, I repeat be attributed only to a mere tenancy at sufferance. No doubt if it had been sufficiently proved that the railway company were bound by a contract of purchase, either under the terms of the lease, or by an agreement made independently of the leaser the fact of possession would have been sufficient constructive notice of the equitable rights of the respondent, to ail persons who subsequently purchased from the railway company, but this is the utmost effect which could be attributed to that fact. Therefore on the 3rd June, 1871, the date of the conveyance of the several parcels of which the appellant is now the owner in fee (with the exception of block A on the north bank of the river, which was not derived from the railway company, but was acquired by the respondent under a different title) the respondent had no title whatever, either as a lessee or as a purchaser, to this mill property, he was merely a person in possession, who had been a tenant, but whose title had expired, and who held over by the sufferance of his landlords. It is impossible, therefore, to ascribe the respondent\u2019s present title to any earlier date than that of the conveyance to his trustee, Patterson, on the 3rd February, 1873, and, as the appellant\u2019s title is derived under conveyances executed in June, 1871, the case must be considered as if the questions now in litigation had arisen between the appellant, or his immediate predecessors in title, and the railway company immediately after the latter date and before the conveyance to Patterson. In thus viewing the case it will at once become apparent that the questions of prescription, the statute of limitations, and the supposed equitable title arising from the acquiescence of the Buffalo and Lake Huron Railway Company in the enlargement of the easement as originally granted, to which some importance was attached in the court below, are immaterial to the decision of the present appeal. On the 1st of May, 1870, when the renewal term expired, the railway company became the absolute owners in fee in possession, or with the right of immediate possession, of all the lands now in question, as well of the mill property and its appurtenant easements, as of the lands on both sides of the river, now the property of the appellant, excepting only block A on the north bank. There was therefore with the exception mentioned, from this date, until the ownership was again separated, on the execution of the conveyances under which the appellant\u2019s title is derived, entire unity of ownership by the railway company of all the tenements, as well of those which are now alleged to be servient, as of those which are said to be dominant, and there could have been, during this period, no easements in the strict sense of the term. It is manifest that one piece of land cannot be said to be burdened by a servitude in favor of another piece when both belong absolutely to the same owner, who has, in the exercise of his own unrestricted right of enjoyment, the power of using both as he thinks fit and of making the use of one parcel subservient to that of the other, if he chooses so to do. There was therefore, when the title to all these lands came to be vested in the same owner, an extinguishment of any easements which may previously have existed, a species of merger by which what may have been, whilst the different parcels were in separate hands, legal easements, ceased to be so, and became mere easements in fact\u2014quasi-easements, as they are sometimes called Then what possible difference can it make in the rights of parties claiming under the railway company, that there had been, during the term which had expired, a possession in the tenant beyond the rights which his lease conferred\u2014a possession which was an encroachment upon other lands of his landlord not comprised in the lease, of such a character that if it had been a possession of the lands of a stranger it would have ripened into a title under the statute of limitations; or that the tenant had, during the term, enjoyed an easement over lands of his landlord other than those demised to him, and which would, in like manner, have given him an easement by prescription, if the burden of it had been imposed upon the lands of a third person; or that such easement had even been enjoyed with the direct and express acquiescence and license of the landlord, who had encouraged the tenant in an expenditure for the purposes of making the easement available? It is impossible to see how any such acts could have had the slightest legal effect upon the rights of the parties claiming under the railway company the owner of the whole, dominant and servient tenements alike. They would, it is true, have some effect as evidence to show that the easements claimed existed as easements in fact, quasi-easements, whilst the several tenements were in the hands of the same owner, but no other and no legal consequence whatever could be attached to such acts in the event which has happened of the ownership of all the lands having become consolidated in the hands of the railway company. Supposing the railway company had not originally owned the mill property at all, and that the easements claimed had actually been acquired in favor of that property and against the other properties now owned by the appellant by a user for the full statutory period of twenty years, and that then the dominant tenements had been acquired by the railway company by purchase, there must in that case have been an extinguishment of the easements. The same principle would also apply in the case of easements to which an equitable title had been acquired by the license and acquiescence of the railway company followed by an expenditure, on the faith of such a sanction, by the owner of the mill property. Again, if in the case supposed of the title to the two properties being absolutely vested in fee in different owners, a title to the land itself on which the race-way is constructed had been actually acquired by a possession for the required period under the statute of limitations, this would, of course, have been immaterial if the railway, company had subsequently acquired a title to the mill property by purchase. Then, when the term came to an end and the mill property reverted to the lessors, it was at least as strong a case as that supposed. It is well settled law that all additions to the demised premises, acquired by a lessee by encroachments on the land of a stranger and possession for the statutory period, enure on the determination of the tenancy to the benefit of the reversioner, as also do easements acquired under the Prescription Act, and an easement acquired by a tenant by acquiescence and license of his landlord over other lands of the latter must be presumed to be so acquired as incidental to the enjoyment of the demised premises, and not as an easement in gross, if indeed such a right as an easement in gross is recognised at all by the law, and therefore to be limited to the continuance of the term and to be determined upon the expiration of the lease. The result is that all these questions of the statutes of limitations, prescription, and license can have nothing to do with the decision of the case, if we determine, as I think we must, on the evidence contained in the record, that the respondent up to the date of the conveyance of 3rd June, 1871, never had any interest, legal or equitable, in the mill property and its appurtenant easements, except as a lessee for the original and renewed terms, the latter of which came to an end on the 1st of May, 1870, and that there is no foundation in fact for the assumption that the respondent has now any title which he can carry back to the option of purchase, or in any way ascribe to the stipulations contained in the lease or to any other origin legal or equitable earlier in date than the conveyance to Patterson on the 3rd February, 1873.\nWe have, therefore, in order to determine what are now the rights of the appellant in respect of block F, to ascertain what were the rights of the railway company immediately after the execution of the conveyances to Ross, Smith and McDonald of the 3rd June, 1871, for it is plain that the respondent, claiming under a subsequent conveyance to Patterson executed on the 3rd February, 1873, can claim no more extensive rights than his grantors had.\nThe appellant seeks in the first place to justify the acts which the bill was filed to restrain, the partial removal of the dam and the embankment of the race-way, upon the ground that as the riparian proprietor of block F, he was also the owner of the bed of the river to its middle thread, and that he, therefore, shows the embankment on the stream and a part of the dam to be erected on land which belongs to himself, and in which he had the absolute and unrestricted right of property. The respondent, on the other hand, insists that the descriptions in the conveyance to Ross of the 3rd June, 1871, does not carry the northerly limit of block F to the water\u2019s edge, and that consequently the appellant is neither the owner of the land in the bed of the river on which the dam and race-way are placed, nor even a riparian proprietor. I am of opinion that the conclusion arrived at by Mr. Justice Proudfoot, before whom the cause was originally heard, that block F did extend to the waters of the river Maitland, was a correct inference from the plan of 1859 as explained by the witnesses who gave evidence as experts, and from the descriptions contained in the conveyance to Ross.\nThe learned judges of the Court of Appeal were of opinion that the plan of 1859 was not entitled to any weight for the purpose of identifying block F as a piece of land extending to the water\u2019s edge, inasmuch as it did not appear that \u201cthe plan was made by a person having authority to bind the owner\u201d. But it is proved that the fact was otherwise; that the plan was made for the owners of the land, the railway company, and was actually registered by them, as appears by the memorandum to that effect on its face.\nIt was, therefore, in June, 1871, when the railway company conveyed to Ross, a plan binding on them, to this extent at least, that when they conveyed a parcel of land, which they described as block F, it must be presumed that they intended to convey the same parcel of land as is shown by that denomination in this plan of 1869 and with the same natural boundaries on the north and north east as are there indicated.\nIt is contended however by the respondent that these limits of block F are shown by the irregular line of shading on the plan of 1859. This the appellant answers by producing as witnesses experienced draughtsmen and surveyors, who state their opinions to be that this shading is not intended as a boundary line, but is meant to represent the configuration of the land in question and to mark where the table land comes to an end, and to show the declivity and slope towards the river, which are found upon the ground. That it is, what Mr. Miles, one of the witnesses, says is technically called by draughtsmen, a \u201ccontour line,\u201d showing the brow of the hill.\nThis evidence is objected to by the learned judges of the Court of Appeal for the alleged reason that the question is not a proper one to be decided by the evidence of experts, but one for the court itself. From this conclusion I am compelled to differ. The question submitted to these experts is not the general one, what is the actual boundary of this block F, but what is intended to be shown by this shading on a plan prepared by a professional draughtsman a provincial land surveyor, and adopted by the railway company. Upon such a point it appears to me beyond doubt that the evidence of other professional draughtsmen may be admitted, not, it is true, to give their opinion upon the question of fact submitted to the court, but to show what, according to the general practice and usage of draughtsmen in preparing plans, similar marks and shadings are intended to indicate. And this is what Mr. Passmore does in the following passages of his deposition. He is asked, \u201cWhat is the meaning of the shading all round? A. It is the shading of the hill side. Q. Would this shading, according to the proper drawing, belong to block F or not? A. Certainly; that is just the shading of the hill side. Q. Then it is intended to designate a flat? A. Just the slope of the shore from the top of the head line.\u201d This testimony is entirely confirmed by that of Mr. Miles, the other professional draughtsman called by the appellant. I am of opinion that this evidence is free from the objections which have been made to it; that it was properly admissible, and that it and the plan together entirely warrant the conclusion come to by Mr. Justice Proudfoot at the trial. If this shaded line is not meant to show the boundary of block F, it is not to be presumed that there was any boundary on the north and north-east sides but the river. The descent to the river as described by one of the witnesses, was so abrupt as almost to be perpendicular, and the river originally, and before the construction of the race-way washed the foot of the declivity. There is always a strong presumption in favor of natural boundaries when there are not well defined surveyed lines laid down either upon the ground or upon maps or plans, and if it is once established that the shading upon the map of 1859 is not meant to show a boundary line that presumption applies here, and we must determine, as the primary judge did, that block F is a piece of land extending to the water\u2019s edge. There is, however, in addition to the plan and the evidence of the surveyors who show that the shading cannot be relied on as a limit, a piece of evidence which establishes that fact conclusively. The deed of the 3rd June, 1871, by which the railway company conveyed block F to Ross, of which more will have to be said when I come to consider another part of the case, has a plan annexed to it to which reference is made in the description contained in the deed. This plan, on which is depicted, coloured in pink, certain parts of block F, which, whatever disputes there may be as to other land which the appellant contends and the respondent denies was intended to pass by this deed, were indisputably intended to be conveyed, shows, at the eastern extremity of the block, a piece of land covered by the pink coloring which, upon a comparison of this plan annexed to the deed with the plan of 1859, is seen at a glance to be beyond the shaded line, to the eastward or north eastward of it. This in a deed executed by the railway company, the common grantor, under whom both the appellant and respondent claim, is therefore a positive admission made at a date anterior to the conveyance under which the respondent claims that block F is not a piece of land contained within limits described by the shading on the plan of 1859, No answer has been given to this either in the factum filed by the respondent or in the argument at the bar, and I am at a loss to conceive how it could be answered. But this plan annexed to the deed, not only entirely destroys the theory of the respondent that the boundary is shown by the shaded line, thus confirming the argument of the appellant that there being no other boundary which can be suggested the natural boundary of the river must be presumed to be the limit, but it does more, for it shows block F at the particular point already referred to, the eastern extremity of the block, as actually touching the river and for some distance at this point the railway company, by the plan accompanying their deed, give the river as a boundary. Then, if the river is the boundary of the block at this point, it surely creates an almost irresistible inference that the river was intended to be the boundary throughout. But indeed it is difficult to say how it can be urged, when we suppose the shaded line on the plan of 1859 to be obliterated, as we must consider it to be, for all purposes of a boundary, that the plan annexed to the deed of 1871 does not actually give the river as the boundary throughout.\nI have, therefore, no hesitation in accepting the judgment of the learned judge at the trial on this part of the case, and in determining that the portions of block F conveyed to Ross by the deed of June, 1871, did extend to the river.\nIt follows that the appellant, as the proprietor of the bank to the water\u2019s edge, is presumably the owner also of the bed of the river to the middle thread of the stream, and the race-way which the bill seeks to have the appellant restrained from interfering with and so much of the dam, also, as is to the south of the middle line of the river were therefore erections upon the appellants land.\nThen it is further contended for the respondent that according to the deed of June, 1871, the appellant is only entitled to such parts of block F as appear to be coloured in pink on the plan annexed to that instrument. Having once ascertained of what block F consists there can be little difficulty on this head. The only piece of block F actually excepted is that coloured green upon the plan. By the very terms of the description the whole of block F beyond this excepted parcel must be held to have passed by the deed, even assuming that the parts coloured pink on the plan do not show the whole of this residue. The words of the description are:\u2014\nAll that part of said block F shown on the plan annexed hereto and coloured pink, that is to say this conveyance covers all of said block F excepting the part thereof shown in the said plan annexed hereto in green colour, and which part coloured green is described thus.\nAnd then follows a particular description of the excepted parcel. Now, assuming that \u201cblock F\u201d was a description of a definite piece of land extending to the river, a conclusion already arrived at, and also assuming that the respondent is right in saying that the pink colouring does not show the whole of the residue of the block beyond the excepted parcel, I should still be of the opinion that the whole of the remainder of the block passed. Mr. Justice Patterson in his judgment refers to the case of Iter v. Nolan et al.[67], as applicable to this point, and I am willing to abide by that case as containing a correct exposition of the law and as being a governing authority to be applied here. Then what does Her v. Nolan, which is only one among a great number of cases both here and in England, decide? It determines that where a close or parcel of land is granted by a specific name, and it can be shown what are the boundaries of such close or parcel, the governing part of the description is the specific name, and the whole parcel will pass, even though to the general description there is superadded a particular description by metes and bounds, or by a plan which does not show the whole contents of the land as included in the designation by which it is generally known. Applying this principle here, it is beyond controversy that the whole of block F passed under the deed. But no such question really arises here, for the parts colored pink in the plan in the deed of 1871 do extend to the river, and therefore include the whole of the block except the reserved portion. The reasons for this conclusion already given are greatly strengthened by an argument which, as applicable to another part of the case, the respondent himself has strongly insisted on. The respondent has himself contended, and the surveyors called called by him support his contention, that the black lines on this plan are designed to show the present race-way as it actually existed at the date of the deed, and has existed since 1865. Taking this to be as the respondent insists, it also shows that block F is bounded by the river, for we are told by the witnesses that the inner bank of the raceway, which is represented in the plan by the inner black line, to which the pink colouring extends, is the natural bank of the river. The consequence is that the description in the deed, as I have construed it, is entirely consistent both in itself and as applied to the plan, and that the parts colored pink do show all of block F save the excepted part colored green, and that as a parcel of land having the river for one of its boundaries. In other words when the description in the deed says, \u201cAll that part of block F shown in the plan annexed hereto and colored pink; that is to say, this conveyance covers all of said block F except the reserved parts,\u201d it correctly and emphatically says that the parts colored pink do show the whole of block F ascertained as a piece of land having the river for its boundary, excepting such parts as are expressly reserved.\nIt is said, however, that even if the appellant is the owner of the land itself that the respondent is entitled, in respect of the mill and lands conveyed by the deed of the 3rd February, 1873, by which the railway company conveyed to Patterson the premises which have since become vested in the respondent, to an easement giving him the right to maintain the dam and raceway, and this is rested upon two distinct grounds. First, it is claimed under the express reservation in the deed to Ross of the 3rd June, 1871, under which the appellant derives his title, and secondly, it is asserted that by operation of law there was an implied reservation of these easements. On both these points it appears to me that the decision must be adverse to the respondent. Any easements to which the respondent is entitled against the appellant as the proprietor of block F must, so far as his title depends on express grant, be necessarily found in the deed to Ross of 3rd June, 1871. It has already been shown that the renewed lease came to an end and the stipulation giving a right to purchase the mill property thereby became inoperative on the 1st May, 1870, from which date the railway company were seized in fee in possession, or with a right to the immediate possession, of the mill property and were also seized in fee of so much of block F as had not been included in the lease, and that consequently from that date all easements were extinguished by unity of ownership. This is incontrovertible, unless we are to ascribe the deed to Patterson of the 3rd February, 1873, to some equitable title earlier in point of time than the date of the 3rd June, 1871, either under the right of purchase conceded by the lease, or under some other agreement binding in equity, but this, as already demonstrated, is impossible, unless we can proceed, to the entire disregard of evidence, upon pure hypothesis and conjecture. Then as on the one hand a title to the easements claimed by the respondent by express grant cannot have relation back to any title earlier than the reservations contained in the deed of 1871, so on the other hand it is clear that nothing done by the railway company subsequently to the execution of that deed, can in any way burden the lands, so as to affect them in the hands of the appellant as claiming under Ross. Therefore the recital in the deed of 1878 that it was granted in pursuance of the contract of purchase, and the description of the easements contained in that deed, and the reference therein to the lease, can have no effect against the appellant with regard to whom they were res inter alios acta. It follows that the respondent, in seeking to make out a title by express grant, must be restricted to the deed of 1871, and can have no other or larger easements than such as are expressly reserved by it in favour of the grantors, the railway company, or, as it may be put, are re-granted to them by Ross, their grantee of the land. Then turning to the deed of 1871, we find that it makes no reference to the expired leases, or to any right of the respondent, or of those claiming Under him, or in his right, that there is no reference to these prior instruments in extension or aid of the description; but that it purports to reserve just what is specifically described within the four corners of the deed itself, and nothing more. After the description of the land intended to be conveyed to the grantee, Ross, already extracted, and being, as I construe it, all of block F, except the reserved portions, the deed proceeds to describe very fully, giving courses and distances, two parcels of land, the first being described as a piece coloured green on the map, and the second as what is called the mill-race. The latter, it is to be observed, is not the mill-race now in dispute, but a piece of land so fully and accurately described that there can be no question as to its size or locality, and which is entirely distinct from the mill-race for the whole length of the river, from the dam near the bridge downwards, as now claimed by the respondent. This mill-race is not reserved by way of easement, but the land itself is excepted from the conveyance to the grantee in the deed. The deed does not in terms purport to convey any easement over the lands conveyed to Ross, or to except from the operation of the conveyance anything but the two pieces of land which are described as before stated It is, therefore, out of the question to say that the right to maintain a race-way such as the respondent now claims, was acquired under the reservation. A piece of land to be used as a race-way and designated as a race-way, was, it is true, reserved, but this was not in any way, identical with the race-way formed by the embankment erected in the bed of the river, and extending in the river for three-quarters of a mile as far east as the dam near the bridge, as now used and claimed, for the purposes of the mill by the respondent. The easements which the respondent, by his bill, seeks to have established and protected, are in respect of this race-way and also of the dam which he has placed obliquely across the river, near the head of the race-way. As regards the first\u2014the race-way\u2014he has entirely failed to shew any title by express grant under the reservation in the deed. He, also, in my opinion, fails to show any grant or reservation which entitles him to maintain such a dam as he has erected, and the appellant\u2019s partial removal of which led to the institution of this litigation. Part of the description of the race-way contained in the deed of June, 1871, is as follows:\u2014\nThence due North 79 degrees, 18 minutes and 30 seconds, East 319 feet 3 inches, more or less to the head gates of the race, thence easterly across the head gates 107 feet, more or less, to the high water mark, caused by a dam giving a head of 8 feet of water at the mill.\nSave this there is no mention of a dam any where in the deed. The question is, therefore, narrowed to this, did this incidental reference to the high water mark caused by a dam giving eight feet of water at the mill authorize the respondent to continue to maintain the dam or obstruction in the bed of the river near the bridge which he had placed there whilst he held under the lease? The respondent insists that this reference to a dam was an informal reservation by the grantees, the railway company, of a right to construct or maintain a dam anywhere they might choose to place it for the purpose of getting a fall of eight feet of water at the mill without restriction to any particular locality, and that, therefore, it authorises the maintenance of the present dam. I am not able to assent to this proposition. In the first place, it seems to be very clear that this mention of a dam in the description was not intended to operate as the reservation of an easement to maintain a dam, but was a mere matter of local description. But, be this as it may, it seems clear that the appellant is right when he contends that the dam referred to was, or was intended to be, below the head gates mentioned in the description. The head gates were intended to let the water confined or ponded back by the dam, into the mill race, and it therefore follows that the dam, to cause this elevation of the water, must have been westerly of or below the head gates, the locality of which is precisely fixed by the deed. Again such a dam as the present never could have been intended, for the reason that it would not have been effective for the purpose of giving the required head of water at the mill without the adjunct of the longitudinal embankment in the bed of the stream forming the race way, and there is no pretence for saying that any right to maintain this embankment was conferred by the deed of 1871. The respondent endeavours to meet this argument by calling the race-way itself a dam, but the answer to this is easy, \u201crace-way\u201d is certainly the more accurate description of the channel through which the water is conveyed from the dam, across the river, in the direction of the mill, and we have the race-way intended particularly described in the reservations of the deed. I have already said that I think that we ought not to look out of the deed itself in order to ascertain the locality of the dam, but if we are to look at the lease, the only other instrument which can be referred to for the purpose, so far from helping the respondent\u2019s case, the description of the dam there referred to makes the case stronger against him, for the dam authorised by the lease is \u201ca dam across the river Maitland so high as to take up eight feet of the fall of the said river, and no more.\u201d Again, the Buffalo & Lake Huron Railway Company by the lease reserved the right to the use of the water of the river above the back water to be caused by the dam. These references to a dam in the lease, therefore, plainly show that what was contemplated was a dam across the river (not one placed longitudinally in it) obstructing the natural flow of the water and so low down that the lands of the railway company to the east of it (which land did not extend eastward beyond the eastern extremity of block F) would be above the back water, a description which would be entirely inapplicable to the existing dam. Then the evidence of one of the surveyors, Miles, the appellant\u2019s witness and Wetherall, called for the respondent, both of whom know the premises, puts this question of the locality of the dam beyond dispute. Miles gives the following evidence:\u2014\nQ. If the dam were to be maintained Where it is, or in other words if the dam is not to be brought down to where it originally was, would the words in the description be sensible or have any meaning at all, that is, the course which carries you to the head gates, and thence across the head gates to the high water mark of the dam, giving so many feet of water, could these words have any sense unless the dam was erected there? A. According to that the dam would be immediately below the head gates.\nQ. To give effect to that part of the description of the plaintiff\u2019s land, there must be a dam at these head gates? A. Yes.\nQ. Could you, by any possibility, reach the high water of the present dam in this description? A. No.\nQ. Looking at this old map of Wetherall\u2019s to which Mr. Passmore referred, and to which you referred also, would the dam, as laid down in that map, give effect to the language of this description: a dam located as that dam was? A. The dam must be at the old head gates.\nQ. If the dam was at the old head gates, would there be any sense in having this long channel running up along the front of lot F? A. If the dam is high enough; I think not.\nQ. Is there anything to prevent its being made high enough? A. A mere matter of expense.\nBeing cross-examined, the witness says:\nQ. What do you say about the position of the dam? A. If the dam is below the head gates, where it is shown on the Wetherall old map the description of the mill privilege can be understood, and then the dams dam back the water to the head gates, and the description shows 107 feet going east along the head gates to the high water mark, caused by a dam; well, if the dam were in its present position, this 107 feet would not touch it, it says 107 feet, more or less, but does not mean 1000 feet, more or loss.\nQ. I understood you to state to Mr. Garrow where the dam ought to be? A. Below the head gates.\nQ. That is lower down the river, you mean? A. Below the head gates. Q. Well, the head gates are the head gates of the pond? A. Exactly, you go to that by description, by metes and bounds.\nQ. Whereabouts should the dam be? A. According to the old head \u00abgates it was attached to the head gates; that is, according to the old plan.\nThen Mr. Wetherall, who is called by respondent, and who prepared the description contained in the original lease after a survey of the ground made for the purpose, agrees with the appellant\u2019s witness; his statement is as follows:\nQ. Now the head gates must have been there when you made the survey for the description? A. Yes.\nQ. And have you gone over the matter? A. Yes.\nQ. And that same description is continued down to the very latest title deeds that he has? A. Yes.\nQ. The same description throughout? A. Yes.\nQ. And the description of his property is simply the exceptions from F? A. Yes.\nQ. Then you say the head gates must have been there? A. Yes.\nQ. Now, was the dam not there at the time? A. I can\u2019t remember.\nQ. Did you know where the dam was to be at the time? A. By the head gates being there, I should say that the dam was to be as shown on my map.\nQ. This is your own map, the map of 1864, and was prepared by yourself? A. Yes.\nThis map of 1864 is produced and is one of the exhibits in the cause, and it distinctly shows the dam situated below the head gates. We have, therefore, the locality of the dam referred to in the deed of 1871 ascertained not precisely, it is true, but sufficiently for the appellant\u2019s purpose of showing that it meant a dam placed in the river below the head gates, and did not mean a dam and embankment, such as the respondent now claims.\nThis concludes the question of any easements by express grant, against the respondent, unless there is any force in an argument derived from the black lines drawn on the plan annexed to the deed of the 3rd June, 1871, which have been already referred to. It was a matter of controversy at the trial whether or not these black lines were intended as a delineation of the race-way now claimed. The respondent\u2019s witnesses, who were called to give evidence as experts, thought they were meant to show the race-way, and I think they were right. But granting this to be so, I am at a loss to see how that fact shows that this raceway, or an easement in respect of it, was reserved by the railway company. No reference is made in the deed itself to the raceway, or to these lines as representing it, and consequently their only effect can be to show that at the date of the execution of the deed the raceway existed in fact, and was as a fact brought to the notice of Ross at the time he took his conveyance. If we were now considering the effect of these lines in connection with other evidence showing an agreement to reserve this race-way or the right to maintain it in an action to rectify the deed, I can understand how these lines might have an important bearing, but in an action like the present, when we are only called upon to construe the deeds and to give them their strict legal effect, the appearance of these lines in the plan must be considered immaterial and can have no other or greater significance than the fact of the actual existence of the race-way itself at the date of the deed can have. The respondent has therefore wholly failed to make out a title to any easement by express reservation.\nThen we have to consider whether, as a matter of law there was any implied reservation of rights by Way of easements to maintain the dam and raceway arising upon the conveyance of the railway company to Ross Both the dam and race-way had been enjoyed by the respondent, not only as quasi-easements which were continuous and apparent in the interval between the expiration of the leasehold term and the deed of the 3rd of June, l871, but they had also existed by the suffer- ance of the railway company as easements de facto during the continuance of the lease, when the several tenements were in different hands. Were they then reserved as legal easements when the ownership in fee of the two properties was again severed by this conveyance to Ross? In a strict technical sense there is no such thing as a reservation or exception of an easement upon a conveyance of land, for a reservation or exception means something reserved or excepted out of the land itself, and an easement in favor of other lands is not within this definition[68]; a reservation or exception of an easement is therefore construed and held to operate as an inartificially expressed grant by the grantee in favor of the grantor. Can it therefore be said that there was any such grant by Ross, the grantee, in favor of his grantors the railway company, not as has been shown, contained in the deed, but arising from implication of law from the state of facts existing at the time of the execution of the conveyances? It appears to me that upon the later authorities this question must be answered adversely to the respondent.\nThree modern cases of the highest authority have settled the law upon this much controverted point. The decisions to which I refer are those of Suffield v. Brown, Crossley v. Lightowler and Wheeldon v. Burrowes, the two first mentioned decided respectively by Lords Westbury and Chelmsford and the last by the English Court of Appeal. In Suffield v. Brown[69], Lord Westbury determined that when the quasi servient tenement was first conveyed without expressly providing for the continuance of the easement there was no implied reservation for the benefit of the land retained by the grantor. In this case of Suffield v. Brown the easement was one of a class which has been called non-apparent and discontinuous, that is the enjoyment of it was of an occasional or intermittent character, and this was at first supposed to have afforded ground for a distinction between the principle of Suffield v. Brown, and that involved in the case of Pyer v. Carter[70]. Later, however, Lord Chelmsford in deciding Crossley v. Lightowler[71], applied the same rule to the case of an easement apparent and continuous, and finally in the case of Wheeldon v. Burrows[72] the Court of Appeal expressly over ruled Pyer v. Carter, so far as it is to be regarded as an authority for a contrary doctrine, holding that no distinction was to be made for this purpose between easements which are apparent and those which are non-apparent. In all these cases it was recognised as a well settled rule of the law of property, that if the dominant tenement is first granted, all quasi easements which had been enjoyed as appendant to it over a quasi servient tenement retained by the grantor, pass by implication. The ratio decidendi of these decisions against the doctrine of implied reservation in the case of the servient tenement being first sold, is that where land is granted uncharged with any easement, it would be to authorize the grantor to derogate from his own grant, and so to set up a presumption against a rule of law, if he were to be permitted to subject the granted land to a user for the benefit of the land retained, to which it had been in fact subservient, whilst he was the owner of both tenements. This being the reason of the rule, it is plain that any distinction between easements apparent and those non-apparent, would be entirely arbitrary.\nNo argument against the application of these authorities to the facts of the present case can therefore be found- ed on the circumstance that the existence of the dam and raceway must have been known to the grantee under the deed of June, 1871. It may be said, however, that here the easements claimed did not consist merely in special modes of user and enjoyment, to which the first granted tenement had been subjected for the first time during the unity of ownership, but that the dam and race-way had both been previously enjoyed during the temporary severance of title which had been occasioned by the lease. But although it is true that this circumstance is not to be found in any of the decided cases, it appears very clear that it can make no difference when it is considered that the principle upon which they were decided is, that a grantor cannot claim rights in derogation of his grant, since a vendor, claiming an easement which had had a legal existence previous to the unity of ownership and which had been extinguished by it would be manifestly acting quite as much in derogation of his grant of the servient tenement as would a vendor who had himself been the original author of the quasi\u2011easement, whilst the titles were united. The only notice I find of this point in any of the text books is contained in the following passage, extracted from the work of Mr. Goddard on the law of easements[73]:\nIf the quasi-easements had legal existence as easements before the unity of ownership, and the quasi-dominant tenement is sold, the purchaser, as in the other case, will become entitled to the easements, but what would be the result if the quasi-servient tenement is sold, is apparently an open question. Now, the authority of Pyer v. Carter is so much shaken, for Lord Westbury did not extend his judgment in Suffield v. Brown to this point, but in all probability it would be said that the grantor could not derogate from his own grant, that as he sold the quasi-servient tenement without making any stipulation for the reservation of the extinguished easement\u2014it would be in derogration of his grant if he could claim them; it might also be said that as the vendor made no mention of the easements in his deed he must be presumed to have intended not to reserve them. Should this be so decided it would make no difference whether the quasi-easements were first used during the unity of ownership or legally existed as easements before the ownership was united.\nIt is to be remarked that this was written before Wheeldon v. Burrows was decided, and as this case has now settled the law as proceeding upon the principle that a grantor cannot derogate from his grant, it can make no difference that the easements had once had a strictly legal existence which had been terminated by merger.\nThen it is urged that these were easements of necessity, and so within the exception pointed out by Lord Justice Thesiger in his judgment in Wheeldon v. Burrows with reference to ways of necessity. There is not the slightest foundation for such a proposition. It is shown by the evidence that the dam and race-way in question are not indispensably necessary to the use of the mill, but that the same head of water might be obtained by erecting a dam below the old head gates, and that the preference of using the water in one mode rather than the other, is only on the ground of expense. It is not sufficient, to bring a case within the exception recognized by Lord Justice Thesiger, to show merely that, as the premises were constructed and used at the time of the grant of the servient tenement, the tenement retained by the grantor was dependent for a continuance of the user by means of the same contrivances and arrangements, upon an easement over the granted property. It must be shown, in order to make out an implied reservation upon this ground, that the easement was absolutely necessary to any user at all by the grantor of the land retained by him. If the argument could prevail in the present case it would have been sufficient also to have brought the case of Crossley v. Lightowler within the principle of the same exception, and also to have exempted the case of Pyer v. Carter from the criticism and disapproval to which it has been subjected. For these reasons I am of opinion that there was no implied reservation of these easements arising from the fact of their apparent and continuous existence and use, to the knowledge of the grantee, entitling the railway company to them as easements appendant to the mill and other tenements which were retained by the company at the date of the deed of June, 1871, and of which property the respondent is now seized.\nHad it been found impossible to reach the conclusions already indicated, either for the reason that the appellant was not a riparian proprietor in respect of block F, or because, though seized of that parcel of land with a boundary on the river, it was subject in his hands to the easements claimed, I should still have been compelled to dissent from the courts below, and to hold that the appellant was entitled to have the decree reversed as having shown a sufficient justification of the acts complained of in respect of his ownership of the three parcels of land on the north side of the river, Island C, the Great Meadow, and Block A. The rights of the appellant in respect of the first two parcels appear to me to depend on propositions so plain and simple that very little is required to be said to show that he ought not to have been enjoined as he has been by the decree now complained of. The appellant\u2019s title to these lands is derived under conveyances from the railway company. Island C was sold and conveyed by the railway company in fee to Smith, on the 3rd June, 1871, and by a deed of the same date, the Great Meadow was sold and conveyed by the same grantors in fee to McDonald. The appellant acquired his title to these lands by purchase from Smith and from the devisee under the will of McDonald, by whom the lands were respectively conveyed to him in December, 1879. As regards Island C, the very description of the land itself, as an island, imports prim\u00e2 facie that it extends to the edge of the waters by which it is surrounded, and. moreover, the registered plan of 1859, or rather the certified copy of it from the Canada Company\u2019s office, which was put in to supply the piece torn off in the registered plan, shows the island as having the water for a boundary. Again the same plan shows the great meadow as extending on the south to the waters of the river. There as not the slightest ground for questioning the correctness of either of these descriptions. The fact that, by means of the dam and raceway, the water is unduly diverted from the appellant\u2019s lands on the north bank of the river, would seem a necessary result of the dam and embanked channel forming the raceway, from the mere descriptions which we have of them in the evidence, and I should have thought no further proof would have been requisite to establish the appellant\u2019s case in this respect. The Court of Appeal, however, was of a different opinion, though the learned judge before whom the case was tried seems to have had no difficulty in finding for the appellant on this point. A reference, however, to the depositions of the witnesses examined at the trial, conclusively establishes that there is a diversion not only to an appreciable extent, but to an extent sufficient to be injurious to the appellant\u2019s rights as a riparian owner.\nWetherall, a surveyor and a witness called by the respondent, says:\nBy reason of this dam and race-way the waters of the river are diverted for about three\u2011fourths of a mile; namely, from the head of the head race at the bridge to the foot of the tail race below the mill. In low water the race takes the greater part of the river, takes it all except what percolates through the dam. The water which is diverted by the race would, if left to itself, go down the main channel past island C, the great meadow and block A, and as it is diverted it does not go past these properties. Miles, a witness called by the appellant, also a surveyor, says:\nThe water is diverted from the main channel by means of the plaintiff\u2019s dam and the raceway that he is claiming, it is made to flow out of the main channel of the river until it reaches the lower end of block E, and it diverts it from both A & C, and the Great Meadow.\nThis testimony is not in the least degree contradicted, and in face of it I find it impossible to agree with the learned judges of the Court of Appeal in holding that the fact of the diversion of the waters from these lands on the north side of the river is not proved. The appellant\u2019s riparian ownership of these last mentioned lands and the fact of injury to the appellant\u2019s right as such owner being thus established, he has made out a prim\u00e2 facie case justifying the acts which the respondent complains of as having been done for the purpose of abating the nuisance caused by the dam. The onus is thus thrown upon the respondent to show some title to the right claimed to maintain the dam and race-way, and thus to divert the waters of the river from the appellant\u2019s property on the north side. Then what shadow of title to such a privilege has the respondent shown? I have not seen the two deeds of the 3rd June, 1871, by which these north side lands were conveyed to Smith and McDonald respectively, as they are not printed in the case, but it has not been suggested that they contained any reservations or exceptions which would operate as a grant of an easement in favour of the railway company giving the right to divert the natural flow of the water or in any way to interfere with the ordinary common law rights of the grantees in these deeds as riparian proprietors of the lands conveyed. There is not then in the case of these lands on the north bank any such difficulty as was founded on the reference to the dam in the exception contained in the conveyance of block F, and there is nothing therefore on which to rest any claim of title by express grant or reservation. Then, as has already been stated, when considering the appellant\u2019s rights in respect of block F, the law as finally settled by the decision in Wheeldon v. Burrows precludes the possibility of implying any reservation of easements in favour of the lands retained by the railway company over those conveyed by them to Smith and McDonald.\nThere only remains to be considered the appellant\u2019s rights as the proprietor of block A, which he holds under a different title from that which he makes to the other lands on the north bank of the river. The railway company were never seised of this land, and consequently the appellant\u2019s title to it is not, as in the case of the other parties, acquired from a grantor who was also originally the owner of the respondent\u2019s mill and other property. There can, therefore, in respect of this piece of land, be no question of easements by reservation, and the only points which have been or could be made against the appellant\u2019s justification of his acts in removing the dam and race-way, as owner of this property, are, first, that his title did not give him the right of a riparian proprietor in respect of it; and secondly, that an easement has been acquired against this block A by prescription. The deed by which this land was conveyed to the appellant has not been printed in the record, but it is said in the judgment of Mr. Justice Burton, and the fact has not been disputed by the appellant, either in his factum or in the argument at the bar, that the boundary of this land on the river side is high water mark, and thence along high water mark to a point on the bank. Assuming this to be so, I fail to see that there can be any doubt that the appellant is a riparian proprietor entitled to object to any unauthorized interference with the flow of the river in its natural state.\nA title to the bed of the river is clearly not requisite to entitle a proprietor of the bank to the use of the water; the case of Lyon v. The Fishmongers\u2019 Company[74] expressly decides that the lateral or riparian contact of the land with the water is sufficient to entitle the landowner to his right though he may own no part of the bed of the stream. That there was a diversion of the water from block A sufficiently injurious, in fact, to have entitled the appellant to maintain an action is clear from the evidence of the witnesses from whose depositions extracts have been already given. It thus appears that the effect of the dam and race-way is to divert the water from the north side as well when the river is at the height of ordinary high water as at other times when it is at a lower stage; and that this must be the result is apparent from the very nature of these obstructions, which the respondent has placed in the river.\nThe acquisition of an easement by prescription against block A is not raised by the pleadings, but I should be very unwilling now to conclude the respondent on that ground. The twenty years user requisite to make out a title of prescription is however not proved. The dam and race-way, which are to be considered as parts of the same structure, were not completed until 1865 and the date of the acts of disturbance which the respondent complains of were in February, 1880. The respondent himself, in the evidence which he gave at the trial, admits distinctly that the works constructed by him for the purpose of turning the water to the south side of the river were not completed until 1865. He says:-\nI built another embankment there in 1865, on the dam from the middle gates up to the upper gates, and I completed that in 1865. Q. Is that the present dam? A. The long dam? Yes.\nIn the face of this admission by the respondent it is impossible to contend that there was for twenty years prior to February, 1880, a user of the water in the manner in which the respondent now uses and claims the right to use it by means of the present dam and race\u2011way.\nIn my judgment, therefore, the respondent has failed to show that he is entitled to the relief which the court below has given him, and the appeal must, therefore, be allowed, the decree reversed, and the bill dismissed, with costs to the appellant in this court, and in both the courts below.\nFOURNIER, J.:\nIn this case I agree with the views expressed by His Lordship the Chief Justice, and the appeal should be allowed.\nHENRY, J.:\nUnderstanding some time ago that other members of the court were preparing exhaustive judgments embracing all the points in this case, I considered it unnecessary that I should prepare a written judgment. It is sufficient, therefore, for me to say that I concur in the views expressed by my learned brothers who have read their judgments, and also in the judgment which I have had the pleasure of reading, prepared by brother Gwynne. I have considered the case fully and I have arrived at the same conclusion that they have. The fact is, in the first place, that the cases and title did not go beyond the head gate, and that the dam referred to in these conveyances meant a dam of sufficient height to give eight feet of a head at the mill, and that dam placed and erected at the head gate. The descrip- tion in the leases and in the deed that subsequently followed, clearly point that out as the true construction of the document, and that when Ross got the deed the other parties and the respondent had no title whatever to the property. They had made no application either for a renewal of the lease or to purchase under the clause of the lease which gave them the right to do so. The property belonged, therefore, unrestrictedly to the parties who gave the deed to Ross. Ross took that as a conveyance of the property, being block \u201cF,\u201d without being encumbered by any reservation of an easement in the respondent other than that which is described in the lease. A question was raised as to the extent of block \u201cF,\u201d and I have no hesitation in saying from all the evidence that that block extended to the water, and as a necessary consequence took in the rights of the proprietors to half the stream, and that the excavations for the mill below the dam, that was subsequently erected by the respondent, were made on the soil of block \u201cF.\u201d But we have here evidence also that the appellant owned land on the other side of the river, to which no reservation is applicable. He also owned block \u201cA,\u201d deriving his title from a totally different source. Under any one or other of those titles, then, I think he was entitled to abate the nuisance by which his property was injured. I can see no right whatever in the respondent to erect the upper dam. It would have been of no service there without the excavation that followed it, to direct the water towards the head gates, and if he had the right to make a dam, he had not the right, certainly, to make the excavations that were necessary in order that that dam would be of any service. Looking at the whole case, with the evidence, and considering the law applicable to it, I have no difficulty in arriving at the conclusion that the appeal in this case ought to be allowed, and the original decree of the Vice Chancellor reversed, with costs.\nGWYNNE, J.:\n[After reading a statement of the case proceeded as follows:]\nThe solution of the questions arising in this case depends wholly, as it appears to me, upon the construction of the instruments under which the plaintiff and defendant respectively claim. What the plaintiff claims by his bill is not any estate in the land covered with the waters of the river Maitland at the place where the dam spoken of in the bill and therein alleged to have been erected in 1861, is situate, or in the channel leading therefrom, to the plaintiff\u2019s mill, but only the easement, right and privilege of maintaining the dam so alleged to have been erected, and of using the channel constructed and dug, as in the bill alleged, for conveying the waters of the river Maitland from above the said darn, which easements, rights and privileges the plaintiff asserts no title unto by prescription, but wholly as granted to and vested in him under and by virtue of the terms and express provisions of the several indentures mentioned in the bill. The plaintiff\u2019s whole claim is founded upon the grant of the easements as described in the Original lease, which lease as he contends granted the easement, right and privilege of erecting the dam therein referred to, at the sites of the dam alleged in the bill to have been constructed in 1861, near the bridge across the river. The plaintiff\u2019s whole claim rests upon the right to the easement as granted by that lease. He asserts no other title.\nNow, the plaintiff not claiming any estate in the bed of the river where the dam was erected, nor in the land covered with the water flowing through the channel, alleged to have been dug by the plaintiff on the south side of the river leading from the said dam, but only the easement, right and privilege of maintaining such dam for the purpose of conducting the waters of the river therefrom, through the said channel to the plaintiff\u2019s mill, whether the contention of the defendant that he is seised in fee of the land where the acts complained of were done be or be not well founded, the plaintiff cannot succeed upon this bill unless \u2018 he establishes his right to the easement as alleged in his bill, to whomsoever the fee in the land over which such easement is claimed may belong; so likewise the defendant, having by his answer set up a case in respect of which he claims cross relief, unless he establishes, not only that the plaintiff is not entitled to the easement, right and privilege of maintaining the dam at the place where it was erected, and of conducting therefrom the waters of the river through the said channel to the plaintiff\u2019s mill, but also that the defendant is seised in fee of the soil and bed of the river where the dam was erected, or of some other land abutting on the river in virtue of which he had a right to remove the dam as a wrongful obstruction in the bed of the river to the flow of the waters of the river in their natural course to and past such his land. If the defendant fail to establish his title as set up in his answer, and the plaintiff fail to establish his title to the easement as claimed in his title, the plaintiff\u2019s bill must be simply dismissed.\nIt is, I think, very plain that the indenture of lease, dated the 4th July, 1859, executed by the Buffalo & Lake Huron Railway Co., did not grant to the plaintiff the easement, right and privilege of constructing a dam across the river from the great meadow on the north side of the river at the place where the stone dam mentioned in the plaintiff\u2019s bill was erected, nor any right to dig the channel in the bill mentioned to have been dug by the plaintiff for the purpose of conducting thereby the waters of the river from the said dam to his mill. True it is that this indenture does not define any precise limits for the site of the dam thereby authorized to be constructed, but its approximate site as contemplated by the parties to that indenture can be ascertained from the evidence of William Robinson, who superintended the work done by the plaintiff from October, 1859, to 1865, the latter year inclusive. He says that the plaintiff came to the place in June, 1859, and the witness himself; in October of that year, at which latter date \u201call the surveying, to lay down the site of the mill and the race, had been completed and part of the dam was built.\u201d The dam here spoken of was situate about half a mile lower down the river than the stone structure near the bridge, which is alleged in the bill to have been constructed in 1861, but which the evidence I think shows, and Mr. Proudfoot, V.C, has found as a fact, to have been constructed at a much later period; and that this dam, constructed in 1859 and not the stone structure near the bridge, comes within the limits and the terms and contemplation of the grant of July, 4859, sufficiently appears from the terms of the indenture of the 4th of that month, which clearly establish that the dam authorized thereby must be so situate as to have in it the head gates of the race, the precise situs of which is specifically defined by metes and bounds, and so must be, as the dam of 1859 in fact was, about half a mile lower down the river than the stone structure, the removal of which by the defendant is complained of in this suit The construction, therefore, of this stone dam near the bridge, whenever constructed, whether in 1861, as alleged in the bill, or later, as the learned Vice-Chancellor has found the fact to be, and the digging by the plaintiff of the channel leading therefrom to his mill cannot be justified as acts done in pursuance of any power or grant of easement contained in the indenture of 4th day of July, 1859.\nIt appears that the indenture of the 9th November, 1866, which in the bill is alleged to have been an assignment by the plaintiff, with the concurrence of the Buffalo & Lake Huron Railway Company of the lands, premises and easements granted by the indenture of the 4th of July, 1859, was, in fact, an indenture of demise, executed by the Buffalo & Lake Huron Railway Company, the plaintiff being made a party thereto, and concurring therein to Patterson, who is therein recited to have been made assignee of all the plaintiffs rights and interests under the indenture of the 4th of July, 1864; and the indenture of the 9th of November, 1866, is, in fact, a grant and demise executed in pursuance of the provisions of the indenture of the 4th July, 1859, for granting a further term of three years to Patterson of the identical premises and easements granted and demised by the indenture of the 4th July, 1859, by the same precise description as the same are described in that indenture, for the term of three years, to commence and be computed from the 1st day of May, 1867, and containing a clause as to the purchase of the same premises within the said term of three years under the conditions and subject to the provisions in that behalf contained in the indenture of the 4th July, 1859. The indenture of the 9th November, 1866, being in express terms limited and confined to the identical lands, premises and easements granted by the indenture of the 4th July, 1859, cannot operate as a grant of any easement different from or more extensive than that which had been granted by the last named indenture. Up to this period, then, the plaintiff had acquired no right whatever derived from the Buffalo & Lake Huron Railway Co., authorizing the construction across the river Maitland of the stone structure mentioned in the bill as being near the bridge across the river, the removal of which by the defendant constitutes the gist of the plaintiff\u2019s bill of complaint.\nIn this state of facts and in this condition of things, the Buffalo & Lake Huron Railway Co., and the Grand Trunk Railway Co. upon the 2nd of February, 1870, entered into an agreement under their respective common seals whereby, subject to the approval of parliament, it was among other things agreed that the railway and works, stores, rolling stock and surplus lands, and all other the property and rights of the Buffalo company should vest absolutely in the Grand Trunk company as from the 1st July, 1869, and be deemed part of their undertaking subject to all existing mortgages and encumbrances thereon, and that subject thereto and to other matters not important to the consideration of the question before us, the railway, works, surplus lands, property and rights of the Buffalo company should be held by the Grand Trunk Co., free from all debts, liabilities and obligations of the Buffalo company; and that the Buffalo company should forthwith, or when and as the same from time to time should become due, pay and discharge all sums due from them as purchase money for land sold to them and for rights of way; and that the Grand Trunk Co. should, within twelve months\u2019 from that confirmation of the said agreement by the Canadian Parliament, sell or retain, at a valuation to be ascertained by a valuer to be named by each company (the valuers to name an umpire to decide between them in case of difference), the said surplus lands, and should forthwith apply the proceeds of such sales or the amount of such valuation in extinction, as far as the same would go, of the sums due for right of way; and all other debts and obligations whatever except those by the agreement expressly assumed by the Grand Trunk Co., and except mortgage and debenture debts and certain arrears which, under the agreement, might be capitalised, but including the interest not so capitalised; and that whether such obligations were or were not a charge upon the line and property of the Buffalo Co., or upon any part thereof, and that the said Buffalo & Lake Huron Co. should for ever indemnify the said Grand Trunk Co. against all the debts, liabilities and obligations of the Buffalo Co., except those thereby expressly adopted by the Grand Trunk Co., and against any interference with the railway, the works, the surplus lands or other the property of the Buffalo Co., vested by the agreement in the Grand Trunk Co., and any demand by or on behalf of any creditor or claimant against the Buffalo Co., except as aforesaid.\nBy an Act of Parliament which received the royal assent upon the 12th May, 1870, in 35 Vic. ch 49, this agreement was ratified and confirmed and all its provisions, stipulations and agreements were declared to be valid and binding, and should have in all respects the same force and effect as if the same and every of them were expressly embodied in the Act. Now, the term created by the indenture of the 9th November, 1866, terminated on the 1st May, 1870, and there is no allegation or pretence that during the currency of that term the lessee Patterson had elected to become purchaser of the premises demised, under the provisions in that behalf contained in the lease. If he had not, the effect of the 33rd Vic. ch. 49 was to make the Grand Trunk Railway Company, the absolute proprietors of the premises demised by the indenture of the 9th November, 1866, freed and released from the said indenture and from every thing contained therein as part of the surplus lands of the Buffalo & Lake Huron Railway Company under and subject to the provisions of the Act relating to surplus lands; and if Patterson, had given notice to the Buffalo company declaring his election to become purchaser of the demised premises under the provision in that behalf in the indenture of lease contained, then upon the passing of the statute 83rd Vic. ch. 49, the Grand Trunk company became seized of the premises, subject only to the obligation created by the express terms of the indenture of the 9th November, 1866, as to the extent of the property and the rights to be conveyed to Patterson, and subject to no other claim or demand whatsoever to be made by or on his behalf.\nWe next find that the Grand Trunk Railway Company, being obliged by the terms of the Act 33rd Vic., ch. 49, to sell or to retain at a valuation the surplus lands so acquired by them, by an indenture bearing date the 3rd day of June, 1871, and made between the Grand Trunk Railway Company and the Buffalo and Lake Huron Railway Company, of the first part, and one John Macdonald, of the second part, in consideration of the sum of $950, by him paid to the parties of the first part, they, the said parties of the first part, did grant unto the said Macdonald, his heirs and assigns, forever \u201cthe lot on the north side of the river Maitland known as The Big Meadow,\u201d to have and to hold to him, his heirs and assigns forever, and the said parties of the first part thereby covenanted with the said party of the second part that they had the right to convey the said lands to the said party of the second part notwithstanding any act of theirs, and that the said party of the second part should have quiet possession of the said lands free from all incumbrances, and that the parties of the first part had done no act to incumber the said lands. Now The Big Meadow, so granted, abutting as it plainly appears to abut upon the river Maitland on its north side, the bed of that river contiguous to and along the extent of the piece of land, called The Big Meadow so granted, ad medium filum aqu\u0153 passed by the above deed to the grantee Macdonald, his heirs and assigns in fee simple, unaffected by anything contained in the indentures of the 4th July, 1859, or of the 9th of November, 1866, to alter, defeat or prejudice such grant. This deed was duly registered on the 18th of July, 1871, in the registry office of the county of Huron, in which county the land called The Big Meadow is situate. Now, the stone structure across the river, which the plaintiff claims the right to maintain, and the defendant the right to remove, and which he has removed, is partly\u2014that is to say, to the middle thread of the river\u2014situate upon\u201d land which became vested in fee in the said Macdonald by the indenture which conveyed to him the big meadow; and the property so vested in Macdonald became, and was, by mesne conveyances from him, vested in the defendant at the time that he did the acts which are complained of. In so far, therefore, as regards one half of the dam across the river, which the plaintiff insists that he has a right to maintain as it was before it was removed by the defendant, namely, that half situate on the bed of the river on the side abutting on the big meadow, it appears to have been situate upon land whereof the defendant was seised in fee, and over which the plaintiff has not shown any grant of any easement affecting such land, his right, therefore, if any he has, to the easement, right and privilege of maintaining a dam upon that part of the river, can be sustained only by his showing title by prescription to the enjoyment of such easement, and that as already pointed out he does not by his bill profess to do.\nIt appears also by the evidence that upon the same 3rd day of June, 1871, by an indenture of that date executed by and between the Grand Trunk Railway Co. and the Buffalo & Lake Huron Railway Co. of the first part, and one Alexander M. Ross of the second part, the said parties of the first part in consideration of the sum of $1,520, paid to them by the said party of the second part, did grant unto the said party of the second part, his heirs and assigns for ever\u2014\nAll that parcel or tract of land and premises situate, lying and being in the town of Goderich and known as part of block F in the said town, and which parcel or tract of land may be more particularly described thus: All that part of the said block F shown on the plan annexed hereto and colored pink; that is to say, this conveyance covers all of said block F, excepting the part thereof shown on the said plan annexed hereto in green color, and which part colored green is described thus: Commencing at a point on the easterly edge of the mill race where the west limit of North street (produced) intersects the same there; thence north fifty-four degrees fifteen minutes east six hundred and sixty-eight feet to an angle; thence north thirty-five degrees and forty-five minutes west 396 feet, more or less, to the edge of the mill race; thence along the high water mark of the mill race in a southerly direction, following the various windings thereof to the place of beginning; also excepting and reserving from said block F the mill-race described thus: (here follows a description identical with the description of the mill-race, as contained in the above indentures of lease of the 4th July, 1859, and of the 9th November, 1866.)\nThe deed then proceeds as follows:\nWhich said two excepted parcels above described form no part of block F, colored in pink, or of the lands conveyed by this indenture, or intended thereby to be conveyed. To have and to hold unto the said party of the second part, his heirs and assigns to and for his and their sole and only use forever, subject, nevertheless to the reservations, limitations, provisoes and conditions expressed in the original grant thereof from the Crown.\nBy this indenture, the parties of the first part covenanted that they had the right to convey the said lands to the party of the second part, notwithstanding act of the said party of the first part, and that the said party of the second part should have quiet possession of the said lands free from all incumbrances; and that the said parties of the first part had done no act to incumber the said lands.\nUpon this deed two contentions upon the part of the plaintiff have been based: 1st That the land covered with the waters of the river running to the head gates mentioned in the lease of the 4th July, 1859, from above the stone dam near the bridge across the river along the foot of the high bank, on the south side of the river, and between that bank and a gravel bed which the plaintiff constructed on the bed of the river, formed no part of the land by this deed conveyed to the defendant; and 2nd, that even if the land covered with such water did pass to the defendant, it only passed subject to the right and easement reserved by the grantors to have the waters of the river run uninterruptedly along the channel so created. The most favorable light for the plaintiff in which the evidence, as to this mode of conducting the water of the river from the bridge can be viewed, as it appears to me, is, that in the year 1865 the plaintiff completed and almost wholly in that year constructed a gravel bank in the bed of the river, from What the plaintiff calls an island therein, near the bridge, down the river to the head gates mentioned in the lease of July, 1859, which was situate in the remains of a dam which he had in that year constructed within the limits authorized by that lease, and which had subsequently been washed away. By the construction of this gravel bank and of the stone structure or dam in the river near the bridge, which was also completed in the same year, 1865, the channel was first formed in the river for conducting its waters to the plaintiffs head gates, the situs of which is defined in his lease. The view taken by some of the learned judges in the court of appeal for Ontario differing in this point from the view taken by the learned V.C. Proudfoot, viz., that there was a strip of land not being part of block F, but lying between it and the river, makes it necessary to trace the condition of the piece of land called block F and the adjacent lands known as block E from a period antecedent to their acquiring such designations.\nThese blocks constituted part of the lands in what was called the Huron tract originally granted to the Canada Company. What other designation was ever given to them by the Canada Company, if any ever was, does not appear unless it be that they formed part of the town plot of the town of Goderich. As early as 1844 on a map filed by the Canada Company and registered in the registry office of the county of Huron, showing part of the town plot of the town of Goderich and its harbor, these blocks E and F are shown upon what appears to be a part of the unsurveyed portion of the town of Goderich, E being situate lower down the river and F adjacent thereto higher up. Now, although this map does not define with accuracy the line separating those blocks, yet there is nothing upon it which supports or countenances the idea that block E extended up the river between block F and the river, so as to separate that block from the river or vice vers\u00e2, that block F extended down the river and between the river and the parcel on which the designation E appears, or that a parcel not designated by any letter or number lay between the high bluff or bank above which the designation block F appears and the edge of the river. On the contrary, although the designated block F appears on the plan above the high bank which is very distinctly laid down on the plan, I should, without hesitation, conclude from the plan itself taken alone that it plainly enough exhibits the intention that the piece called block F should be regarded as extending down the steep bank to the water\u2019s edge of the river, which runs along its entire length. But in 1859 that intention appears to me to be put beyond all doubt. In the month of June of that year the Buffalo & Lake Huron Railway Company appear to have made an arrangement with the Canada Company for the acquisition by the former Company of the title to certain lands of the Canada Company, in virtue of which arrangement they executed the lease of May, 1859, before their title was perfected by deed, which was executed upon and bears date the 17th of February, 1865. As part of such arrangement a plan was prepared under the direction of the Canada Company, of \u201cGoderich harbour and part of the river Maitland with certain lands and premises sold by the Canada Company to the Buffalo & Lake Huron Railway Company\u201d which was signed by Frederick Widder, Commissioner of the Canada Company, upon behalf of that company and by R.J. Carter, Director and General Manager of the Buffalo & Lake Huron Railway Company, on the 3rd of June, 1859, and registered in the registry office of the county of Huron on the 6th of that month. Upon this map are laid down blocks \u201cE and F\u201d and a dotted line, which plainly, as I think, is intended to define the boundary line between these blocks extending down to the water\u2019s edge of the river. Block F is also thereon shewn, plainly, as I think, to extend to the river along its entire length, from the Maitland bridge to the dotted line, between blocks E and F, which is situated a long way down the river below the bridge. That such was the plain intention is confirmed by reference to the terms of the deed of the 17th February, 1865, although the designations blocks E and F do not appear in that deed. The description in that deed, which comprises those pieces of land, is as follows:\nThe northern unsubdivided portion of the Goderich town plot in the said town of Goderich, butted and bounded as follows:\u2014Commencing at the water\u2019s edge of the river Maitland, at the last limit of Wellington street produced; thence following the several courses of the river Maitland against the stream to within forty-nine and one-half feet of the centre of the approach to the bridge over the river Maitland produced; thence up and parallel with the centre line of that approach, and always distant, forty-nine and one-half feet therefrom to the northern limit of Gloucester Terrace and the intersection of the west limit of Cambria street produced; thence due west along Gloucester Terrace, and divers other courses to the place of beginning.\nAfter describing other lands, the deed then proceeds:\nAlso the Big Meadow on the north side of the river Maitland, in the township of Colborne, in the county of Huron, estimated as containing sixty-one acres of land, be the same more or less.\nThen, after describing other lands, the deed proceeds:\nAlso, all the right, title and interest which the Canada Company may now have in and to those certain parcels or tracts of land covered by water, lying between the townships of Goderich and Colborne, that is to say, by the river Maitland from its confluence with Lake Huron, for a distance up stream of one mile and seven-eighths of a mile.\nThen, after describing other lands situate between the town plot and Lake Huron, the deed proceeds:\nAll the lands and tenements hereinbefore mentioned, and also all the lands and waters an 1 all the rights, titles, privileges and interests in the same, such as the Canada Company may have, are described and laid down on the copy of a map made by Thomas Nepean Molesworth, Deputy Provincial Surveyor, dated third day of June, in the year of our Lord, one thousand eight hundred and fifty-nine, and signed by Frederick Widder and Robert Stuart Carter, on behalf of the respective parties to these presents.\nNow, there cannot, I think, be a doubt that at this time and thence continually until and at the time of the execution by the Buffalo & Lake Huron Railway Co. and the Grand Trunk Railway Co. of the deed of the 3rd of June, 1871, to Ross, the block F extended to the water\u2019s edge of the river Maitland. It is said, however, that the contents of that deed indicate an intention of the proprietors to alter the boundary of the block on the river side and show that what was thereby con- veyed did not extend to the river. The contrary, I think, appears both by the express terms of the deed and by reference to the plan annexed thereto.\nThe deed in terms professes to grant to Ross, his heirs, and assigns for ever, the whole of a piece of land said to be known as block F, excepting certain specially described excepted parts thereof Now, when we bear in mind that the Canada Co. gave to the block its designation and its bounds, and conveyed it to the Buffalo & Lake Huron Railway Co., from whom the Grand Trunk Co. acquired it as surplus lands, which they were under an obligation to sell and to apply the proceeds to a particular purpose if they should not pay the Buffalo & Lake Huron Railway Co. for them at a valuation, there can, I think, be no doubt that when the piece of land is spoken of in this deed as \u201c known as block F,\u201d what is meant must be that block as shown on the plan, registered on the occasion of the contract of purchase made between the Buffalo & Lake Huron Railway Co. and the Canada Co. The deed, however, goes on to define more particularly the land intended to be sold and conveyed to Ross, as follows:\nAll that parcel of block F shown on the plan annexed hereto colored pink.; that is to say, this conveyance covers all of the said block F, excepting the part shown on the plan annexed hereto in green color (which is particularly described) and also excepting and reserving from the said block F the mill race described thus.\nThen follows a minute verbatim description by metes and bounds of the mill race as granted by the lease of July, 1859. This plainly, as it appears to me, expresses the intention of the grantors, the Buffalo & Lake Huron Railway Co., and the Grand Trunk Railway Co., to convey to Ross the whole of block F except the piece colored green and except also so much of the mill race as granted and described in the lease of the 4th July, 1859, as was situate upon block F. Referring, then, to the plan, the part colored pink very plainly, as it appears to me, is shown to reach to the water\u2019s edge of the river, for by far the greater part of the extent of the piece of land It shows, as part of the river, what the plaintiff in his evidence describes as the channel completed by him in 1865 by the construction of a gravel bank in the bed of the river.\nThe plan seems to indicate this channel composing the space between the line shewing such gravel bank, and the piece shaded pink as part of the river Maitland. It may be that, and no doubt is, the fact, that the conformation of the south bank of the river along block F was different from what it was in 1859, when the plan by which the Canada Company sold to the Buffalo & Lake Huron Railway Company was registered.\nNow, it is very plain that no part of this channel above the old head gates in the dam as authorized by the lease of July, 1859, and constructed in that year, comes within the description of the piece colored green, or of the mill-race, as described in that part of the deed to Ross, of the 3rd June, 1871, defining the mill-race which is excepted from the operation of that deed. If then this space between the gravel bank constructed by the plaintiff in the bed of the river and the piece of land shaded pink on the plan, is situate upon and forms part of block F, it passed to Ross by the express terms of the deed, and if it is not part of block F, it is part of the river Maitland, and if it constituted (as there is no doubt upon the evidence it always did for the greater part of the extent immediately above the plaintiff\u2019s old head gates) part of the river Maitland, then the piece shaded pink extending down to this water, the bed of the river ad medium filum aqu\u0153 would pass to Ross. So that, unless specially reserved the land covered with water flowing down between the gravel bank in the bed of the river and the piece shaded pink, and to the middle thread of the river, would and did pass by the deed to Ross. Close up to the bridge for some little distance the river is plainly shewn to wash along the piece of land shaded pink, without any line whatever, similar to that lower down, indicating the gravel bank, and there is no indication whatever on the plan of there being any obstruction whatever across the river, where the stone structure or dam which the, plaintiff claims the right of maintaining, was situtate, from which any argument in support of the contention that the right of maintaining such structure was intended to be reserved can be drawn. The plan rather shows the waters of the river as if they flowed in their natural course, save as they are confined by the gravel bank constructed in the bed of the river to the plaintiffs old head gates as described in the lease of the 4th July, 1859, and as constructed originally in the dam by that deed authorized.\nIndependently of the case of Wheeldon v. Burrows[75], relied upon by the learned counsel for the appellant as establishing that there can be no implied reservation from the deed to Ross of June, 1871, of the easements claimed by the plaintiff, it appears to me to be impossible to contend that that there can be any implied reservation of an easement of a water course as a race-way to a mill over a particular piece of land, when the deed in virtue of which the implied reservation is claimed contains, in very explicit and express terms, a reservation from the grant contained in the deed of a race-way to the same mill site in a wholly different place from that over which the race-way by implication is claimed to be reserved. The principle that expressum facit cessare taciturn seems to me to put that point beyond all question.\nThe effect then of the deed to Ross of June, 1871, was, as it appears to me, to convey to him the land clown to the waters of the river Maitland, as of a piece of land abutting on the river free from any reservation of a right of maintaining the stone structure or dam across the river at the place where the stone structure or dam, which \u2018 the plaintiff claims the right of maintaining, was situate, and free also from any right of easement in the race-way as claimed by the plaintiff; and from any right to affect the waters of the river above a dam constructed within the limits as prescribed or authorized by the leases of July, 1859, and November, 1866, other than in such manner as a dam constructed as thereby authorized would affect the river above it. But it was contended for the respondent that the race-way which the plaintiff now claims the right to enjoy for the purpose of conducting the waters of the river to this mill site, for the mill itself appears to have been burned down in 1872 and not since rebuilt, is the identical one which is described in the indentures of lease of July, 1859, and of November, 1866; that contention must be determined upon the true construction of those instruments, and, in my opinion, cannot be sustained. In support of this contention, the plaintiff was permitted to give evidence of conversations which he alleged that he had had with Mr. Carter, Managing Director of the Buffalo & Lake Huron Railway Company. This evidence was objected to on the part of the defendant, and, in my opinion, should not have been received as the effect, if effect should be given to such conversations, would be, upon oral statements of what had been said by a servant of the company, to put a construction upon indentures executed under the corporate seal of the company, which, in my opinion, would not be authorized by, but would be at variance with, what the deliberately prepared terms of those indentures express. But, even if admissible, the evidence of the plaintiff as to those conversations with Mr. Carter, if they ever did take place, which appears to me to be more than doubtful, is not of such a nature that it would be at all safe to rely upon it or to attach any weight whatever to it.\nThey took place as alleged by the plaintiff in his examination in chief after the completion by him of the works executed in 1865, and after, as the plaintiff alleges, Mr. Carter was aware that the plaintiff had completed such work, but upon cross-examination he is obliged to admit that Mr. Carter left this country and went to England in 1864, when he ceased to be manager of the Buffalo & Lake Huron Railway Company. He then says that it was after Mr. Carter ceased to be manager of the company, that the plaintiff had the conversations spoken of with him; but he was in England in 1865, and, in so far as appears, he does not appear to have had any connection with the company since he left this country for England in 1864 when the lease of November, 1866, was executed to Patterson. The seal of the company was set thereto by the company\u2019s secretary, and that Mr. Carter was ever in this country after 1864 does not appear. If any part of the conversations alluded to did ever take place it can safely be said that they did not take place in or subsequent to 1864, and plaintiff can claim nothing which cannot be claimed under the indenture of lease of November, 1866, to Patterson. It is not necessary to criticise closely the plaintiff\u2019s evidence in relation to this matter, for upon no principle could the company or their assigns, the Grand Trunk Railway Company, be affected by any verbal statements of Mr. Carter to the plaintiff, even when he was the railway company\u2019s manager, in respect of a matter provided for in the indenture of lease to an extent not authorized by the terms of that indenture, but it appears to me that if Mr. Carter ever made any statement of the nature alleged by the plaintiff, it must have been prior to the erection of the dam, which was erected in 1859, at which time it would naturally relate to a dam to be constructed within the limits prescribed and authorized by the lease of July, 1859. It only remains to be observed that in February, 1873, nearly two years after the Grand Trunk Railway Company conjointly with the Buffalo & Lake Huron Railway Company had by the indentures of June, 1871, conveyed The Big Meadow to Macdonald, and that part of block F described in the deed to Ross, under both of whom the defendant now claims, it was not competent for the Grand Trunk Railway Company, even if so minded, to convey to Patterson, through whom the plaintiff claims, any easement, right or privilege, prejudicially affecting the lands so conveyed, not specially reserved in the deeds whereby such lands were respectively granted. Moreover the very precise manner in which the Grand Trunk Railway Company in the deed of February, 1873, describe the race-way thereby intended to be granted according to the identical metes and bounds stated in the indentures of lease of July, 1859, and November, 1866, plainly shows that they entertained no idea of granting any other or different race-way or easement than that mentioned in those indentures, and excepted from the grant to Ross contained in the indenture of 3rd June, 1871. This is also apparent from the plan annexed to the deed to Patterson of February, 1873, and which is therein referred to in the following terms: \u201call of which property covered by this indenture is shown on the plan annexed hereto.\u201d This plan shows no part of the race-way from near the bridge as claimed by the plaintiff, but does exhibit the race-way as described in the lease of July, 1859. The deed to Patterson of February, 1873, after the words \u201cthis indenture made the third day of February, in the year of our Lord, one thousand eight hundred and seventy,\u201d has a blank left in which it is plain that by mistake the word \u201cthree\u201d was omitted to be inserted, for the plaintiff alleges in his bill, and it is admitted, that it was in fact executed in 1873; that it was executed after the deed to Ross of the 3rd June, 1871, appears from the deed itself, wherein the deed to Ross, granting to him that portion of block F conveyed to him by the deed of 3rd June, 1871, is referred to as having been previously executed.\nUpon the whole, then, it appears to me that the plaintiff fails to show any title by grant of the easement as now claimed by him, and that the defendant has shown title, as well to the bed of the river abutting on one side thereof on the big meadow, and on the other on the part of block F, whereof the defendant is seised in fee, which title authorized him to remove the stone structure or dam across the river near the bridge, across the Maitland, the right of the plaintiff to maintain which constitutes the gist and substance of this suit. The plaintiff does not claim any title by prescription to maintain this obstruction in the river as a burthen upon the lands of which the defendant is so seised in fee, and if such a claim had been made, the evidence, in my opinion, wholly fails to support it; and of this opinion also was the learned Vice Chancellor. However, no such claim is made by the plaintiff.\nFor the reasons already given, I am of opinion that this appeal should be allowed, with costs, and that the plaintiff\u2019s bill should be ordered to be dismissed out of the Court of Chancery for Ontario with costs. It is unnecessary to grant to the defendant any thing as prayed by him by way of cross relief, beyond the relief which he obtains by dismissal of plaintiffs bill.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellant: Garrow & Proudfoot.\nSolicitors for respondent: Cameron, Holt & Cameron.\n[1] 7 Ed. ss. 22 & 36.\n[2] 34 U.C.Q.R. 199.\n[3] 7 H. & N. 722.\n[4] 1 H. & G. 113.\n[5] 6 Ch.

C. (P.

C.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench (appeal side) rendered on the 31st day of October last, confirming a judgment of the Superior Court at Montreal, rendered on the 9th of February, 1882, by the Honorable Mr. Justice Papineau, dismissing appellants' action for want of proof.\nThe action was brought by William Punton Munn and Robert Stewart Munn, doing business in Newfoundland under the name and style of John Munn & Co. The declaration sets forth the transaction as being carried out by Lord & Munn, as agents of John Munn & Co., with the defendants acting by their agent William Johnson; that Johnson knew that Lord, Munn & Co., were acting as agents of John Munn & Co., and that Johnson purchased the goods in question, barrels of steamed oil. The declaration sets forth further that Johnson wrote to Lord, Munn & Co. withdrawing his offer, as though it had not been accepted; that Lord, Munn & Co. demurred to this, and that then Johnson authorized Lord, Munn & Co. to sell the oil for account of defendants. The defendants denied that they ever purchased the oil, or had any negotiation with the plaintiffs concerning the oil, or that they had contracted with plaintiffs as alleged in plaintiffs' declaration By a second plea defendants specially denied that Johnson was ever authorized by them, or that he had any authority to enter into the alleged contract on their behalf.\nOn the issues so raised the parties went to proof, and plaintiffs produced James Lord, a partner of Lord, Munn & Co., as a witness. Without objection, Lord proved that Johnson was the agent of the defendants. He was then asked to state \"What occurred on the occasion of \"the visit of Mr. Johnson to your office (i e., office of \"witness), the 26th of May, 1878.\" Witness then related the propositions of Johnson, that Lord, Munn Co. telegraphed to plaintiffs their answer accepting, and that Lord, Munn & Co. then offered the oil as stated. Here defendants' counsel interposed an objection \"to the witness proceeding to detail the conversation, if any, which occurred between him and Mr Johnson on this occasion, inasmuch as it is an attempt to prove by mere verbal conversation a contract for the sale of goods exceeding in value the sum of $50, without having first produced any memorandum in writing, or made any proof within the requirements of Article 1235, C. C.\" This objection was maintained and the ruling was excepted to.\nOn behalf of plaintiff's, witness was then asked: \"Had you in store, on account of Lewis Berger & Sons, \"a quantity of seal oil during the course of the summer \"of 1880?\" Objection was taken to this on similar grounds; the objection was maintained. Witness was then asked: \"Did you or did the plaintiffs \"in this case deliver any oil that you had in your \"possession for themselves; did they employ you to act \"as agent for them to sell it?\" The defendants also objected to this question. They contended it was irrelevant unless it was intended to get witness to say that his firm held the oil for defendants. Other questions, all seeking to elicit from witness answers to show that he had received verbal instructions to deal with the oil as if it were the property of defendants, stored with Lord, Munn & Co., were put; but they were all objected to, and the objections maintained by the court unless some writing could be produced. The witness said there was no such writing. The plaintiffs then asked the following question: \"Did \"the defendants, by their agent, Mr. Johnson, exercise \"any acts of ownership over the said oil so in store \"during the months of July and August and September \"of the year 1880, and if so, state what the said acts of \"ownership were?\" Objection was taken to this question, and the court instructed the witness that \"if there is any writing to establish the said acts of ownership, he may answer.\" The witness says \"there is no exercise of acts of ownership in writing.\" The court thereupon maintained the objection.\nThereupon the appellants asked that the case might be suspended in order to allow them to appeal from the rulings so made by the learned judge, declaring that it was impossible for them to proceed with the further examination of the witnesses, the evidence being virtually stopped.\nThe appellants applied to the Court of Queen's Bench on its appeal side, for leave to appeal from the said orders, but was refused such leave.\nThereupon the appellants had again to proceed, and being shut out from all evidence either of the contract, or acceptance, or delivery, judgment was pronounced dismissing their action.\nAn appeal was taken from the final judgment of the Superior Court to the Court of Queen's Bench, appeal side, and by judgment rendered on 31st October, 1883, the said appeal was dismissed with costs.\nMr. Kerr, Q. C., for appellants:\nThe only question to be decided in this case is the following:\nCan a plaintiff who seeks to recover damages, to the amount of $3,094.71 for breach of contract for the sale of goods exceeding in value $50, from the defendant (there being no writing signed by the defendant) establish by parol evidence that the defendant accepted or received part of the goods, or gave something in earnest to bind the bargain?\nThe provisions of the Civil Code of Lower Canada governing this question are to be found in Arts. 1283 and 1235.\nPrevious to the Civil Code, the same proof that was admissible in England under the 17th section of the Statute of Frauds in all suits founded upon sales of goods was admissible in like suits in Lower Canada.\nIt remains, then, for the elucidation of the present question to enquire whether under the English Statute of Frauds parol testimony (there being no memorandum in writing) could have been admitted in any such suit to establish acceptance and receipt, part payment or earnest.\nUnder that section there can be no doubt that partial delivery and acceptance, payment, either in part or in whole, and earnest could and can be proved in England by parol testimony on a sale of goods, where no memorandum in writing had been signed by the party charged. And that such proof was and is sufficient to cause the contract to be held good[1].\nIn England and elsewhere a different meaning was and is attached to the words \"accept\" and \"receive.\" In the 17th section of the Statute of Frauds they evidently did not mean the same thing, for as laid down by Lord Blackburn in his work on Sales[2]: \"As there may be an actual receipt without any acceptance, so there may be an acceptance without any receipt\u2014an acceptance of part of the goods is an assent by the buyer, meant to be final, that this part of the goods is to be taken by him as his property under the contract and as so far satisfying the contract; the receipt of the goods is the taking possession of them. When the seller gives to the buyer the actual control of the goods, and the buyer accepts such control, he has actually received them.\" Campbell on Sales and Com. Agents[3].\nIn Art. 1235 C. C., L. C., the words being \"accepted or received,\" evidently mean that \"accept\" differs from \"receive,\" and that the same act or process is not intended to be required by the use of the words in the alternative.\nIt is quite settled that the acceptance of the goods, or part of them, as required by the statute, may be constructive only, and that the question whether the facts proven amount to a constructive acceptance is one \"of fact for the jury, not matter of law for the court.\" Benjamin on Sales[4].\nThe constructive acceptance by the buyer may properly be inferred by the jury when he deals with the goods as owner, when he does an act which he would have authority to do as owner, but not otherwise. It is also now finally determined that the goods may remain in the possession of the vendor, if he assume a changed character, and yet be actually received by the vendee. Chaplin v. Rogers[5]; Elmore v. Stone[6].\nBy Art. 1235, C.C., L. C., it is provided that to maintain an action or exception founded on a sale of goods exceeding $50, a memorandum in writing is not required if the buyer \"has accepted or received part of the goods.\"\nWhilst thus under the Statute of Frauds acceptance and actual receipt of part of the goods sold by the buyer causes the agreement to be a binding contract, under Art. 1235 C.C., L. C., either acceptance or receipt produces the same effect.\nIt certainly is very extraordinary that the codifiers should have changed the wording of the 17th section of the Statute of Frauds when they incorporated it into Art. 1235, and yet that they should not, if any change in the law was intended to be effected, have distinguished the new provision in the usual manner.\nMoreover, certain specific meanings had, by a long series of judgments, been attached to the words \"accept\" and \"receive,\" and it would seem to be rash in the extreme to run the risk of unsettling the jurisprudence established for many years by changing the phraseology used in any portion of the provisions of the Statute of Frauds intended to be incorporated into Art. 1235.\nThe use of the word \"or,\" however, between the words \"accepted\" and \"received,\" in Art. 1235, in lieu of the conjunction \"and\" in s. 17 of the Statute of Frauds, cannot have changed the meaning of those words as settled by the courts. Nor can such use of the alteration be held to have prohibited the old mode of proof of either acceptance or receipt by parol testimony, and to have required proof in writing to establish such facts. In conclusion I contend that the article in question, therefore, is productive of this effect, that the action or exception in such case cannot be maintained unless a writing, signed by the party, is proved, or part acceptance, part receipt, or earnest, given by the vendee is established by testimony; but any one of the requirements being fulfilled satisfies the article.\nSuch being the case, it is clear that, under the circumstances, where in the declaration there is an allegation of acceptance or receipt of the whole or any part of the goods, or earnest, the vendor cannot be prohibited from proving by testimony the agreement, the acceptance or receipt of the goods, or earnest, according to the allegations of his declaration. If he fails in establishing by such testimony one of such requisites, his action must be dismissed on the ground that the agreement was non-productive of an obligation; if, on the contrary, he establishes by such testimony either acceptance, receipt or earnest the agreement thereby was transformed into a contract productive of all the obligations arising from a contract of sale.\nAs, in old Roman law, the verbal, literal and real contracts required certain formalities over and above the mere agreement of the contracting parties; in the verbal, a form of words in the shape of a question and answer between the contracting parties; in the literal, an entry in a ledger or table-book; and, in the real, the delivery of the thing, ere the agreement was clothed with the obligation, so under the 17th section of the Statute of Frauds are partial acceptance and receipt, part payment, earnest, or a memorandum in writing, required to make the agreement good. And under Art. 1235 in like manner a memorandum in writing, partial acceptance, or delivery, or earnest, ripens the agreement into a contract.\nMr. Tait, Q.C., for respondents: The appellants made no attempt to prove any tender of the goods to the respondents, or any sale of them, or that they sustained any loss or damage by the non-reception of the goods by the respondents.\nThe decisions of the courts below as to reception of the evidence should not be disturbed, because the appellants have not made out a case in which it is permitted to prove a contract of sale by verbal testimony under Art. 1235 C. C., P. Q.\nThe learned counsel also referred to Campbell on Sales[7].\nRITCHIE, C. J.:\nThe appellants in this case offered to prove by verbal evidence the fact of the acceptance or partial acceptance by, and of delivery to, and the exercise of acts of ownership by the respondents over the oil sold, also to prove verbally the contract by witnesses, but the learned judge was of opinion that such acts could only be proved by writing, and the appellant being prevented from making such verbal proof, judgment was pronounced dismissing the action.\nThis being a commercial transaction, I think the judge should have allowed the questions proposed to the witnesses to be put and answered. I think the learned judge was in error in thinking that acceptance, or partial acceptance, or delivery, or the exercise of acts of ownership over the oil sold, could only be proved by writing. In England to make the sale good, the requisites of the statute of frauds not having been complied with, the buyer should \"accept part of the goods so sold and actually receive the same,\" By article 1235 C. C. L. C. in sale of goods over $50 a memo. in writing is not required if the buyer \"has accepted or received part of the goods, or given something in earnest to bind the bargain.\" It is quite clear to me that proof of acceptance, or receipt, or earnest given, may be by parol testimony, and proof in writing to establish such facts is not necessary. The witness should have been allowed to answer the questions proposed\u2014we cannot anticipate what the answers would have been, or whether they would have sustained plaintiff's contention.\nSTRONG, J., concurred.\nFOURNIER, J.:\nLes faits de cette cause ont donn\u00e9 lieu \u00e0 la question suivante: Dans un contrat de vente commerciale exc\u00e9dant $50, le d\u00e9mandeur, poursuivant en dommages pour refus d'ex\u00e9cuter le contrat, peut-il faire la preuve testimoniale que le d\u00e9fendeur a accept\u00e9 ou re\u00e7u une partie des effets vendus, ou qu'il a donn\u00e9 des arrhes pour rendre le march\u00e9 obligatoire, lorsqu'il n'y a pas eu d'\u00e9crit sign\u00e9 par le d\u00e9fendeur?\nEn mati\u00e8re de commerce, le principe g\u00e9n\u00e9ral est, article 1233, que la preuve testimoniale est admise \"de tout fait relatif \u00e0 des mati\u00e8res commerciales.\" mais \u00e0 ce principe il y a des exceptions, et entre autres celles de l'article 1235: \"Dans toutes les mati\u00e8res commerciales o\u00f9 la somme des deniers ou la valeur dont il s'agit exc\u00e8de cinquante piastres, aucune action ou exception ne peut \u00eatre maintenue contre une personne ou ses repr\u00e9sentants, sans un \u00e9crit sign\u00e9 par elle,\" dans les cas suivants entre autres: De tout contrat pour la vente d'effets, \u00e0 moins que l'acheteur n'ait accept\u00e9 ou re\u00e7u une partie ou n'ait donn\u00e9 des arrhes.\nLa r\u00e8gle qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de a lieu lors m\u00eame que les effets ne doivent \u00eatre livr\u00e9s qu'\u00e0 une \u00e9poque future, ou ne sont pas, au temps du contrat, pr\u00eats \u00e0 \u00eatre livr\u00e9s.\nCet article est en substance la clause 17 du Statute of Frauds, en force dans la province de Qu\u00e9bec longtemps avant l'adoption du Code Civil. Dans l'application de ce statut on se conformait \u00e0 la jurisprudence cr\u00e9\u00e9e en Angleterre par de nombreuses d\u00e9cisions rendues sur son interpr\u00e9tation.\nCette clause 17, d'o\u00f9 est tir\u00e9 notre article 1235, en diff\u00e8re dans un point important; le statut imp\u00e9rial dit:\nNo contract for the sale of any goods, wares and merchandises for the price (value) of ten pounds sterling or upwards, shall be allowed to be good, except the buyer shall accept part of the goods so sold, and actually receive the same, or give something in earnest to bind the bargain, or in part payment, or that some note or memorandum in writing of the said bargain be made and signed by the parties to be charged by such contract, or their agents thereto, lawfully authorized.\nOn voit par le texte de cette clause que l'acceptation et la r\u00e9ception de fait (actual receipt) sont toutes deux n\u00e9cessaires pour faire admettre la preuve testimoniale, lorsqu'il n'y a point de memorandum sign\u00e9 par la partie que l'on veut rendre responsable. Telle a \u00e9t\u00e9 la jurisprudence constante en Angleterre. En vertu de l'art. 1235 il n'en est pas de m\u00eame, l'acceptation ou la r\u00e9ception d'une partie des effets suffit pour dispenser de la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 de produire un \u00e9crit. Cet article s'exprime dans l'alternative, en se servant de la disjonctive ou, au lieu d'employer la conjonction et comme dans le statut imp\u00e9rial. Il y a certainement l\u00e0 une grande diff\u00e9rence, et ce langage est si clair qu'il est impossible de pr\u00e9tendre que le texte de l'article 1235 doit \u00eatre lu comme le statut imp\u00e9rial qui emploie la conjonction entre les mots acceptation et r\u00e9ception.\nLes mots acceptation (acceptance) et r\u00e9ception n'ont pas dans le Statute of Frauds la m\u00eame signification; ils signifiaient \u00e9videmment dans l'intention du l\u00e9gislateur deux choses diff\u00e9rentes dont il exigeait le concours pour dispenser de la production d'un \u00e9crit. C'est l'opinion de Lord Blackburn dans son trait\u00e9 \"On Sales\" o\u00f9 il s'exprime comme suit sur la signification de ces deux mots[8]:\nAs there may be an actual receipt without any acceptance, so there may be an acceptance without any receipt. An acceptance of part of the goods is an assent by the buyer meant to be fixed, that this part of the goods is to be taken by him as his property under the contract and as so far satisfying the contract\u2014the receipt of the goods is the taking possession of them. When the seller gives to the buyer the actual control of the goods, and the buyer accepts such control, he has actually received them.\nLes codificateurs ont sans doute trouv\u00e9 dans cette diff\u00e9rence entre l'acceptation et la r\u00e9ception un motif suffisant pour admettre que l'existence de l'une ou de l'autre aurait le m\u00eame effet que la r\u00e9union des deux en vertu de la clause 17 du Statute of Frauds. On ne peut en cons\u00e9quence refuser de donner effet au changement introduit par l'article 1235. Toutefois le code en n'exigeant que l'acceptation ou la r\u00e9ception, et en donnant un m\u00eame effet l\u00e9gal \u00e0 l'un ou \u00e0 l'autre, n'en a pas chang\u00e9 la signification \u00e9tablie par la jurisprudence, ni modifi\u00e9 le mode d'en faire la preuve, suivi par cette jurisprudence, qui admettait la preuve testimoniale de l'acceptance and actual receipt. Le code sous ce rapport n'a point modifi\u00e9 cette jurisprudence, il n'y est dit nulle part dans l'article 1235 que la preuve de l'acceptation ou de la r\u00e9ception de partie des effets devra \u00eatre faite par \u00e9crit\u2014au contraire, lorsque l'une ou l'autre de ces deux conditions existe, il dispense de l'obligation de produire un \u00e9crit, comme dans le cas o\u00f9 des arrhes ont \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9e. Si, comme je le crois, cette interpr\u00e9tation est correcte, la preuve testimoniale de l'acceptation ou r\u00e9ception de partie des effets vendus, tel que all\u00e9gu\u00e9 dans la d\u00e9claration, peut \u00eatre re\u00e7ue.\nHENRY, J.:\nThis is an action to recover the price of a quantity of oil alleged to have been sold and delivered by the appellants to the respondents. The contract set out in the declaration was not in writing, and the respondents refused to complete the purchase. The declaration alleges an acceptance of a portion of the oil, the storing of it by the agents of the appellants at the request of the agent of the respondents, and the sale of a part of it by the same direction. At the trial the appellants, having proved the contract for the sale, were proceeding to adduce oral evidence, when the learned judge before whom the cause was tried, on objection raised on the part of the respondents, decided that, under the terms of the Civil Code, the evidence of acceptance or delivery must be proved by a writing signed by the party to be affected by it; and, rejecting the oral evidence tendered, dismissed the action with costs. On appeal to the Court of Queen's Bench, the judgment of the court of first instance was affirmed, with costs, and from the latter judgment the case came by another appeal to this court; and having been argued it awaits our judgment. The only question before us is as to the ruling of the learned judge in rejecting the evidence in question.\nBy the article of the Civil Code applicable to this case (1285), it is provided as follows:\nIn commercial matters in which the sum of money or value in question exceeds fifty dollars no action or exception can be maintained against any party or his representatives, unless there is a writing signed by the former in the following cases. 4. Upon any contract for the sale of goods, unless the buyer has accepted or received part of the goods or given something in earnest to bind the bargain;\u2014the foregoing rule applies, although the goods be intended to be delivered at some future time, or be not at the time of the contract ready for delivery.\nWhat then, is the meaning of the second proviso? The first part of the article provides that no action or exception can be maintained on a contract, the amount of which exceeds fifty dollars, unless it is in writing and signed by the proper party, and the effect of the second proviso is to except from the operation of the first provision of the article cases where the buyer has accepted or received part of the goods, or given something to bind the bargain. The articles were adopted from sec. 17 of the English statute of frauds; but in one important respect they differ. Under the latter there must be a delivery out of the possession and control of the vendor, so as to destroy his (vendor's) lien; for the continuance of such lien necessarily implies that he retains the possession. By a proper and legitimate construction of the provision in the code the \"acceptance\" or \"delivery\" of part of the goods is sufficient. The words admit, I think, of no other construction.\nIt is not necessary to constitute an acceptance and delivery under the statute of frauds that the position or location of the goods should be changed. In Kershaw v. Ogden[9], it was decided that, though the goods remain in the personal possession of the vendor, yet, if it is agreed between the vendor and vendee, that the possession shall thenceforth be kept, not as vendor, but as bailee for the purchaser, the right of lien is gone, and then there is a sufficient receipt to satisfy the statute. Numerous cases have been decided in England on the same principle.\nRoscoe, in his work on Nisi Prius Evidence[10]. says:\nThere need not be an actual delivery, but there may be something tantamount. Such as the delivery to the buyer of a key of the warehouse in which the goods are lodged or the delivery of other indicia of property.\nLord Kenyon, C. J., in Chaplin v. Rogers, says[11]:\nAnd this is evidence of acceptance as well as delivery.\nA written order given by the seller of goods to the buyer, directing the person in whose care the goods are to deliver them, is a sufficient receipt within the statute, provided the person to whom it is directed accept the order for delivery and assent to hold the goods as the agent of the buyer. See Searle v. Keeves[12]; Bentall v. Burn[13]; and Salter v. Woollams[14].\nThe declaration contains allegations that the oil in question on arrival art Montreal was taken out of the ship and stored by the directions of the agent of the respondent, who told the latter that he would be satisfied to receive the same on the then present gauge and inspection, and would not require it to be re-gauged on delivery. Shortly after the storage of the oil, the agent of the appellants at Montreal was requested by the agent of the respondent to sell it at a certain named price, and he, acting on such instructions, sold a portion of it at the price so fixed by the agent of the respondents. The appellants should have been permitted to give oral evidence of these facts as showing an acceptance of the oil and a delivery also. I think that such evidence was admissible under the article of the code to which I have referred, and, that as such evidence was improperly rejected on the trial, I think the judgment of the Superior Court dismissing the appellants action and that of the Court of Queen's Bench affirming it should be set aside and a new trial granted with all costs.\nGWYNNE, J.:\u2014\nI also am of opinion that this appeal must be allowed. In an action upon a contract for the sale of goods exceeding the sum of $50, where there is no written contract, oral evidence of the acceptance of the goods by the defendants, is as admissible under article 1235 of the C. C. of the Province of Quebec as it is under the provisions of the Statute of Frauds in England. The evidence, therefore, which was tendered by the plaintiffs for the purpose of proving acceptance by the defendants in this case should have been received. Whether the evidence, when received, shall prove to be sufficient to entitle the plaintiffs to recover in this action, is a question with which we cannot be in a position to deal until we shall see what the extent of the evidence is.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellants: Kerr & Garter.\nSolicitors for respondents: Abbott, Tait & Abbott.\n[1] Browne, Statute of Frauds, 315, 322 and 337, and cases there cited.\n[2] Pp. 22 & 23.\n[3] P. 169.\n[4] 3rd ed., 130, 148, 149, and cases there cited.\n[5] 1 East 195.\n[6] 1 Taunt. 458.\n[7] P. 169.\n[8] Pp. 22-23.\n[9] 3 H. & C. 717, and 34 L.

Ritchie, C.J., and Strong, Fournier, Henry and Gwynne, JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF QUEEN'S BENCH FOR LOWER CANADA (APPEAL SIDE).\nRailway Bonds\u201439 Vic., ch. 57 (P. Q.), construction of\u2014Condition Precedent\u2014Certificate of Engineer, contents of\u2014Parol evidence inadmissible\u2014 Onus probandi.\nThe L. and K. Ry. Co. was incorporated in 1869 (32 Vic., ch. 54), to construct a railway from Levis to the frontier of the state of Maine, a distance of 90 miles. The company was authorized by that act to issue bonds or debentures to provide funds for the construction of the railway.\nIn 1872, by 36 Vic., ch. 45, power was given to issue bonds to the amount of three million dollars, without limitation of time, and without restriction as to the length of the railway constructed. In 1874, a statute of the Legislature of Quebec (37 Vic., ch. 23), declared that debentures to the amount of $280,000 had already been issued, and limited for the future the issuing of bonds to the amount of \u00a3300,000 stg., to be issued as follows: \u2014The first issue of \u00a3100,000 at once $ the second issue of \u00a3100,000 when 45 miles of the road should have been completed and in running order, as certified by the Government Inspecting Engineer; and the third issue of \u00a3100,000 as soon as 30 additional miles\u2014making in all 75 miles\u2014should have been completed, with the same privilege for the three issues.\nIn 1875, by the Act 39 Vic., ch. 57, the Legislature amended the former acts so as to modify the condition to be fulfilled by the L and K. Ry. Co. before the third issue of \u00a3100,000 could be by them made. This condition was as enaoted by the said Act (39 Vic., ch. 57) \"so soon as the rails and fastenings required \"for the completion of the remaining forty-five miles or thereabouts \"of the company's line shall have been provided, then \"the remaining one thousand bonds, of one hundred pounds\" each, to be termed the third issue, may be issued by the \"company.\"\nIn that Act lastly cited, the preamble declared: \"Whereas it \"appears that a total length of forty-five miles of the company's \"line having been completed, a first and second issue each of \"one hundred thousand pounds of the company's debentures \"have been made.\"\nIn March, 1881, the L. and K. Ry. was sold by the sheriff at the suit of the plaintiffs the W. M. Co., and bought by the Q. C. R. Co. respondents for $195,000.\nIn April, 1881, the corporation of the city of Quebec (appellants), filed an opposition afin de conserver for $218,099, being the amount of 300 debentures of \u00a3100 sterling and interest of the second issue issued on the 25th January, 1875, numbered 1020 and upwards, payable on the 1st January, 1894, and for the payment of which the opposants alleged that the said railroad was hypothecated.\nThe Q. C. Ry. Co., also opposants in the case, contested the opposition of the corporation of the city of Quebec, and claimed the issue of the bonds of the second issue and held by the appellants was illegal. At the trial no certificate was produced, but the government engineer stated that he had reported to the Minister of Railways that there were only 43\u00bd miles of the road completed, and the secretary of the company testified that the total length of railway certified by the government engineer as being complete and in running order had never exceeded 43\u00bd miles. The learned judge at the trial found as a fact that there were only 43\u00bd miles completed, and held the bonds of the second issue invalid. This judgment was affirmed by the Court of Queen's Bench (appeal side).\nOn appeal to the Supreme Court, it was\nHeld (reversing the judgment of the court below)\u2014That the effect of the statute 39 Vic., ch. 57 is to make the bonds therein mentioned good, valid and binding upon the company, although the conditions precedent specified in 37 Vic., oh. 23, might not have been fulfilled when they were issued.. (Ritchie, C. J., and Strong, J., dissenting.)\nPer Fournier and Henry, JJ., that as there was evidence that a certificate or report had been given, oral evidence of the contents of the certificate or report was inadmissible and therefore respondents had failed to prove the illegality of the second issue.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada (appeal side).\nThe facts and pleadings sufficiently appear in the head note, and judgments hereinafter given.\nMr. P. A. Pelletier, Q.C., for appellants:\nThe ground upon which the respondents contend that the appellants are not entitled to rank pari passu with them on the proceeds of the judicial sale of Levis & Kennebec Railway is that forty-five miles of the road had not been completed, a condition precedent, they alleged, necessary to legalize the issue of the bonds of which they are the holders. First, I submit that if the bonds mentioned in their opposition have been issued previous to the completion of the 45 miles of the road, and without the production of the certificate of the Government engineer, these bonds have nevertheless been declared valid and legally issued, by the Act 39 Vic., ch. 57.\nThe legislative power which has imposed certain conditions on the Levis & Kennebec Railway Company on the issue of the bonds, had the right to alter, change, and even remove those conditions. The Legislature which, in 1874, had authorized the issuing of the bonds only after 45 miles would have been completed, had the right to declare, in 1875, that those bonds were valid, though issued before the completion of the 45 miles of the road.\nAdmitting that, conformably to the Act 39 Vic., ch. 57, the Levis and Kennebec Railway Company had purchased the rails and ties or fastenings for the remainder of the road to the frontier, and that the bonds of the third issue be legal would not the bonds of the second issue be legal? Certainly they would. And there is no proof of record that the rails and ties have not been purchased, and that the bonds of the third issue have not been issued. But if the bonds of the third issue have or had been issued regularly after the purchase of the rails and ties, how can it be pretended that the bonds of the second issue would nevertheless be null? Such a pretension would lead to a very illogic, abnormal consequence, to a consequence manifestly in contradiction with the intention of the Legislature.\nIf the appellants fail on this branch of the case, then I submit that the proof adduced by the respondents is not only insufficient, but it is also illegal. The certificate of the engineer not having been produced, it was not competent to prove the contents thereof by oral testimony.\nGeo. Irvine, Q.C., for respondents:\nNo consideration of the equities of the case can affect the legal rights of the parties.\nThe learned judge who heard this case, came to the conclusion, as a matter of fact, that the length of the road at the time of the issue of these bonds mentioned in the statute was not completed.\nThe evidence of the secretary and of the engineer proves that fact beyond all doubt, and the condition precedent not having been fulfilled, the second issue of bonds is illegal.\nThen, if it is admitted that the road was not completed, as it must be, I submit the insertion of the statement in the preamble of the Act 39 Vic., ch. 57 (which is a private Act) can have no effect. Any misrepresentations of fact or law in the preamble or body of a private Act can be shown. Ballard v. Way[1]; Shrewsbury Peerage Case[2]; Hardcastle on Statutes[3].\nRITCHIE, C.J.:\u2014\nThe Levis and Kennebec Railway was brought to sale by the Sheriff of the District of Quebec, at the suit of The Wason Manufacturing Company, the original plaintiffs in this case, and was adjudged to the Quebec Central Railway Company on the 22nd March, 1881, for the sum of $192,000. Upon this sale the Quebec Central Railway Company, the present respondents, fyled an opposition claiming $272.537.34, being the amount of several sterling bonds of the Levis and Kennebec Railway Company mentioned in the opposition. The corporation of Quebec, the present appellants, also fyled an opposition based upon a number of bonds alleged to be held by them, and for the amount of which they also claimed to be collocated upon the proceeds of the sale. The opposition of the corporation of Quebec was contested by the Quebec Central Railway Company on the ground that the bonds held by them were illegally issued, and consequently null and void, and this contestation was maintained by the judgment of the Superior Court, rendered on the 19th December, 1882.\nThe circumstances which have given rise to the present contestation may be shortly stated as follows:\nThe Levis and Kennebec Railway Company was incorporated by an Act of the Legislature of the Province of Quebec passed 32 Vic., (1869) chap. 54, which Act was subsequently amended by the 36 Vic., (1872) chap. 45, and again amended by the 37 Vic., (1874) chap. 23, assented to 28th January, 1874, which is the only Act necessary to be referred to for the purposes of the present case. The first section of this Act enacts as follows:\nThe following words in the twelfth, thirteenth, fourteenth and fifteenth lines, in the fourth section of 36 Victoria, chapter 45, to wit: \"The said company shall have power to issue bonds to the amount of three million dollars, the capital of the said company, and such bonds shall not be for less than five hundred dollars each,\" are struck out, and the following are substituted therefor; \"The said Company shall have power to issue debentures to the amount of three hundred thousand pounds sterling, and such debentures shall not be for less than one hundred pounds sterling each; provided, however, that until forty-five miles of the said company's railway shall be completed and in running order, as certified by the government inspecting engineer, no more than one thousand of the said debentures of hundred pounds sterling each, to be termed the first issue, shall be issued by the company; and as soon as such forty-five miles shall have been certified as complete and in running order as aforesaid, then a further issue of one thousand bonds of one hundred pounds sterling each, to be termed the second issue, may be made by the company, and no more of such bonds shall be issued by the company until seventy-five miles of the said road (inclusive of the aforesaid forty-five miles) shall be complete and in running order, as certified by the government inspecting engineer; and so soon as such seventy-five miles shall have been certified as completed and in running order as aforesaid, then the remaining one thousand bonds of one hundred pounds sterling each, to be termed the third issue, may be issued by the company, it being understood, however, and hereby declared, that such terms 'first issue,' 'second issue' and 'third issue' shall be for convenience only of this bill, and shall not be deemed to give any of the said issues priority one over another.\"\nThis act was again amended by the 39 Vic., (1875) chap. 57, assented to the 24th December, 1875, the preamble of which recites as follows:\nWhereas the Levis and Kennebec Railway Company have prayed, that the act to amend their act of incorporation be amended in the particulars hereinafter set forth, and it is expedient to grant their prayer; and whereas it appears that a total length of forty-five miles of the company's line having been completed, a first and second issue, each of one hundred thousand pounds of the company's debentures, have been made, each of such issues consisting of one thousand debentures of one hundred pounds sterling each; and whereas, since the passing of the said amended act, the subsidy by the Provincial Legislature has been increased to four thousand dollars per mile, and that further subsidies are about to be granted by various municipalities through which the line passes, thus providing a considerable portion of the amount required for the completion of the earth works and bridges on the forty-five miles of lines remaining to be completed; and whereas, to insure the speedy completion of the said forty-five miles now incomplete, it is expedient that the rails and fastenings required should be provided without delay.\nImmediately on the passing of the act of 1874, the company issued \u00a3100,000 of bonds, as they had a right to do under the provisions of the said act. The bonds claimed by the respondents form part of this issue, which consist of one thousand bonds of one hundred pounds sterling each. The claim of the corporation of the city of Quebec, is founded upon bonds of the second issue.\nThese debentures of the second issue are headed, \"The Levis and Kennebec Railway,\" province of Quebec, Dominion of Canada, incorporated by a special act of the Legislature of the province of Quebec, assented to on the fifth day of April, 1869, amended by an act assented to the 24th day of December, 1872, and further amended by an act assented to the 28th day of January, 1874,\" and on their face purport to be issued under the authority of the above-mentioned acts and of the Quebec Railway Act, 1869, and were issued the 25th January, 1875, 11 months before the passing of the 39 Vic., cap. 57.\nThe contestation by the Quebec Central Railway Company alleges that inasmuch as the Levis and Kennebec Railway Company was only authorized to make the second issue of bonds when forty-five (45) miles of their road was completed and in running order as certified by the government inspecting engineer, and that as no such length of railway had ever been built by them, or ever certified by the engineer, this second issue was illegal, null and void. The evidence clearly shows that only forty-three and a-half (43\u00bd) miles of road had been completed up to the date of the sale by the Sheriff in 1881, and the government engineer states that he never gave any certificate for that length of line, The appellants, the corporation of the city of Quebec, contend on the other hand, that although it may be true as a matter of fact that the proper length of road had not been completed, the preamble of the Act of 1875 justifies them in claiming the legality of the bonds held by them.\nI think we have nothing whatever to do in this case with the sale by the sheriff, but only with the proceeds of that sale. Both parties admit the sale to have been right, and no question is raised as to whether the sheriff sold too much or too little, nor as to what the purchasers were entitled to, or what their rights are under such sale. As to these questions all parties appear to be perfectly satisfied and to agree that if both these issues of debentures are legal the proceeds should be divided among the holders of such debentures in rateable proportion, but if the second issue are illegal, then the whole should be paid to the holders of the first issue. This is not a controversy between the holders of the second issue and the company that issued them, but between the holders of the first and second issues, and it is quite clear that the company and the holders of the second issue could not by any combination of theirs cut down the security of the holders of the first issue unless what they did had legislative sanction.\nIt is not, therefore, necessary to discuss or decide whether, if the money raised on these debentures has been bon\u00e2 fide applied for the purposes of the company, the bon\u00e2 fide lender is or is not entitled to payment as against the company; nor is it a question between the holders of these debentures and the directors who issued them, nor between the shareholders and the directors or company. The sole controversy is whether the second issue of debentures are valid as debentures and entitled as such to rank pari passu on the money in court with those of the unquestionably legal first issue; in short, between the holders of the bonds legally issued and the holders of the bonds alleged to have been illegally issued, and the determination of this question will, in my opinion, depend entirely and solely on the question: whether since the issue of the second debentures they have been legalized directly, or there has been such a legislative recognition of their legality as to place them on an equal footing with the first issue.\nAs to the illegality of the second issue at the time the issue was made, I do not think there is room for any doubt.\nIt is hardly possible to conceive that the legislature could have used more clear and explicit language, not only limiting the right to issue debentures, but actually prohibiting the issue of debentures except as provided, Power is given to issue debentures to the amount of \u00a3300,000 stg., and such debentures shall not be for less than \u00a3100 stg. Provided, however, that until 45 miles of the said company's railway shall be complete and in running order, as certified by the government inspecting engineer, no more than one thousand of the said debentures of \u00a3100 stg. each, to be termed \"the first issue,\" shall be issued by the said company. Could stronger prohibitory words have been used? They are negative and prohibitory, yet as if to remove the possibility of a doubt as to the intention of the legislature, that the company should have no right to issue debentures beyond such first issue till the 45 miles shall not only have been complete, but shall have been certified as complete and in running order, the legislation contains the enactment: \"And as soon as such 45 miles have been certified as complete and in running order as aforesaid, then a further issue of one thousand bonds of \u00a3100 stg. each, to be termed 'the second issue\" may be made by the company.\"\nIs there anything ambiguous here\u2014is there any room for doubt or argument? Could a condition precedent to the right to issue more bonds be more clearly or explicitly stated? And this it must be remembered is an act passed to amend a previous act which contained these words: \"The said company shall have power to \"issue bonds to the amount of $3,000,000, the capital \"of the said company, and such bonds shall not be for \"less than $500 each,\" by directing these words to be struck out and substituting those I have referred to, limiting and prohibiting the issuing of debentures, except as provided for in the manner I have pointed out.\nAfter the passing of this act the company issued, as they had a right to do, 1,000 debentures of \u00a3100 stg. each, which became for the time being a first charge on the road. But in the face of these statutory provisions referred to, not only without authority of law, but in direct defiance of the legislature, when 45 miles of the road were not complete and in running order and were not so certified by the government inspecting engineer,\u2014for it is not questioned, and under the evidence cannot be questioned, that 45 miles were not complete and in running order, and such 45 miles were not certified as being complete and in running order by the government engineer\u2014the second bonds were issued; that is to say, the company on the 25th January, 1875, issued 300 debentures of \u00a3100 stg., those now held by the city of Quebec. If the conditions of a statutable power are not complied with, how can it be said to be lawfully exercised? Can any person, lawyer or layman, who can read and understand the English language, say otherwise than that the debentures so issued were issued not, only without authority of law, but in direct opposition to a clear and express enactment of the legislature, and therefore illegally issued and consequently void, and no more in fact and in law than waste paper.\nI have therefore no difficulty in coming to the conclusion, forty-five miles of the road not having been completed, that the company in issuing the second bonds pledged their funds, not only in an unauthorized but in a forbidden manner, in a manner beyond their powers at the time the issue was made, and for which they had not obtained parliamentary authority; even if the issue was made in the expectation of such authority being obtained, the bonds were improvidently and illegally issued without reference to the necessity of 45 miles of the road being first completed.\nIt seems almost a waste of time to refer to authorities on a matter which seems so clear as that the second bonds were illegal when issued.\nRe Poolery Hall Colliery Company[4]:\nBy the articles of association of a company, extended by a special resolution, the directors were empowered to incur debts and to borrow on mortgage and other securities to an amount not exceeding \u00a38,000. They issued a number of debentures at a time when the liabilities of the company exceeded \u00a38,000; and it was held, that the debentures were not voidable, but absolutely void, and that the holders of them could only come in pari passu with the simple contract creditors for the amounts seceured by their debentures.\nLord Romilly in that case said:\nWith respect to the debenture holders, I think the validity of the debentures depends upon the fact of whether the liabilities did or did not exceed \u00a38,000, at the date of the issue. That was the amount which was fixed as the limit.\n* * * * * * Therefore I am of opinion that if the liabilities of the company exceeded \u00a38,000, they had no power to issue these debentures; that they are not voidable, but that they were absolutely void, the directors having had no authority to issue them.\nIn Wales v. Ropert[5], in which case the debentures were declared void as being for a sum in excess of the borrowing powers of the company, Keating, J., says:\nSo far as binding the company is concerned that document was mere waste paper. The directors had no power to issue it, and it was afterwards held by the Court of Chancery to be absolutely and ab initio void.\nIn reference to a railway company whose borrowing powers were not to arise until a certain portion of their line was open for traffic, in speaking of debentures issued in contravention of such statutory powers as being invalid, In re Bagnalstown and Wexford Railway Co.[6], the Lord Justice of appeal says:\u2014\nThe former is limited by the number and values of the shares; the latter (their loan capital) undergoes a two-fold limitation, viz: first, a restriction of the total that may be borrowed; second, the imposition of conditions precedent, such as, in some companies, that the whole share capital be subscribed for and one-half of it actually paid up; in others, that the undertaking shall have begun to be productive, by the opening of the line or of described portions of it. Any attempt to add to the loan capital in violation of either of those restrictions\u2014i.e., either after the full amount permitted has been already borrowed, or before the prescribed conditions precedent have been fulfilled\u2014would be illegal, and the debentures so issued would be invalid.\nIn re The Cork and Youghal Railway Co., exparte, Overend, Gurney & Co. (limited)[7]\nThe railway company had exhausted their capital and borrowing powers; but their undertaking was yet incomplete. At a general meeting of the company, a balance sheet, showing the then amount of excess, was laid before the company, and a resolution was adopted authorizing the board to issue to L., their financial agent, bonds to be settled by counsel. Lloyd's bonds to a large amount were accordingly given to L., upon which he raised money, some part of which, it was not disputed, was applied in payment of the company's debts and completing their works, and the bonds passed from L. into the hands of the present respondents, who carried in claims against the proceeds of sale of the railway under a special Act of parliament for its dissolution, and claimed to be entitled to a surplus of such proceeds in priority to the shareholders. On appeal by the shareholders, it was held that, although it was not law that no creditor who trusted the company after its capital and borrowing powers were exhausted could recover what was due to him, yet any debenture, loan notes, or the like, for the mere borrowing of money in excess of the company's powers, were void; but as the moneys raised in this case had been applied in paying debts of the company, and otherwise for the purposes of its undertaking, with the sanction and acquiescence of its shareholders, these latter could not be entitled to the surplus of the company's property without repaying all moneys so raised and expended.\nThe Lord Chancellor said:\nOn the other hand it was equally clear, or it has been made clear, if it was not clear before by the case of Chambers v. The Manchester & Milford Railway Co., and the very able and lucid judgment there given, especially that of Mr. Justice Blackburn, that any scheme by which a company is authorized only to raise a given amount of capital by shares, and then a certain other quantity, usually one-third, of the share capital is prescribed by the Act of parliament under which it acts, in the shape of debentures or mortgages, they cannot issue any debenture, or loan note, or any security of that description, for the mere purpose of borrowing money; and I apprehend any such instrument so issued would be just as void in equity as at law, being contrary altogether to statute, and being absolutely forbidden by statute; for I entirely adopt the view which was taken by the learned judges, that that thing, in respect of which a penalty is inflicted by statute, must be taken to be a thing forbidden, and absolutely void to all intents and purposes whatsoever.\nThat being so, this distinction is drawn by Mr. Justice Blackburn, which appears to me to be very plain and clear. He says[8]:\nThey (that means these instruments) are on their face the acknowledgment of a debt to some particular person, with a covenant to pay it. Such instruments may be useful in this way: when a company are indebted it may be convenient to make a bond pointing to a particular portion of the debt actually due; it would facilitate the assignment in equity of the debt thus acknowledged to be due, and possibly throw upon the company the onus of showing the non-existence of the debt. But if there be no debt existing, such an instrument cannot create one, nor put any assignee in a better position than the original obligee or covenantee; and the person holding it could not recover upon it, if it was shown that it was given gratuitously, or was not authorized by statute.\"\nLord Justice Giffard said:\u2014\nI think it of importance to state clearly in this case that it is not intended by the court to throw the slightest doubt on the decision come to in the case of Chambers v. The Manchester amd Milford Railway Co., and, from the course which the matter took in the court below, I think it also important to say that there is no ground whatever for the argument that a contract or instrument which fails in a court of law by reason of its illegality can, nevertheless, be enforced in equity, bacause money has been paid and received in respect of it. Equitable terms can be imposed on a plaintiff seeking to set aside an illegal contract as the price of the relief he asks, but as to any claim sought to be actively enforced, the defence of illegality is as available in a court of equity as it is in a court of law; and it is for that reason, among others, that the declaration made by the court below has been varied. That, of course, is no answer to the present case.\nBut it is now contended that a new Act was passed by which the validity of these bonds is established, the practical effect of which would be that from the date of their issue, 25th January, 1875, up to the passage of this Act on the 24th December, 1875, the rights of the holders of the first issue, continued as a first and only charge, in no way affected by this illegal issue, but were by the passing of this Act swept away and the holders of the illegal issue placed on the same footing as the holders of the first issue legally made, and entitled to rate concurrently, as no doubt they would have been entitled to do, if such second issue had been legally made.\nIf the legislature contemplated legislation of this exceptional and retrospective character, we shall require to find such an intention clearly and unequivocally expressed. The Act relied on is the 39 Vic. ch. 57, which was passed, as appears by the preamble above cited, at the instance and on the prayer of the Levis & Kennebec Railway Co., and which enacts as follows,\nThe following words in the 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29 and 30th lines of the first section of 37 Vic., ch. 23, to wit:\nAnd no more of such bonds shall be issued by the company until seventy-five miles of the said road (inclusive of the aforesaid forty-five miles) shall be complete and in running order as certified by the government inspecting engineer, and so soon as such said seventy-five miles shall have been certified as completed and in running order as aforesaid, then the remaining one thousand bonds of one hundred pounds sterling each, to be termed the third issue, may be issued by the company are struck out and the following are substituted therefor:\nAnd as soon as the rails and fastenings required for the completion of the remaining forty-five miles or thereabouts of the company's line shall have been provided, then the remaining one thousand bonds of one hundred pounds sterling each, to be termed the third issue, may be issued by the company.\nThe act 39 Vic., ch. 57 will bear no such construction as contended for. The recital cannot be relied on either as establishing the truth of the statements contained in the recital, or as repealing the provisions of the original act, or as legalizing these debentures. There is nothing in this act repealing the first act either by express words or by necessary implication. To give this act such a retrospective operation, as is now sought to be done, is opposed in my opinion to all principle and authority.\nThere is not a word in this act in express terms, that I can discover, affirming the legality of this issue, still less recognising such illegality and legalizing it, nor is there any language altering the law, or indicating any intention to alter the law by repealing the 37 Vic., ch. 23, which prohibited the second issue until forty-five miles were completed and certified to. The legislature had no such object in view, nor were they, as appears by the recital, asked to do so; the legislation sought was not to aid the holders of the second issue, still less to take away, or to lessen, impair, or affect in any way, the rights of the bondholders under the first issue, (and it was not in reference to either of these issues of stock) but to enable the company to provide rails and fastenings for the speedy completion of the length of road represented by the company to be incomplete, and surely this legislation must be construed consistently with and not in derogation of the rights of other parties as they stood at the time.\nThere is not the slightest indication from the language of the act of an intention to cut down the express provisions of the previous enactment, or to modify, alter, or excuse, the fulfilment of the conditions to be fulfilled by the Levis and Kennebec Railway Company before issuing the second debentures. On the contrary, the provisions of the act assume the fulfilment of the conditions and the legality of the issue. Any recognition of the validity of the debentures by the legislature is based only on the representation placed before the legislature by the Levis and Kennebec Railway Company, that the conditions had been complied with; and this we are now asked to construe into a recognition that the bonds had been legally issued, whereas the whole representation was to the effect that the conditions having been complied with no legislative recognition was needed to give them legal force and effect.\nClearly what the legislature intended to do was, at the instance of the company, to base certain legislation, as to the issue of further debentures, on the representation that certain bonds already issued had been legally issued, not to deal with or to recognize and give vitality to an issue illegally made. Had the company represented to the legislature that the condition imposed by the 37 Vic., ch. 23, had been disregarded and the 45 miles never completed or certified as provided, and an issue had been made in defiance of the law and was consequently illegal, can it be supposed the legislature would have legalized such an issue to the detriment of the holders of the first legal issue? If the legislature determined to do so, is it possible to suppose an intention would not be apparent on the face of the act and manifested in terms express, clear and unmistakable? And here the language of Jessel, M.R., in Harrison v. Cornwall Minerals Railway Co.,[9] is strictly applicable, viz:\u2014\nOn the other hand the argument appears to me to be without answer, that the vested rights of persons acquired before the passing of the Act, who either bought debenture stock or lent money on mortgage, are not interfered with by the legislature without compensation, and it requires the strongest and clearest words in an Act of parliament before you are entitled so to interpret it as to deprive people of their property without compensation.\n* * * * * *\nIt being shown, as it has most unquestionably been in this case, the representation of facts essential to the legality and validity of the issue was incorrect, though the legislature may have acted on such a misrepresentation and the legislation based on such misrepresentation be fruitless, the illegality of this issue remains as if the legislature had not been mislead.\nBut even if the insertion of a statement in an Act such as this would amount to a legislative recognition, so soon as the allegation is shown to be incorrect the recognition necessarily ceases to have any effect. It being made to appear that the representation was unfounded, and the fact not being as the legislature on such representation assumed it to be, the recognition relied on necessarily falls with the representation and the assumption based thereon. This was a private act prayed for by the company, and any misrepresentation of fact or law in the preamble or body of the act can be shown. As regards the character and the true construction of this act and the effect of the recital, the following authorities are applicable:\nQuitter v. Mapleson[10]:\nIt is a well settled rule that you are not to construe an act to be retrospective so as to alter existing rights, unless you find from the act itself that such was the intention of the legislature.\nAs a general principle acts of parliament, especially when they alter the rights of parties, are not to be construed retrospectively unless otherwise provided.\nHickson v. Darlow[11]. Mr. Justice Fry in that case says:\nNow, it is a well-known principle of law on the construction of acts of parliament, and especially when the rights and liabilities of persons are altered thereby, that they are not to have a retrospective operation unless it is expressly so stated.\nAnd Jessel, M. R., in Quitter v. Mapleson[12]:\nThe question whether an Act of parliament is retrospective in its operation must be determined by the provision of the Act itself, bearing in mind that a statute is not to be construed retrospectively unless it is clear that such was the intention of the legislature.\nThere can be no question, in my opinion, that this is a private act to which the holders of the first issue were no parties, and I think it a clear principle that rights acquired under the 37 Vic., ch. 23, cannot be taken from them by a private act to which they are not parties, unless by clear express words the intention is manifest.\nIn Ballard v. Way[13], Lord Abinger, C.B., says:\nI consider that these Acts of parliament (private acts) do not affect all mankind with a knowledge of what is contained in them.\nAnd in Earl of Shrewsbury v. Scott[14], Cockburn, C. J., says:\u2014 We have been reminded, indeed, that a private act of parliament has been said upon very high authority to be little more, if anything, than a private conveyance between those who are parties to it, and to a certain extent I agree to that proposition. Recitals in a private act of parliament could never be held to bind persons who were not parties to the act. Provisions, however general in their terms, could not be held to affect the rights of parties who were not before parliament and whose rights were never intended to be affected.\nIn Mahony v. Wright[15], Lefroy, C. J., says:\u2014\nBut it is settled by authority that the recital of an intention merely in a subsequent statute to repeal a former specific statute will not operate by implication to repeal the former statute, and that in order to affect such a repeal there must be a clause of repeal in the repealing statute.\nPer L. J. Turner in Trustees of Birkenhead Docks v. Laird, &c.[16]:\nIt is thus laid down in Jenkins, 3rd century, case 11:\n\"A special statute does not derogate from a special statute without express words of abrogation.\"\nPer Kay, J. in Gard v. Commissioners of Sewers[17]:\nGeneral enactment cannot repeal specific enactment in an earlier act merely by implication.\nIn Edinburgh & G. Ry. Co. v. Magistrates of Linlithgow[18], the Lord Chancellor says:\nA recital in an Act will not bind those who are not within its enacting part.\nIn Purnell v. Wolverhampton N. W. Co.[19], Erle, C. J., says:\nThere is much in the argument of Mr. Powell, that these are all in the nature of private acts, and that a provision in a private act is not to be held repealed by a subsequent private act, unless there are words which operate expressly to repeal it, and I think the principle thus enunciated by him should guide our judgment upon this occasion.\nByles, J.: I am of the same opinion, and I must confess I have been much influenced by the case of the Trustees of the Birkenhead Docks v. Laird[20], where Lord Justice Turner, a very high authority, lays down the rule to be this: \"It is a rule of law that one private act of parliament cannot repeal another, except by express enactment.\" If the Waterworks Clauses Act, 1847, were so incorporated with the Wolverhampton Waterworks Transfer Act, 1856, as to override the 18 and 19 Vic. ch. cli., it could only at the utmost impliedly repeal the 40th section of the last mentioned Act; and the case referred to is a distinct authority to show that there can be no repeal except by express enactment.\nAs to what are private acts. The marginal note in Brett v. Beales[21] is as follows:\nAn act of parliament, private in its nature, is not made admissible in evidence against strangers by a clause declaring \"that it shall be deemed and taken to be a public act and shall be judicially taken notice of without being specially pleaded.\" A canal act is not rendered a public act by containing provisions empowering the company to regulate and take towage rates and tolls from persons using the canal.\nPer Atty.-Gen. arguendo:\nThese private acts have always been treated as mere contracts between individuals and their recitals are of no more value than the recitals of any private deeds.\nLord Tenterden, after consulting his brother judges on two grounds laid for admission of evidence\u20141st, that the concluding clause renders it admissible as a public act; 2nd, that independent of that clause it is so from its nature, says[22]:\u2014\nThe answer given to the first was that the clause only applied to the forms of pleading and did not vary the general nature and operation of the act. I was inclined to that opinion at the time and my learned brothers agree with me in that impression. We also think that the second ground fails. It is said that the bill gives a power of levying a toll on all the king's subjects, and therefore the act is public. The power given is not so extensive, it is only to levy toll on such as shall think fit to use the navigation. The ground, therefore, on which it is said the act is public and the evidence admissible fails and I cannot receive it. In Beaumont v. Mountain[23], on Brett v. Beales[24] being cited and commented on, Alderson, J., says:\u2014\nThe question in that case was not so much as to the mode of proving the act as to whether the act could be taken as proof of certain facts recited in it.\nThe court held when the act is declared to be a public act and is required to be judicially taken notice of without being specially pleaded, it was unnecessary to prove it by certified copy of the original.\nAnd in Wordward v. Cotton,[25] Alderson B.:\u2014\nI think Lord Tenterden only meant to say in Brett v. Beales, that the clause was one respecting the mode of proving the act, and that for other purposes, as for instance the recital of matters in it, it did not give it the effect of a public act.\nAnd Lord Lyndhurst, C.B., says:\u2014\nThe case of Brett v. Beales has been much misconceived. It is certainly not well reported, but I think that upon the whole scope of it Lord Tenterden meant to rule the same law that is decided in Beaumont v. Mountain.\nAs to the effect of recitals with reference to questions of fact or of law.\nIn The Queen v. The Inhabitants of Haughton,[26].\nBy a local and personal act (since repealed) it was recited that the highway in question was in the township of D. Held, recital not conclusive.\nLord Campbell, C.J., says:\u2014\nHad there been anything amounting to an enactment that the road should be considered in Denton, this would have prevailed over the estoppel, but a mere recital in an act of parliament, either of fact or law, is not conclusive, and we are at liberty to consider the fact or the law to be different from the statement in the recital.\nIn the Shrewsbury Peerage case[27] it is said: \u2014\nThe act 1 Geo. IV., c. 40, was put in for the purpose of reading a part of the recital. An act 6 and 7 Vic., c. 28, and other private acts, were then proposed to be put in for a similar purpose.\nMr. Serjeant Byles objected to receiving these recitals as evidence of the facts.\nSir F. Kelly contended that they were complete evidence of such facts; the Wharton Peerage, where the Lord Chancellor, on such evidence being tendered, said \"It is very strong proof, for it is the well known practice of this House not to allow the insertion of such a statement in the recitals of a private act of parliament, unless the truth of that statement has been previously proved to the satisfaction of the judges to whom the bill has been referred.\"\nLord St. Leonard's:\nThat used to be the practice, but it is not so now, the evidence in support of private bills is not now submitted to and reported on by the judges, and future recitals will not therefore be evidence.\nWith the hardship of this case we have nothing to do; if the second issue is legal, the holders are entitled to their share of the money in court, if they are not legal they have no claim and no court can relieve them. But I cannot help remarking that I should think no prudent person would take debentures without looking at the authority of the company to issue them. On this point Jessel, M.R., says in Harrison v. Cornwall[28]:\nNo companies borrow under their statutory powers, or ought to borrow, without expressing all the acts under which they borrow, and I believe they do. It is the practice to state under what acts they borrow the money, so that the lenders may look at the acts for themselves, and see what the powers are. Any lender would, no doubt, be very foolish who did not inquire of the company as to what their borrowing powers were, and I have known such questions addressed to secretaries of companies over and over again.\nThe most casual glance at the statute would show the, absolute conditions under which alone the power of issuing debentures in this case could be exercised, and the prohibition from issuing except on those conditions, and if seeing this a purchaser did not choose to inquire whether the conditions had been complied with or not, I cannot see that he has anybody but himself to blame. It is impossible that at the time the company issued and parted with these debentures, any person could have been misled by the recital in the act, for it is clear beyond all doubt that they were issued before the passing of the act; the act says so, and the appellants in their opposition admit it as follows:\nOPPOSITION AFIN DE CONSERVER PRODUITE PAR L'APPELANTE LE 5 AVRIL 1881.\nQue le vingt-cinq de janvier mil huit cent soixante-quinze, la dite d\u00e9fenderesse, en conformit\u00e9 \u00e0 la loi, a \u00e9mis et mis en circulation trois cent bons ou d\u00e9bentures, de la somme de cent louis sterling chaque, par lesquelles d\u00e9bentures elle s'est oblig\u00e9e de payer au porteur de chacune des dites d\u00e9bentures, le premier de janvier mil huit cent quatre-vingt-quatorze, la dite somme de cent louis sterling, pour valeur re\u00e7ue, avec int\u00e9r\u00eat \u00e0 raison de sept louis sterling par chaque somme de cent louis sterling, le dit int\u00e9r\u00eat payable les premiers jours de janvier et de juillet de chaque ann\u00e9e, depuis la date de l'\u00e9mission des dites d\u00e9bentures jusqu'au dit premier de janvier mil huit cent quatre-vingt-quatorze, au porteur des coupons ou bons annex\u00e9s aux dites d\u00e9bentures et en faisant partie;\nQue les dites trois cents d\u00e9bentures ainsi \u00e9mises par la dite D\u00e9fendresse, &c., &c.\nBut if any person could have been misled, the hardship would be infinitely greater on the holders of the legal first issue if their security was to be cut down behind their backs by d\u00e9bentures issued on a date when there was no law to justify their issue, and for which issue no subsequent legislative authority has been given, simply because the company introduced a misrepresentation into the private act, on the assumption of the correctness of which the legislature made provision, not for legalizing any unlawful issue, but simply assuming to have been correctly done what was so alleged, with reference to other operations for finishing the road, with which neither the holders of the first issue nor of the second issue had anything to do.\nSTRONG, J., concurred. FOURNIER, J:\u2014\nLes deux parties en cette cause, l'appelante et l'intim\u00e9, sont porteurs de bons \u00e9mis par la compagnie du chemin du fer de L\u00e9vis et Kennebec, en vertu de l'acte 37 Vic., ch. 23 des statuts de Qu\u00e9bec, amendant la charte du dit chemin de fer de L\u00e9vis et Kennebec. Ce statut constate que lors de sa passation, des bons avaient d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9mis au montant de $280,000, et limite pour l'avenir l'\u00e9mission de bons \u00e0 la somme de \u00a3300,000 sterling,\u2014qui seraient \u00e9mis comme suit: une premi\u00e8re \u00e9mission de \u00a3100,000 devant avoir lieu imm\u00e9diatement; la seconde (100,000) \u00a3100,000 lorsque 45 milles du chemin en question auraient \u00e9t\u00e9 compl\u00e9t\u00e9s, et la troisi\u00e8me aussi de \u00a3100,000, lorsque trente autres milles du dit chemin de fer auraient \u00e9t\u00e9 construits. Ces diff\u00e9rentes \u00e9missions quoique appel\u00e9es 1ere, 2me et 3me, n'ont aucune priorit\u00e9 les unes sur les autres,\u2014au contraire, elles doivent affecter le dit chemin de fer au m\u00eame degr\u00e9, ainsi que le statut le d\u00e9clare:\nIt being understood, however, and hereby declared, that such terms \"first issue,\" \"second issue\" and \"third issue\" shall be for convenience only of this bill, and shall not be deemed to give any of the said issues priority one over another.\nCet acte fut plus tard amend\u00e9 et la condition de construire trente milles de chemin de fer avant de pouvoir faire la 3me \u00e9mission fut abolie par la 39me Vic., ch. 57, et remplac\u00e9e par la suivante:\nSo soon as the rails and fastenings required for the completion of the remaining 45 miles or thereabouts of the company's line shall have been provided, then the remaining one thousand bonds of one hundred pounds sterling each, to be termed the third issue, may be issued by the company.\nLe chemin de fer de L\u00e9vis et Kennebec, hypoth\u00e9qu\u00e9 \u00e0 la garantie de ces bons a \u00e9t\u00e9 vendu par le sh\u00e9rif du district de Qu\u00e9bec, le 22 mars 1884, pour la somme de $192,000. C'est l'intim\u00e9 qui en est devenu l'acqu\u00e9reur. Comme porteur de bons de la 1re \u00e9mission, il a form\u00e9 opposition, sur le produit de la vente pour la somme de $284,537.34.\nL'appelante aussi produit une opposition r\u00e9clamant, sur les m\u00eames deniers, le paiement de $218,099 pour bons de la 2me \u00e9mission, avec rang de premi\u00e8re hypoth\u00e8que sur le dit chemin\nL'intim\u00e9 \u00e0 contest\u00e9 l'opposition de l'appelante sur le principe que les bons dont elle \u00e9tait porteur faisaient partie de la seconde \u00e9mission qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 faite ill\u00e9galement. L'intim\u00e9 base cette pr\u00e9tention sur cette partie de la 37me Vict., ch. 23, en d\u00e9clarant que la 2me \u00e9mission n'aura lieu qu'apr\u00e8s que 45 milles du dit chemin de L\u00e9vis et Kennebec auront \u00e9t\u00e9 compl\u00e9t\u00e9s, et il all\u00e8gue que de fait la dite \u00e9mission a eu lieu lorsqu'il n'y avait encore que 43\u00bd milles du chemin fait et termin\u00e9s, et qu'en cons\u00e9quence la compagnie du chemin de L\u00e9vis et Kennebec n'a jamais eu le droit de faire que la premi\u00e8re \u00e9mission et que tous les autres bons \u00e9mis par elle sont nuls.\nL'appelante a attaqu\u00e9 en droit cette d\u00e9fense, en all\u00e9guant que le fait avanc\u00e9 par l'intim\u00e9 que les 45 milles de chemin de fer n'avaient jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 compl\u00e9t\u00e9s, \u00e9tait contraire \u00e0 la loi 39 Vint, ch. 57, laquelle d\u00e9clare dans son pr\u00e9ambule que les dits 45 milles du chemin de fer ont \u00e9t\u00e9 compl\u00e9t\u00e9s, et reconna\u00eet dans ses dispositions la validit\u00e9 de la seconde \u00e9mission et modifie les conditions pour la troisi\u00e8me \u00e9mission. Avant de faire droit sur cette d\u00e9fense il a \u00e9t\u00e9 ordonn\u00e9 de proc\u00e9der \u00e0 la preuve sur les faits avanc\u00e9s par l'intim\u00e9. Celui-ci apr\u00e8s avoir expos\u00e9 les faits dans son factum, dit que cette cause ne pr\u00e9sente qu'une seule question, celle de savoir quel doit \u00eatre, \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de personnes non parties \u00e0 un acte priv\u00e9, l'efiet de la constatation dans le pr\u00e9ambule de l'acte d'un fait qui est en r\u00e9alit\u00e9 erronn\u00e9. Il pose ainsi la question:\u2014 From this statement it will appear that the whole point in this case is whether the recital contained in the preamble of a private act of a fact itself untrue and erroneously stated', is evidence of the truth of such fact against persons who are in no way parties to the passing of such private bill, and who were in all probability ignorant of what was taking place.\nC'est aussi \u00e0 cette seule question que l'hon. juge qui a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 en premi\u00e8re instance a r\u00e9duit les divers points de fait et de droit soulev\u00e9s par l'appelante. Cette mani\u00e8re de voir ne repr\u00e9sente pas correctement ses pr\u00e9tentions. Elle n'a pas pr\u00e9tendu s'appuyer seulement sur l'\u00e9nonciation contenue dans le pr\u00e9ambule de la 39 Vic., ch. 57. Mais elle invoque pour justifier sa pr\u00e9tention l'effet de cet acte sur l'ensemble de la l\u00e9gislation concernant ce chemin de fer. Elle pr\u00e9tend de plus que l'intim\u00e9 ne pouvait pas par une preuve testimoniale contredire les d\u00e9clarations contenues dans la 37me Vic., ch. 57.\nL'hon. juge apr\u00e8s avoir cit\u00e9 une partie du pr\u00e9ambule, se demande s'il fait partie de l'acte et s'il a aucune force l\u00e9gislative. Il cite l'autorit\u00e9 de Dwarris sur l'effet du pr\u00e9ambule dans un statut. Il cite aussi l'autorit\u00e9 de Taylor[29], pour montrer qu'une \u00e9nonciation m\u00eame dans un acte public ne forme pas une preuve concluante, et il en tire la conclusion suivante:\nThe preamble of the act in question being without force in a legislative sense, and creating or conferring no powers, the pretention of the corporation, &c., &c....... is unfounded in law........\nComme on le voit par les expressions de l'hon. juge lui-m\u00eame, il a limit\u00e9 son examen de la question \u00e0 l'effet du pr\u00e9ambule.\nAucune observation de sa part ne fait voir s'il a cherch\u00e9 dans le corps de l'acte la confirmation de l'\u00e9nonciation du pr\u00e9ambule, ou s'il ne se trouve pas dans le corps de l'acte quelque d\u00e9claration \u00e9quivalente \u00e0 une disposition l\u00e9gislative formelle reconnaissant la validit\u00e9 des bons de la 2me \u00e9mission. Il faut d'abord remarquer que ce pr\u00e9ambule est d'un caract\u00e8re tout sp\u00e9cial; la mention de l'ach\u00e8vement des 45 milles du chemin de fer, est le moindre fait qu'il contient. On y trouve de plus des d\u00e9clarations qui font voir que cet acte a \u00e9t\u00e9 le r\u00e9sultat d'une transaction entre le gouvernement et les int\u00e9ress\u00e9s, en consid\u00e9ration de l'augmentation du subside accord\u00e9 par la l\u00e9gislature et en vue de nouveaux subsides sur le point d'\u00eatre accord\u00e9. On ne pourrait donc pas retrancher une seule des conditions de ce compromis sans d\u00e9truire compl\u00e8tement l'effet de cette loi. Il est n\u00e9cessaire, je crois, de citer les principales parties de ce pr\u00e9ambule:\u2014\nAttendu qu'il appert que lorsqu'une longueur totale de quarante-cinq milles de la compagnie a \u00e9t\u00e9 compl\u00e9t\u00e9e, une premi\u00e8re et une seconde \u00e9mission des d\u00e9bentures de la compagnie ont eu lieu chacune pour un montant de cent mille livres, chacune des dites \u00e9missions consistant en mille d\u00e9bentures de cent livres sterling chacune; et attendu que depuis la passation du dit acte amend\u00e9, le subside accord\u00e9 par la l\u00e9gislature provinciale a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9lev\u00e9 jusq'\u00e0 concurrence de quatre mille piastres par mille, et que de nouveaux subsides sont sur le point d'\u00eatre accord\u00e9s par les diverses municipalit\u00e9s travers\u00e9es par la dite ligne, contribuant ainsi dans une proportion consid\u00e9rable au montant requis pour l'ach\u00e8vement des terrassements et des ponts sur les quarante-cinq milles qui restent \u00e0 compl\u00e9ter; et attendu que pour obtenir le prompt ach\u00e8vement des dits 45 milles actuellement inachev\u00e9s, il est \u00e0 propos que les rails et les attaches requis soient achet\u00e9s sans d\u00e9lai.........\nCe pr\u00e9ambule qui contient tant de faits pr\u00e9cis et importants doit sans doute avoir un effet consid\u00e9rable sur l'interpr\u00e9tation de l'acte, et suivant l'article 12 du C. C. de Qu\u00e9bec, il doit \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme faisant partie de l'acte.\nLorsqu'une loi, (dit cet article,) pr\u00e9sente du doute ou de l'ambiguit\u00e9, elle doit \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9e de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 leur faire remplir l'intention du l\u00e9gislateur et atteindre l'objet pour lequel elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 pass\u00e9e.\nLe pr\u00e9ambule qui fait partie de l'acte sert \u00e0 l'expliquer.\nIl faut remarquer que ce statut est un de plusieurs actes amendant la charte du chemin de fer de L\u00e9vis et Kennebec, que l'intervention de la l\u00e9gislature qui subventionnait ce chemin, \u00e9tait encore devenue n\u00e9cessaire pour en faciliter la construction en modifiant les conditions pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment expos\u00e9es concernant l'\u00e9mission de bons. Ce pr\u00e9ambule fait voir que ce n'est qu'apr\u00e8s un complet examen de la position des affaires de la compagnie que la l\u00e9gislature a acquiesc\u00e9 aux demandes qui lui \u00e9taient faites. Le pr\u00e9ambule ne contient pas seulement l'\u00e9nonc\u00e9 du fait que 45 milles de chemin ont \u00e9t\u00e9 compl\u00e9t\u00e9s; il va beaucoup plus loin; il dit que la preuve en a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite en s'exprimant ainsi, \"et attendu qu'il appert que lorsqu'une longueur totale de quarante-cinq milles de la ligne de la compagnie a \u00e9t\u00e9 compl\u00e9t\u00e9e, une premi\u00e8re et une seconde \u00e9mission des d\u00e9bentures de la compagnie ont eu lieu chacune pour un montant de cent mille livres, chacune des dites \u00e9missions consistant en mille d\u00e9bentures de cent livres chacune.\" Ces expressions ne constituent pas seulement une \u00e9nonciation d'un fait, elle comporte de plus la d\u00e9claration que le fait a \u00e9t\u00e9 constat\u00e9\u2014qu'une premi\u00e8re et une seconde \u00e9mission avait eu lieu. Mais dit l'intim\u00e9 ce fait n'\u00e9tant pas exact et ne se trouvant que dans le pr\u00e9ambule, il peut \u00eatre contredit et il offre une preuve testimoniale \u00e0 cet effet. Mais cet avanc\u00e9 est-il correct, ne trouve-t-on que dans le pr\u00e9ambule la mention de la seconde \u00e9mission? N'y a-t-il pas dans le corps de l'acte des expressions qui font voir que cette loi constate le fait d'une seconde \u00e9mission? La derni\u00e8re partie de l'unique section de ce statut ne peut laisser aucun doute \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard; elle dit positivement qu'il ne restait alors que les bons de la 3me \u00e9mission. C'\u00e9tait donc positivement d\u00e9clarer dans le corps de l'acte que les deux autres \u00e9missions avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 faites. C'\u00e9tait r\u00e9p\u00e9ter la d\u00e9claration du pr\u00e9ambule.\nLe but principal de cet acte \u00e9tait sans doute de changer les conditions de la 3me \u00e9mission qui, d'apr\u00e8s la 37me Vic., ch. 23, ne pouvait avoir lieu qu'apr\u00e8s l'ach\u00e8vement des 75 milles, en permettant de faire cette \u00e9mission aussit\u00f4t apr\u00e8s l'achat des rails, et c'est en accordant cette facult\u00e9 que la loi reconna\u00eet la validit\u00e9 des deux autres \u00e9missions dans les termes suivants, \"et aussit\u00f4t que les rails et les attaches requis pour l'ach\u00e8vement des quarante-cinq milles restant ou \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s de la ligne de la Compagnie auront \u00e9t\u00e9 achet\u00e9s, alors les mille bons restant de cent livres sterling chacun, qui seront d\u00e9sign\u00e9s comme \u00e9tant la troisi\u00e8me \u00e9mission, pourront \u00eatre \u00e9mis par la compagnie.\" Apr\u00e8s la mention faite dans le pr\u00e9ambule des deux premi\u00e8res \u00e9missions, la d\u00e9claration dans cette section que la troisi\u00e8me peut-\u00eatre faite suivant les nouvelles conditions n'est-elle pas une reconnaissance formelle et positive de la l\u00e9galit\u00e9 des deux autres? Ceci me semble d\u00e9montrer clairement que la question ne pouvait pas \u00eatre r\u00e9solue pas le seul examen du pr\u00e9ambule,\u2014qu'il fallait de plus examiner l'acte dans son ensemble.\nIl y a encore \u00e0 consid\u00e9rer le fait important de la date des bons de la 2me \u00e9mission, et celle de la sanction de l'aete 39 Vic., ch. 57. Ces bons avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9par\u00e9s le 25 janvier 1875, longtemps avant la passation de la 39 Vic., ch. 57. Dans quel but en a-t-on fait mention dans ce dernier acte? Doit-on supposer que cette mention est tout \u00e0 fait oiseuse et faite sans aucune intention quelconque d'utilit\u00e9 de la part des int\u00e9ress\u00e9s? On a sans doute pens\u00e9 qu'apr\u00e8s l'\u00e9mission faite il y avait avantage \u00e0 constater comme un fait l\u00e9gal ces deux \u00e9missions. S'il y avait la condition de construire 45 milles avant de pouvoir faire la 2me \u00e9mission, il y avait aussi \u00e0 l'\u00e9mission des premiers bons une condition fort importante, celle de racheter, avec le produit de ces bons, tous ceux \u00e9mis en vertu de la 4me section de la 36me Vict., ch. 45. En pr\u00e9sence de cette condition on comprend qu'il \u00e9tait du plus haut int\u00e9r\u00eat, pour la compagnie et pour les porteurs de bons, d'avoir une d\u00e9claration statutaire reconnaissant la validit\u00e9 de ces \u00e9missions.\nVoici ce que dit Taylor On Evidence,[30]:\u2014\nThe solemnity of an act done, though not done in court, will also, sometimes, raise a conclusive presumption in its favour.\nEt s'il est vrai de dire:\u2014\nBut in general a local and private statute, though it requires a' clause requiring it to be judicially noticed, is not, as against a stranger, any evidence of the facts recited[31].\nIl est aussi juste de dire que lorsque la personne qui attaque la v\u00e9rit\u00e9 du fait attest\u00e9, n'est pas \u00e9trang\u00e8re \u00e0 l'acte, la pr\u00e9somption l\u00e9gale de la v\u00e9rit\u00e9 du fait est compl\u00e8te comme le dit Parke, B., dans la cause de Ballard v. Way[32]:\u2014\nThis is an incumbrance created by a private act to which the defendant may be considered a party, and, therefore, it is the same as if there had been an agreement with him.\nSi la demande \u00e0 la l\u00e9gislature est faite dans l'int\u00e9r\u00eat des porteurs de bons de la 1\u00e8re et 2me, aussi bien que ceux de la 3me \u00e9mission, et suivant l'autorit\u00e9 ci-dessus ils doivent \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9s comme parties \u00e0 l'acte, et ne doivent pas \u00eatre admis \u00e0 prouver que l'\u00e9mission a \u00e9t\u00e9 irr\u00e9guli\u00e8re dans le cas m\u00eame o\u00f9 cette preuve e\u00fbt \u00e9t\u00e9 possible. En cons\u00e9quence je suis d'avis que la preuve faite par l'intim\u00e9 en cette cause au sujet des irr\u00e9gularit\u00e9s qui peuvent avoir eu lieu lors de l'\u00e9mission est inadmissible.\nUne consid\u00e9ration qui n'est pas sans importance, c'est que l'appelante n'\u00e9tait devenue acqu\u00e9reur des bons de la \u00e2me \u00e9mission que longtemps apr\u00e8s la passation de la 89me Vict., qui en reconna\u00eet la validit\u00e9, il n'\u00e9tait pas n\u00e9cessaire pour elle de porter ses perquisitions aude-l\u00e0 du statut pour savoir si leur \u00e9mission \u00e9tait l\u00e9gale, les ayant acquis de bonne foi sur l'autorit\u00e9 des d\u00e9clarations solennelles du statut, cela devait lui suffire pour se convaincre de leur l\u00e9galit\u00e9.\nC'est sans doute dans ce but qu'elles ont \u00e9t\u00e9 mentionn\u00e9es non seulement dans le pr\u00e9ambule, mais aussi \u00e0 la fin de la section premi\u00e8re; autrement il faudrait en conclure que cette mention a \u00e9t\u00e9 ins\u00e9r\u00e9e sans r\u00e9flection et par pure ineptie de la part du r\u00e9dacteur du bill. Mais comme on en voit fort bien l'utilit\u00e9, on doit \u00eatre convaincu que l'acte n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 ainsi fait qu'\u00e0 la demande de tous les int\u00e9ress\u00e9s, parmi lesquels \u00e9taient sans doute les porteurs des bons de la premi\u00e8re \u00e9mission.\nQuant aux arguments de l'intim\u00e9 au sujet du d\u00e9faut d'avis aux porteurs de bons, et aussi \u00e0 ce qu'il a dit de la mani\u00e8re dont se fait la preuve des pr\u00e9ambules des actes, je ne crois pas qu'il soit utile d'y r\u00e9pondre autrement qu'en disant qu'on doit pr\u00e9sumer que toutes les proc\u00e9dures n\u00e9cessaires ont \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement faites.\nL'avis donn\u00e9 devait mettre tous les int\u00e9ress\u00e9s sur leur garde, et ils n'ont aucun droit de se plaindre qu'on a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 sur leurs int\u00e9r\u00eats sans les avoir entendus.\nSi, comme je le crois, la position prise par l'hon. juge de la Cour int\u00e9rieure est erron\u00e9e; si j'ai \u00e9tabli que la loi a voulu parler des deux \u00e9missions en question comme \u00e9tant l\u00e9galement faites, il ne resterait donc plus qu'\u00e0 savoir si la l\u00e9gislature de Qu\u00e9bec avait le pouvoir de faire ce qu'elle a d\u00e9cr\u00e9t\u00e9.\nIl me semble que cela ne peut faire le sujet d'un doute raisonnable. Il s'agissait, dans tous les statuts ci-dessus cit\u00e9s, de l\u00e9gislation au sujet d'un chemin de fer local commen\u00e7ant \u00e0 L\u00e9vis et se terminant \u00e0 la fronti\u00e8re du Maine. Le pouvoir de la l\u00e9gislature de Qu\u00e9bec \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard ne peut \u00eatre mis en contestation. Toutes les dispositions de ces divers actes \u00e9taient dans les limites de ses attributions, et doivent recevoir leur effet. Mais en supposant que la 39me Vict., ch. 57, n'aurait pas tranch\u00e9 la question et qu'il n'y aurait en faveur de l'appelante qu'une \u00e9nonciation qui pourrait \u00eatre contredite, l'intim\u00e9 en a-t-il d\u00e9truit la v\u00e9rit\u00e9 par une preuve l\u00e9gale? Les bons de la 2me \u00e9mission qui sont les titres de la cr\u00e9ance de l'appelante, sont en forme authentique et faits conform\u00e9ment aux divers actes concernant l'incorporation du chemin de L\u00e9vis et Kennebec, et conform\u00e9ment aussi \u00e0 l'acte des chemins de fer de Qu\u00e9bec. Ils sont rev\u00eatus des signatures des pr\u00e9sident et secr\u00e9taire, et portent le sceau officiel de la dite compagnie. A leur face ces titres sont parfaits et l'on doit, d'apr\u00e8s la maxime, Omnia praesumuntur rit\u00e8 et solenniter esse acta,\" les consid\u00e9rer prouvant un titre parfait, jusqu'\u00e0 preuve du contraire. Comme actes officiels, la pr\u00e9somption l\u00e9gale qu'ils ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00fbment ex\u00e9cut\u00e9s est en leur faveur Brown.[33]:\nAgain, where acts are of an official nature, or requiring the concurrence of official persons, a presumption arises in favour of their due execution. In these cases the ordinary rule is, Omnia pr\u00e6sumuntur rite et solenniter esse acta donec probetur in contrarium.\nOn peut encore invoquer en faveur de leur l\u00e9galit\u00e9, la pr\u00e9somption que les conditions dont la violation ferait de leur \u00e9mission un acte frauduleux, ont \u00e9t\u00e9 duement ex\u00e9cut\u00e9s.\nIt is a well established rule that the law will presume in favour of honesty and against fraud[34].\nDans le cas o\u00f9 les bons en question seraient consid\u00e9r\u00e9s comme des actes de particuliers, les m\u00eames pr\u00e9somptions devraient s'appliquer \u00e0 leur validit\u00e9, car ils sont rev\u00eatus des formes les plus solennelles que la loi exige pour la perfection d'un titre.\nAs regards the acts of private individuals, the presumption, ommia rite esse acta, forcibly applies where they are of a formal character as writings under seal. Likewise upon proof of title, everything which is collateral to the title will be intended, without proof; for, although the law requires exactness in the derivation of a title, yet, where that has been proved, all collateral circumstances will be presumed in favour of right.\nOn the same principle, it is a general rule, that when a person is required to do an act, the not doing of which would make him guilty of a criminal neglect of duty, it shall be intended that he has duly performed it, unless the contrary be shown,\u2014stabit pr\u00e6sumptio donec probetur in contrarium; negative evidence rebuts this presumption, that all has been duly performed[35].\nL'appelante se pr\u00e9sente donc ici avec un titre qui doit \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 com me pariait donec probetur in contrarium. Mais comment doit \u00eatre faite cette preuve pour op\u00e9rer la destruction de ce titre? La loi anglaise pas plus que celle de la province de Qu\u00e9bec n'admet la preuve testimoniale en pareil cas. C'est la seule que l'intim\u00e9 a offerte.\nIl a fait entendre deux t\u00e9moins MM. Lesage et Demers pour leur faire d\u00e9clarer qu'il n'avait \u00e9t\u00e9 fait et compl\u00e9t\u00e9 que 43\u00bd milles. Leurs d\u00e9clarations verbales peuvent-elles \u00eatre oppos\u00e9es aux d\u00e9clarations positives de la loi qui fait voir le contraire. Aux termes de la 37me Vic., ch. 23, la seconde \u00e9mission ne devait avoir lieu que sur un certificat de l'ing\u00e9nieur-en-chef que 45 milles avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 compl\u00e9t\u00e9s et mis en op\u00e9ration. Cette preuve verbale est donc absolument inutile et d'aucun effet.\nL'ing\u00e9nieur-en-chef Light a aussi \u00e9t\u00e9 entendu comme t\u00e9moin. Il dit qu'il n'est pas bien s\u00fbr de la longueur du chemin qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 ex\u00e9cut\u00e9, mais qu'il a d\u00e9duit mille qui n'\u00e9tait pas compl\u00e9t\u00e9. Que restait-il \u00e0 faire pour le terminer? Il n'en dit rien, y avait-il encore de l'ouvrage \u00e0 faire pour un dollar ou pour des milliers? On n'en sait rien, mais il ajoute qu'il a fait \u00e0 ce sujet un rapport qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 remis \u00e0 l'hon. M. DeBoucherville, alors ministre des chemins de fer. Ce t\u00e9moignage est tout-\u00e0-fait ill\u00e9gal d'abord parce qu'il tend \u00e0 contredire par t\u00e9moins une d\u00e9claration de la loi, et ensuite parce que l'existence d'un rapport \u00e9tant prouv\u00e9e, la preuve testimoniale de son contenu ne pouvait \u00eatre re\u00e7u.\nThe contents of a written instrument, which is capable of being produced, must be proved by the instrument itself, and not by parol evidence * * * The fact that in cases of this kind the writing is in the possession of the adverse party does not change its character, its absence must be accounted for by notice to the other party ot produce it, or in some other legal form, before secondary evidence of its contents can be received[36].\nLa preuve est claire et precise qu'un certificat a \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9 et rien n'en explique l'absence de production.\nL'admission de ce t\u00e9moignage est une violation des r\u00e8gles de la preuve. Le rapport ou certificat seul aurait pu faire preuve du fait qu'il n'y avait eu que 43\u00bd milles de compl\u00e9t\u00e9s. Le d\u00e9faut de production de ce rapport par l'intim\u00e9 doit faire pr\u00e9sumer que le rapport en question n'aurait pas prouv\u00e9 ce que dit Light. De plus n'aurait on pas d\u00fb faire la preuve que l'ouvrage incomplet pour lequel Light avait fait une diminution de 1\u00bd mille, n'avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 compl\u00e9t\u00e9 depuis son rapport?\nEn cons\u00e9quence il me para\u00eet impossible d'en venir, comme le jugement de 1re instance l'a fait, \u00e0 la conclusion que les bons de la 2me \u00e9mission sont nuls et que les porteurs de la 1\u00e8re doivent au m\u00e9pris des termes positifs du statut d\u00e9clarant qu'il n'y aura aucune priorit\u00e9 entre ces bons, absorber tout le produit de la vente du chemin de L\u00e9vis et Kennebec, qui \u00e9tait affect\u00e9 \u00e0 la garantie des bons de la premi\u00e8re comme de ceux des deuxi\u00e8me et troisi\u00e8me \u00e9mission.\nPour ces motifs et pour ceux exprim\u00e9s par l'honorable juge Tessier, je suis d'opinion que l'appel devrait \u00eatre allou\u00e9, que la contestation de l'opposition de l'appelante, faite par l'intim\u00e9, devrait \u00eatre renvoy\u00e9e et que l'appelante devrait \u00eatre colloqu\u00e9e concurremment avec l'intim\u00e9 pour le montant de son opposition sur le produit de la vente du chemin de L\u00e9vis et Kennebec. Le tout avec d\u00e9pens. HENRY, J.;\u2014\nA company called the Levis and Kennebec Railway Company was incorporated by an act of the legislature of the province of Quebec, in 1869 (32 Vic., chap. 54.) That act was subsequently amended by 36 Vic., chap. 45; again amended by the 37 Vic., chap. 23, and again by the 39 Vic., chap. 57.\nOver forty miles of the railroad was built and in running order, and, on the 22nd of March, 1881, the right and title of the company in the railway was sold at auction by the sheriff of the district of Quebec, under an execution at the suit of \"The Wason Manufacturing Co., to the respondents, for $192,000.\nUpon this sale the Quebec Central Railway Co., the present respondents, fyled an opposition claiming the sum of $272,537.34, being the amount of several sterling bonds of the Levis and Kennebec Railway Co. mentioned in the opposition. The corporation of Quebec, the present appellants, also fyled an opposition based upon a number of bonds alleged to be held by them, and for the amount of which they also claimed to be collocated upon the proceeds of the sale. The opposition of the latter was contested by the former on the ground that the bonds held by them were illegally issued, and consequently null and void, and this contestation was maintained by the judgment of the Superior Court, rendered on the 19th December, 1882, and subsequently affirmed by a majority of the Court of Appeal in Quebec, Mr. Justice Tessier dissenting.\nThe first section of the act 37 Vic., ch. 23, is as follows[37]:\u2014\nThe following is the preamble and a part of section one of 39 Vic., ch. 57[38]:\nBy section one the restriction contained in the Act 37 Vic., ch. 23, was repealed, so far as related to the third issue of the company's bonds, until the full completion of the ninety miles; and the following provision was substituted:\nSo soon as the rails and fastenings required for the completion of the remaining forty-five miles or thereabouts of the company's line shall be provided, then the remaining one thousand bonds of one hundred pounds sterling each, to be termed the third issue, may be issued by the company.\nHere then, is, in my opinion, a legislative declaration of the validity of the first and second issues of the bonds. The fact of the completion of the first forty-five miles of the railroad, is particularly referred to in the preamble; and that fact having been ascertained, the condition upon which the third issue was provided to have been made, was ameliorated; and the enacting words have virtually incorporated the statement in the preamble, as to the first forty-five miles having been completed. If that position is tenable, then the evidence on the trial cannot affect the legal rights of the holders of the second issue of the bonds. The Legislature of Quebec had jurisdiction over the subject matter; and legal tribunals cannot resist its declaration, no matter upon what evidence that might be produced.\nThe words in section 1 of 87 Vic., ch. 23, are:\nAnd as soon as forty-five miles shall have been certified as complete and in running order as aforesaid, then a further issue of one thousand bonds of one hundred pounds sterling each, to be termed the second issue, may be made by the company.\nIf the necessary certificate was issued, then the rights of the bondholders of the second issue, acting on the certificate, could not be affected, in my opinion, by evidence subsequently, that when it was issued, the forty-five miles, although certified as provided by section one, were not fully completed. It was to the certificate alone that purchasers of the bonds had to look. That was the security and the only one provided for them by the legislature, and when that certificate was executed and issued by the proper officer, the liability under the bonds when issued attached. A certificate was duly issued before the sale of the bonds, but it was not given in evidence; and it may be questionable whether any evidence as to the condition of the first forty-five miles at the time was regular. If the bonds were purchased and held on the security of the certificate, it should have been produced by the respondents; or, if none such were given, that fact should have been shown. It is shown, however, that a certificate was given by the inspecting engineer of the government, and lodged with the Minister of Railways of the province of Quebec. That document was, then, the best evidence, and should have been produced. The contents of it were not attempted to be given; and could not have been, unless the original could not be produced. The holders of the bonds are prim\u00e2 facie entitled to share in the proceeds of the sale left after paying the execution creditor; and the onus of the illegality of the issue raised was on the respondent company. They, in my opinion, were bound to shew the illegality of the issue of the bonds held by the appellants. The respondents rely on two allegations in one of their pleas, \"that forty-five miles of the said company's railway \"have never yet been built and in running order, nor \"certified as such by the government inspecting \"engineer.\" I have already stated my opinion, that it would not invalidate bonds purchased on the security of the certificate, provided for by the Act, even should it be shown, that through mistake or otherwise the road was certified to be completed when it was not; and that consequently such an issue would be immaterial. I have also stated my opinion that when it was once shown or admitted, as it was, that a certificate was issued, and available, it should have been produced by the respondent company before being permitted to go into evidence of the state of the forty-five miles. It is quite possible that the engineer may have given a certificate for the whole distance of forty-five miles, and subsequently found it was somewhat short of that distance, but that, in my opinion, would not affect the certificate. The appellants are, in my opinion, justly entitled to a participation in the funds in question as bond-holders; and to deprive them of it, the best available evidence should be required to show the illegality of the issue. Such evidence has not I think been given. Even had it been, I think the issue of the bonds was legislatively sanctioned, as before pointed out.\nFor these reasons I think that the appellants are entitled to the judgment of this Court with costs.\nGWYNNE, J.:\u2014\nThe point which is raised upon this appeal is one or the gravest nature, the importance of which, as it appears to me, cannot be over estimated, affecting as it does the value and character of debentures of a railway company, issued and placed upon the money markets of the world, and there sold to innocent persons who purchased them for value in the confidence and assurance solemnly published on the face of the debentures, that they have for their validity the sanction and guarantee of the Legislature of the Province of Quebec, but which, as now appears, are (by the judgment of the courts of the province upon the authority of whose Legislature the debentures upon their face profess to have been issued) pronounced to have been illegally issued\u2014and without the sanction or authority of any law\u2014and to be of no value or effect whatever, and to be, in fact, no better than waste paper,\nA difficulty has in limine suggested itself to my mind, namely\u2014whether upon the proceeding which is now before us, and in view of the transaction out of which (as appears by the appeal case submitted to us,) it originates, the record is so framed that a judgment to the effect that the debentures in question are absolutely invalid, as they have been pronounced to be by the judgment of the courts of the Province of Quebec, can have any judicial force and effect?\nBy the appeal case it appears that the proceeding before us originates in a judgment recovered in the Superior Court of the Province of Quebec, on the 20th day of January, 1877, by the Mason Manufacturing Co. against the Levis & Kennebec Railway Co., a company incorporated and having certain powers and privileges conferred upon it by 32 Vic. ch. 54 and certain other acts in amendment thereof, passed by the Legislature of the Province of Quebec. To enforce execution of this judgment a writ of execution against the goods and chattels, lands, and tenements of the railway company was issued, addressed to the Sheriff of the district of Quebec whereby he was ordered to levy the sum of $4,688.33, (the amount of the judgment, with the interest thereon from the said 20th January, 1877,);\u2014a return having been made by the Sheriff to this writ to the effect that he had seized the goods, lands and tenements of the company, but had not sold the same by reason of certain oppositions \u00e0 fin de distraire, a writ of venditioni exponas was issued out of the Superior Court on the 3rd day of March, 1881, whereby, after reciting the previous writ, the sheriff's return thereto, and the proceedings had thereon, the sheriff was commanded that he should proceed according to law to the sale of the road called the Levis and Kennebec Railway, comprising the road made and built by the defendants, from and including the terminus thereof in the parish of Notre Dame de la Victoire, county of Levis, district of Quebec, up to and including the terminus in the parish of St. Joseph, district of Beauce, with the way and right of passage over the said extent as now established, the depots, stations, buildings connected with the said road and now occupied for the use of the said road, and ground occupied by the defendants for the said road, and the said depots, stations and buildings, also the rolling stock of the said road and which is found thereon, namely: Two engines and tenders, one first-class and four second-class passenger cars, twelve wood cars, two cattle cars, twenty-two large platform cars and six small ones, ten hand cars, nine laury cars, and one baggage and post office car, with all the rights of the defendants in and upon the road now in operation, and its right to continue and extend the same to the boundary line of the State of Maine.\nNow, by what law can a sheriff by a sale such as that here directed, transfer to a purchaser from him, not only all the rolling stock, goods and chattels of the company, but also the railway itself, the depots, stations and buildings, and the lands on which they are erected, together with the rights of the defendants in and upon the road as in operation, and the right of the company to extend the same to the boundary line of the State of Maine\u2014in short, all the corporate estate and all the corporate powers, rights and privileges of the company?\nThe sheriff, however, has returned that to satisfy the judgment of $4,688.38, with interest from the 20th day of January, 1877, not that he had sold a portion of the chattel property of the company, which he had under seizure, of a value apparently five or six times the amount of the judgment, and that he had thereby realised sufficient to pay and satisfy the judgment, but that he had on the 22nd of March, 1881, proceeded to the sale and adjudication of the said lands and tenements and sold the same to the Quebec Central Railway Co. fox the sum of $192,000; the right to participate in which sum is the question now brought before us.\nNow, it is to be observed, not only that there does not appear to have been any occasion for the sale of any lands and tenements belonging to the company, inasmuch as it does not appear that the goods and chattels which the Sheriff had returned that he had under seizure, were first sold and found to be insufficient to satisfy the judgment, but further the Quebec Central Railway Co. which was incorporated for building and working a totally different railway had no power or authority whatever to acquire the Levis and Kennebec railway, nor had any person or company such power or authority. A railway consisting of its road way, stations, buildings, and other real estate necessary for the working of and for the use and enjoyment of the railway as a going concern, is a species of property which is capable of being held, worked, used and enjoyed only by the body corporate created by the Legislature for that special purpose, no other person or body corporate could acquire the property, powers, and privileges held by the Levis & Kennebec Railway Co. for the working of their railway, unless specially authorized by the Legislature for that purpose, and the Sheriff, therefore, could not, under the ordinary process of execution divest the company of such property, and vest it in a person or company not capable of taking and holding it for the purpose for which alone it was authorized to be constructed, and the property in question here, namely, the Levis and Kennebec railway, so far as constructed, being capable of being, and being, hypothecated to persons who advanced their money upon the security of having a lien upon the whole of the work as a going concern, to permit such property to be sold as bare lands and tenements divested of the corporate privileges annexed to them in the possession of the company, thus stripping the property of the whole of its value as security as a going concern for the money advanced upon it as such by the hypothecary creditors; and to compel them to accept, in lieu of their hypotheques upon the property as a going concern, the money realized by a sale of the naked lands and tenements divested of the corporate powers and privileges annexed to it as a going concern, would be such a fraud upon the hypothecary creditors that I cannot well see how it could receive the sanction of law apart from all authority upon the subject. It has, however, been decided in the Province of Quebec where the railway in question here is situate, that a railway of an incorporated company cannot be seized in execution of a judgment or sold at sheriff's sale. The County of Drummond v. S. E. Ry. Co.[39] This is the established law also of the province of Ontario, as well as in England. If, then, the sale of the Levis and Kennebec Railway professed to have been made by the sheriff, and by which the money was realised the appropriation of which is under consideration here, was illegal and void, with what propriety can a court of justice interfere by adjudicating upon the legal rights of parties to moneys which upon the record before the court are shewn to be the proceeds of an illegal and void sale?\nWould not an adjudication as to the distribution of the moneys which are the proceeds of the sale, if it should have any judicial effect, be ipso facto an affirmance of the illegal sale?\nShould a court pronounce a judgment in any matter, however brought before it, which, if it has any judicial effect, deprives absent hypothecary creditors of the Levis and Kennebec Railway Co. of the benefit of their securities?\nThe corporation of the city of Quebec appear by the record to be holders of but a portion of the debentures of that class or issue, the whole of which the court has pronounced to be void and of no force or effect whatever. Can, then, a court with any propriety pronounce debentures of a railway company, sold as good and valid securities to purchasers for value, to be null, void and of no effect, in the absence of a representation of all persons holding such securities; or otherwise than in a suit properly framed, so that judgment therein shall be effectual to bind all persons holding like securities? To have them pronounced to be null and void may be, and no doubt is, a matter of some importance to the Quebec Central Railway Co., who, after the illegal sale to them of the property of the Levis and Kennebec Railway Co. stripped of all its value as a going concern for a sum about one-fifth of the amount of the debentures hypothecated upon it, have, by an act of the legislature, acquired all the corporate rights and privileges of the former company, in which rights and privileges consisted the chief value of the hypothecary securities, which rights and privileges and corporate property they now hold under an act which contains, however, this proviso, that nothing in the act contained shall in any wise affect the rights of the creditors of the Levis and Kennebec Railway Co. I confess, however, that I cannot bring my mind to think that it was competent or proper for the Court upon this proceeding, or otherwise than in a suit properly framed, to which all persons interested shall be parties, including the Levis & Kennebec Railway Co., and all persons claiming to be their hypothecary creditors, to pronounce a judgment to the effect that the Levis & Kennebec Railway Co. never became or were indebted to the purchasers of any of the debentures belonging to the class or issue to which those of which the city of Quebec are now the holders belong, in respect of the moneys received by the railway company upon the sale of and upon the security of those debentures, but that all debentures of that class or issue, notwithstanding that they were sold by the company to purchasers for full value, always have been and are null and void, having no validity, force or effect whatever in law and equity against the company that issued them and received value for them. That they were so null and void is, in my opinion, the sole substance and effect of the judgment pronounced by the courts of the Province of Quebec in this case, all the rest of the judgment is merely consequential upon such adjudication of nullity, and it is from this adjudication of nullity that this appeal is taken.\nAssuming it to be competent for the Court, notwithstanding the points of difficulty above referred to which have suggested themselves to my mind, to pronounce such a judgment in a proceeding framed as the present is, it remains to be considered whether the judgment can be sustained upon the merits.\nBy the 32 Vic. ch. 54, as amended by 36 Vic. ch. 45 and 37 Vic. ch. 23 of the statutes of the Province of Quebec, the Levis & Kennebec Railway Co. were authorized, by a resolution of the directors of the company to that effect, to issue their bonds or debentures for the purpose of raising money to prosecute their undertaking. The statutes enacted that such bonds should be signed by the President and countersigned by the Secretary-Treasurer with the seal of the company thereto affixed. That they should constitute a privileged claim upon the personal property of the said company, and shall bear hypotheque from the date of the resolution authorizing the same on the immoveable property belonging to the company, and this without any registration. That the company should have power to issue the bonds to the amount of \u00a3300,000 sterling, in bonds for not less than \u00a3100 sterling each, provided always that until 45 miles of the railway should be completed and in running order, of which the certificate of the inspecting engineer of the government should afford proof, no more than one thousand of said bonds of \u00a3100 sterling each, to be termed the \"first issue,\" should be issued by the company, and that so soon as a certificate as aforesaid should be given, certifying that the said 45 miles are complete and in running order, a further issue of one thousand bonds of \u00a3100 sterling each, to be termed the \"second issue,\" might be made by the company; and that no further bonds should be issued by the company until 75 miles of the said road (including the 45 miles above mentioned) should be completed and in running order, according to the certificate of the inspecting engineer of the government; and that so soon as it should be certified that the said 75 miles are completed and in working order as aforesaid, the last thousand bonds of \u00a3100 sterling each, termed the \"third issue,\" may be issued by the company, it being understood and declared by the statute that the expressions \"first issue,\" \"second issue \"and \"third issue\" were used merely for convenience, and that they should not be construed as giving to any of those issues priority over the others.\nThe company adopted the following form of bond for the purposes of the three several issues above mentioned, showing upon the face of every bond (no matter to which issue it should belong), that each bond issued was one of the whole 3,000 authorized to be issued and which constituted an hypothecary charge upon the property of the company, a precaution which, I apprehend, was adopted as being deemed of some importance in the English market, upon which, as appears as well from the directions in the statute, that the bonds should be issued for sterling money, as from the terms of the bonds themselves, it was contemplated to offer them for sale:\u2014\nLEVIS AND KENNEBEC RAILWAY COMPANY.\nPROVINCE OF QUEBEC, DOMINION OF CANADA.\nIncorporated by a special act of the legislature of the province of Quebec, assented to the 5th day of April, 1869, amended by an act aasented to the 24th day of December, 1872, and further amended by an act assented to the 28th day of January, 1874.\nSTERLING DEBENTURE.\nBearing interest at the rate of 7 per centum per annum, payable on the first days of January and July in each year, in the city of London, England.\nKnow all men by these presents that the Levis and Kennebec Railway Co. under the authority of the above mentioned acts, and of the Quebec Railway Act, 1869, promises to pay to the bearer of this bond, in the city of London, England, on the 1st day of January, 1894, the sum of \u00a3100 sterling, value received, with interest thereon, at the rate of seven per centum per annum, payable semi-annually, according to the tenor of the coupons annexed. And for the payment of the said principal sum and interest the Levis and Kennebec Railway Co., under the authority of the above mentioned acts, has hypothecated and does hypothecate the whole of the said Levis and Kennebec Railway Co.'s road, stations, permanent way, and all branches thereof constructed or to be constructed, rolling stock, machinery, fixtures, equipments, and all other the real and personal property of the company, and the tolls, income, rents and profits thereof or any part thereof, inclusive of a capitalized subsidy granted by the Legislature of the Province of Quebec, in Government 5 per cent. debentures, to the amount of $1,748 per mile, payable on completion of the first 25 miles of railway, and after upon each and every mile completed, together with all rights, easements and appurtenances thereto belonging or in any wise appertaining.\nThis debenture is one of an issue amounting to three hundred thousand pounds and consisting of three thousand bonds of one hundred pounds sterling each, and numbered consecutively from I to 3,000 inclusive, all of like tenor herewith.\nSEAL. In witness whereof, the Levis and Kennebec Railway Co. has caused its corporate seal to be hereto affixed and the same to be attested by the signature of its President and Secretary, this day of\nThe company, as appears from a recital in the preamble of the statute 39 Vic., ch. 57, hereafter referred to, and the correctness of this recital is not questioned, executed bonds to the amount of and to represent the first and second issues authorized by the above acts, that is to say, for \u00a3200,000 of the \u00a3300,000 authorized by the acts. These bonds would seem to have been afterwards, but at what date does not appear, sent to a Mr. Albert Grant in London, to be disposed for the company upon the London market. From the opposition \u00e0 fin de conserver filed by the appellants, it appears that the bonds, of which the appellants are the holders, being bonds to the amount of \u00a330,000 sterling, all of which, from the numbers being above number 1,000 and under number 2,000, appear to belong to the second issue, were among those which were transmitted to Mr. Grant, and bear date the 25th day of January, 1875. There is nothing to show when these bonds were first sold. All that appears is that Mr. Grant at some time, but when is not stated, transmitted to the railway company their full face value of \u00a330,000 sterling. The city of Quebec do not appear to have become holders of them until the month of January, 1877, long after the passing of the act 39 Vic., ch. 57.\nIt is consistent with all that appears before us, and not at all improbable, I think, in view of the natural enquiries likely to be made by and on behalf of purchasers of these bonds for evidence of the fulfilment of the conditions precedent necessary to be fulfilled before the bonds could legally be issued, that none of those numbering over 1,000, that is that none of those constituting what is termed the \"second issue\" in the statute, were or could have been disposed of by Mr. Grant until after the passing of the Act 39 Vic., ch. 57; and if the time of the sale of the bonds, as distinguished from the time of their being executed and issued by the company to be sold, is material, it certainly is not sufficiently shown to justify us in pronouncing bonds, which are good upon the face of them and in the hands of purchasers for value to be null and void, if being sold after, though issued before, the passing of the Act they would not be so. Now at the session of the Provincial Legislature held in December, 1875, the company, having thus already issued bonds to the full amount of the first and second issues, and there remaining to be issued only the \"third\" issue of \u00a3100,000 sterling to complete the whole amount which they were authorized to issue, petitioned the Legislature for a further amendment of their Acts, and thereupon the 39 Vic., ch. 57 was passed, the preamble of which is as follows:\nWhereas the Levis & Kennebec Railway Co. have, by petition, prayed that the Act to amend their Act of incorporation may be amended; and whereas it is expedient to grant the prayer of their petition; and, whereas it appears, &c.[40].\nIt is to be observed here, 1st., that this Act is obtained upon the petition of the company, and, being passed at their instance and for their benefit, must be construed strongly as against them, and to give effect to their acts and contracts, and so validity to the bonds, which are therein recited to have been issued by them as and for the second issue of bonds, forming part of the \u00a3300,000 sterling, which they were authorized to issue, and, having so obtained the act, they must be estopped from questioning the validity of the bonds in the hands of purchasers for value[41]. 2nd.\u2014The act does not profess to be passed upon the supposition that, or upon any suggestion or representation that, before the issue of the bonds for \u00a3200,000 sterling in the act recited, the conditions precedent to their issue imposed by 37 Vic., ch. 23, had been fulfilled. What is recited is very different and falls short of any such representation. What is recited, in substance and effect, is that it appears to the satisfaction of the Legislature that after the company had performed work which, in the opinion of the Legislature, constituted a completion of the 45 miles, they issued the first and second issues of bonds amounting to \u00a3200,000 sterling in the whole. The recital does not say that the company had put the 45 miles in running order, or that the inspecting engineer of the Government had given his certificate to that effect. On the contrary, from what is recited, we must presume that the Legislature were well aware that no such certificate had been given, but that they were satisfied, from independent evidence taken by themselves, that the 45 miles had been substantially completed, and that with the other subsidies referred to in the preamble, legislative and municipal, enough appeared to justify the Legislature in authorising the remaining \u00a3100,000 sterling of the \u00a3300,000, which the company were authorized to borrow, to be raised by bonds of the last or third issue, under the altered conditions stated in the act. Accordingly the act, in lieu of the provisions in 37 Vic., ch. 23, as to the conditions upon which the third issue might be made, enacts that:\u2014\nSo soon as the rails and ties requisite for the completion of the remaining 45 miles or thereabouts of the company's line shall be purchased, then the one thousand bonds remaining of \u00a3100 sterling each, which shall be designated as being the third issue, may be issued by the company.\nNow, what is this but to say that bonds to the amount of \u00a3200,000 sterling, constituting the bonds which belong to what is termed the \"first\" and \"second\" issues, have been already issued, and that for the remaining \u00a3100,000 sterling of the total sum of \u00a3300,000 may, upon certain conditions, be issued by the company, which shall be regarded as being the third issue. Whether the recital in the preamble as to the time when the first and second issues are said to have taken place was true or not, is, as it appears to me, immaterial, for the Act is, in my opinion, quite insensible, unless, when authorizing the issue of the remaining one thousand bonds of the three thousand authorized to be issued, which are to be regarded as the third issue, it is construed as recognising as good, valid, and binding upon the company, the bonds to the amount of \u00a3200,000 constituting the first and second issues recited as having been already issued.\nThe only way in which bonds for the remaining \u00a3100,000 sterling could be, or could be treated as being the third issue of the \u00a3300,000 sterling bonds, is by regarding the bonds for \u00a3200,000 sterling recited as already issued, as effectually representing the \"first\" and \"second\" issues, and this wholly irrespective of, and so excluding, all enquiry as to whether or not the conditions procedent to their issue as required by 37 Vic., ch. 26 had been fulfilled; and so, as it appears to me, the effect of the statute 37 Vic., ch. 57, is to constitute the bonds, therein recited as having been already issued to the amount of \u00a3200,000 sterling, to be good and valid bonds binding upon the company, although the conditions precedent specified in 37 Vic. ch. 23 had not been fulfilled when they were issued.\nIt is quite unnecessary, in my opinion, to insist upon the recital of the bonds having been issued after the completion of the 45 miles, as affording evidence conclusive or otherwise, of the fact that the 45 miles had been completed in the sense of authorizing the bonds to have been issued under the provisions of 37 Vic. ch. 23; mere completion, of the 45 miles would not, as I have already said, have had that effect. The Act 39 Vic., ch. 57 would be open, in my opinion, to the construction I put upon it, if nothing had been said in its preamble about the 45 miles; if, for example, the recital had been as follows:\nWhereas the Levis & Kennebec Railway Co. have by their petition prayed that the Act to amend their Act of incorporation may be amended; and whereas they have already issued a \"first\" and \"second\" issue of bonds, each of such issues consisting of one thousand bonds for \u00a3100 sterling each, making in the whole \u00a3200,000 sterling; and, whereas since the passing of the said amended Act the subsidies of the Provincial Legislature have been increased, &c., * * * (without saying anything about 45 miles); therefore, it is enacted, &c. * * *\nBut, in truth, the recital which is in the preamble of the Act is not contradicted or disproved by the evidence offered in this case. All that the evidence establishes is that the government inspecting engineer has never certified 45 miles, nor more than 43\u00bd miles, as being complete and in running order, and that the government engineer upon some occasion, but when in particular does not clearly appear, it may have been after the passing of 39 Vic., ch. 57, took off 1\u00bd miles from the length of road which the company insisted upon as being completed, but which the government engineer did not consider completed; how far it was short of completion to satisfy him does not appear. Whether it would have required an outlay of ten dollars or more, and what sum, to complete the miles so \"taken off,\" does not appear. Now, what the preamble recites is in effect, that the Legislature were satisfied that the 45 miles had been completed (a fact which might co-exist with the government engineer not being so satisfied,) in such manner as to warrant the Legislature in regarding them as complete and in recognizing the second issue equally as the first, and so justifying them in granting the prayer of the company's petition, as to the remaining \u00a3100,000 sterling to constitute the \"third\" issue.\nAfter the passing of 39 Vic. the certificate of the government engineer was no longer a matter essential to be established, and by that Act, so obtained by the company, they were, in my opinion, for ever estopped from setting up in answer to any claim made for recovery of the amounts purported to be secured by bonds coming within the designation of the \"second\" issue, that those bonds had been issued ultra vires; and this, as appears to me, is all that is necessary to be, established; for if the company cannot dispute the validity of the bonds, they cannot always have been, and be null, void, and of no effect, as they have been pronounced to be by the judgment appealed against; and if they are good, valid, and binding upon the company in an action against them, they must be so, also, as against all creditors of the company holding bonds for other parts of the \u00a3300,000 sterling; for all bonds issued to that amount, to whatever class belonging, whether to the first, the second, or the third issue, are put upon the same footing, none having a preference over another. It is contended upon behalf of the Quebec Central Railway Co., that, so to hold, would be inequitable and unjust towards them upon the ground that they, as holders of the bonds of the first issue, lose the benefit which the completion of the 1\u00bd miles, which, in the opinion of the government engineer, the work done by the company falls short of 45 miles, would give to their securities, and they think it therefore equitable that they should have, as additional security for their bonds, the benefit which the outlay of the proceeds of the second issue to the amount of \u00a3100,000 sterling has contributed to the completion of the 43\u00bd miles admitted to have been completed; but, in truth, the security of the holders of all the bonds is increased beyond what it originally was by the subsidies recited in 39 Vic., ch. 57, and this claim of the Quebec Central Railway Co. is made in the face of the further fact, that they have acquired the whole of the corporate estate, rights and privileges of every description of the Levis & Kennebec Railway Co. vested in them under a statute which enacts that nothing in that statute shall, in any wise, affect the rights of the creditors of the Levis & Kennebec Railway Co. If the Quebec Central Railway Co. cannot maintain their contention upon strict, rigid principles of law, as distinguished from equity, they cannot, in my opinion, upon principles of equity.\nAssuming, therefore, the record of the case before us to be properly framed, so as to make an adjudication as to the validity of the bonds of the Levis & Kennebec Railway Co. of which the corporation of the city of Quebec are the holders effectual and conclusive, I am of opinion that they are good, valid and effectual against the Levis & Kennebec Railway Co., and the property by the bonds purported to be hypothecated, and that they rank equally with the bonds of the same company held by the Quebec Central Railway Co., and equally with those latter bonds affect all the property of the Levis & Kennebec Railway Co. by the bonds purported to be hypothecated.\nThis appeal, therefore, should, in my opinion, be allowed with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs\nSolicitors for appellants: Pelletier & Chouinard.\nSolicitors for respondents: Irvine & Pemberton.\n[1] 1 M. & W. 529.\n[2] 7 H.

Ritchie, C.J., and Strong, Fournier, Henry and Gwynne, JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW BRUNSWICK.\nBuilding contract\u2014Enforcement of\u2014Violation of city by-law\u2014Liability of owner\u2014Effect of by-law passed after contract was made.\nS. & Co., contractors for the erection of a building for the respondent in the city of St. John, N.B., brought an action claiming to have been prevented by respondent from carrying out their contract. The declaration also contained the common counts, part of the work having been performed. By the terms of the contract the building, when erected, would not have conformed to the provisions of a by-law of the city passed (under authority of an Act of the General Assembly of New Brunswick, 41 Vic., ch. 7) two days after the contract was signed.\nOn the trial of the action the plaintiffs were non-suited, and an application to the Supreme Court of New Brunswick to set such nonsuit aside was refused. Held, (Henry, J., dissenting)\u2014That the by-law of the said city of St. John made the said contract illegal, and, therefore, the plaintiffs could not recover. Walker v. McMillan[1] followed.\nPer Henry, J.\u2014That the erection of the building would not, so far as the evidence showed, be a violation of the by-law, and, therefore, the non-suit should be set aside and a new trial ordered.\nAppeal from the Supreme Court of the Province of New Brunswick, refusing to set aside a non-suit and order a new trial.\nThe action in this case arose out of a contract made between the appellants and the respondent for the erection of a building in the city of St. John, N.B. After the building was partially up a portion of the centre wall gave way, and the appellants (the contractors for the erection of the building) refused to complete it, unless an undertaking was given by the owner that by so doing they would not be considered as acknowledging responsibility for the fall of the wall. Such undertaking was refused and respondent completed the building himself. It appears that two days after the signing of the contract a by-law had been passed by the corporation of the city of St. John, (under the provisions of 41 Vic., ch. 7, N. B.) regulating the erection of buildings in the city, and the erection of this building, according to the terms of the contract, would not be in accordance with the provisions of such by-law.\nThe contract itself and other facts bearing on the case will be found set out in the case of Walker v. McMillan.\nWeldon, Q. C., and Barker, Q. C., for the appellants.\nThis case is very different from Walker v. McMillan. That was an action by a third party who had sustained damage by the negligence of the owner of an adjoining building and the contractor employed by him. Here, we are claiming redress for breach of contract, and would submit:\nThat the contract being lawful when made, and, by subsequent agreement, so altered as to make its performance lawful, it is not affected by a by-law passed after it was made, and the parties had no intention of violating the law, which is an important ingredient in the case, the action being upon a contract. Waugh v. Morris[2]; Pearce v. Brooks[3]; The Teutonia[4].\nThere was evidence to go to the jury as to whether or not a new agreement was made, and, if so, whether or not it was within the terms of the by-law.\nTuck, Q. C., and Straton, for the respondent.\nFrom the time of the injury to respondent's building the contract was in contravention to the city by-law and unlawful. It is admitted that the centre wall, as agreed to be built, became unlawful as soon as the by-law was passed, and such a contract cannot be enforced. Walker v. McMillan[5]; Stevens v. Gourley[6].\nThe intention of the parties has nothing to do with the question. They seek to recover under a contract to erect a building in a manner forbidden by law. The following cases also were cited: Ellis v. The Sheffield Gas Co.[7]; Bower v. Peate[8], and Angus v. Dalton[9].\nWeldon, Q. C., in reply.\nRITCHIE, C. J.:\u2014\nI agree with Mr. Justice King that this case is concluded by the judgment of this court in Walker v. McMillan[10], which judgment is, in my opinion, fully sustained by the case of Hughes v. Percival[11], decided in the House of Lords since the case of Walker v. McMillan was decided. Unless we are prepared to overrule that case (which most certainly I am not prepared to do), the non-suit must stand.\nSTRONG, J., concurred.\nFOURNIER, J.:\nL'action en cette cause est bas\u00e9e sur un contrat pass\u00e9 le 24 septembre 1877. Le 26 du m\u00eame mois un by-law de la municipalit\u00e9 de St. John, pass\u00e9 en vertu d'une loi du Nouveau-Brunswick, r\u00e9glant les constructions de b\u00e2tisses dans la cit\u00e9 de St. John, d\u00e9clarant ill\u00e9gal la construction dans la dite cit\u00e9 de murs d'une \u00e9paisseur moindre que celle pos\u00e9e par le dit r\u00e9glement, devenait en force.\nQuoique le contrat f\u00fbt l\u00e9gal au moment o\u00f9 il fut pass\u00e9, il cessa de l'\u00eatre par l'adoption du r\u00e8glement en question. Les appelants en connaissaient l'existence aussi bien que les dispositions, m\u00eame avant d'avoir commenc\u00e9 leurs travaux, cependant ils les continu\u00e8rent, en contravention aux dispositions du r\u00e8glement. Cette raison seule suffit pour faire rejeter la demande.\nJe suis d'avis de renvoyer l'appel avec d\u00e9pens.\nHENRY, J.:\u2014\nThis is an action by a declaration consisting of three counts\u2014two of them on a building contract, and the third for work and labour done and materials provided. The declaration sets out the written contract, alleges part performance and a readiness to complete it, and that the contractors would have completed but they were hindered and prevented by the respondent from so doing, and that they were wrongfully discharged and prevented from doing and completing the same.\nThe respondent in his eighth plea to the first count, and in his twenty-second plea to the second count, substantially denies that he so prevented or hindered the appellant from completing the contract, and alleges in both pleas that the appellants \"utterly refused to go on and perform their part of the said agreement\" and complete the building. The appellants do not and cannot contend full performance, but depend, to entitle them to succeed, on the reason they allege. The excuse for non-performance must be a legal one, and the onus of proving the issue is on the appellants who allege it. Under the issues raised by the two counts and the pleas thereto, which I have stated, the only question to be preliminarily decided was as to the truth of the appellants' allegation that they were prevented from the full performance of the contract by the respondent. That issue was one to be submitted to, and resolved by, the verdict of a jury, inasmuch as touching it there was conflicting evidence, although the weight of it preponderated greatly in favour of the respondent. The judgment of non-suit having been given, and none of the facts proven as to the issue in question, I think that the judgment of non-suit was not warranted, and that the non-suit should be set aside and a new trial awarded. There is however, another view to be taken of the pleadings and evidence. The contract was entered into on the 24th of September, 1877, for the erection of a building on a lot of land owned by the respondent in the city of St. John, New Brunswick, bounded on the west by Prince William street. It was prescribed to be 55 feet front, four storys high, 105 feet deep, first story; 60 feet deep, second, third and fourth stories. From other evidence it is shown the walls were to have been 65 feet in height. The specification which formed part of the agreement provided for a central wall of brick from front to rear, sixteen inches thick. Two days after the agreement was entered into, the mayor, aldermen, and commonalty of the city of St. John passed a by-law\u2014being authorized so to do by statute\u2014requiring that brick or stone buildings to be subsequently erected in St. John should be according to the prescriptions thereof. The carrying out of the contract in this case, if it involved a breach of any of such prescriptions by any of the parties to it, would not be justifiable. It is shown that the appellants, immediately after entering into the contract, commenced work on the building and continued therewith till the early part of the autumn, when the partition or centre wall gave way, and the greater part of the erection fell. This partition wall was not built according to the provisions of the contract, it being partly built on clay. Before the fall of the building it had rained hard for a part of two days, and from the statements in evidence of one of the appellants, the mortar in parts of it had become softened and was pressed away from its proper connection with the bricks. Wm. M. Sears acted as agent and manager of the respondent as to the building and contract, and the evening before the 8th of September, the appellant, W. C. Spears, received from him a notice demanding him to remove the d\u00eabris of the fallen building, and to rebuild the same as per contract. On the 8th the appellants replied, denying any responsibility for the loss, and refusing to remove the d\u00e9bris or restore the buildings without a written statement from him (Sears) declaring \"that any such acts or operations on my part will in no wise be construed by you as an acknowledgment on my part of any errors or defects in my work, leading to the disaster.\" Upon this negotiations ended, and the respondent proceeded to re-erect the building at his own costs and charges. He alleges that it cost him more than the contract price with the appellants. The question of the liability of the appellants to re-erect the building is not a matter for inquiry in this suit, and it is unnecessary to refer to it. Neither is the question of damages for non-performance of the contract. In addition to the other issue on the two pleas before mentioned, the respondent alleges, in a great many pleas, that the agreement for the partition wall of the width of sixteen inches, became illegal by the by-law before-mentioned; that inasmuch as the walls of the building were over thirty-five feet in height, the partition wall should have been twenty inches to the top of the third floor to have complied with the by-law, and that he, the respondent, was therefore released from the agreement. A great deal of irrelevant evidence, I think, was admitted in this case, and much more than affects the only issues raised.\nI have carefully read and examined the by laws before referred to, and I have wholly failed to find any prescription that the partition walls of a building such as the respondent's should be twenty inches, or indeed of any particular thickness. In fact, the thickness of partition walls in such buildings is, as far as I can see, not specially provided for. In respect of buildings in which the walls exceed thirty feet, provision is made that the foundation walls shall not be less than twenty-four inches, the external walls not less than twenty inches, party walls (other than dwelling houses) not less than twenty inches to the top of the second floor above the street. The only reference to the thickness of partition walls is to be found in number 24, which is as follows:\nEvery building hereafter erected, more than thirty feet in width, except churches, theatres, railroad station buildings and other public buildings, shall have one or more partition walls running from front to rear, and carried up to a height not less than the top of the second story floor joists; said wall or walls may be four inches less in thickness than is called for by the provisions relating to the thickness of walls; these walls shall be so placed that the space between any two of the floor bearing walls of the building shall not be over twenty-five feet.\nThe distinction between party walls and partition walls is readily appreciable, and such distinction is seen to be preserved in the by-laws. No. 18 provides that:\nParty walls for buildings exceeding thirty five in height shall not be less than twenty inches.\nNo. 32 provides that:\nAll party walls shall be carried up to a height of not less than one foot above the roof covering, &c.\nThis shows that a party wall was not intended to be understood as a partition wall, as the latter could not regularly be, and never is, built out through the roof.\nThere is no provision in the by-laws requiring any Wall of a building to be over twenty inches, except foundation walls, which are required to be twenty-four inches. Such, however, are not the walls referred to in No. 24, before quoted.\nSuch being the case, I fail to find any thing in the bylaws requiring a partition wall to be over sixteen inches in thickness, that is, four inches less than the prescribed thickness of the party and external walls, which are required to be not less than twenty inches. There being no other provision for a greater thickness of partition walls, I cannot come to the conclusion that the agreement to build the partition wall in this case was illegal, and that on that account the respondent would be justified in refusing to permit the appellants to re-erect the building and finish their contract; and a non-suit of the appellants would therefore be unjustifiable. The contract, or rather the specification, refers to a plan under the head \"stone walls,\" which were to. be built as cellar walls; and under the head \"brickwork,\" reference is also made to a plan, which was not put in evidence, in this way:\u2014\nAll walls coloured red on plan to be built of brick of the given heights and dimensions.\nAnd, after describing how other parts of the work were to be done,\nTo carry up all walls at least twenty-four inches above the roof to twelve inches thick above the top of the roof beams, all other walls sixteen inches thick throughout their height.\nWithout the plan referred to, where would, no doubt, be found \"the given height's and dimensions,\" I am unable to construe satisfactorily the meaning of the provision as to \"all other walls.\" I am, however, of opinion that the plan showed the external and party walls required to be twenty inches, and that the clause first above quoted was to provide for their height, and that the latter clause was not intended to apply to them. If it did apply to the external or party walls, the agreement would in that respect have been illegal, but as no pretence was made that they were not of sufficient thickness, the fair conclusion is that by the plan they would be shown to be provided to have sufficient thickness. The onus of showing the illegality was on the respondent, and it should have been clearly shown, which it has not been. So far then, I cannot see my way clear to sustain the non-suit.\nThere is, however, a plea setting up the illegality of that part of the contract which is alleged to provide that the walls were to be so placed that the space between the floor-bearing walls would be over twenty-five feet, which, under the concluding clause of number 24 of the by-laws, would be illegal. I have carefully consulted the specification and I can find nothing therein to show whether one or more partition walls were to have been built. That, however, I have no doubt was provided for by the building plan referred to, but as it is not in evidence we cannot decide that the contract in that respect is illegal, when we have not the necessary proof. The width of the building from the centre of the two outside walls was shown to be 55 feet. Each wall 20 inches, taking half off each side would leave a space of 53 feet 4 inches. A wall in the centre of 16 inches would leave a space on each side of 26 feet, one foot more than prescribed by the by-law. It was for the respondent to furnish evidence of the illegality alleged, and that evidence is in this respect wholly wanting\u2014because, for all that appears by the agreement the plan referred to may have provided for more than one partition wall. There are a great many other pleas on the record to which it is quite unnecessary, in my opinion, to refer; but in reference to the general plea of illegality of the agreement I may say that I have carefully considered the agreement and the by-laws, and can discover nothing that could affect our decision of the issues on that point. The judgment of a majority of this court in Walker v. McMillan[12] was cited and referred to on the trial, but the decision of this case depends on other evidence and the issues are wholly different. That was an action to recover damages for losses sustained by the negligence of the parties to this action. The decision of this court was not, in that case, founded solely on the statutory negligence attributed through a violation of the by-law, but upon other evidence of negligence on the part of the present appellants by means of defective building, by which the respondent's building fell down and injured that of the respondent in that case, and for which this court held the present respondent answerable under the facts in evidence in that case. The alleged deficiency in the thickness of the partition wall was not stated in the judgment of the learned Chief Justice of this court, in which my brothers Fournier and Taschereau and I concurred\u2014to be the cause of the illegality referred to. The illegality was stated in general terms. As far as my memory serves me, it was tacitly, if not expressly, admitted on the argument of that case, that a 16 inch partition wall would be a violation of the by-law, and having examined the evidence, I find the plan was in evidence in that case. We had therefore, in that case, what was absolutely necessary to properly understand and construe the specification which referred to it, and which is, in respect of the question now under consideration, all important, and without which we cannot decide whether or not the agreement is illegal. To come to a conclusion on the issues now before us I had more specially to examine the agreement and by-laws, and with the result before stated.\nAt the instance of the counsel for the appellants, the learned judge on the trial did not submit the issues raised on the third count to the jury, as the counsel preferred a judgment of non-suit on the two special counts, and it is only with them we have to deal. I am of opinion that the non-suit should be set aside and a new trial ordered, with the costs of the appeal to this court.\nGWYNNE, J.:\u2014\nIn the case of McMillan against the above defendant[13], I was of opinion that the by-law of the corporation of the city of St. John for regulating the mode of constructing buildings in the city of St. John, passed upon the 26th September, 1877, in pursuance of the provisions of an Act of the Legislature of the Province of New Brunswick, 41 Vic., ch. 7, known as \"The St. John Building Act of 1877,\" had no application whatever to the matters in issue in that action, which was one for damages alleged in the declaration to have been occasioned to certain property of the plaintiff by negligence in the manner in which a house, which was being erected for the defendant under a contract entered into by him with the present plaintiff, was erected. It seemed to me to be reconcilable neither with principle nor with authority that the plaintiff in that action should recover against the defendant by reason of the latter's non-compliance with the provisions of the bylaw, for an injury which the plaintiff charged to be, and which the jury found to be, and which was upon all sides admitted to be, attributable, not to non-compliance with the provisions of the by-law, but to causes wholly independent of, and in no way connected with, the provisions of the by-law or the violation thereof. Non-compliance with the provisions of the by-law not having caused the injury complained of, I could not see what application the by-law could have to the matters in contestation in that action, but in the present one, that by-law and its provisions constitute, in my opinion, the material substance of the matter now under consideration. The by-law, and the fact that the work for which the plaintiffs bring this action was executed by him in violation of its express terms and provisions, and in a manner prohibited thereby, are specially pleaded in bar of the action, the gist of the pleas setting up this defence being, that although the contract declared upon was executed on the 24th September, 1877, and the by-law passed on the 26th of the same month, yet that the work now sued for was not commenced until after the by-law was passed, and thereafter the plaintiffs, in violation of the terms of the by-law, commenced and proceeded with the work; and the evidence, moreover, shows that they did so with full knowledge of the by-law and its provisions. Upon this ground alone, without reference to the other grounds of defence pleaded, I am of opinion that the non-suit must be sustained, which, it appears, the plaintiffs agreed to accept rather than that the case should be submitted to the jury in the manner in which the learned judge who tried the case proposed to submit it, he having expressed the opinion that the plaintiffs could not recover for work done under the contract, such work having been of a nature which was prohibited by the terms of the by-law, and therefore illegal. Although the contract was not illegal upon the 24th September, when it was executed, the execution of the work thereby contracted for became illegal two days afterwards by the passing of the by-law, and the proceeding with the work thereafter by the plaintiffs, under the contract, was as illegal as if they had done so under a contract which had been executed after the passing of the by-law, and for such work they can no more recover in the one case than they could in the other. The judgment of the court below should, in my opinion, be affirmed, and appeal dismissed.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellants: Weldon & McLean.\nSolicitor for respondent: James Straton.\n[1] 6 Can.

L. P. Act\u2014Payment by drawer into court by order of a judge, effect of.\nAn action was brought by respondent as endorsee of a promissory note made by appellants in favour of one J. A. and by him endorsed to respondent. The appellants pleaded that the amount of the note had been attached in their hands by one of A's judgment creditors and paid under the garnishee clauses of the Common Law Procedure Act of P. E. I,, transcripts of secs. 60 to 67 inclusive, of the English C. L. P. Act, 1854. To this plea respondent demurred on the ground that the debt was not one which could properly be attached, and on the 5th February, 1883, the Supreme Court gave judgment in favour of the respondent on the demurrer. No rule for judgment on the demurrer was taken out by the respondent. On the 19th March following an order was obtained to ascertain amount of debt and damages for which final judgment was to be entered, and judgment was signed for the respondent on the 2nd May fol\u00adlowing. The appellants then appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nHeld (reversing the judgment of the court below), that an overdue promissory note in the hands of the payee is liable to be attached by a judgment creditor under the C. L. P. Act, and that payment of the amount by the garnishee to the judgment creditor of the payee, in pursuance of a judge's order, is a valid discharge.\nOn motion to quash for want of jurisdiction, it was contended on behalf of respondent that the appellant should have appealed from the judgment rendered on the demurrer on the 5th February, 1883, and within thirty days from that date ; but,\nHeld, that the judgment entered on the 2nd May, 1883, was the \"final judgment\" in the case from which an appeal would lie to the Supreme Court.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Supreme Court of Prince Edward Island.\nThis was an action to recover the amount of a promissory note made by defendants on 5th December. 1876, payable to Isaac Auld or order, for the sum of $200 twelve months after date, with interest at rate of 10 per cent. per annum until paid, and which note Auld endorsed to the plaintiff.\nDefendants pleaded: that after the making of the said promissory note, and after the same became due and pay able, and while the said Isaac Auld was the legal holder of the said note, and before the same was endorsed to the plaintiff, Alexander Strang and Jessie Strang, his wife, obtained a judgment in the Supreme Court of this island, at Charlottetown, for the sum of $1,500 damages, and $118.65 costs of suit, making in all $1,618.65, against the said Isaac Auld, and was a judgment creditor of the said Isaac Auld within the meaning of the Common Law Procedure Act, 1873, for that amount; and afterwards, and while the said Isaac Auld was the legal holder of the said note, and after the same became due and payable, and before it was indorsed to the now plaintiff, the said Alexander Strang and Jessie Strang, his wife, in pursuance of the said Act, as such judgement creditors, made an ex parte application to Mr. Justice Hensley, one of the judges of the said court, upon affidavit by the said Alexander Strang, stating that such judgment had been recovered, and that it was still unsatisfied, and that the now defendants were indebted to the said Isaac Auld, and were within the jurisdiction of the said court, whereupon it was, in pursuance of the said Act, ordered by the said judge that all debts due and owing, or accruing due, from the now defendants to the said Isaac Auld, should be attached to answer the said judgment debt, and that the now defendants should appear before the said judge to show cause why they should not pay the said Alexander Strang and Jessie his wife the debt due from the now defendants to the said Isaac Auld, or so much thereof as might be sufficient to satisfy the said judgment debt; and the said order was duly served on the now defendants, and the now defendants did not forthwith pay into court the amount due from them to the said Isaac Auld, or any part thereof, and did not dispute the debt due from them to the said Isaac Auld, whereupon it was, in pursuance of the said statute, duly ordered by the honourable Edward Palmer, Chief Justice of the said Supreme Court, that the now defendants should forthwith pay the said Alexander Strang and Jessie Strang, his wife, judgment creditors as aforesaid, the said debt due from them to the said Isaac Auld, judgment debtor, and that in default thereof an execution should issue for the same, being the amount of the claim herein pleaded to, towards satisfaction of the said judgment debt, and the last mentioned order was duly served on the said defendants ; and afterwards the defendants paid to the said Alexander Strang and Jessie Strang his wife, under such proceedings as aforesaid, the amount of the note and interest due thereon and herein pleaded to, arid the said note was indorsed by the said Isaac Auld to plaintiff after it became due and after the payment by the now defendants to the said Alexander Strang and Jessie his wife, under the proceedings aforesaid.\nThe plaintiffs both joined issue and demurred as follows:\nThe plaintiff takes issue on the defendants' plea.\nAs to the defendants' plea, says that the same is bad in substance.\nA matter of law intended to be argued is, that the order for attachment, and the order for payment of all debts due from the defendants to the said Isaac Auld, and the payment by the defendants of said moneys so due by them, is no defence to this action as against the present plaintiffs.\nThere was a joinder in demurrer.\nThe respondent subsequently obtained an order from one of the judges of the court below ordering the issues in law to be first disposed of.\nThe following were the plaintiff 's points for argument on demurrer:\n1\u2014That the order for attachment and the order for payment and the payment there under, is no defence to this action, as against the present plaintiff.\n2\u2014That the promissory note, the subject of this action, is not a debt within the meaning of the Common Law Procedure Act of 1873, being a negotiable security.\n3\u2014That the payment under the orders for attachment herein is not such an equity, attaching to the Promissory note, the subject of this action as can be set up by the defendants against the plaintiff, the endorsee of the note, although it was endorsed after it was due.\n4\u2014That the payment made under the provisions of the Common law Procedure Act, as alleged in plea, only amounts to a discharge ad against the judgement debtor, and does not operate as a discharge as against third persons.\n5\u2014 The pleas are bad because they do not plead the matters set out on equitable grounds.\n6\u2014 The plea is bad as it does not shows that the claim or debt of plaintiff was barred by the order of a judge.\nThe case came on for argument, and was heard before the full Supreme Court of the Province on the fifth day of February, A. D. 1883, and on a subsequent day judgment was given on said demurrer in favour of the plaintiff below by Peters and Hensley, JJ., two of the judges of the Supreme Court of this province, the chief justice dissenting.\nOn the 19th day of March last, the respondents obtained an order absolute, authorizing the prothonotary of the Supreme Court of this Province to ascertain or compute the amount of debt and damages for which final judgment was to be entered in said cause.\nOn the 24th day of March, A. D. 1883, the prothonotary computed the amount for which final judgment was to be entered in the said cause,\nNo rule for judgment on the demurrer or other rule except the rule to compute above set forth was taken out by the respondent, nor was any judgment signed until the second day of May, A. D. 1883, on which day judgment was signed for the plaintiff below.\nThe application to quash appeal for want of jurisdiction made on the ground that time for appeal should run from the date of the judgment on the demurrer and that the present appeal was too late, was dismissed.\nL. H. Davies, Q.C., for appellant:\nThe garnishee clauses of the local statute, under which the proceedings in this cause were taken, are transcripts of the 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66 and 67 sections of the English Common Law Procedure Act, 1854.\nThe effect of an order that all debts owing or accruing from the garnishee to the judgment debtor to answer the judgment debt is, when served, In re Stanhope Silkstone Collieries Company ([1]) to bind the debt or debts, and prevent the creditor, i.e., the judgment debtor, from receiving it or them. Per Cotton, L.J., ex parte Jocelyne, In re Watt ([2]); Chatterton v. Watney ([3]).\nIt is immaterial whether the attached debts are due and payable at the time of the service of the order nisi, because the effect of the order is to deprive the judgment debtor of the right to receive, leaving the garnishee to shew cause why he should not pay.\nFurther, the attachment is not of the note but of the debt, which the garnishee has by payment admitted did at one time exist between him and judgment debtor, and which was only suspended during the running of the note.\nTaking the note only operated as a suspension of the original debt due from appellants to the judgment creditor, and on the note becoming due in the hands of that judgment debtor, the original debt revived and existed at the time of garnishment ([4]).\nThe payment made by order of the judge to, the judgment creditor, was in the eye of the law a payment to the judgment debtor. It was therefore, an equity attaching to the note when Auld, after that payment, endorsed it to respondent.\nAfter payment a note loses all its validity, and is no longer negotiable. Story Prom. Notes ([5]).\nThe obvious reasons which may be urged for excluding current promissory notes from the operation of the garnishee clauses, viz., that they would destroy their negotiability, do not extend to overdue notes in hands of payee. See Drake on Attachment ([6]).\nThe arguments of the majority of the court below, that it would be very inconvenient to construe the statute as embracing debts secured by overdue promissory notes, are based upon an imaginary condition of things, and are not sound, and cannot override the statute. In actual life, overdue promissory notes are not accepted as securities for large advances, as suggested in the judgment, and every mercantile man knows that in taking such an instrument he takes it at his peril, and subject to the chances of its having been paid, &c.\nThe appellants, having once been compelled to pay the notes, by order of a court of competent jurisdiction, will not be compelled to pay it a second time. Wood v. Dunn ([7]); Westoby v. Day ([8]).\nA. Peters, for the respondents:\nThe real quesion in dispute raised by the demurrer is, \u201cwhether or not debts secured by promissory notes are attachable, under the garnishee clauses of the C. L. P. Act, 1873, when overdue.\"\nMy first point is, that debts secured by negotiable instruments are not attachable. The 258th section of the P. E. Island Common Law Procedure Act (English Act, 1854, section 65,) provides that payments made by the garnishee shall be a discharge as against the \"judgment debtor.\" In order to support the appellant's construction, the statute should read as against those claiming through him, and I contend that the discharge given by the section is a discharge only against \" the judgment debtor,\" and cannot be set up except by a person who comes strictly within the words of the section, and does not apply to an action brought by a third person ; and this is obvious, for if it was intended that negotiable instruments could be attached, some machinery would have been provided for seizing the note itself, or, in case that could not be done, of indemnifying the person paying against the note, as is done in several of the states of the United States of America in the case of garnishment of negotiable paper. See Law of Mississippi and Iowa, cited in \"Drake on Attachments ([9]), and analogous to the provision of the English law in case of plea of lost note pleaded.\nSuppose the maker of a note is garnisheed, or attempted to be garnisheed, does he know whether the judgment debtor is then the holder of the note or not; and may he not be garnisheed when he actually believes that the note is in the hand of the judgment debtor, when as a matter of fact it has been endorsed away?\nAgain, the garnishee, if he is compelled to pay the note without any indemnity, and without getting his note, is left open to the risk and annoyance of having to defend an action brought against him by an indorsee claiming to be an indorsee before the attachment, when he, the garnishee, is not in a position to prove when the note was actually endorsed; the risk of paying costs that the garnishee might be compelled to run would, in such case, be very great and very unjust.\nBy the common law no person is required to pay a negotiable instrument unless the instrument is delivered up to him at the time of payment. See Hansard v. Robinson ([10]); Byles on Bills ([11]).\nI also contend that this statute should not be construed so as to alter the common law in so material a point unless the statute is express. See Maxwell on Statutes ([12]). Again, if the maker of a negotiable instrument can be attached, the same process might be applied against an indorser, which must lead to evident inconvenience. For instance, suppose a note made by \"A\" in favor of \"B,\" or order indorsed by \"B\" to \"C\" and \"C\" to \"D,\" a judgment is obtained against \"D,\" and \"C\" is garnisheed and compelled to pay, \"C\" has no means of obtaining the note from \"D\" or of compelling him to give it to him (especially if \"D\" is in a foreign country). How is \"C\" to recover against the previous indorser or the maker?\nThe garnishee clauses apply to ordinary debts only, and not to those secured by negotiable securities, See Holmes v. Tutton ([13]) per Lord Campbell, where he says, the enactment under our consideration, extends the power of executing the judgment of mere ordinary debts, though not secured by bill or note followed in Turner v. Jones ([14]); Mellish v. The Buffalo Ry. Co. ([15]). Drake on attachments ([16]).\nIt is said that though negotiable instruments which are not due may not be attachable, still, that an attachment of an overdue note is an equity which would affect it in the hands of an indorsee who took it after it was due. I answer that it is not such an equity. The indorsee of overdue paper takes it subject to all the equities which attached to the bill in the hands of the holder at the time it became due, arising out of, or con- nected with, the bill transaction itself, but not arising out of any collateral matter. Burrough v. Moss ([17]); Oulds v. Harrison ([18]); and see also per V. C. Malins in re Overend and Gurney ex parte Swan ([19]), where he says, \"it is the equities which attach to the bill, not the equities of the parties ; Holmes v. kidd ([20]). See Story on Bills ([21]); Story on promissory notes ([22]) where he states that the law of France goes further and holds an attachment an equity; Byles on Bills ([23]); Stein v. Yglesias ([24]). A note does not lose its negotiability after it becomes due, but it is only then encumbered with the equities which legally attach to it and which are fully defined in the case above cited.\nRITCHIE, C. J.:\u2014\nThis is an appeal from the judgment of the Supreme Court of Prince Edward Island.\nThis action was brought by respondent as endorsee of a promissory note made by the appellants in favor of one Isaac Auld, and by him endorsed to respondent. The appellants pleaded that after the note fell due, and while Auld, the payee, held it, the amount was attached in their hands by one of Auld's judgment creditors, by whom they were summoned before one of the judges of the Supreme Court, who ordered them to pay the amount of the note to the judgment creditor, and that, in obedience to such order, they paid it, and that the note was after this, while long overdue, endorsed to respondent.\nTo this plea respondent demurred, and a majority of the court sustained the demurrer, holding that\u2014\nAn overdue promissory note in the hands of the payee is not liable to be attached by a judgment creditor of the payee, and that the garnishee clauses of the statute do not extend to promissory notes. From this judgment appellants appeal.\nI have no doubt that a promissory note overdue, in the hands of the payee, is liable to be attached by a judgment creditor of the payee, the garnishee clauses of the Common Law Procedure Act, in my opinion, extending to overdue promissory notes, and that, irrespective of any question as to the right of a judgment creditor to attach an overdue promissory note, I think a payment into court by the drawer of the amount of such a note, in obedience to an order of a court of competent jurisdiction, discharges the drawer from any further liability on the note, and that the subsequent endorsement by payee to a third party gave such party no right of action against the drawer on the note.\nSec. 65 of C. L. P. Act, 1873, provides that\u2014\nPayment made on execution upon the garnishee under any such proceeding as aforesaid shall be a valid discharge to him, as against the judgment debtor, to the amount paid or levied, although such proceeding may be set aside, or the judgment reversed ([25]).\nThe case of Alien v. Dundas ([26]), clearly establishes that the law, which is founded on wise and sound principles, will never compel any person to pay a sum of money a second time which he has once paid under the sanction of a court having competent jurisdiction. This case has been often since referred to with approval.\nSee per Channell, B., in Wood v. Dunn ([27]), in which the question was as to the protection of a garnishee under an order of a court of competent authority, in which case Pigott, B., says:\u2014\nThe garnishee's duty is to obey the order; not to contest conflicting claims.\nand in which case, Channell, B., considered it neces- sary to examine the decided cases, and see whether there was anything in them to induce the judge's sitting in a court of error to decide \"in opposition,\" as he expresses it, \"to the broad principle of protecting honest payments made under competent authority; \"and taking the first case of a payment being made under the order without any notice of an assignment, then, he says:\u2014\nWe think we ought to hold that the payment has been made under the sanction of a court of competent authority, and that it ought to be protected.\nAnd on the whole case he concludes thus: \u2014\nWe think that it sufficiently appears in this plea, that the payment was made in obedience to the order of a competent authority, and is, therefore, protected, and the judgment of the court of Queen's Bench should be reversed.\nPayment into court by a garnishee, under a judge's order, is a payment within this section, and discharges the garnishee.[28]\nIn Culverhouse v. Wickens (), Willes, J. says:\u2014\nIt is clear that if the garnishee pays the money into court under a garnishee order instead of disputing the debt, it is, under sec. 65 of the Common Law Procedure Act, 1854, equivalent to a payment to the judgment creditor, and it should seem to be the same if money is subsequently paid into court by the garnishee, by order of a judge,\nBovill, C.J.:\u2014\nWith respect to the sum of \u00a325 that has been paid into court I see no reason for granting the rule. Under the 63rd sec. of the Common Law Procedure Act, 1854, the garnishee may pay into court the money he acknowledges to be due from him, and by the effect of that and the 65th section such a payment would undoubtedly discharge the garnishee. In this case the money was paid in under the order of a judge, but it was paid in as an acknowledgment of the debt, and I think the effect was the same as if it had been paid in in-pursuance of the section above alluded to,\nWilles, J:\u2014 The 65th section of that Act must refer, I think, to all payments by the garnishes into court, whether made under the 63rd section as an acknowledgment of the debt, or subsequently under a judge's order, to be held for the creditor if he proves his claim to be just. The latter is, in fact, a payment to him if his claim is just, because it is payment into court in trust for him,\nIn Sampson v. Section Railway Co. ([29]), Lush, J. says:\u2014\nThe right to attach a debt owing to the judgment debtor by a third party is a species of execution against the property of the judgment debtor. For the purpose of this new remedy given by the Common Law Procedure Acts, the debt is made equally available to the judgment creditor as property seizable under a fi. fa., and his rights are as ample in the one case as in the other, The machinery provided for determining questions of disputed liability has reference solely to cases where the garnishee disputes his liability to the judgment debtor. And although we have no doubt that the state of accounts between the garnishee and the judgment debtor may and ought to be gone into, so that the garnishee may not be in a worse position than if he had been sued for his debt by the judgment debtor, the case is different as between him and the judgment creditor. There is no place for the discussion of cross claims between the garnishee and the judgment creditor. If it had been intended to let in such claims, some mode of adjusting them in case of dispute would have been also provided. But there is none. The words of sec. 63 of the Act of 1854 appear to us clearly to define what is the right of the judgment creditor: \" If the garnishee does not forthwith pay into court the amount due from him to the judgment debtor, or an amount equal to the judgment debt, and does not dispute the debt due, or claimed to be due, from him to the judgment debtor, or if he does not appear upon summons, then the judge may order execution to issue, and it may be sued forth accordingly, without any previous writ or process, to levy the amount due from such garnishee towards satisfaction of the judgment debt.\" All that the judge has to do is to decide whether the circumstances are such as to make it right and just that the garnishee should pay and that the judgment creditor should have execution against him. Having decided against the garnishee, the judge cannot go on to settle the accounts between him and the judgment creditor, nor to impose, as a condition of granting the remedy to which the statute entitles him, that he shall pay what he may owe to the garnishee. The case of Wood v. Dunn ([30]), is also referred to.\nIn re Stanhope Silkstone Collieries Company ([31]), shows that the order of attachment, or the writ of attachment, (which James, L. J., says, in his opinion, are the same thing), does not prevail until it has been executed by being served on the debtor, and then, at the time, as an execution against goods actually executed.\nI am of opinion to allow this appeal,\nSTRONG, J.:\u2014\nIt has been decided by an Irish case\u2014Pyne v. Kinna ([32])\u2014that a promissory note held by the judgment debtor as payee or endorser, not yet due, is not liable to attachment, for the reason that it may be endorsed to a bon\u00e2 fide holder for value without notice before it became due, but this reason is obviously inapplicable to an overdue promissory note, as the plea alleges this to have been when the attaching order was made. It would seem therefore, that as every subsequent endorsee would take the note subject to the equities to which the payee was liable, and as it was, beyond all question, by force of the express enactment of the provincial statute, corresponding to Common Law Procedure Act (Eng.), 1854, sec. 65, to be considered paid so soon as payment was made to the judgment creditor according to the exigency of the order, that it stands on the same footing as a bond. Sec. 65 of the English Common Law Procedure Act, 1854, is as follows:\u2014\nPayment made on execution levied upon the garnishee under any such proceeding as aforesaid, shall, be a valid discharge to him as against the debtor, liable under a judgment to the amount paid or levied, although such proceeding may be set aside or the judgment order reversed.\nSo that, even granting that the order ought hot to have been made, the statute makes the payment under it good, and the plaintiff must therefore, on the averments of this plea, be considered as the endorsee of an overdue note which had been paid and satisfied before it was endorsed to him.\nI venture to suggest, however, that in order to prevent frauds such as that practised in the present case, it would be a prudent and proper precaution if the court were to order the judgment debtor, on payment by the garnishee to the creditor, to deliver up the note to the latter, an order which the court, under its general equitable jurisdiction, has clearly power to make.\nThe judgment must be reversed, and judgment on demurrer entered for the defendant, and the appellant must have his costs of the appeal.\nFOURNIER, J., concurred.\nHENRY, J.:\u2014\nThis is an action on a promissory note by the endorsee of the payee. The record shows, that after the note fell due, proceedings were taken by a judgment creditor of the payee, under the provisions of the Garnishee Act of Prince Edward Island, against the drawers of it. That Act is the same as the English Act on the same subject. The drawers appeared and admitted the debt due by them to the payee, and subsequently paid the amount of the note to the judgment creditor, under an order duly made by a judge in that behalf; the note, however, remaining in the possession of the payee. The drawers, being unable to deny the existence of the debt due by the note to the payee, were not only justified but compelled to admit it, as a contest on that point would be not only useless but expensive, and having so admitted such debt, were obliged to pay the same, as otherwise an execution for the amount might, and no doubt would, have been issued against them to enforce the payment thereof. The words of the statute are: \"all debts owing by the garnishee to the judgment debtor shall be attached to answer the judgment recovered against them.\" Can it be for a moment contended that a debt is any the less a debt because it is secured and evidenced by a promissory note overdue? It is not hard to appreciate the difference in such a case between a current note and one overdue. In respect of the former, there is really no debt due by the maker to the payee, and if endorsed to a third party while current, he, or some other holder would become the creditor therefore of the drawer. A current note cannot therefore, be attached, or if the garnishee, as such, should be called upon to pay the amount, such payment would be no defence to an action at the suit of an endorsee, or any subsequent holder, at all events, if the note were endorsed before falling due.\nThe note in question was what is termed a \"stale note\" before it was endorsed to the respondent, and by well understood rules, his position in regard to it is no better than that of the payee who endorsed it to him, which would not have been the case if the indorsement had been made while the note was current. The endorsee here, it must be held, took the note on the credit of the endorser, and not of the drawer, and any defence available in an action by the payee is, as to all matters antecedent to the endorsement, equally available in an action by the endorsee. This note is shown to have been paid after maturity, and not only so, but its payment was enforced by legal means. The drawers had no option but to pay the amount of the note, and it would, in my opinion, evidence a most unsatisfactory state of the law, if a third party, claiming through the payee whose judgment debt the amount was appropriated to liquidate, could enforce the payment of it a second time. It is contended, on the part, of the respondent, that the appellants might have successfully resisted an order in favor of the judgment creditor until the note was produced. That point, however, it is unnecessary, I think, to discuss. The debt due by the note was paid, and, I think, legally paid. The question as to possession of the note was not at the time raised. The garnishee ran the risk as to the then holder of it, and, if it was then held by the judgment debtor as payee thereof, the payment under the garnishee proceedings was an extinguishment of the debt, and a legal payment of the note.\nI am, for the foregoing reasons, of the opinion that the appeal herein should be allowed, and judgment given in favour of the appellants with costs.\nGWYNNE, J.\u2014I am of opinion that a debt secured by a promissory note overdue in the hands of the payee, who, while the holder thereof, became a judgment debtor to another person, is, while in the hands of such judgment debtor as the legal holder thereof, a debt owing to him by the maker and attachable at the suit of the judgment creditor of the payee. The statute of the province of Prince Edward Island is identical on this point with the English Common Law Procedure Act, and its provision therefore is, that in the case of a judgment recovered by one person against another remaining unsatisfied, all debts owing by, or accruing from, any third person to the judgment debtor may be attached to answer the judgment, and that service upon such third person of an order, that debts due or accruing due to the judgment debtor shall be attached, shall bind such debts in his hands, and that by the same or any subsequent order, it may be ordered that such third person (in the statute called the garnishee) shall appear before a judge or some officer of the court, to be specially named by the judge, to show cause why he should not pay the judgment creditor the amount due from him to the judgment debtor, or so much thereof as may be sufficient to satisfy the judgment debt, and that if the garnishee does not forthwith pay into court the amount due from him to the judgment debtor, and does not dispute the debt, execution may issue to levy the amount due from such garnishee.\nNow the reason why a debt, secured and made payable by a promissory note, is not attachable to satisfy a judgment recovered against the payee while the note is still current\u2014not yet arrived at maturity\u2014is because the amount made payable by such a note is not, before maturity, either a debt owing by, or accruing due from, the maker to the payee within the words of the statute.\nThe amount secured by the note, until maturity, is not a debt owing by the maker and due to the payee or to any one. By the custom of merchants, which governs promissory notes, it is accruing due to the person who shall be the holder thereof at maturity, and therefore cannot be said to be accruing due to the payee, the judgment debtor, within the words of the statute.\nNo such reason however, exists for holding that a debt secured by a promissory note, when overdue and still in the hands of the payee, cannot be attached to satisfy a judgment recovered against the payee, for in that case the amount does constitute a debt owing by the maker, and due and payable to the judgment debtor; and in case the maker does not dispute the debt there can be no reason why such a debt (whether the promissory note was given to secure an antecedent debt, or one which was incurred only at the time of the making of the note) should not come within the comprehensive words of the statute \"all debts owing by the garnishee to the judgment debtor shall be attached to answer the judgment recovered against him.\"\nThe plea here avers not only that at the time of the order nisi being served upon the defendant, the maker of the note sued upon, the note was overdue, but that it was then in the hands of the payee, judgment debtor, as the legal holder thereof, and that the maker did not dispute the debt; and further, that he had, in fact, paid the amount of the note to the judgment creditor in obedience to a judge's order to that effect, granted under the circumstances authorized by the statute before ever the note was transferred by the payee to the present plaintiff; all which being admitted by the demurrer, the defendant has, in my opinion, shown a good bar to the present action, for the statute expressly provides that payment by the garnishee, in pursuance of a judge's order granted under the circumstances stated in the plea, shall be a valid discharge as against the judgment debtor, and being so, it must be a good defence to an action, brought by a person who admits on the record that his sole claim to, and property, in the note was acquired from the person whose interest in the note and in the amount secured thereby was extinguished by a good and valid payment after the note had become due, and before ever the present plaintiff had received a transfer of the note or had acquired any interest therein.\nThe appeal should be allowed with costs and judgment be ordered to be entered for the defendants in the court below with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for appellants: L.

Stats. ch. 37\u2014Directed to two Commissioners\u2014Return signed by one only\u2014Failure to administer interrogatories.\u2014Mar. Ins.\u2014Total loss\u2014Notice of abandonment\u2014Waiver.\nA commission was issued out of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick directed to two commissioners\u2014one named by each of the parties to the suit\u2014to take evidence at St. Thomas, W. I., with liberty to plaintiff's commissioner to proceed ex parte if the other neglected or refused tb attend. Both commissioners attended the examination, and defendants' nominee cross-examined the witness, but refused to certify to the return, which was sent back to the Court signed by one commissioner only. Some of the interrogatories and cross-interrogatories were put to the witnesses by the commissioners.\nHeld,\u2014That the failure to administer the interrogatories according to the terms of the commission was a substantial objection, and rendered the evidence incapable of being received. Per Ritchie C.J., and Strong, Fournier and Henry JJ., that the refusal of one commissioner to sign the return was merely directory, and did not vitiate it.\nPer Gwynne J., That the return should have been signed by both commissioners, and not having been so signed was void, and the evidence under it should not have been read.\nOn a voyage from Porto Rico to New Haven respondents' vessel sustained damage and put into St. Thomas. A survey was held by competent persons named by the British consul, and according to their report the cost of putting her in good condition would exceed her value. The captain, under instructions from owners to proceed under best advice, advertised and sold vessel, and purchaser had her repaired at a cost much less than the report, and sent her to sea.\nHeld, that there was no evidence to justify the jury in finding that the vessel was a total loss.\nOwners of vessel gave notice to agent of underwriters that they would abandon, which agent refused to accept. Owners telegraphed to Captain that they had abandoned and for him to proceed under the best advice.\nHeld, that this act of telegraphing to the Captain did not constitute a waiver of the notice of abandonment.\nAppeal from a judgment of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick, refusing to make absolute a rule nisi for a non-suit.\nThe action was upon two policies of insurance upon the hull and freight of the respondents' vessel (\"The Star\") for a voyage from Porto Rico to New Haven. After starting upon the voyage the vessel encountered heavy weather, and put into St. Thomas, where a survey was ordered, and made by parties admitted to be the most competent obtainable, appointed by the British Consul. The report of the surveyors showed that it would cost $4,500 to put the vessel in good repair, which was largely in excess of the captain's estimate of her value, and on notifying the owners, he was advised that they had abandoned to the underwriters, and directed to proceed under the best advice. It appeared on the trial that the agent of the underwriters refused to accept notice of abandonment. The captain then advertised the vessel, and sold her, the purchaser afterwards causing her to be repaired, at an expense of some $1,300; and she was kept employed for some time after.\nThe evidence for the plaintiff was mostly taken under a commission issued out of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick, directed to two commissioners, one named by each party to the suit, the commission containing a provision, that should the commissioner named by the defendant neglect or refuse to attend the examination of witnesses thereunder, his co-commissioner could proceed ex parte, on giving two days notice of hearing to the other. On the commission being opened at the trial, it appeared that the return was signed by the plaintiffs' commissioner only, although the defendants' commissioner had attended the examination and cross-examined some of the witnesses; and also, that some of the interrogatories had not been put to the witnesses. No reason was alleged for the failure of the other commissioner to sign the return, and the judge at the trial allowed the evidence to be read, subject to the objection of defendants' counsel. A verdict having been found for the plaintiff, a motion was subsequently made to the court in banc to set the same aside and enter a non-suit, which was refused, the majority of the court holding the return to the commission to be regular, and that there was evidence of a total loss to go to the jury. From that judgment the defendants appealed. Weldon Q.C. and Palmer for the appellants:\nThere was no evidence of a total loss. The vessel was in a harbor, a place of safety, and captain got no advice from his owners. Wood v. Stymest[1].\nIf the respondents were entitled to abandon, they had no right to interfere with the property after notice, and the telegram to the master was an interference, and a waiver of the abandonment. Then the sale by the master being unauthorized, and there being no evidence of a total loss, there was no notice of abandonment given in time to make it a constructive total loss.\nThen in regard to the evidence taken under commission, it is submitted that it should not have been read at the trial. By sec. 194 of chap, 37 Con. Stats., the return to the commission must be under the seal of the judge, commissioner or other person taking the same; and by chap. 118, relating to interpretation of terms, a word importing the singular may extend to several persons. Therefore, all commissioners named must sign the return. And more particularly so when the commission itself contained the only provision for one commissioner to act alone, and the facts were not in accordance with such provision.\nAgain, the commission itself was not executed according to the exigencies of the writ, some of the interrogatories not being put. On these grounds it is submitted that the judgment of the court below should be reversed and a non-suit entered.\nBarker Q.C. for respondents:\nIt is not pretended by any one that there was an actual total loss of the vessel, but only a constructive total loss, and that was what the jury really found. The captain acted according to his best judgment, and as soon as possible communicated with the owners. As to the notice of abandonment, that was given as soon as owners were in possession of the facts, and the telegram to the captain was clearly no waiver of the notice, but merely a notification to him of their course.\nThen as to the commission, it is submitted that the return was sufficient; but, if not, the objection goes only to a question of practice, and this court will not interfere. In fact, the application should have been made to a judge at chambers. Grill v. General Iron Collier Co.[2]. As to the failure to administer the interrogatories, the appellants were represented at the examination, and not having then objected, it was too late to do so at the trial. Robinson v. Barnes[3]. The proper course for the appellants was to move to suppress the depositions, and for another commission to issue. For these reasons, I submit that the judgment of the court below must be sustained.\nWeldon Q.C. in reply:\nGrill v. The General Iron Collier Co. does not apply. By the practice in England the depositions are opened before the trial and copies furnished to the parties. As in New Brunswick the commission is not opened until the trial, it would be impossible to apply to a judge at chambers.\nSir W. J. RITCHIE C. J.:\u2014\nUnder the practice and law in New Brunswick, I do not think it was the duty of the defendants to apply before trial to have the evidence under the commission suppressed. So far as my experience goes, such never was the practice in New Brunswick, and it is quite clear that no such motion could be made until the commission was opened, and its contents disclosed, and this could not be done before the trial by reason of the provision of sec. 194, ch. 37 of the Consolidated Statutes of New Brunswick, which enacts that the commission shall not be opened before trial without the consent of the parties.\nBy section 194, no examination or deposition is to be read in evidence without consent of opposite party, unless it is made to appear that the examinant or deponent is out of the province or dead, or unable from sickness or other infirmity to attend the trial:\nIn all or any of which cases the examinations and depositions, certified under the hands of the judge, commissioner, or other person taking the same, shall and may, without proof of the signature to such certificate, be received and read in evidence, saving all just exceptions; provided always, that such examinations or depositions shall be closed up under the seal of the judge, commissioner, or other person taking the same, and addressed to the Supreme Court, and endorsed with the title to the suit in which the same were taken, and shall not be opened before the trial without the consent of the parties to the suit.\nThough the commissioners are named one by each party, when the commission is issued to the commissioners so named do they not become officers of the Court and in no sense agents of the parties, but both alike bound duly and properly to execute the commission, entirely irrespective of either party? Chapter 37 of the Consolidated Statutes makes no provision whatever for the nomination of the commissioners, by the parties. On the contrary, section 188 simply provides that:\nIt shall be lawful for the court and the several judges thereof, in any action therein depending, upon the application of any of the parties to such suit, to order a commission to issue under the seal of the court for the examination of witnesses on oath at any place out of the province, by interrogatories or otherwise, and by the same or any subsequent order or orders, to give all such directions touching the time, place, and manner of such examination, and all other matters and circumstances connected with such examinations.\nOn the face of the commission there is nothing to show that either of the parties had anything to do with naming the commissioners; in fact, for aught that appears, they may have been nominated by the court or judge without reference to the parties at all, though, no doubt, in point of fact, as was stated on the argument, the names may have been suggested one by each party, as no doubt is usually done.\nThe commission in this case is simply addressed to Francisco Fontana, Esq, of St. Thomas West Indies, and Edmund T. Merrill, of the same place, merchant:\nThus know ye that we, in confidence of your prudence and fidelity, have appointed you, and by these presents do give unto you, full power and authority, diligently to examine, &c., upon interrogatories hereto annexed.\nIt then commands that, without delay, and at a certain place or places, at St. Thomas aforesaid, to be appointed by you, the said Francisco Fontana, for that purpose, you (the commissioners) cause the said witnesses for said plaintiffs to come before you at St. Thomas aforesaid, and then and there examine each of them upon the said interrogatories, &c. The words of the commission are:\u2014\nAnd that you do take such examinations and reduce them into writing in the English language, and that when you shall have taken the same, that you do without delay send and return the same certified by you, the said Francisco Fontana, and closed up under your seals, or the seal of you the said Francisco Fontana, you shall alone execute this commission, together with this writ, addressed to the Supreme Court and endorsed with the title to the said cause.\nProvision is made that Francisco Fontana give at least two days' notice in writing of the time and place of executing commission to Edmund T. Merrill, and authorizes Francisco Fontana, in case Edmund T. Merrill refuses or neglects to attend, to proceed ex parte with the examination and execution of commission.\nIn this case the omission to put the questions was by no means an irregularity, but was a most substantial objection affecting the merits; an objection that has, as Mr. Justice Willes expresses it, \"a solid foundation.\" And again, by reason of the express enactment of section 194, no application could be made till the commission was opened and the omission made apparent, which could only be on the trial; and the absence of any such provision in the Imp. Statutes, 1 Wm. IV. ch. 22, entirely distinguishes Grill v. Gen. Iron Screw Collier Co.[4] from this case.\nI do not think there is anything in the objection as to the certifying of the commission. I think this may be treated as merely directory, and not fatal to the reception. The certificate is in the terms of the commission, which directs Francisco Fontana, to certify; if, under the statute, both commissioners must certify, as strictly speaking I think they should, the defendant should have had the commission altered in this respect.\nThe case of Grill v. The General Iron Screw Collier Co., (1) is not applicable to this case. In that case there was at most a mere irregularity, and Willes, J., says he was not convinced there was any irregularity, and then says it is not necessary to decide whether the objections could be taken at the trial, or whether it should be taken before, and on application made at chambers to set aside the depositions, he says:\u2014\nNo question, however, has been suggested which might have been asked with advantage to the defendants, and has been omitted, and it appears, therefore, that the objection has no solid foundation, but only amounts to this, that the questions were put viva voce instead of in Writing.\nKeating J. concurred.\nMontague Smith J. went a little further, and certainly held that the proper course, when there is any irregularity in the mode of taking a commission, was to apply at chambers to have it suppressed. In the Boston Belting Co. v. Gabel[5], Chief Justice Allen says:\nThe commissioners are officers of the court, though nominated by the parties. They are appointed for the purpose of seeing that the evidence of the witnesses, who are examined, is properly taken and certified; and I think they ought not to be treated as the agents of the parties while acting as commissioners, unless it is clear they are so.\nIn the case of Robinson & Co. v. Davies & Co.[6], where the question arose as to the admissibility of evidence not objected to before the commissioners and\u2014\"one \"of the commissioners was the defendants' agent at \"Hamburg and represented their interests\"\u2014the court held that the defendant should have objected, and not having done so, it was too late to do so on the trial. That case is entirely distinguishable from this. The appointment of Merrill, as commissioner, did not make him the defendants' agent and there is not the slightest evidence to show that he was in any way defendants' agent de facto or de jure.\nDavis v. Nicholson[7] is if possible still more inapplicable, so much so that I do not think it necessary to take up further time in discussing it.\nIf all the interrogatories had been put to the witnesses, I should not have thought so much of the non-certifying of the second Commissioner, because by the terms of the commission it is directed to be certified by only one. A commission such as this may be irregular, but it was acquiesced in by defendant, or if he had any objections he should have applied to the judge to have it rectified before being sent for execution.\nBut assuming, even if we could, that each party is to be considered as represented by a commissioner, there is nothing on the face of this commission to show that Merrill, if he was the defendants' commissioner, of which I have no evidence, assented to it or had any power to assent; on the contrary, it appearing on the face of the proceedings that he refused to sign the certificate of the examination that would show that he must have been opposed to the way in which the commission was executed in reference to the examination.\nI do not think that the circumstance of the assured, after. Temple's refusal to accept abandonment, telegraphing to the master that they had abandoned to the underwriters, and that he should follow the best advice in reference to the vessel, amounted, in any way, to a withdrawal or waiver of the abandonment, but amounted to no more than an intimation that they had abandoned the vessel, and he was not to look to them for further advice or assistance. It amounts, in other words, to a refusal to advise the captain, and an intimation that they had nothing more to do with the vessel. That they acted in perfect good faith is evidenced by the fact, that they, while adhering to the abandonment, showed the telegram to Temple before sending it, a statement Temple does not contradict, though he says he did not recollect the fact, whereby Temple was placed in a position to act on the abandonment if he chose, or to leave matters in the hands of the captain, whose duty under such circumstances was to act for the benefit of all concerned.\nI am of opinion, that under the circumstances of the case, the vessel was not an actual total loss when she arrived at St. Thomas, and thatt here was no evidence to justify the jury in finding such to have been the case.\nIf the circumstances warranted a notice of abandonment, which was a question for the jury, and which I think in this case it must be assumed was found in favor of the plaintiff, then I think the notice given was sufficient, but if there is any doubt as to this having been properly left to them, there should have been a new trial, but having found there was an actual total loss, there can be no doubt as to how they would have found as to this. I am therefore of the opinion that the appeal should be allowed.\nSTRONG, FOURNIER and HENRY JJ. concurred.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014The objection taken to the reception of the evidence taken under the commission obtained and issued in this case, by and on behalf of the plaintiffs, is, in my opinion, fatal.\nThe plaintiffs obtained a commission to issue out of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick, directed to Francisco Fontana, Esquire, of St. Thomas, in the West Indies, and Edward T. Merrill of the same place, merchant, appointing them as commissioners to examine certain witnesses to be produced before them, on the part of the plaintiffs in the action, upon interrogatories annexed to the commission; and the said Francisco Fontana was thereby authorized and empowered (in case the said Edward T. Merrill should refuse or neglect to attend at the time and place to be named in a notice in writing, which the said Francisco Fontana was directed to have served upon him, appointing a time and place for executing the commission, or at any adjourned meeting) to proceed ex parte, in the absence of him, the said Edward T. Merrill, with the examination of the said witnesses and the execution of the commission, the same as though he had attended and was present, and upon all the evidence being taken, the said Francisco Fontana was directed to return the commission closed up, under the seals of both of the commissioners, if they both should act, or under the seal of Francisco Fontana, if he alone should execute the commission, and addressed to the Supreme Court. Both of the commissioners acted together throughout the examination of the witnesses whose evidence was directed to be taken under the commission. Mr. Merrill however, for what reason did not appear, refused to sign and seal the commission, and the same was returned signed, sealed, and certified by Fontana alone, although both had acted in the execution of the commission. The reception of the evidence taken under the commission was, for this reason, objected to by the learned counsel for the defendants. By the 188th sec. of ch. 37 of the Consolidated Statutes of New Brunswick, the Supreme Court is empowered to issue commissions for the examination of witnesses upon interrogatories or otherwise, at any place out of the province. By the 194th section it is enacted that no examination or deposition to be taken by virtue of such commission shall be read in evidence at any trial without the consent of the party against whom the same may be offered, unless it shall appear to the satisfaction of the judge, on proof by affidavit or viva voce, that the examina at or deponent is out of the province, or dead, or unable from sickness or other infirmity to attend the trial, in all or any of which cases, the examinations and depositions, certified under the hand of the judge, commissioner or other person taking the same, shall and may, without proof of the signature to such certificate, be received and read in evidence saving all just exceptions; provided always, that such examinations or depositions shall be closed up under the seal of the judge, commissioner, or other person taking the same, and addressed to the Supreme Court and endorsed with the title of the suit in which the same were taken, and shall not be opened before the trial without the consent of the parties to the suit. The effect of this section, read in the light of the Interpretation Act whereby the singular number imports also the plural, is, that without the consent of the party against whom any evidence taken under a commission shall be offered, the same shall not be received and read in evidence unless the examinations and depositions are certified under the hands, and closed up under the seals, of the Commissioners, where there are more than one, or where there is only one, the commissioner taking the same, and so signed and sealed, are returned to the Supreme Court, endorsed with the title of the suit in which the same were taken. Mr. Merrill having joined with Mr. Fontana in taking all the examinations and depositions of the witnesses examined under the commission, his signature and seal was, by the statute, made as necessary to the reception of the evidence as the signature and seal of Mr. Fontana, and this being a statutory requirement, constituting a condition precedent to the reception of the evidence, cannot be dispensed with by the court against the will of the party against whom the evidence is tendered. Noncompliance with this condition precedent is not a mere irregularity, as was the subject of objection in Grill v. General Iron Screw Collier Co.,[8] but a defect which cannot, as it appears to me, be got over without the consent of the parties to the suit.\nThat the objection is not technical only and one of mere form, but that it is one touching the merits of the case, is apparent from the fact that upon the commission being opened, and the evidence in it read, as it was against the will of the defendants, it appeared that some of the interrogatories in chief and of the cross-interrogatories, being those which touched the very marrow and substance of the case, were either not answered at all, or quite insufficiently; and some, for anything appearing upon the commission, were not put to the witnesses at all; these questions were pointed to an enquiry into the nature of the damage done to the vessel insured, for the purpose of ascertaining the nature and extent of it, and of determining whether it was such as to constitute a constructive total loss, or to justify the sale of the vessel, for that she was not an actual total loss, but was in perfect sailing condition, and to all appearance, except in her sails, in the same condition in which she was before receiving the alleged damage, having upon her no visible sign of having undergone recent repairs, but having visible repairs which had been done to her before she sailed upon the voyage in which she received the damage sued for, was abundantly apparent from the evidence of witnesses examined viva voce at the trial. Even if, as was suggested, Mr. Merrill was to be regarded as the agent of the defendants at the examination, a position in support of which there does not appear anything in the evidence, still, that would not have authorized the Commissioners to dispense with putting the interrogatories and executing the commission by taking the examination of the witnesses as they were directed and required by the commsssion to do; nor, in disregard of the provisions of the Statute and against the will of the defendants, would it have authorized the reception and reading of evidence taken under a commission so imperfectly executed. It is impossible, as it appears to me, that any judgment in favor of the plaintiffs can be rendered upon the merits of the case, in the absence of a searching inquiry into the facts as to the actual extent of the damage done to the vessel and attending its sale and the alleged subsequent repair of the vessel, and under the circumstances of imperfection attending the execution of the commission, I am of opinion that what evidence was taken under it should not have been received and read as evidence for the plaintiffs, and that they should therefore have been non-suited.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for Appellant: C.

Court, N. B.\u2014Affidavits in reply\u2014New matter\u2014Discretion of Court below.\nThe cause was referred by Court of Nisi Prius to arbitration, the award to be entered on the postea as a verdict of a jury. After the award the appellants obtained a judge's order for a stay of proceedings, and for the cause to be entered on the motion-paper of the Court below, to enable the appellants to move to set aside the award and obtain a new trial, on the ground that the arbitrators had improperly taken evidence after the case before them was closed. Before the term in which the motion was to be heard, appellants abandoned that portion of the order directing the cause to be placed on the motion paper, and gave the usual notice of motion to set aside the award and postea, and for a new trial, which motion, by the practice of the court, would be entered on the special paper. Defendant, in opposing such motion, took the preliminary objection that the judges order should be rescinded before plaintiffs could proceed on their notice, and presented affidavits on the merits, and plaintiffs requested leave to read affidavits in reply, claiming that defendant's affidavits disclosed new matter. This the court refused, and dismissed the motion, the majority of the judges holding that plaintiffs were bound by the order of the Judge, and could not proceed on the special paper until that order was rescinded, the remainder of the court refusing the application on the merits. On appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nHeld,\u2014That the cause was rightly on the special paper, and should have been heard on the merits, and the court should have exercised its discretion as to the reception or rejection of affidavits in reply; Strong J. dissenting on the ground that such an appeal should not be heard.\nPer Ritchie C.J.\u2014A Court of Appeal ought not to differ from a court below on a matter of discretion, unless it is made absolutely clear that such discretion has been wrongly exercised. The statute[1] applies as well to motions for new trials, where the grounds upon which the motion is based are supported by affidavits, as in other cases. It makes no distinction, but applies to all \"motions founded on affidavits.\"\nAppeal from a judgment of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick refusing to set aside an award in favor of the defendant and to grant a new trial.\nThe cause was referred to arbitration by order of the Judge at Nisi Prius, and the award under it was to be entered as a verdict of a jury. After the award was made, the plaintiffs obtained an order from Judge Weldon staying the proceedings and ordering the cause to be placed on the motion paper of the following term, and heard by the court on a motion to set aside the award. Before the term, plaintiffs gave notice of motion to set aside the award and have a new trial, and by that notice abandoned the portion of Judge Weldon's order directing the cause to be placed on the motion paper, and they entered it on the special paper, according to the usual practice in moving for a new trial When the case was called the defendants objected that Judge Weldon's order was still in force and must be disposed of before plaintiffs could proceed, and the court allowed the hearing subject to such objection. The defendants. then presented affidavits on the merits, whereupon plaintiffs asked leave to read affidavits in reply, claiming that defendants affidavits disclosed new matter. This the court refused, and finally gave judgment for the defendants, some of the judges holding the preliminary objection fatal, the rest of the court refusing the application on the merits. The plaintiffs appealed from that judgment.\nG. F. Gregory and J. G. Forbes for appellants:\u2014\nThe appellants had a right to abandon that portion of Judge Weldon's order directing the cause to be entered on the motion paper, as it was opposed to the practice of the court, and the judge had no power so to order, and it was not necessary to have the order rescinded. Black v. Sangster[2]. In fact being a nullity it could not be rescinded. Sellars v. Dawson[3]. See also on this point Clarke v. Manns[4]; Lander v. Gordon[5]; Woosnam v. Price[6]; The King v. The Inhabitants of Diddleburry[7]; The Queen v. The Inhabitants of St, Paneras[8].\nAgain, we should have been allowed to answer the new matter in the respondent's affidavits opposing our motion in the court below. Admitting that our application was properly made, it is clear that we had such right under sec. 173 of the Con. Stats. And it is not a matter of discretion with the court, but they are bound to grant such an application.\nIt is submitted that your Lordships should hear our affidavits in reply and decide on the merits of the case, or failing that, that the case should be remitted to the court below to be heard on the merits there.\nTuck Q.C. respondent in person, submitted the case to the court. Sir W. J. RITCHIE C.J.\u2014To the court below belongs the right to say whether, in their discretion, the parties should be allowed to produce affidavits in reply; therefore as affidavits in reply could only be properly before the court below, or before this court, after the court below had determined that the defendant's affidavits introduced new matter, and had given permission to plaintiffs to produce affidavits in reply, and no such permission having been given or affidavits read in reply, but on the contrary the court having refused that permission, we have no right now to look at any affidavits or other material not before the court below upon the mere statement of the party that he would have read them in reply if he had been permitted to do so. The question of the preliminary objections being now put aside, the case, in my opinion, should be fully heard on the merits in the court below, but I think we are not to anticipate what the court will or will not do on the hearing on the merits, still less to assume that the court will improperly refuse to allow affidavits to be read in reply if the case is such as to entitle the plaintiffs to that privilege.\nI think there is nothing in the objection that the case should have been heard on the motion paper, and that it was not open to the court to hear it on the special paper (where, according to the rules and practice of the court, it clearly belonged), but that it should have been heard on the motion paper, (where, according to the rules and practice of the court, it clearly did not belong). If called on that paper it would seem to me the court, of its own motion, should have refused to hear it, but have ordered it to be placed on its proper paper, viz., the special paper in accordance with the 48th sec. of chap. 12, 44 Vic.\nIn the Supreme Court of New Brunswick there are two papers; one called the motion paper, on which is entered cases where the party moving has fourteen days before the court served on the opposite party copies of the motion he intends making and of the affidavits on which he bases his motion, and when the motion comes on the party opposing is heard, and the motion is granted or refused.\nThere is also a special paper on which are entered all cases where cause is to be shown, and in which rules nisi have been granted or demurrers are to be heard.\nFormerly, in cases of motions for new trials, the practice was to move on the first Friday or Saturday in term for a rule nisi to set aside the verdict or to enter a non-suit; if granted it was entered on the special paper of the next term, and if no sufficient cause shown, was made absolute (except in the county of York, where the motion for a rule nisi was made on the first day of term, and, if granted, was entered on the special paper of the same term).\nFormerly, motions for new trials were motions nisi, and the causes in which rules nisi were granted were in the following term set down by the party to show cause on the special paper.\nNow, motions \"to set aside verdicts or for judgments non obstante veredicto,\" or for a repleader, are regulated by Act of Assembly, 44 Vic. cap. 12, sec. 3, which dispenses with rules nisi and allows the party seeking a new trial to give notice of the motion to the judge who tried the cause, and to the opposite party; also a statement of grounds of motion with the authorities relied on, and file statement with the Clerk of the Pleas; whereupon such causes shall be entered on the special paper without any rule nisi having been granted. But under neither the old nor the new system were motions for new trials ever entered on the motion paper. But I am doubtful (very) as to the propriety of the court refusing to allow affidavits in answer. Had a majority of the court in their discretion thought affidavits in answer should not have been received, on the ground that defendant's affidavits disclosed no new matter entitling the plaintiff to produce affidavits in reply, I should have hesitated before interfering with such an exercise of their discretion, because a Court of Appeal ought not to differ from the court below on a matter of discretion, unless it was made absolutely clear that they had exercised their discretion wrongly[9]; but instead of this being the case, two of the learned judges\u2014the Chief Justice and Judge Fraser\u2014were of opinion that new matter was disclosed, and that plaintiffs should have an opportunity of answering such new matter; the other three judges expressed no opinion on this point, Judge Weldon being of opinion that there cannot be a postponement to permit affidavits in answer to be produced on motions for new trials; but in my opinion, the statute applies as well to motions for new trials, where the grounds on which the motion is based is supported by affidavits, as in other cases. The Cons. Stats., ch. 37, sec. 173, makes no distinction; but applies to all \"motions founded on affidavits.\" Judge Palmer appears to base his judgment on the preliminary objection that the case should have been heard on the motion paper, but, on the question of allowing affidavits in answer, intimates that, in his opinion, it is not new matter arising out of the affidavits. Judge Wetmore, without expressing any opinion as to the granting of time, says, \"I agree with the views of Mr. Justice Palmer as to the effect of the stay of proceedings.\"\nSo that in fact the question as to the propriety of plaintiffs being allowed to answer those affidavits has never been adjudicated on, the majority of the court having decided against the plaintiffs on other grounds, which I do not think tenable, and which did not involve the exercise of a discretion on this point; and this case should be remitted to the Supreme Court of New Brunswick, and there heard as if no preliminary objection had been raised, or rather that the preliminary objection should be overruled, and the hearing proceeded with on the merits.\nSTRONG J.\u2014As regards the point of practice raised by this appeal I feel bound to follow the Supreme Court of New Brunswick, not merely because I incline to think the judgment of Mr. Jnstice Fraser and those of the other judges who agreed with him was correct, but also because I consider this court ought not to interfere to reverse a decision upon a mere question of practice, and that, too, a practice regulated by rules peculiar to the court appealed from.\nUpon the merits also, at it appears to me, the appeal fails. The affidavits contain ample evidence to show that what Mr. DeForest did in inspecting books, and in making further inquiries of witnesses who had been examined, was authorised by agreement.\nI need not enter more fully into the case, as it does not involve any question of law of general interest, and I am a single dissentient from the present judgment. It suffices therefore to say, that I, in all respects, agree with and adopt the reasens given in the judgment of Mr. Justice Fraser.\nFOURNIER J.\u2014I entirely agree with the views expressed by the Chief Justice. HENRY J.\u2014Perhaps, under all the circumstances of the case, this matter had better be referred back to the court below. I have prepared no written judgment. The court below did not decide upon the matter of discretion in regard to the receipt of the affidavits on the part of the appellants against the validity of the award, and I think they should have done so; and if they had done so I think this court would have no right to interfere with the exercise of that discretion. Not having done so the affidavits are not in evidence, and not being in evidence, the judgment ought, consequently, to be, on the grounds stated by my brother Strong, in favor of the respondent. I think, however, under the circumstances of the case, the ends of justice would be better served by requiring, in all these cases where discretion is to be used by the courts below, the exercise of that discretion one way or the other, before this court decides upon the merits. It is with that view I consent to have the case referred back, but I think it should be without any costs whatever as far as this court is concerned.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014The circumstances under which the appeal in this case arises are somewhat peculiar, and the point raised by the appeal appears to have originated in a question of procedure. It appears that by the practice in New Brunswick there are two papers upon which all motions are entered in order to be heard in court, without any rule nisi being required, the one called the \"special paper,\" upon which all motions for setting aside verdicts and for new trial are put, and the other simply the \"motion paper\" upon which all other motions are put. In the present case the action was referred to arbitration by a rule of reference at nisi prius, which directed that the award should be entered on the record as a verdict. An award was made in favour of the defendant, and as it was to be treated as a verdict for the defendant, the plaintiffs, in moving to set it aside, and for a new trial upon the ground that, as was alleged, the arbitrators had, after the close of the case taken further evidence behind the plaintiffs' back, must needs, according to the practice of the court, proceed by giving notice to the defendant and setting down the case for argument upon the special paper, The 184th section of ch. 37 of the Consolidated Statutes of New Brunswick, provides for staying proceedings in the case of an award ordered to be entered as a verdict, as follows:\u2014\nIn any case in which a reference to arbitration shall be made at nisi prius, and it shall be ordered that the award of the arbitrators shall be returned on the postea as a verdict of a jury, the officer returning the postea shall set down on the margin thereof the day on which the award shall be so filed with him; and judgment on the postea shall not be signed until the expiration of twenty days after the day so set down; and any judge in any such case in which justice may appear so to require, may, either upon summons or not according to the circumstances of the case, order the returning of the postea and the signing of judgment to be stayed, until the court shall make order in the matter at the next succeeding term.\nThe award was made on the 12th July, 1883; on the 4th August the defendant served the plaintiffs with notice of taxation of costs, for the purpose of entering up judgment, for the 6th of August. On that day Mr. Justice Weldon, to whom an application was made for an order to stay proceedings under the above 184th section of the act, made an ex parte order, entitled in the Supreme Court and in the cause, as follows:\u2014\nUpon reading the affidavit of J. G. Forbes, the plaintiffs attorney in this cause, I do order that all further proceedings in this cause be stayed until an opportunity be afforded the said plaintiffs of moving this honorable Court in the ensuing Michaelmas Term. And I do further order that the said cause be set down in the motion paper at said ensuing Michaelmas Term for argument without any further order of this honorable court. This order was served, and thereby the entry of judgment was stayed until term. In the meantime, however, the plaintiffs being of opinion or advised that it was necessary to the practice of the court, that the case should be set down for argument on the special paper, as a motion for a new trial, and that the last clause of Mr. Justice Weldon's order should be treated as inserted by mistake and inadvertence, or as a false designation of the paper on which the case should be entered, and might, therefore, be disregarded or abandoned, gave notice to the defendant on the 6th October, according to the requirements of the rule of practice for setting down motions for new trial on the special paper as follows, entitled in the court and cause: \"The plaintiffs will move to set aside the award and postea, and for a new trial in this cause, at the ensuing Michaelmas term of this honorable court, on the following grounds:\n\"The improper reception of evidence and explanations, by the arbitrators or some of them, in the absence of the plaintiffs and their counsel, and after the testimony for both sides had been submitted to the said arbitrators, and the case closed and given to them for their final order, determination, arbitrament and award; \"The following authorities will be relied on.\" Here follows a list of the cases relied upon by the plaintiffs.\nUpon the 8th October, the plaintiffs gave to the defendant the further notice following in like manner, entitled in the court and cause:\nTake notice that the plaintiffs on the motion to set aside the award and postea and for a new trial in this cause, will use the affidavits, copies of which were served upon you with the notice of said motion, and also the evidence taken before Amon A. Wilson, Esq., a barrister, under the order of His Honor Mr. Justice Palmer, in this cause, a copy of which was also served upon you, and that the plaintiffs will also use the order of His Honor Mr. Justice Weldon, made in this cause on the 6th August. A.D. 1883, a copy of which is herewith served upon you. And take notice that the plaintiffs abandon so much of said last mentioned order as relates to this cause being set down on the motion paper without any further order of this honorable court.\nUpon the coming on of the motion upon the special papers for argument in Michaelmas term in the latter end of the month of October, the defendant took the preliminary objection following to the motion for new trial being heard, namely:\nThat all proceedings in the cause were stayed by the order of Mr. Justice Weldon dated 6th August, 1883, and the plaintiffs could not give any notice of motion for new trial, but were bound to act upon Mr. Justice Weldon's order which had not been set aside.\nThe force of the contention involved in this objection, assuming it to prevail, would seem to be that as a motion for a new trial could not properly be entered upon the \"motion\" paper, and as Mr. Justice Weldon had ordered that the motion by his order authorised should be entered on the \"motion\" paper, the plaintiffs had no right to move for a new trial at all, and that all that could have been moved for, under Mr. Justice Weldon's order, would have been to set aside the award, and that in such case the plaintiffs would take nothing by their motion, inasmuch as the award having been entered as a verdict, could only have been set aside by setting aside the verdict, which could only have been done upon a motion entered on the special paper, thus impaling the plaintiffs inextricably upon the horns of a dilemma. The court, however, ordered the motion for setting aside the award and postea, and for a new trial, to be proceeded with, subject to the preliminary objection. In the course of the argument defendant's counsel produced and read affidavits to the effect that what had been objected to by the plaintiffs as having been done by the arbitrators after the close of the case, had been done in pursuance of leave for that purpose, given by the parties and their counsel to the arbitrators at the close of the case, if they should desire to apply to any of the witnesses already examined for any further information before making their award. Upon this affidavit being read, on behalf of the defendant, the plaintiffs applied to the court, under the provisions of section 173 of ch. 37 of the Consolidated Statutes, for leave to file affidavits in answer to these affidavits, which contained, as was contended, new matter which plaintiffs had a right to contradict. That the matter was new and of such a character, that if not true, the plaintiffs should have been given an opportunity to contradict them by affidavits in reply, cannot, I think, admit of a question; but although the court had already ordered that the motion should be heard subject to the preliminary objection, which order involved a full hearing upon the merits reserving the consideration of the preliminary objection until the close of the argument upon the merits, they disposed of the plaintiffs application for leave to file affidavits in reply, as follows:\nThe court consisted of five judges. Of these the Chief Justice and one other were of opinion that the plaintiffs should be permitted to file affidavits in reply; two others were of opinion that the preliminary objection was fatal, and that Mr. Justice Weldon's order of the 6th August could not be abandoned after service, and that therefore the plaintiffs had no right to set down the motion upon the special paper, and for this reason they refused leave to the plaintiffs to file affidavits in reply.\nThe effect of the judgment of the two learned judges was, that although the court was proceeding with the argument upon the merits, subject to the preliminary objection, there was no use in proceeding with the argument, as in their opinion the preliminary objection was fatal, and the fifth learned judge was of opinion that the court could not grant leave to file affidavits in reply upon a motion for a new trial. Why the court could not grant leave to file affidavits in reply to new matter upon motions for new trials, as well as upon other motions, no reason is suggested.\nThe result was that the leave was refused, and the case 'was reserved for the consideration of the court upon the affidavits already filed, and the court, after taking time to consider the case, pronounced judgment as follows: The two learned judges, who, upon the plaintiffs application for leave to file affidavits, in reply to the affidavits filed on the defendant's behalf, were of opinion that the preliminary objection was insurmountable, adhered to that opinion, and expressed no opinion upon the merits. The Chief Justice was of opinion that there was no force in the preliminary objection, and that the motion was properly before the court. He was of opinion however, that the application had been answered on the merits, although he was of opinion that the plaintiffs should have been given the opportunity, which was refused them, to answer the defendant's affidavits. The learned judge who, upon the application for leave to file affidavits in reply, had agreed with the Chief Justice that the leave should be granted, gave a long judgment terminating in the conclusion that the preliminary objection was well founded, and that the plaintiffs could not take any proceeding in the cause while the order of Mr. Justice Weldon, of the 6th August, remained in force, and consequently could not give the notice they had given, and which was necessary to be given to support the motion. He, however, expressed his opinion also, that the motion was sufficiently answered upon the merits; although the court, by refusing leave to the plaintiffs to file affidavits in reply, can scarcely be said to have been in a position to pronounce upon the merits of a case in which the statement of both parties as to the facts were not permitted to be brought before the court, and the other learned judge, while he thought that the case was properly before the court, expressed his opinion to be in favour of the award as valid, and that the rule to set it aside, and for a new trial, should be refused on that ground, although this was the point upon which the plaintiffs had been refused leave to file affidavits in reply.\nHe added, however, \"the majority of the court do not decide upon the merits, but that my order was not carried out.\" But from the above analysis of the judgment it appears that although three out of the five judges constituting the court did pronounce the preliminary objection to be sufficient, yet only two proceeded upon that point alone, and that the other and the remaining two (also constituting three in a court consisting of five) pronounced their judgment against the plaintiffs upon the merits, which, in point of fact, were only half heard if the plaintiffs should have been given leave to file their affidavits in reply. The arguments upon which the preliminary objection was maintained, appear to me to be altogether too technical and refined. The better course would have been to have treated Mr. Justice Weldon's order as a stay only of proceedings by the defendant within the meaning of the 184th sec. of the ch. 37, which was all the plaintiffs wanted, so as to have given them an opportunity to make the proper motion which the circumstances of the case and the practice of the court required; or, as it is admitted, that the special paper was the proper paper for a motion of the particular character of that which the plaintiffs had to make to appear upon, to have read that part of Mr. Justice Weldon's order, as to the motion being put on the \"motion paper,\" not as a vital part of the order, but as a falsa demonstratio inserted by error or inadvertence; and that, in treating it as not vital, and that in giving notice of motion as the plaintiffs did, and in setting down their motion on the special paper\u2014they being in strict accord with the practice of the court, as to a motion of this character\u2014the case was properly before the court, and should have been adjudicated on upon its merits, for which purpose, as it appears to me, the ends of justice required that the court should have received and read the affidavits offered by the plaintiffs in reply, and that in refusing to do so there has been a miscarriage; and as those affidavits have been brought before us, the motion should, I think, be disposed of by us upon its merits, instead of remitting the case to be reheard by the court below at great, and as I think, unnecessary expense.\nUpon an appeal from a rule refusing to grant a new trial, such as this appeal is, our duty under the statute, I think, is to do what the court below ought to have done, and that, in my opinion, was to receive the affidavits tendered in reply, and to adjudicate upon the merits, whether or not the verdict should be set aside and a new trial granted. As a majority of the court, however, is of a different opinion, I express no opinion upon the merits.\nAppeal allowed.\nSolicitor for appellants: J. G. Forbes.\nSolicitor for respondent: W. H.

Stats. N. B. ch. 37 sec. 83 sub-secs. 4 & 5 \u2014 Evidence of want of stamp under\u2014Special plea.\nR. remitted by mail to V. a draft on Bay of Fundy Quarrying Co., Boston Mass., in payment of an account of the Co. of which R. was Superintendent. The draft, when received by V., was unstamped, and V. affixed stamps required by the amount of the draft, and initialed them as of the date the draft was drawn, which was at least two days prior to the date on which they were actually affixed. The draft was not paid, and an action was brought against R., who pleaded, according to provisions of Cons. Stats. New Brunswick ch. 37 sec. 83 sub-sec. 4, \"that he did not make the draft.\" On the trial the draft was offered in evidence and objected to on the ground that it was not sufficiently stamped, the plaintiff having previously testified as to the manner in which the stamps were put on, and having also sworn that he knew the law relating to stamps at the time. The draft was admitted, subject to leave reserved to defendant to move for a non-suit, and at a later stage of the trial it was again offered with the double duty affixed.\nThe trial resulted in counsel agreeing that a non-suit should be entered with leave reserved to plaintiffs to move for verdict, Court to have power to draw inferences of fact.\nOn motion, pursuant to such leave reserved, the Supreme Court of New Brunswick set aside the non-suit and ordered a verdict to be entered for the plaintiffs on the ground that the defect in the draft of want of stamp should have been specially pleaded.\nOn appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada:\u2014\nHeld, Strong and Gwynne JJ. dissenting, that double duty should have been placed on the note as soon as it came into the hands of the drawee unstamped, and that it was too late at the trial to affix such double duty, the plaintiff having sworn that he knew the law relating to stamps, which precludes the possibility of holding that it was a mere error or mistake.\nHeld also, that under the plea that defendant did not make the draft, he was entitled to take advantage of the defect for want of stamps.\nPer Strong J.\u2014That the note was sufficiently stamped and plaintiffs were entitled to recover.\nPer Gwynne J.\u2014Thai if the note was not sufficiently stamped the defence should have been specially pleaded.\nAppeal from a judgment of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick making absolute a rule to set aside a non-suit and enter a verdict for the plaintiffs, according to leave reserved.\nThe facts of the case are sufficiently set out in the judgments of Ritchie C.J. and Gwynne J.\nWeldon Q.C. for the appellant.\nStraton for the respondents.\nSir W. J. RITCHIE C.J.\u2014The bill of exchange sued upon in this case is dated 25th July, 1881, and payable four months after date to L. H. Vaughan & Bros., at Pacific National Bank, Boston Mass., for $577.30. At the trial Mr. Weldon proposed to call witnesses to show that the draft was not properly stamped, and this was objected to.\nThe defendant was then called and examined, and says:\u2014\nI never put these stamps on or authorized any one to do so. I sent this paper to Mr. Vaughan to pay an account of the Bay of Fundy Quarrying Company. I was then at Mary's Point. Account was not due by myself.\nL. H. Vaughan, one of the plaintiffs, says: Received this draft in latter end of July, 1881. No stamps then on it. Stamped it myself. Cancelled them myself by figures 25-7-'81 on 25th July, 1881. Cannot give exact date of receipt; will not swear I got it on 25th July. A letter from Mary's Point ought to come in a day. Got it in a letter. Have not letter here.\nCross-examined:\u2014\nI stamped draft before using it at bank. May have stamped it at time or not before using it at bank. General course of business is to stamp note\u2014sometimes immediately on receipt\u2014other times when used. I think this was stamped on day received.\nRe-cross examined:\u2014\nCan't tell without referring to books when it was used. Will not undertake to swear when this was stamped. Mary's Point is, by one road, six miles, by another, eight or ten miles from Harvey, Don't known when mail comes down. (I admit draft subject to leave to defendant to move to enter a non-suit, Mr. Palmer to be at liberty to supply further evidence bearing on the point).\nMr. Palmer offers protest, proving presentation.\nOther witnesses are called, but no further evidence relating to the stamping was offered.\nIt is clear, from plaintiff's letters to W. J. Roberts, that draft was not received by them on the 25th July. The letter of 26th July to defendant so says,\u2014and on the next morning they wrote again\u2014\"Since writing you last evening have received a letter from A. J. Roberts (defendant), enclosing the draft;\" and L. H. Vaughan, in his evidence after close of plaintiff's case, says, \"Will swear they were put on between 27th and 29th.\"\nThe following are the sections bearing on the question: 42 Vic. ch. 17 s. 10:\u2014\nThe stamps shall be cancelled by writing thereon the signature or part of the signature or the initials of maker or drawer, or of the witness attesting signature of maker or drawer, or if drawn out of Canada, &c., &c., to identify each stamp with the instrument, to show it has not before been used, and to prevent it being again used.\nPersons or witness affixing stamp shall write or stamp thereon the date at which it was affixed, and stamp shall be held prim\u00e2 facie to have been affixed at that date.\nIf no signature or initials, nor any date stamped or written; \"or if date do not agree with that of the instrument, such stamp shall be of no avail; and any person wilfully writing a false date shall incur a penalty of $100.\"\nSection 11:\nStamp shall be affixed by maker or drawer. Such maker or drawer failing to affix stamp at the time of making, or affixing insufficient stamps, \"shall thereby incur a penalty hereinafter imposed;\" and the duty payable on such instrument, or the duty by which the stamps affixed fall short of the proper amount, shall be doubled.\nSection 12:\nPenalty for drawing bill without affixing proper stamps to be $100, and save only in the case of double duty, as in the next section provided, instrument so drawn shall be invalid and of no effect in law or equity.\nNo party shall incur any penalty, provided that at the time it came into his hands it had affixed to it stamps to the amount of the duty apparently payable upon it, that he had no knowledge that they were not affixed at the proper time and by the proper party or parties, and that he pays the double or additional duty, as in the next section provided, as soon as he acquires such knowledge.\nSection 13:\nAny holder may pay double duty by affixing stamps to amount of double the sum the stamps affixed fall short of the proper duty, and by writing his initials on such stamps, and the date on which they were affixed; and where, in any suit or proceeding in law or equity, the validity of any such instrument is questioned by reason of proper duty not having been paid at all, or not paid by proper party, or at the proper time, or any formality as to the date or erasure of the stamps affixed having been omitted, or a wrong date placed thereon, and it appears that the holder thereof, when he became such holder, had no knowledge of such defects, such instrument shall be held to be legal and valid if it appears that the holder thereof paid double duty, as in this section mentioned, so soon as he acquired such knowledge, even though such knowledge shall have been acquired only during such suit or proceeding; and if it shall appear in such suit or proceeding, to the satisfaction of the court or judge, as the case may be, that it was through mere error or mistake, and without any intention to violate the law on the part of the holder, that any such defect as aforesaid existed in relation to such instrument, then such instrument shall be held legal and valid if the holder shall pay the double duty thereon as soon as he is aware of such error or mistake, but no party who ought to have paid duty shall be released from penalty.\nThe facts in this case are undisputed. The bill was transmitted by drawer to drawees unstamped. Bill was stamped by drawees and cancelled, as of the day of the date (obviously not on day of date, but between the 27th and 29th), with full knowledge of the law relating to stamps, for L. H. Vaughan says in his evidence: \"I know the law relating to stamps.\"\nThese were not only not the proper stamps to be put on by the drawees after neglect by a drawer, and after bill came to their hands, but they should have been for double the amount, and they were not dated the day they were affixed, but on the day of the date of the bill. They were received in evidence without double stamps, and it was only after being so received, and on the day after, that the bill is produced in court, with the double stamps on, and nothing whatever to show that it was proved to the satisfaction of the judge, &c., as provided in the Act.\nThe plaintiffs statement, when re-called, that he \"believed he had authority to affix the stamps on behalf of the drawer,\" amounts to nothing whatever. In the first place, there is not the slightest evidence of any such authority, but if he had any such authority, affixing the stamps as he did, supposing he claimed to do so under such authority, would be clearly contrary to the Act. The drawer having issued the bill without stamps, he could not, on a subsequent day, affix the original amount of stamps and initial them as of the day of the date of the bill, and the day of issuing, and if he could not do so, a fortiori nobody could do it for him. The Act was clearly violated by the drawer issuing the bill to the drawees without stamps; and it was violated by the drawees, after receiving the bill, in affixing the amount of stamps which ought to have been affixed by the drawer, instead of double the amount.\nIt was likewise violated by writing a false date as to the time of affixing, viz., the date of the draft, and not the date of the actual affixing, and all this, as plaintiff proves, with a knowledge of the law relating to stamps.\nAnd yet he says, when re-called at the close of defendant's case: \"Yesterday afternoon, in court, was the first I heard that draft was insufficiently stamped.\" It may be the first he heard of it, but not the first he knew of it.\nThere was no evidence offered to show any mere error or mistake, or no intention to violate the law; and no finding of the judge, that any such fact was made to appear to his satisfaction; then as to the double stamping, it was entirely too late.\nThen as to the point not noticed in the judgments of the court below: If the address was insufficient on the notice of dishonor, who is to blame? The drawer of the bill must be taken to know that the statute permits notices to be addressed in accordance with the bill or note, unless he stipulates for a more particular address. What had the holder to do with there being or not being a post office at St. Mary's Point? The drawer chose, in fact, to say (having reference to the statute) \"put in the post office a notice addressed as I have headed this bill, and I will take the responsibility of its reaching me. \"No doubt, the drawer knew full well that if a notice was addressed to St. Mary's Point he would find the letter in the Harvey post office; but whether so or not, he named the place to which the notice was to be mailed, and cannot now, complain of this direction being followed.\nThe note not being properly stamped, the judge should not have received it in evidence, the statute declaring that this instrument, not being properly stamped, should be invalid and of no effect in law or equity. There was no necessity for a special plea.\nI think the appeal should be allowed and a nonsuit entered, agreeably to leave reserved.\nSTRONG J. was of opinion that, as a matter of fact, the note was sufficiently stamped, and agreed with the court below that the plaintiff was entitled to recover.\nFOURNIER J.\u2014The appellant disputes the validity of the draft on account of its not being stamped when it was drawn.\nL. H. Vaughan (one of the respondents and the person who received and stamped the draft) says he knew the law in regard to stamps, yet he insufficiently stamped this draft when it came into his hands, by affixing single, where he should have affixed double, duty.\nJudgment has been given against the defendant, who was only an agent for the Quarrying Company, and known to be such by the respondents. If he should have pleaded that the note was not properly stamped, and he asks to be allowed to add this to his plea, I am of opinion that such leave should be granted and the appeal allowed.\nHENRY J.\u2014This action was brought by the respondents to recover from the appellant the amount of the draft made by him in their favor, hereinafter set out.\nThe appellant pleaded that he did not make the draft.\nThe respondents were merchants dealing in iron at St. John N. B. The Bay of Fundy Quarrying Company was a company incorporated in Massachusetts, having their principal office in Boston, and operating in quarries at St. Mary's Point, Albert County, in New Brunswick. The appellant was their superintendent at St. Mary's Point, having no interest in the quarries or the company. The respondents sent up goods to the quarries for the company, charging the same to the company, and it appears that the mode of payment was by appellant giving his drafts on the company to respondents, which drafts were accepted and paid, with the exception of the one upon which this action was brought.\nTo pay for goods furnished to the company in July, 1881, the appellant drew a bill, as he had several times before done for other goods furnished to the company by the respondents on the company, as follows:\u2014\n$577.30. St. Mary's Point, July 25th, 1881.\nFour months after date, pay to order of L. H. Vaughan & Bros., five hundred and seventy-seven dollars and thirty cents, Pacific National Bank, Boston Mass., value received, and charge to account of\nAustin J. Roberts,\nSuperintendent.\nTo The Bay of Fundy Quarrying Company,\n119 Devonshire street, Boston Mass.\nOn back of note are the following Canada bill stamps, with dates and initials cancelling: 3ct., L. H. V., 19-1-'83; 7ct., L. H. V., 19-1-'83; 8ct., L. H. V., 19-1-'83; 9ct., L. H. V., 19-1-'83; 9ct., L. H. V., 19-1-'83.\nThe draft was discounted by the bank of New Brunswick on the 29th July, and L. H. Vaughan, one of the respondents, proved that when the draft was received by the respondents, it was not stamped, but that between the 27th and the day it was so discounted he stamped it and cancelled the stamps by figures 25-7-'81, i.e., the 25th July, 1881. It is shown that the stamps so affixed amounted to but a single rate. It is suggested that he had authority from the appellant so to place and obliterate such stamps, but I can find no evidence to sustain that suggestion. It is true that in the bill of goods for which the draft was given there is a charge of fifteen cents, which is explained, but it having been shown that the charge was for stamps used on a previous draft, that fact is no evidence of authority to obliterate stamps for the appellant on the draft now in question.\nThe evidence shows that, during the trial, the stamps above mentioned as appearing on the back of the draft were affixed by L. H. Vaughan, one of the respondents.\nThe questions that arise under such circumstances are\u2014\n1st. Was the appellant bound to plead specially the fact that the draft was not stamped as required by the provisions of the statutes relating thereto?\n2nd. Was the affixing of the stamps by L. H. Vaughan, before the draft was discounted, sufficient? and\n3rd. If not, was the affixing of the stamps subsequently during the trial sufficient?\nThe appellant pleaded, as before stated, that he did not make the draft declared on. If the draft, as it passed from his hands, was, in contemplation of law, a binding draft, then the decision should be against him. Sec. 12 of ch. 17 of 42 Vic. provides that\u2014\nIf any person in Canada makes, draws, accepts, indorses, signs, becomes a party to or pays any promissory note, draft or bill of exchange chargeable with duty under this Act, before the duty (or double duty, as the case may be) has been paid, by affixing thereto the proper stamp or stamps (or by making it on stamped paper, or both), such person shall thereby incur a penalty of one hundred dollars, and save only in case of the payment of double duty, as in the next section provided, such instrument shall be invalid, and of no effect in law or in equity, and the acceptance, or payment, or protest thereof, shall be of no effect.\nSection 13 provides that:\u2014\nAny holder of such instrument, including banks and brokers, may pay double duty, by affixing to such instrument a stamp or stamps to the amount thereof, or to the amount of double the sum by which the stamps affixed fall short of the proper duty, and by writing his initials on such stamp or stamps, and the date on which they were affixed; and where, in any suit or proceeding in law or equity, the validity of any such instrument is questioned by reason of the proper duty thereon not having been paid at all, or not paid by the proper party, or at the proper time, or of any formality as to the date or erasure of the stamps affixed having been omitted, or a wrong date placed thereon, and it appears that the holder thereof, when he became such holder, had no knowledge of such defects, such instrument shall be held to be legal and valid, if it shall appear that the holder thereof paid double, duty, as in this section mentioned, so soon as he acquired such knowledge, even although such knowledge shall have been acquired only during such suit or proceeding; and if it shall appear in any such suit or proceeding, to the satisfaction of the court or judge, as the case may be, that it was through mere error or mistake, and without any intention to violate the law on the part of the holder, that any such defect as aforesaid existed in relation to such instrument, then such instrument or any indorsement or transfer thereof, shall be held legal and valid, if the holder shall pay the double duty thereon as soon as he is aware of such error or mistake; but no party who ought to have paid duty thereon shall be released from the penalty by him incurred as aforesaid.\nBy sec. 12, just partly quoted, it will be seen that unless the prescribed duty be paid either by the maker or drawer, or by double duty paid by the holder, as prescribed by sec. 13, the instrument is declared to be \"invalid and of no effect in law or in equity.\" To constitute an instrument not invalid it is a necessary part of its due execution that it should be properly stamped, and the stamp or stamps obliterated as prescribed. The penalty in this case attached as soon as the bill or draft was made and sent to the payees without being stamped; and by the same section the same is declared \"invalid and of no effect in law or in equity.\" It was therefore, in law, no draft as such, and being so, the plea that the appellant did not make the draft declared on, puts in issue the making of a legally binding draft. If it never was a draft by legal intendment, the plea raises the proper issue. A valid and binding instrument is what the declaration sets out, and if, for any reason, it was ab initio void, then, under the plea in question, the alleged drawer can show the necessary facts to have it so adjudged. Delivery is necessary to the validity of an instrument in all other respects duly executed. The possession of the document by the payee, or others through him, is prim\u00e2 facie evidence of delivery, but under a plea that the defendant did not make the instrument, he could show that he never delivered it. It, in legal acceptation, was not his instrument, and was therefore void as against him. The statute makes the draft in this case void, as wanting in one of the essentials to a valid instrument. To make a valid instrument, the proper stamping of it by the maker or drawer is as necessary as the delivery of it, and when it is shown not to have been stamped it stands in the same position as if it had been shown not to have been delivered.\nWhen, then, the draft in this case came to the hands of the respondents, it was a void instrument. It remained so when negotiated with the bank, when accepted by the company, when protested for non-payment, and when notice of such protest was sent to the respondent, as I shall hereafter show. All this time the draft was void by law, and, it appears to me, not a document to be negotiated, accepted or protested.\nSec. 11 requires the stamp or stamps to be affixed by the maker or drawer of the instrument, and not by any one else, even with his authority, at a time subsequent to the delivery of the instrument out of his possession. It is said that ruling would create inconvenience, but it is not the less the plain prescription of the law, and it cannot be disregarded from any suggestion of inconvenience. Besides, provision is made to remedy the defect by the holder paying double duty. This latter mode of supplying the deficiency or defect is the only one provided by law, and unless adopted, the instrument continues to be invalid and of no effect.\nThe first stamps affixed to the draft in question were not so affixed before the 27th of July\u2014two days after it was drawn\u2014although they were marked as having been affixed on the 25th\u2014the date it was drawn. The fifth clause of sec. 10, however, requires that the person affixing the same should \"write or stamp thereon the date at which it was affixed.\" The respondents, to make the draft good, were bound, when it came to their hands, as it did, without any stamp, to have paid double duty by adhesive stamps, and to have cancelled them, by causing to be written the initials of the party affixing them, \"and the date on which they were affixed.\" The stamps affixed on the draft in July, 1881, in my judgment, were wholly useless. They were so affixed as the act of the drawer, without, as he swears, any authority from him (which is not contradicted), and two days after the draft was made\u2014when the law requires such to be done at the time.\nHaving considered two of the three questions referred to, I will deal with the third and only remaining one, which refers to the stamping during the trial. Stamping instruments at the trial is provided for on the part of holders under the circumstances referred to in the 13th section. The first provision for the double stamping, however, is based upon the want of knowledge of defects when he became the holder, but he is required to pay the double duty \"as soon as he acquired such knowledge.\" The respondents in this case acquired such knowledge as soon as the draft came into their hands. They were bound, then, immediately to have paid double duty, and to have affixed and properly marked the necessary stamps, which they did not do. Not having done so, they cannot claim the benefit of a provision they did not comply with. The concluding provision of the 13th section goes further, and it is necessary to consider its bearing upon and applicability to the circumstances of this case. It provides that:\nIf it shall appear, in any such suit or proceeding, to the satisfaction of the court or judge, as the case may be, that it was through mere error or mistake, and without any intention to violate the law on the part of the holder, that any such defect as aforesaid existed in relation to such instrument, then such instrument, or any indorsement or transfer thereof, shall be held legal and valid, if the holder shall pay the double duty thereon as soon as he is aware of such error or mistake, &c.\nThe learned judge who presided at the trial was not called upon or requested by the counsel of the respondents to, and did not, find whether there was any error or mistake on their part or on the part of any of them, in regard to the stamping of the draft. Without taking that position, it was:\nAgreed that a non-suit be entered, plaintiffs to have leave reserved to move to have a verdict entered for them by the court for any amount that court may think plaintiffs entitled to. Court to have power to draw such inferences of fact as a jury might draw, or as I might draw in reference to facts respecting the stamping.\nIn the reasons for judgment given by the learned Chief Justice, in which Weldon, Wetmore and Fraser JJ. concurred, the matter of error or mistake is not considered, and such is not found directly in the reasons given by Mr. Justice Palmer. If found at all, it must be by this court.\nI have examined carefully the evidence of the respondent who affixed both sets of stamps, and he does not particularise any error or mistake he made. He says he did not discover, before the time of the trial, the insufficiency of the stamps, but he did not explain what the mistake or error was that he made. He says he knew the law as to stamps, and so knowing he affixed only a single duty in July 1881, when the law required double the amount. To obtain the benefit of the provision in question, I think the party desiring to do so should show on the trial wherein the error or mistake consisted, and satisfy the presiding judge or court on the point; and not having done so, I think this court should not be expected to consider the matter. There is, besides, another objection to the legality of the stamping during the trial in this case. The trial took place in November 1882, and the Stamp Act then in force (the 42nd Vic.) was repealed on the 4th of the preceding month of March[1]. The repealing Act, however, contained a provision that\u2014\nAll things lawfully done, and all rights acquired under the said Act, or any Act repealed by it, shall remain valid, and all penalties incurred under them, or any of them, may be enforced and recovered; and all proceedings commenced under them, or any of them, may be continued and completed, as if this Act had not been passed.\nThe operation of the provision was to continue all rights as then existing, but not to acquire any new ones. It preserved and continued all penalties then incurred, and provided for enforcing them, but created no new ones, and for the continuance of proceedings then previously commenced. When that statute was passed the draft in question was incapable of being recovered. It was, in the words of the statute, invalid and of no effect. The statutory provisions in regard to payment of double duty by a holder were repealed, and the process of the stamping, during the trial, was without legal authority, and therefore ineffectual. I have fully considered the matter of pleading suggested by the learned judges in the court below, and the references made by them to the 4th and 5th sub-sections of sec. 83, of ch. 37, of the Consolidated Statutes of New Brunswick, but cannot reach the same conclusions as they appear to have done. The 4th, as to bills of exchange and promissory notes, abolishes the pleas of non assumpsit and never indebted, and requires a special traverse of some matters of fact, \"for example, the drawing, or making, or indorsing, or accepting, or presenting, or notice of dishonor of the bill or note.\" The plea in this case is a denial of the making of the draft, and surely is, as to that provision, a good plea.\nThe 5th is expressly confined to matters in confession and avoidance, and does not apply to cases where the party confesses nothing. Here the appellant is charged as the maker of a legal draft and one capable of enforcement. His answer is, substantially, \"I did not make such legal draft.\" The principles of pleading applicable to such a case are wholly different from those in confession and avoidance, the examples of which are given in that sub-section.\nI think, for the reasons given, the law is in favor of the appellant, and that the equities are also with him. The respondents gave the credit to the company, of which the appellant was the mere servant to the full knowledge of the respondents. He would, no doubt, have been answerable for the amount of the draft but for the imperfect stamping of it; but he evidently did not contemplate such responsibility, nor did, I assume, the respondents either when giving credit to the company.\nI think the appeal should be allowed and judgment given for the appellant with costs.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014I am of opinion that this appeal must be dismissed, and that the plaintiffs are entitled to recover. The bill upon which the action is brought against the defendant as drawer, was, to all appearances, sufficiently stamped, having affixed to it stamps to the amount required for single duty, and I know of no mode by which the defendant can call in question the sufficiency of such stamping but by plea stating the facts relied upon by him as establishing the contention, that what to all appearance is good, valid and sufficient, is, in truth, invalid and insufficient. For the reasons given by me in Chapman v. Tufts[2], I am clearly of opinion that the defendant's plea, that he did not draw the bill, does not raise any question as to the invalidity of the bill on the ground of its not being sufficiently stamped, whether the defect intended to be relied upon by him consisted in the stamps, although affixed at the proper time and by the proper person, and to the proper amount, not having been properly erased, or not having been affixed by the proper person, or at the proper time, or for the proper amount, which latter varies according to the time when, and the person by whom, and the circumstances under which, the stamps upon the bill were affixed.\nThe onus lies upon the defendant to state specifically which of the above grounds is that which he relies upon as invalidating a commercial instrument of such importance as a negotiable bill of exchange, which, to all appearances, is good and valid; and the only mode of stating these facts in an action at law, is by a special plea, averring the particular fact intended to be relied upon. But upon the other point also, assuming that the question had been sufficiently raised upon the record by a special plea, I am of opinion that the plaintiffs are entitled to recover, for, by the agreement entered into at the trial, the whole case, both upon the facts and the law, was submitted to the judgment of the court, with power to draw inferences of fact as a jury, and the court to which the case was so submitted has unanimously found, as matter of fact, that the plaintiffs affixed stamps to the amount of double duty as soon as they became aware of the previous defect in the stamping. As a court of appeal we cannot interfere with such a finding on pure matter of fact, consistently with the principle upon which this court has, upon different occasions, announced that it proceeds in such a case.\nI confess I am unable to preceive any distinction in principle between this case and that of Chapman v. Tufts, or anything which justifies a different judgment in this case from the judgment which was rendered in that case in favor of the plaintiff. There, the learned judge who tried the case being of opinion that double stamps were affixed by the party whose duty it was to affix them as soon as he became aware that double stamps were necessary, this court held that the plaintiff was entitled to recover. Upon the same principle the plaintiffs here are entitled to recover, as the whole of the members of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick, which court was, by agreement at the trial, substituted for court and jury, have unanimously found a like fact in favor of the plaintiffs here. The distinction appears to me to be one without a difference. I am of opinion also, that by reason of the provisions of the Dominion Statute, 45 Vic., ch. 1, the validity of the bill of exchange sued upon is not, in this action, open to any such objection as that suggested, this action having been commenced after that Act came into operation. The Act enacts that\u2014\nThe 42nd Vic. ch. 17, intituled \"An Act to amend and consolidate the laws respecting duties imposed on Promissory Notes and Bills of Exchange,\" shall be repealed from and after the 4th day of March 1882, the day after the passing of the Act: Provided always, that all Acts repealed by the said Act, shall remain repealed, and that all things lawfully done and all rights acquired under the said Act, or any Act repealed by it, shall remain valid, and all penalties incurred under them or any of them, may be enforced and recovered, and all proceedings commenced under them, or any of them, may be continued and completed as if this Act had not been passed.\nIt is not, in my opinion, necessary for the determination of this case, but if it be, I am prepared to hold that the privilege of a defendant in any action to be commenced after the time fixed for the Act to come into operation, to dispute the validity of his own note, draft or acceptance, by reason of his own default in not having stamped the note, draft or acceptance at the proper time or in the proper manner, or with the proper amount, as directed by 42 Vic. ch. 17, was not, at the time of the passing of 45 Vic. ch 1, a right acquired under 42 Vic. ch. 17, within the meaning of the proviso contained in 45 Vic. ch. 1.\nThe defendant's liability to pay the penalties imposed by 42 Vic. may be, and perhaps is, preserved in force by the express words of the proviso, but there is nothing in the Act which, in my opinion, is sufficient to maintain in force, or indicates the intention of the legislature to maintain in force, the provisions of 42 Vic. ch. 17 for calling in question the validity of any promissory note, draft or acceptance in any action which should be commenced after the coming into operation of 45 Vic. ch. 1, whatever may be the date of the draft, note or acceptance. For all of the above reasons, I am of opinion that the unanimous judgment of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick should be sustained, and that this appeal therefrom should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellant: Weldon, McLean & Devlin.\nSolicitor for respondent: C.

Ritchie C.J. and Strong, Fournier, Henry and Gwynne JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.\nVendor and purchaser\u2014Specific performance\u2014Contract not signed by vendor, but subsequently admitted by his letters\u2014Statute of frauds.\nWhere property was sold by auction, the particulars and conditions of sale not disclosing the vendor\u2019s name, and the contract was duly signed by the purchaser, but was not by the vendor or the auctioneer acting in the matter of sale, and subsequently, in consequence of delays on the part of the purchaser, the attorneys for the vendor (one of whom was the vendor himself) wrote in the course of a correspondence which ensued: \u201cRe S.\u2019s purchase, we would like to close this:\u201d And referring to certain representations made in the advertisements of the sale: \u201cThey were not made part of the contract of sale. * * Have the goodness to let us know whether the vendee will pay cash or give mortgage. If the latter, we will prepare it at once and send you draft for approval; and on a subsequent occasion: \u201cRe S.\u2019s purchase. Herewith please receive deed for approval,\u201d and on another occasion the vendor himself wrote \u201cI shall take immediate steps to enforce the contract.\u201d\nHeld, affirming the judgment of the courts below, that the conditions of sale together with the correspondence were sufficient to constitute a complete and perfect contract between the vendor and purchaser within the Statute of Frauds.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] affirming the decree of Blake, V.C., in favor of the respondent. The respondent, on the 28th day of August, 1880, filed a bill of complaint, in the late Court of Chancery for (Ontario, alleging that he was the purchaser at a sale by auction on the 15th day of May, 1830, of a parcel of land in the township of East Gwillimbury, containing 81\u00bc acres, and that the appellant was the owner and vendor, and prayed inter alia for the specific performance of the contract of sale.\nThe defence was that neither the agreement alleged in the bill for the purchase and sale of the lands and premises in said bill mentioned, and of which the respondent sought to have the benefit, nor any memorandum or note thereof was ever reduced into writing and signed by the appellant or any person lawfully authorized thereunto within the meaning of the Statute of Frauds, and the appellant claimed the benefit of the statute and pleaded the same as a defence to the action.\nThe circumstances under which the sale of the lot in question was made, and the subsequent correspondence which took place between the parties in reference thereto, are fully sot out in the judgment of Ritchie C.J., hereinafter given.\nO\u2019Donohoe Q.C. for appellant.\nThe following authorities were referred to:\nPotter v. Duffield[2]; Dobell v. Hutchison[3]; Munday v. Asprey[4]; Vandenberg v. Spooner[5]; Wilmot v. Stalker[6]; Fry on Specific Performance[7]; McClung. v. McCracken[8]; Smith v. Surman[9]; Archer v.

Scho\u00dfeid[17]; Peirce v. Corf[18]; Peek v. North Staffordshire Railway Co.[19]\nBain Q.C. for respondent.\nIn addition to the cases referred to in the judgments, the learned counsel relied on:\nEmmerson v. Hellis[20]; Glengall v. Barnard[21]; Bland v. Eaton[22]; Ogilvie v. Foljambe[23]; Owen v. Thomas[24]; Catling v. King[25]; Jones v. Victoria Graving Dock Co.[26]; Long v. Millar[27]; Gillattley v. White[28].\nSir W.J. RITCHIE C.J.\u2014The bill sets out that defendant, being the owner of a lot of land as therein described, offered the same by public auction, when plaintiff became the purchaser, and an agreement for such purchase was signed by defendant and plaintiff, and plaintiff, thereupon, paid defendant $50, as the first payment, in accordance with the conditions of sale, under which the said property was sold, the balance of the said purchase money being payable as follows, namely: such other sum as with the said first payment will make one-third of the purchase money within fifteen days after the day of sale, and the remaining two-thirds in three years, secured by mortgage, bearing interest at the rate of seven per cent. per annum, payable half-yearly.\nThat at the time of the plaintiff\u2019s said purchase the said lands and premises were covered by a mortgage to one A.J. Broughall, on which about two hundred and seventy-five dollars was due and payable, and it was subsequently agreed by and between the plaintiff and defendant that the said defendant should procure a discharge and release of the said mortgage, and that the plaintiff should thereupon pay to the defendant the whole balance of the purchase money without giving a mortgage.\nThat the plaintiff has accepted the title to the said lands and premises subject to the discharge of the said mortgage being procured as agreed, and has otherwise been ready and willing to carry out his said purchase.\nThat in the advertisement of the sale of the said property the said lands and premises were described as a farm of eighty-one and one-quarter acres, having twenty acres cleared and fenced. The said advertisement was read to the plaintiff and others who were present at the said auction at the time and in the course of said sale, and it was on the faith of the correctness of the said description that the plaintiff bid for and became the purchaser of such property; the plaintiff having no previous knowledge of the state or condition of the said lands.\nThat the plaintiff, shortly after the said sale, discovered that a small part of the said lands had been cleared, but the greater portion having been cut over and the best of the trees removed, but leaving brush-wood and logs lying thereon, and that no portion of the said lands were fenced, nor was there any trees or lumber on the place to make the fence.\nThat the defendant has threatened, and still threatens, to re-sell the said lands and premises and thereby deprive the plaintiff of the amount he has paid as aforesaid, and also of any profit or advantage he may be able to make out of the said purchase, The plaintiff therefore prays:\u2014\n1. That the defendant may be ordered specifically to perform his said contract, the plaintiff hereby offering to perform the same on his part.\n2. That an allowance by way of compensation for the said fencing may be made to the plaintiff and the said purchase money applied towards payment thereof, and the defendant ordered to pay and make good any additional sum that may be required.\n3. That the defendant may be ordered to pay and procure a discharge of the said mortgage now existing on the said lands and premises.\n4. That the defendant may be ordered to pay the cost of this suit.\n5. That for the purposes aforesaid all necessary accounts may be taken and directions given, and that the plaintiff may have such further and other relief as the nature and circumstances of the case requires, and to your Lordships may seem just.\nThe defendant\u2019s only answer is as follows:\u2014\n\u201cThat neither the agreement, which is alleged by the said bill, for the purchase and sale of the lands and premises in the said bill mentioned, and of which the plaintiff, by the said bill, seeks to have the benefit, nor any memorandum or note thereof, was ever reduced into writing or signed by me, or any person lawfully authorized thereunto, within the meaning of the statute passed in the twenty-ninth year of King Charles the second, for the prevention of frauds and perjuries, and I claim the benefit of the said statute, and I plead the same as a defence to this suit.\u201d\nTwo questions were raised by the defendant on the argument, viz.:\u2014\n1st. That the agreement to purchase was signed by Oliver, the auctioneer, not as auctioneer, but as a witness to the signature of the plaintiff, Stammers. I think there is nothing whatever in this point; the signature of Oliver was, in my opinion, unquestionably as auctioneer under the fifth condition of sale, viz.: \u201cThe auctioneer signing these sale deeds shall bind both vendor and purchaser to these conditions and terms,\u201d and in my opinion there is nothing on the face of the paper to indicate that he signed as a witness, but rather that in witness of his signing as a party, he placed his name to the document. The second point is that there was no binding contract in writing under the Statute of Frauds, the vendor\u2019s name not being mentioned in the agreement so signed by the auctioneer. It was conceded on the argument that the title to the property was in the defendant, a member of the firm of O\u2019Donohoe & Haverson, which gave the instructions to the auctioneer to sell this property. The defendant attended the sale. Defendant paid the deposit.\nAfter the sale a correspondence took place between Messrs. O\u2019Donohoe & Haverson and A.H. Meyers, who was acting on behalf of the plaintiff. The first letter appears to have been written on the 7th June, 1880, by O\u2019Donohoe & Haverson to A.H. Meyers, as follows:\n7th June, 1880.\nRe Stammers\u2019s Purchase,\nA.H. Meyers, Esq.\nDear Sir,\u2014We would like to close this. Please state a time that you will be here, and oblige, yours truly,\nO\u2019DONOHOE &. HAVERSON.\nOn the same day A.H. Meyers writes to O\u2019Donohoe & Haverson enquiring if O\u2019Donohoe & Haverson have the probate of will of the late William Hawkins, and on the same day O\u2019Donohoe & Haverson reply in the negative. On the next day O\u2019Donohoe & Haverson write A.H. Meyers, heading the letter:\nYou require\n$ 366.25\nDeposit paid,\n40.00\n$ 406.25 enclosing an estimate and stating that it occurred to them that the probate might be found in papers of court to which extract refers. There is then a letter from A.H. Meyers to O\u2019Donohoe & Haverson, which appears to have created the difficulty which resulted in this suit; it is as follows:\nJune 14th, 1880.\nRe Stammers.\nMessrs. O\u2019Donohoe & Haverson,\nBarristers, Toronto.\nSirs,\u2014Now I am prepared to complete this transaction. Mr. Stammers has apparently three years to pay the balance, and I think for cash he should be allowed a deduction, as the mortgage at three years would not sell at all, etc.\nThe adv. says that there are twenty acres cleared and fenced, and that it was a material part of the contract that it should be so, but when Mr. Stammers goes out to see it, there is not a fence or rail on it. Of course you will make some compensation for that. I hav\u2019nt any idea of what the fencing would be worth, but it must be considerable. Please let me hear from you on the different subjects.\nYours, &c.,ADAM H. MEYERS.\nNo notice appears to have been taken of this letter, and, on the 18th June, A.H. Meyers again writes:\nJune 18th, 1880.\nRe Sale, O\u2019Donohoe and Stammers.\nMessrs. O\u2019Donohoe & Haverson.\nPlease let me hear from you in reply to my letter in this matter. Mr. Stammers is now and has for some time been prepared to close the matter up. I am ready at any time.\nYours, &c.,ADAM H. MEYERS.\nOn the 18th June, O\u2019Donohoe & Haverson replying to both letters thus:\u2014\n18th June, 1880.\nStammers\u2019s Purchase.\nAdam H. Meyers, Esq.\nDear Sir,\u2014We beg to acknowledge your letters of the 14th and 18th inst. We have no authority to make any allowance for the money. The mortgage is as good as money at the stipulated rate of interest. As to what you say of fencing and clearing, they were not made any part of the contract of sale, and cannot be allowed for.\nHave the goodness to let us know whether the vendee will pay cash or give the mortgage. If the latter, we will prepare it at once and send you draft for approval.\nHoping to hear from you soon, we are, dear sir, yours,\nO\u2019DONOHOE & HAVERSON.\nOn the 21st June, 1880, Adam H. Meyers writes O\u2019Donohoe & Haverson thus:\u2014\n21st June, 1880.\nRe Stammers.\nMessrs. O\u2019Donohoe & Haverson.\nSirs,\u2014In reply to yours of 18th, received by me on Saturday, I have to say that I am prepared to close the purchase by Mr. Stammers from Mr. O\u2019Donohoe at once, and pay the balance of the purchase money in cash. At the sale it was represented that twenty acres of the land were cleared arid fenced, as set out in the advertisement. As this was an inducement to buy, in fact Mr. Stammers would not have bought if he had not expected it to be as advertised and represented, this not being correct he is entitled to compensation, and I would suggest that the amount of it be settled out of court. Please prepare the deed and let me see it before execution. The money is ready now, but the purchaser must have compensation, even if he files a bill to get it, although I would rather not do so if possible.\nYours truly,\nADAM H. MEYERS.\nIn reply to this on the same day O\u2019Donohoe & Haverson send Adam H. Meyers a deed for approval:\u2014\n21st June, 1880.\nRe Stammers\u2019 Purchase.\nA.H. Meyers, Barrister, Toronto.\nDear Sir,\u2014Herewith please receive deed for approval.\nYours, &c.,\nO\u2019DONOHOE & HAVERSON.\nThis Indenture, made in duplicate the day of the year of Our Lord one thousand eight hundred and eighty- In pursuance of the Act respecting short forms of conveyances:\u2014Between John O\u2019Donohoe, of the city of Toronto, in the county of York, Esquire, of the first part, and Samuel James Stammers, of the said city of Toronto, in the said county of York, accountant, of the second part.\nWitnesseth, that in consideration of four hundred and six dollars and twenty-five cents of lawful money of Canada, now paid by the said party of the second part, to the said party of the first part, (the receipt whereof is hereby by him acknowledged), he the said party of the first part doth grant unto the said party of the second part, his heirs and assigns, for ever:\nAll and singular that certain parcel or tract of land and premises, situate, lying and being in the township of East Gwillimbury, in the county of York, being parts of a block of land consisting of broken lots numbers one hundred and eleven, one hundred and twelve, one hundred and thirteen, and one hundred and fourteen, formerly on the first concession west of Yonge street, of the township of West Gwillimbury, in the county of Simcoe, afterwards annexed to the county of York, laid out and subdivided into lots according to a plan of survey of said block by F.F.

Meyers writes O\u2019Donohoe & Haverson acknowledging receipt of draft deed and saying he would do his utmost to close the matter tomorrow, and asking what about the compensation for non-clearing and fencing. Not having received any reply, on the 28th June, 1880, A.H. Meyers addresses the defendant as follows:\u2014\nToronto, 28th June, 1880.\n(Without prejudice.)\nJohn O\u2019Donohoe, Esq., Barrister, City.\nDear Sir,\u2014You have not replied as to the question of compensation to the purchaser. I must have a reply in this positively before I pay any money at all. If you don\u2019t want to compensate the purchaser he will give up the bargain on payment of what he is out of pocket and my charges. One thing or the other must be settled before any money is paid, so we may as well agree now as any time If litigation must be let me know; I don\u2019t want it put to compensation.\nYours,ADAM H. MEYERS. On the same day, evidently before receiving this, O\u2019Donohoe & Haverson write A.H. Meyers thus:\nJune 28th, 1880.\nDear Mr. Meyers,\u2014If the deeds have not turned up, give the correct name, etc., of Mr. S. and we will at once fill up a new deed and send it to you for approval. Meantime let me have $225 to send for discharge of the mortgage, and oblige.\nYours,O\u2019DONOHOE & HAVERSON.\nA.H. Meyers, Esq.\nOn the 29th June, 1880, defendant writes A.H. Meyers thus:\nJune 29th, 1880.\nRe Stammers,\nA.H. Meyers, Esq.\nDear Sir,\u2014I am unable to find any authority for such compensation as you speak of. I think if you look at the subject in Sugden\u2019s V. & P., you will abandon any claim of the kind.\nI have to state explicitly that no such claim will be entertained, and that on your refusal any longer to complete the purchase, I shall take immediate steps to enforce the contract. Hoping to have a definite reply to this at once,\nI am, dear sir, your obedient servant, J. O\u2019DONOHOE. (written across) without prejudice.\nOn July 3rd, 1880, A.H. Meyers writes:\n3rd July, 1880.\nRe Stammers\u2019 Purchase.\nMessrs. O\u2019Donohoe & Haverson, Barristers, Toronto.\nGents,\u2014I am quite at a loss to know why Mr. Stammers should not get all he bargained for when he agreed to purchase the land as advertised and represented. I have no doubt but what he is entitled o compensation which he must have. I will file a bill if necessary to convince you of it, but would much prefer not doing so. I think if you consider the matter you will agree with me. Please let me hear from you as Mr. Stammers is ready with the cash to pay you when he gets what he is entitled to.\nYours, &c.,ADAM H. MEYERS.\nAnd again on the 9th July, 1880:\n9th July, 1880.\nRe Stammers.\nMessrs. O\u2019Donohoe & Haverson:\nI sent your last letter to Mr. Stammers and only received a reply this morning. He says that \u201cas regards the statement of forty acres of land cleared, I have written to the owner of the adjoining land, who is an old resident, for a corroboration of the fact. My own impression derived from actual inspection is, it is true, only in the sense of all wood having been stripped from the property, leaving the stumps fallen making rotten logs on the ground, and that it has never been brushed or logged; so far from this being an advantage it detracts from the value, as were there any timber it would be utilized for fencing in the process of clearing.\u201d Mr. Stammers also says he thinks you never could have seen the land and he has. You will notice how widely different your respective views are, but they must be reconciled in some way. Mr. Stammers is willing to give up the sale, you paying my charges and what he has paid to visit the land, and return the deposit, or he will go to the land with any competent person to view it, and see if a solution of the difficulty can\u2019t be made on the premises; or he will early in the week make you a counter proposition.\nYours, &c.,ADAM H. MEYERS.\nto which O\u2019Donohoe & Haverson reply:\nJuly 22nd, 1880.\nRe Stammers\u2019 Purchase.\nA.H. Meyers, Esq.\nDear Sir,\u2014In your last letter you said that in about a week you would let us know your ultimatum in this matter. We have now to request you will do so, as we must get the sale closed without further delay. Hoping you will favor us with a prompt reply,\nWe are, dear sir, yours truly,\nO\u2019DONOHOE & HAVERSON.\nto which A.H. Meyers replies:\n5th August, 1880,\nMessrs. O\u2019Donohoe & Haverson.\nI have had an interview with Mr. Stammers: he says to fence the land will cost nearly if not quite $200. But to settle it he is willing to be allowed one hundred dollars for the fencing. This offer is without prejudice; he says he will go with either of you on the 16th and see the land, and try if an arrangement can be come to; he is prepared to pay cash when he can get what he purchased.\nYours truly,ADAM H. MEYERS.\nOn the 10th August, 1880, O\u2019Donohoe & Haverson write A.H. Meyers.\nAugust 10th, 1880.\nRe Stammers.\nAnswer at once and oblige. Without prejudice.\nA.H. Meyers, Esq.,\nDear Sir,\u2014Your letters indicate that your client Mr. Stammers, would rather not carry out his contract. We will take $150 damages and rescind the contract. We must now close the matter, and unless you accede to this we shall at once issue a writ.\nYours, &c., O\u2019DONOHOE & HAVERSON.\nOn the same day A.H. Meyers replies:\nRe Stammers.\n10 August, 1880.\nMessrs. O\u2019Donohoe & Haverson,\nBarristers, Toronto.\nI am at a loss to know in what respect my letter indicated that Mr. Stammers would either not carry out his contract; I never intended it so, nor do I think you can read it so. I have always asked to carry it out, and he is ready and willing now to do so. I am instructed to file a bill for specific performance, which I will do tomorrow, and ask the court for compensation. It is childish to ask him to pay you $150 damages because you cannot complete your contract. Mr. Stammers has had no desire for law, and has not now; but he had no intention of being imposed upon. I reserve to myself the right to read all the letters to the court to show our anxiety to settle the matter out of court.\nYours,ADAM H. MEYERS.\nAugust 11th, 1880.\nA.H. Meyers, Esq., (Without prejudice.)\nDear Sir\u2014We think that any attempt at agreeing upon facts would be futile. Therefore let the conversation of this a.m. stand cancelled. We would sooner than have any more trouble, make an abatement of say $25 in the price; this of course without prejudice. Hoping this may be acceptable, we are, dear sir, yours, &c.,\nO\u2019DONOHOE & HAVERSON,\nOn the 12th August, A.H. Meyers writes:\nToronto, 12 August, 1880.\nRe Stammers.\nO\u2019Donohoe & Haverson, (Without prejudice.)\nBarristers, Toronto.\nGents\u2014Mr. Stammers claims he should have $200 (two hundred dollars) for the fencing; but as I wrote before he will close the matter up by your reducing the price one hundred dollars. Now, this is quite reasonable; or, if you like to pay him back the deposit and say $25 for disbursements; which will you do? Let me know and oblige.\nADAM H. MEYERS. And O\u2019Donohoe & Haverson close the correspondence as follows:\nAugust 21, 1880.\nStammers v. Corbett.\nA.H. Meyers, Esq.,\nDear Sir\u2014We must decline acceding to the proposal of your last letter in this matter. We wrote you, not having before us the conditions of sale, that we would issue a writ; but now having these before us we have to intimate that unless the purchase-money is paid without any reduction on or before the 25th inst., we shall pursuant to said conditions proceed to re-sell and look to your client, the purchaser, for all damages, &c., &c., occasioned by his default.\nYour obed\u2019t servt,\nO\u2019DONOHOE & HAVERSON.\nThe signatures of O\u2019Donohoe and Haverson throughout this correspondence are in the handwriting of O\u2019Donohoe. The head of this letter, Stammers v. Corbett, is explained by what Mr. O\u2019Donohoe asserts in his evidence, that though the legal estate in the land in question was conveyed to him by Corbett, he held it only for Corbett\u2019s benefit and for convenience of sale and transfer.\nThe contract signed by the auctioneer and vendee was full and explicit, wanting only the vendor\u2019s name, the vendor subsequently recognizes this contract and admits receiving the deposit money, and in a correspondence which ensues, growing out of a claim by the purchaser for compensation, by reason of there not being on the premises the clearing and fencing represented, the vendor, while denying his liability to make such compensation, so far from repudiating the character of vendor, or in any way impugning the contract or sale as made by him, insists on its fulfilment, and, with a view to its being carried out, transmits to plaintiff\u2019s solicitor a deed purporting to be made in pursuance of the act respecting short forms of conveyances, between John O\u2019Donohoe, of the city of Toronto, in the county of York, Esquire, of the first part, and Samuel James Stammers, of the said city of Toronto, in the said county of York, accountant, of the second part, whereby O\u2019Donohoe, &c., &c., grants to the plaintiff and his heirs, the land in question, and, on compensation being still insisted on, threatens proceedings at law for the enforcement of the contract. This correspondence supplies, in my opinion, any deficiency in the original agreement read in connection with the advertisement, conditions of sale and contract signed by the auctioneer and deed transmitted by the defendant, to all which the letters clearly refer. The subject of sale, the price and conditions of sale, and identification of vendor and purchaser, and all particulars connected with the sale are clearly set forth and thereby establish a complete and perfect contract between the defendant as vendor and plaintiff as purchaser, within the statute of frauds. I cannot understand how the vendor can claim that his name is wanting on this contract, when in writing as vendor he insists on the validity of the contract, and claims its performance. Dobell v. Hutchison[29] seems very analogous to this case, Denman C.J. thus states the facts of that case and the law governing it.\nThree questions arose: 1st. Whether there was a contract binding upon the defendants within the statute of frauds; 2nd. Whether the defect of title was the subject of compensation within the terms of the ninth condition of sale; 3rd. Whether, in case the special contract was not proved, an action for money had and received would lie against these defendants.\nAs to the first question the facts were, that the plaintiff had signed a written contract on the back of written conditions of sale, in which conditions the names of the vendors appeared as solicitors only, and not as vendors. Nothing was signed by the vendors or by the auctioneer. An abstract of title was sent, on the face of which it appeared that a yard, which was proved to be an essential part of the premises, was held from year to year at a separate rent of $81, in addition to a rent of $551, at which the conditions described the whole premises to be held for a term of twenty-three years. The plaintiff\u2019s attorney wrote and rejected the title, demanding a return of the deposit. The defendants wrote in answer, and several letters passed between the parties, the letters of the defendants insisting that the defect was matter of compensation within the condition of sale, calling on the plaintiff to perform the contract, speaking of our sale to Mr. Dobell, and mentioning the premises by name and the price contracted for, and threatening to file a bill for a specific performance; they were signed by one of the defendants (they being attorneys) for both. They now contend that there is no contract binding them with the Statute of Frauds\nThe cases on this subject are not at first sight uniform; but, on examination, it will be found that they establish this principle, that, where a contract in writing or note exists which binds one party, any subsequent note in writing, signed by the other, is sufficient to bind him, provided it either contains in itself the terms of the contract or refers to any writing which contains them. Here the letters of the defendants refer expressly and distinctly to the conditions of sale, and they had in their hands, or the hands of the auctioneer, at that very time, the conditions of sale signed by the plaintiff, to which reference is made, so that no parol evidence of any kind was requisite to show a contract binding both parties, except of the handwriting of each, which must be adduced in all cases. In the case of Boydell v. Drummond[30], the book signed by the defendant did not refer to any prospectus or contract. In Richards v. Porter[31] the letter of the buyer referring to the invoice sent by the seller expressly repudiated the contract.\nIf it could for a moment be doubted that the contract was not sufficiently made out without the introduction of parol evidence to identify the documents referred to in the correspondence, the evidence of the defendant himself places beyond all doubt the identity of the documents which he referred to in his letters as being the terms of the contract, and himself the vendor referred to, he says:\nJohn O\u2019Donohoe, of the City of Toronto, sworn:\u2014\nBy Mr. Meyers\u2014I am the defendant; I have no copy or draft of the advertisement of the sale of the lands in the pleadings mentioned; I believe I drafted the advertisement; I don\u2019t remember whether it was published in more papers than one; I believe Exhibit A is a copy of it; I believe the land was sold on the day mentioned in the advertisement; it was purchased by the plaintiff Stammers; I don\u2019t remember whether that or any advertisement was read out at the sale; I don\u2019t remember any one then asking me if the land or any part of it was fenced; it was offered just as the advertisement stated. At the time of the sale I believed that it was fenced, but when I went to see it a month or six weeks after the sale, there was no fence on it, and I was then informed that there had been a fence upon it, but that it had been stolen and carried away. I won\u2019t swear that Exhibit A was not read over at the sale; I don\u2019t remember either Mr. Stammers or one of the Mr. McLeans asking if twenty acres were cleared and fenced; I am quite sure that if I had been asked I would have said that I believed it was. I think I intended to sell the property according to the advertisement, It was not given out by me, or by any one on my behalf, that the sale would be different from what it was advertised; I don\u2019t remember the terms of the sale. There was a mortgage to a man named Broughall, which afterwards became the property of Mrs. Whitty; I employed the auctioneer to sell the lands in the bill mentioned; there was a conveyance made of the lands by the owner to me to enable me to sell them and convey them when sold, in his name; I was intended to be the conduit of conveyance; it was after the conveyance to me that I employed the auctioneer; I did not tell the auctioneer that the lands were not mine, and I don\u2019t know what he knew about it. The land was to be sold free from the mortgage; it was sold at $5 an acre; there were 81\u00bc acres; I never sold any other land to Mr. Stammers; I had no transaction between Stammers and Corbett during this year, 1880. The auctioneers employed to sell this land were Coate & Co., the firm was composed of Coate & Oliver, as I believe; I gave them no authority to sign any contract for me; I did not reserve to myself the right to sign the contract myself, and never at any time informed them that I had done so. I authorized them to sell the land; I don\u2019t remember giving them instructions as to the terms; I suppose I did; I don\u2019t remember hearing the terms read out at the time of the sale. There was no other transaction with Stammers that I had anything to do with except the Stammers purchase. When I refer to the matter of \u201cStammers\u2019 purchase\u201d or \u201cStammers and Corbett transaction\u201d I refer to this land. I don\u2019t know that Mr. Stammers paid any deposit, but I believe he did; if I didn\u2019t get it, I got credit for it, which is the same as if it was paid to me. Exhibit B is written by me; the figures at the top refer to the purchase of this land, and so does the letter; $406.25 is the amount of the purchase money, the $40 is the deposit paid, and the $366.25 is the balance still unpaid. Exhibit C is a letter written by me and relates to this transaction, the $225 asked for there is a part of the purchase money to discharge the Whitty mortgage. Mr, S. refers to Mr. Stammers, and I wrote to you (Mr. Meyers) as you were acting for him. Exhibit D is written by me and relates to this matter; Exhibit E is written by me and refers to this matter. When I employed the auctioneers I took no authority away from them that they had to sign a contract for me and the purchaser. I don\u2019t remember whether the conditions were read at the sale; I was present at the sale and so was Mr. Archibald McLean; there were a large number of others, but I don\u2019t remember any names. I don\u2019t remember signing the contract of sale myself; I don\u2019t remember seeing it since the sale; I won\u2019t swear I didn\u2019t sign it.\nBy Mr. Haverson\u2014All the Exhibits, B, C, D and E, were written by me, but for the firm.\nJ. O\u2019DONOHOE.\nCertified a true copy.\nGEO. M. EVANS,\nSpecial Examiner.\nNumerous authorities might be referred to, I think it only necessary to cite one. Ridgway v. Wharton[32] The Lord Chancellor says:\nThe authorities lead to this conclusion, that if there is an agreement to do something, not expressed on the face of the agreement signed, that something which is to be done being included in some other writing, parol evidence may be admitted to show what that writing is, so that the two taken together may constitute a binding agreement within the statute of Frauds.\n* * *\nThen, my Lords, there was a case of Dobell v. Hutchison,[33] which went exactly upon the same principle. There, the defendant having put up a thing for sale by auction, the plaintiff entered into a written agreement, signed by himself, to purchase it upon certain specified terms. It turned out that Hutchison, the defendant, had not a title which authorized him to sell, and consequently, that he could not complete the sale; but, in the correspondence which took place afterwards, several letters referred to the terms which had been signed by Dobell, the plaintiff, as being the terms which were then subsisting between them, and the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench held that, parol evidence being given to show what the terms were to which Hutchison referred in his letters, the two might be taken together, so as to bind Hutchison, and to show that that was the written paper, signed by the plaintiff, to which he referred as being the terms of the contract.\nI am clearly of opinion that this appeal should be dismissed.\nSTRONG J.\u2014I am of opinion that a contract in writing sufficient to satisfy all the requirements of the statute of Frauds is made out by the correspondence taken in conjunction with the conditions of sale. In Ridgway v. Wharton[34] when that case was before the Court of Chancery, Lord Cranworth said:\nThe statute is not complied with unless the whole contract is either embodied in some writing signed by the party, or in some paper referred to in a signed document, and capable of being identified by means of the description of it contained in the signed paper. Thus a contract to grant a lease in certain specified terms is of course good. So, too, even if the terms are not specified in the written contract, yet if the written contract is to grant a lease on the terms of the lease or written agreement under which the tenant now holds the same, or on the same terms as are contained in some other designated paper, then the terms of the statute are complied with. The two writings in the cases I have put become one writing. Parol evidence is, in such a case, not resorted to for the purpose of showing what the terms of the contract are, but only in order to show what the writing is which is referred to. When that fact,\u2014which is to be observed\u2014is a fact collateral to the contract, is established by parol evidence, the contract itself is wholly in writing signed by the party.\nSubsequent cases so far from having shown this statement of the law by Lord Cranworth to be too loose have, on the contrary, much relaxed the principle as to the admissibility of parol evidence for the purpose of identification[35]. Then proceeding to apply this rule to the correspondence in evidence in the present case, we find, in my opinion, some of the letters written by the appellant or by the firm in which he was a partner, and which, for this purpose, is to be considered his agent, so referring to the conditions of sale as to make out a sufficient contract in writing, signed by the appellant within the provisions of the statute. The conditions of sale are insufficient by themselves to constitute a contract, because they fail to show who the vendor was. This defect is, however, fully supplied by the letters. In a letter of the 21st June, 1880, Mr. Meyers, the solicitor of the respondent, writes to Messrs. O\u2019Donohoe & Haverson, the firm of solicitors in which the respondent is a partner, a letter which is headed Re \u201cStammers,\u201d in which he says: \u201cIn reply to yours of the 18th received by me on Saturday, I have to say that I am prepared to close the purchase by Mr. Stammers from Mr. O\u2019Donohoe at once, and pay the balance of the purchase-money in cash.\u201d The same letter concludes with this request: \u201cPlease prepare the deed, and let me see it before execution.\u201d The same day, the 21st June, 1880, Messrs. O\u2019Donohoe & Haverson wrote to Mr. Meyers a letter entitled \u201cRe Stammers purchase,\u201d saying \u201cherewith please receive deed for approval,\u201d thus recognizing the matter in negotiation, designated as Re Stammers, to have reference to a purchase of land by Mr. Stammers from Mr. O\u2019Donohoe, and what the land so sold consisted of, was also made to appear in writing from the deed enclosed in the letter of Messrs. O\u2019Donohoe & Haverson and showed this as well as the price to be paid for the land, which must be presumed to be that mentioned as the consideration in the purchase deed. The heading already referred to is sufficient to identify the letters as referring to the same matter of a contract for the sale of a particular piece of land by Mr. O\u2019Donohoe to Stammers, but even without this heading, I should have been of opinion that this sufficiently ap- peared, for where a contract is to be made out from letters, the reference to previous letters in the line of correspondence need not be express but may be shown by inference arising from the contents and terms of the letters.\nLord Justice Fry, in the last edition of his learned treatise on Specific Performance[36], says on this head:\nWhether the reference must be express and on the face of the paper containing the signature, or whether it is enough that a jury or judge of fact would conclude from the circumstances and contents that the two papers are parts of one correspondence, may be open to doubt. The latter is probably the better view.\nHere if these two letters of the 21st of June had not been entitled as they were, the fact that by one of them Mr. Meyers asked for a draft deed of land sold by O\u2019Donohoe to Stammers and that in the other O\u2019Donohoe enclosed to him such a deed would have been sufficient to connect them. Had the matter stopped here, however, there might have been difficulties in saying that the contract was sufficiently made out. But on the 29th of June, 1880, the respondent writes to Mr. Meyers a letter signed by himself and in his own name, which is also entitled Re Stammers, in which he says inter alia \u201con your refusal any longer to complete the purchase I shall take immediate steps to enforce the contract.\u201d This letter, in addition to being entitled like those before referred to, in Re Stammers, is sufficiently connected by its contents with those of the 21st of June, for in the interval, two letters dated respectively the 24th and 28th of June had been written by Mr. Meyers, claiming compensation, to which claim of compensation Mr. O\u2019Donohoe refers in his letter of the 29th of June in these words, \u201cI am unable to find any authority for such compensation as you speak of.\u201d We have then here an express admission by Mr. O\u2019Donohoe, signed by him, that there was a contract relating to land sold by O\u2019Donohoe to Stammers. It may be said, however, and was argued by the appellant that the reference must be to a written contract, and that it is consistent with the admission of \u201ca contract\u201d contained in this letter, that it may relate to a contract the terms of which were in parol merely. At the argument it appeared to me that such was the law, and that to bring a case within the propositions of Lord Cranworth in Ridgway v. Wharton[37], there must be a reference not merely to a general contract but to some specified written paper embodying such contract, parol evidence being then, and only then admissible to identify the writing referred to. This proposition was, however, strenuously controverted by Mr. Bain on behalf the respondent, who cited Baumann v. James[38], as an authority showing that when the reference was to a contract or agreement generally, without saying or implying that such contract was in writing, parol evidence was admissible to identity the contract so referred to with the terms of an agreement set out in some prior unsigned or imperfect writing,\u2014and subsequent consideration of this case of Baumann v. James has convinced me that the learned counsel was entirely right in his contention. In this case of Baumann v. James it was held that an agreement by letters for a lease of 14 years, \u201cat the rent and terms agreed upon\u201d was sufficient to warrant the admission of a report of a surveyor containing the terms which had been previously agreed to except as to the duration of the term. The case of Baumann v. James is, therefore, as was held by the court below, alone a sufficient authority to show that the conditions of sale signed by the auctioneer were, upon being as they were sufficiently identified, admissible in evidence, and being admitted they, taken in conjunction with the correspondence down to and inclusive of the letter of the 29th of June, make out a sufficient contract in writing satisfying all the requirements of the Statute of Frauds. I confess, however, that Baumann v. James seems to me to sanction a much greater infringement upon the enactment and policy of the Statute of Frauds, than previous authorities had admitted, and particularly to overstep the limitation as to the admissibility of parol evidence laid down by Lord Cranworth in Ridgway v. Wharton. It is, however, the decision of a Court of Appeal and has not so far as I have been able to discover been questioned, by any late judicial decision, although it is true that it has been strongly disapproved of by text writers. I think, however, we ought to follow it, and, if we do, it concludes the present appeal.\nWere we, however, to disregard Baumann v James altogether and apply the far stricter rule already stated laid down by Lord Cranworth in Ridgway v. Wharton, the result would as it appears to me be the same, for; on the 21st August, 1880, a letter signed by Messrs. O\u2019Donohoe & Haverson, was written to Mr. Meyers, which is as follows:\u2014\nAug. 21, 1880.\nStammers v Corbett.\nA.H. Meyers, Esq.\nDear Sir.\u2014We must decline acceding to the proposal of your last letter in this matter. We wrote you, not having before us the conditions of sale, that we would issue a writ; but now having these before us we have to intimate that unless the purchase money is paid without any reduction on or before the 25th inst., we shall pursuant to said conditions proceed to re-sell, and look to your client, the purchaser, for all damage, &c., &c., occasioned by his default.\nThis letter of the 21st August, is connected with the letters contained in the correspondence previously remarked upon, written on, and previously to the 29th June, by several intermediate letters, by which the correspondence was continued in the interval between the last mentioned date and the 21st of August, and the letter of this last date is sufficiently identified as referring to the same matter as the previous correspondence related to, viz., to the sale and purchase mentioned in the two letters of June 21st, by the terms and contents of these intermediate letters without requiring the aid of any extrinsic evidence for that purpose. Therefore, finding in this letter of the 21st August, a reference not to some agreement or contract, which might or might not be in writing, but a distinct reference to a particular document embodying conditions of sale which the writer of the letter had then before him, the Court below was entitled to receive parol evidence, not for the purpose of showing what the contract was, but in order to establish the identity of this document produced by the auctioneer, and proved to have been signed by him, as the agent of the appellant, with that referred to in Mr. O\u2019Donohoe\u2019s letter\u2014which, as Lord Cranworth says, was to admit parol evidence, not to make out the contract, but to establish a fact altogether collateral to it. Then reading the conditions of sale together with the correspondence, we have a perfect contract in writing, signed by the appellant, containing all the terms of the sale and complying with all the requirements of the Statute of Frauds.\nI am of opinion the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nFournier J. concurred.\nHENRY J.\u2014The action in this case was brought to enforce specific performance of a contract for the sale of a lot of land by the appellant to the purchaser. The bill sets out the contract and described the land and set forth the price thereof, and the terms of the sale, and prays that specific performance of the contract may be adjudged with costs. The land belonged at the time of the sale to the appellant, and he caused the same to be sold at auction on the 15th of May, 1880, and the respondent being the highest bidder became the purchaser, and signed an agreement to become such purchaser on the conditions and terms contained in the printed conditions of sale upon which the said agreement was written. The name of the vendor does not appear in either of those documents, nor does it appear satisfactorily that the auctioneer signed the agreement as such under the authority given to him by the fifth article of the conditions. His name was signed to it, but it is merely under the word \u201cwitness,\u201d and the evidence does not show in which capacity he so signed. Nor will I say it would have been sufficient had he signed it as the auctioneer, without giving the name of the vendor for whom he sold. As a general rule a contract for the sale of land must, according to the provision of the statute of Frauds, show the subject, terms and names of the parties. It is not necessary, however, that the names or terms should appear in any single paper. The contract may be collected from several connected papers. If a document properly signed does not contain the whole agreement, yet, if it refers to a writing that does, it will be sufficient, though the latter is not signed, and oral evidence is admissible to identify the writing referred to, and where a contract in writing exists which binds one party to it under the statute, any subsequent note signed by the other is sufficient to bind him. If an offer be made by one party in writing stating the subject and terms to sell or to purchase, he is bound thereby if the offer be accepted by a writing signed by the other referring to the offer. If, therefore, the appellant, by any writing signed by him, adopted the agreement which was signed by the respondent at the instance and request of the agent or auctioneer who was authorized by the appellant to sell, it appears to me that according to binding decisions on the subject, no objection can be raised under the statute. The appellant, in his answer, denies that neither the agreement nor any memorandum or note thereof was ever reduced into writing or signed by him, and that is the only issue raised by the pleadings.\nIt is shown that the appellant was the owner of the lot of land in question and was present at the sale of it to the respondent. That sale was made at the instance of the legal firm of O\u2019Donohoe & Haverson, of which the appellant was the head or leading partner. He says in his cross-examination on his answer that he believes he drafted the advertisement, and that he believes Exhibit A (Exhibit I of the case) is a copy of it, and the land sold on the day and on the terms mentioned in the advertisement and that the respondent became the purchaser. He acknowledges therein that Exhibit B (Exhibit 4 of case) was written by him. It is dated the 8th of June, 1880, and addressed to A.H. Meyers, who was then acting as the solicitor of the respondent, and was signed O\u2019Donohoe & Haverson. \u201cThe figures at the top,\u201d he says, \u201crefer to the purchase of this land and so does the letter; $406.25 is the amount of the purchase money, the $40 is the deposit paid, and the $366.25 is the balance still unpaid.\u201d That letter bears his firm\u2019s signature and includes his. If he had signed it \u201cO\u2019Donohoe\u201d only it would still be his signature made as it was by himself, and the adding the name of his partner could not lessen the effect of it. He therein admits that he wrote and signed Exhibit C (Exhibit 12 of the case) dated 28th June, 1880, and directed to A.H. Meyers, in which he refers to deeds which were apparently mislaid. He says in it: \u201cIf the deeds have not turned up give the correct name of Mr. S. (referring to the respondent) and we will at once fill up a new deed and send it for your approval. Meantime let me have $225 to send for discharge of mortgage.\u201d He further, in his cross-examination, says that the letter related to the transaction in question and that the $225 asked in the letter was a part of the purchase money. He also says that \u201cMr. S.\u201d in the letter refers to the respondent. In reference to a claim for compensation put forward by Mr. Meyers on behalf of the respondent, because the fences referred to in the advertisement as being on the land were not there as ascertained after the sale, the appellant addressed to him a letter as follows:\u2014\nJune 29, 1884.\nRe Stammers.\nA.H. Meyers, Esq.:\u2014\nDear Sir,\u2014I am unable to find any authority for such compensation as you speak of. I think if you look at the subject in Sugden\u2019s V. & P., you will abandon any claim of the kind. I have to state explicitly that no such claim will be entertained, and that on your refusal any longer to complete the purchase, I shall take immediate steps to enforce the contract. Hoping to have a definite reply to this at once.\nI am, dear sir, your obedient servant,\nJ. O\u2019DONOHOE.\nAcross the letter was written the words \u201cwithout prejudice,\u201d but I do not see how these words can lessen the effect of what was previously written. Again, on the 22nd July the appellant addressed another note to Mr. Meyers, as follows:\u2014\nJuly 22, 1880.\nRe Stammers Purchase.\nA.H. Meyers, Esq.:\u2014\nDear Sir,\u2014In your last letter you said that in about a week you would let us know your ultimatum in the matter. We have now to request you will do so, as we must get the sale closed without delay. Hoping you will favor us with a prompt reply.\nWe are, dear sir, yours truly,\nO\u2019DONOHOE & HAVERSON.\nWith a full knowledge of the advertisement, the sale and purchase by the respondent and the agreement giving the description of the property, and the terms and conditions of the sale, and of the execution of it by the respondent, and by Oliver the auctioneer, as such, as stated by the latter, or as a witness, the appellant writes and signs the several letters I have referred to and quoted, and they, in my opinion, are quite sufficient to satisfy the requirements of the statute and to bind the appellant as well as the respondent. I think, therefore, the respondent was entitled to the decree for specific performance, and inasmuch as the advertisement was drafted by the appellant, and was referred to by Mr. Meyers in his correspondence with the appellants firm, and tacitly, if not expressly, admitted by the latter, as constituting a part of the terms and conditions of the sale. I think that part of the decree which refers the matter of compensation to the Master may, also, be sustained, and that the decree and the judgment of the court below should be affirmed with costs.\nGwynne J. was also of opinion that the appeal should be dismissed.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for appellant: Adam H.

J. Ritchie, C.J., and Strong, Fournier, Henry and Gwynne, JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF QUEEN'S BENCH FOR LOWER CANADA (APPEAL SIDE).\nCon, Stat. L. C., ch. 69\u2014\u2014Building Society by-law\u2014Purchase of Land\u2011Intra vires,\nL. Cie. de V., a building society incorporated under ch. 69, Con. Stat. L. C., by its by-laws, on the 21st August, declared that the principal object of the society was to purchase building lots, and to build on such lots cottages costing about $1,000 each for every one of its members. In order to obtain its object, the company through its directors, obeying the instructions of the shareholders, on the 7th October, 1874, purchased the particular lots described in the by-laws and contracted for the building of twenty-four cottages at $1,250 each, the amount that each of the shareholders had agreed to pay. A year elapsed, during which the cottages are built and drawn by lot for distribution among the members. On the 11th October, 1875 the vendors of the lots and contractors for the building of the cottages, borrowed money from the ominion Building? Society and transferred to the same as collateral' security the moneys due them by the appellants in virtue of the deeds of purchase and building contract. The appellant company accepted the transfer and paid some monies on account, and finally a deed of settlement acte de reglement de compte was executed between the two companies, upon which was based the suit by H., the respondent, as assignee of the Dominion Mortgage Loan Company (which name was substituted for that of \"The Dominion Building Society\" by 40 Vic, ch. 80, D.), against the appellants.\nThe question argued on the appeal was whether the purchase of the lots and contract for building entered into by the directors was intra vives of the appellant company.\nHeld, affirming the judgment of the court below, that as the transaction in question was for the purpose of carrying out the objects of the society in strict accordance with its views, it was not ultra vires, Strong and Gwynne JJ. dissenting.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada (Appeal side) ([1]).\nThe facts and pleadings are fully set out in the head note, and judgments hereinafter given.\nChrysler for appellants:\u2014\nThe principal question is whether the appellants a non-permanent building society, organized under ch. 69 Con. Stats, of Lower Canada, has power, immediately-after organization and before any money had been paid upon the stock subscribed, to make the purchase of 100 building lots and to enter into a contract for the building of houses thereon. The appellants submit that they have not such power. See ch. 69, sec. 2; sec. 4, ss. 1 and 2. Secs. 10, 11 and 13 are all in favor of this view, and in effect they provide that the society cannot invest in real estate, except by way of loan or advance upon property of the borrower. Victoria Permanent Benefit Society ([2]); in re National Permanent Benefit Building Society ([3]).\nThe second question is whether the Dominion Mortgage Loan Company, represented here by their assignee, the respondent, had the right to take the assignment of the mortgage from the appellants' company to Desmarteau and others. The first objection is to the power of the Dominion Parliament to incorporate what is a building society empowered to transact business in only the Province of Quebec.\nSec. 2 provides that the company shall have, hold and continue to exercise the powers, &c., enjoyed by the Dominion Building Society (a provincial society), and no other powers are conferred, nor is the Act declared to be one for the general advantage of Canada. Further, the Dominion Building Society had no power to lend money upon security in the nature of personal security.\nA. Ouimet, Q.C., for the respondent:\u2014\nAs to the last question: Permanent building societies are, in effect banking institutions, and not local corporations dependent upon provincial legislation. Further, the appellants cannot contest, by incidental procedure, the legal status of a corporation, but such status must be regularly attacked under 12 Vic. ch. 41, art. 997, C. C. (L. C.) See Union Building Society v. Russell & Moran ([4]).\nAs to the first question: A transaction by a corporation which is but a mode of attaining more easily the object of its creation is not ultra vires when authorized by the rules and regulations. Mulloch v. Jenkins ([5]); Grimes v. Harrison ([6]); Bateman v. Ashton under Lyne ([7]) Hughes v. Layton ([8]); Brice ([9]); Richardson v. William son ([10]); Art. 358 C. C. (L.C.)\nJ. Doutre, Q.C., followed for respondent.\nA. Geoffrion, Q.C., for appellants, in reply.\nSir W. J. RITCHIE C.J.\u2014Although no direct evidence to that effect has been adduced, it may well be presumed that the real organization of the appellant company took place on the 21st of August 1874. On that day the by-laws were adopted and signed. On the 7th of October next following, the company through its directors, obeying the instructions of the shareholders purchased by notarial deed the particular lots described in the by-laws and contracted for the building of twenty-four cottages, The prices were precisely those determined by the rules and regulations of the society, $1,000 for each cottage, and$250 for the lots being for each shareholder $1250 the amount that each of them had agreed to pay. Moreover the amount was payable by instalments corresponding with the quarterly payments of the shareholders.\nA year elapse during which the cottages are built and drawn by lot for distribution among the members. On the 11th October 1875 the vendors of the lots and contractors for the building of the cottages, Desmarteau and others, happening to be shareholders in the Dominion ,Building Society, borrow money from the latter and transfer to the same as collateral security the moneys due them by La Compagnie de Villas du Cap Gribraltar in virtue of the above deeds The latter company accepted the transfer paid some monies on account now and then until 1877, when an action in recovery of the arrears then due was taken out against them in the Superior Court. On the 12th of January 1877, judgment was entered condemning the present appellants to pay to the Dominion Building Society $4,703099 with interest.\nA few months after that judgment, which was accepted as final by both parties, the deed of settlement (acte de r\u00e8glement de compte) upon which is based the present action was executed.\nBuilding Societies are of course subject to articles 358 and 366 of the Civil Code. They possess only the powers specially conferred upon them by their charter or Act of Incorporation, and those that are necessary to attain the object of their creation; and they are subject to the disabilities arising from the law and comprised in the general laws of the country respecting mort-mains and bodies corporate, prohibiting them from acquiring immovable property except for certain purposes only.\nThe appellants were incorporated under cap. 69 of the Consolidated Statutes of Lower Canada intituled: \"An Act respecting Building Societies.\" This act deals with two kinds of building societies, non-permanent and permanent.\nTheir object is the same: to raise by periodical subscription from members a capital to be afterwards lent by the society upon hypotheque to facilitate the purchase of real estate or the buildings of houses Both have the power of taking and holding real estate in certain cases: non-permanent building societies, for the purpose only of securing advances made to their members or debts due to the society; and permanent building societies for these objects and also up to a certain fixed sum, for establishing thereupon a place of business. The following clauses of the said act are common to the two kinds of building societies:\nSect. 1 \u00a72. Such Society shall be constituted for the purpose of raising, by monthly or other periodical subscriptions of the several members of the said society in shares not exceeding the value of four hundred dollars for each share (and by subscriptions not exceeding four dollars per month, for each share), a stock or fund for enabling each member to receive out of the funds of the society the amount or value of his share or shares therein, for the purpose of erecting or purchasing one or more dwelling houses, or other freehold or leasehold estate, such advance to be secured by mortgage or otherwise to the said society, until the amount or value of his share or sharesis fully paid to the said society, with the interest thereon and with all fines or liabilities incurred in respect thereof.\n\u00a73\u2014The several members of such society may\u2026\u2026\u2026..make and constitue rules and regulations for the government and guidance of the same\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.so as such rules be not repugnant to the express provisions of this Act or to the laws in force in Lower Canada\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.\nSect. 4, \u00a71-.\u2014Every such society shall, by one or more of their said rules, declare all and every the interests and purposes for which such society is established; and shall also in and by such rules direct all and every the uses and purposes to which the money from time to time subscribed, paid or given to or for the use or benefit of the said society.\n\u00a72.\u2014But the application of such money shall not in any wise be repugnant to the uses, interests or purposes of such society, or any of them to be declared as aforesaid.\nThis latter section has been taken from the Act. 12 Victoria, Oh. 57, Sect 4, which is in the following terms:\nAnd be it enacted, that every such society so established as aforesaid shall in or by one or more of their said rules, declare all and every, the interests and purposes for which such society is intended to be established; and shall also in and by such rules direct all and every the uses and purposes to which the money which shall from time to time be subscribed, paid or given to or for the use or benefit of the said society, or which shall arise therefrom, or in any wise shall belong to the said society, shall be appropriated and applied: and in what shares or proportions and under what circumstances any member of such society or other person, shall or may become entitled to the same, or any part thereof; provided that the application thereof shall not in any wise be repugnant to the uses, interests or purposes of such society, or any of them to be declared as aforesaid. Sect. 10.Any such society may take and hold any real estate or securities thereon bona fide mortgaged, assigned or hypothecated to the said society, either to secure the payment of the shares subscribed for by its members, or to secure the payment of any loans or, advances made by, or debts due to such society, and may also proceed on such mortgages, assignments or other securities, for the recovery of the moneys thereby secured, either at law or in equity or otherwise; and such society may invest in the names of the president and treasurer for the time being, any of its surplus funds in the stocks of any of the chartered banks, or other public securities of the province.\nSect. 11.\u2014Any such society may, from time to time, lend and advance to any member or other person, money from and out of its surplus funds, upon the security and mortgage, (hypoth\u00e8que) of real estate.\nSect. 12.\u2014-Whenever any such society has received from any shareholder a mortgage or hypothec, or an assignment or transfer of any real estate belonging to him or her, to secure the payment of any advance, and containing an authority to the society to sell such real estate in case of nonpayment of any stipulated number of instalments, or sums of money (as every such society is hereby authorized to do) such society may cause the same to be enforced by an action or proceeding in the usual course.\nSect. 13.\u2014Every such society may advance, in the usual manner moneys or any real estate whatsoever of any member of the said society, as well for the actual purchase of the same and for the erection of buildings thereon, as generally upon the security of any real estate belonging to any such member, at the time of his borrowing such moneys, and may take a mortgage, hypothec or assignment of all such real estate whatsoever in security for such advances.\nAll the clauses of the Act from section 21 onwards relate only to permanent building societies, and among them are the following:\nSect. 24.No such society, by its rules, regulations and by-laws authorized to borrow money, shall borrow, receive, take or retain, otherwise than in stock and shares in such society from any person or persons, any greater sum than three-fourths the amount of capital actually paid in on unadvanced shares and invested in real securities by such society and the paid in and subscribed capital of the society shall be liable for the amount so borrowed received or taken by any society.\nSect. 26. Any such society may advance to members on the security of investing on unadvanced shares in the said society, and may receive and take from any person or body corporate, any real or personal security of any kind whatever, as collateral security for any advance made to members of the society\u00bb\nSect. 27.--Any such society may hold absolutely real estat'e for the purposes of its place of business, not exceeding the annual value of six thousand dollars.\nThe Act under which the Building Society (appellants) was incorporated, the object for which it was formed, and the manner in which its capital was to be employed are mentioned in articles 1 2 3 4, 5, 6 and 7 of its by-laws, viz:\u2014\nBy-Laws of the Villa Association of Cape Gibraltar, (Lake Memphrenagog,) adopted at the general meeting of the 21st August, 1874:\nArt. I. The society shall be called \" the Villa Association of Cape Gibraltar, Lake Memphremagog:\" La Campagnie de Villas du Cap Gibraltar, Lao Memphremagog.\nIt is incorporated in virtue of Ch. 69 of the Consolidated Statutes of Lower Canada entitled: \"An Act concerning Building Societies.\"\nIts office shall be at Montreal.\nArt. II.\u2014The object of the society is to offer to its members a sure and advantageous means of investing their savings, to aid them in acquiring cottages on certain lots of land of one hundred feet frontage and three hundred feet depth, situate at Cape Gibraltar, Lake Memphremagog, county of Brome, Province of Quebeb, being a portion of the property known as the Furniss property.\nArt. III.\u2014\"The present capital of the society is $100,000, being the first issue. The directors may increase the capital when they may deem it necessary and fix such conditions of payment and other conditions that they may consider expedient. Each increase of capital shall be designated according to its issue.\nArt. IV.\u2014The present capital of the company forms the first issue and is divided into shares of one hundred dollars each, called the fixed stock this issue is also composed of an indeterminate amount of accumulating stock.\nThe shares are divided into a certain number of accounts or num bers, each account or number consisting of ten shares.\nShareholders shall pay during ten years at the office of the society, for each account or number which they owe, the sum of one hundred dollars per annum in three instalments of $33.33\u2153; such instalments shall represent the fixed stock. They shall moreover pay $25.00 per annum in three instalments of $8.33\u2153; such instalments shall represent the accumulating stock, and they shall be continued until the expiration of the society\u00bb\nArt. V.\u2014The capital or funds of the society shall be employed\u20141st for the cost of administration; 2nd to purchase building lots on the property known as the \" Furniss property \" situate on the shores of Lake Memphremagog; 3rd to build on such lots cottages costing about $1,000.00 each for every one of its members or shareholders.\nArt. VI.\u2014These cottages shall be erected under the care and direction of the directors according to plans and contracts approved by them.\nArt. VII.\u2014As soon as one or more of such cottages shall be built as the directors may decide, there shall be a drawing by lot to designate the number or shareholder to whom such house and the lot upon which it is built shall belong.\nThese by-laws were approved of and signed as appears by plaintiff's exhibit A, viz:\n\"Nous, les soussign\u00e9s, apr\u00e8s avoir lu et examine les r\u00e8glements de la Compagnie de Villas du Cap Gibraltar, Lac Memphr\u00e9magog, les approuvons, les signons, et nous nous engageons de nous y conformer ainsi qu'aux changements et amendements qui pourront y \u00eatre faits et nous y souscrivons le nombre de parts inscrites vis-\u00e0-vis nos noms respectifs.\nSignatures des membres.

It cannot be denied that when an incorporated company has certain limited powers it can only be bound when acting within the limits of those powers. Any acts or agreements outside of these powers are ultra vires, and for which the corporation will not be liable, or as Mr. Bryce puts it, \" a corporation incurs no liability by engaging in transactions aliunde those for the prosecution of which it has been created \"\u2014and as corporations can be bound only within certain limits, outside those limits they are not bound, and therefore, as he says, \" neither at law nor in equity will the other contracting parties obtain any redress in any form of suit upon the engagement itself from the corporation whatever be the fraud or however unjust the refusal of such redress.\"\nAnd as Jervis C. J., in the East Anglian Railways Co. v. The Eastern Counties Railway Co. ([11]) says:\u2014\nIf the contract is illegal, as being contrary to the Act of Parliament, it is unnecessary to consider the effect of dissentient shareholders; for, if the company is a corporation only for a limited purpose, and a contract like that under discussion is not within their authority, the assent of all the shareholders to such a contract, though it may make them all personally liable to perform such contract, would not bind them in their corporate capacity or render liable their corporate funds.\nIn Riche v. Ashbury Railway Carriage Co. ([12]) Mr. Justice Blackburn expresses himself thus:\u2014\nI do not entertain any doubt that if on the true construction of a statute creating a corporation, it appears to be the intention of the legislature, express or implied, that the corporation shall not enter into a particular contract, every court, whether of law or equity, is bound to treat a contract entered into contrary to the enactment as illegal, and therefore wholly void, and to hold that a contract wholly void cannot be ratified. .\nAnd Lord Cairns in the Ashbury Railway Carriage & Iron Co. v. Riche ([13]), citing that passage says: \"that sums up and exhausts the whole case.\" And by Lord Cran worth in the Eastern Counties Railway Co. v. Hawkes ([14]), and by Lord Selborne in the Ashbury Railway Carriage & Iron Co. v. Riche ([15]), it has been stated as settled law that a statutory corporation created by Act of Parliament for a particular purpose, is limited as to all its powers by the purposes of its incorporation as defined by that act.\nThe simple question then is as to the competency and power of the company to make this contract; if it was beyond the objects for which it was incorporated it was beyond the powers of the company to make it and was therefore void from the beginning and as if no contract at all had been made and therefore could not be ratified though every member had originally sanctioned the action of the directors and authorized the placing of the seal of the company to the contract, or had subsequently ratified and confirmed the transaction. If therefore the contract in this case is of a nature not included in the memorandum of association it would be ultra vires not only of the directors but of the whole company, so that the subsequent assent of the whole body of shareholders would have no power to ratify it because it is in its inception void or beyond the provisions of the statute. Has the corporation in this case then gone beyond the objects and purposes expressed or implied in the act ? It must be borne in mind that there is a clear distinction as to what may be ultra vires the directors of the company and of the company itself, because there may be acts extra vires the directors and yet intra vires the corporation.\nIn the Eastern Counties Railway Co. v. Hawkes ([16]) Lord St. Leonards said:\u2014\nThe mere circumstance of a covenant by directors in the name of the company being ultra vires, as between them and the shareholders, does not necessarily disentille the covenantee to sue upon it.\nIn Bateman V. Mayor, &c., of Ashton-Under-Lyne ([17]), Martin B. says:\u2014\nI do not at all mean to differ from any of the cases cited on the argument. I am content to take the law as laid down in The last Anglian Railway Company v. The Eastern Counties Railway Company ([18]). and in McGregor v. The Official Manager of the Dover and Deal Railway Company ([19]), in conjunction with what I have already referred to as being stated by Lord Wensleydale in The South Yorkshire By. Co. v. The Great Western By. Co, ([20]) and Mr. Justice Erle in The Mayor of Norwich v. The Norfolk By. Co. ([21]). The cases in equity which were cited were as between the companies and their shareholders, where the question is very different from that between a third person and the company, being a corporation, upon a bon\u00e2 fide contract.\nThe real question then will be: What were the objects for which the corporation was established ? For those objects and those alone is the company in existence. The object is thus expressed in article II., \" The object of the society is to offer to its members a sure and advantageous means of investing their savings, to aid them in acquiring cottages on certain lots of land of 100 feet frontage, situate at cape Gibraltar lake Memphremagog, county Brome, province of Quebec, being a portion of the property known as the Furnis property.\"\nNow, practically, is not the object to be attained by this arrangement and purchase identical with the object the act of incorporation and rules agreed on were intended to attain oniy in a different manner from that g\u00e9nerally adopted by benefit building societies ? Is there then anything in the express provisions of the statute creating the corporation, or by necessary and reasonable inference from its enactments, expressly or impliedly forbidding the making of the contract sought to be enforced, and thus showing that such an arrangement or contract was ultra vires, that is, that the legislature meant that such a contract should not be made or as Lord Wens leydale expresses it ([22]):\u2014\nWhether it can be reasonably made out from the Statute that this covenant is ultra vires or in other words forbidden to be entered into And again at p. 88\nIt not being made out that the Act prohibits such a bargain the contract must be enforced.\nAdopted by Erie J. and also by Martin and Channell BB., in Bateman v. Mayor, &c. of Ashton-under-Lyne ([23])\nThis contract was unquestionably made bond tide on both sides\u2014there is no pretence for saying there was any breach of trust as against the shareholders, or that the agreement was in fraud of the proprietors of shares. On the contrary all that was done in reference to this transaction was with the unanimous consent and con currence of the shareholders, so that the simple question is Was what has been done illegal as being forbidden by law, that is, not authorized by the act of incorporation and therefore prohibited by the act ? So far from there being anything in this transaction unconnected with the object of the incorporation, or calculated to defeat the purposes of this incorporation, the object seems to me to be directly in furtherance of what the parties had in view, therefore I fail to see how it can be said that the transaction is prohibited by implication. If the purposes to be accomplished were substantially the same, then the means and modes by and through which such purposes are to be effected would not make the transaction ultra vires.\nSee the Mayor of Norwich v. The Norfolk Ely Co. ([24]), as to the d distinction between a difference of purposes and a difference of means and modes by and through which the same purpose is to be effected.\" And in Bateman v. The Mayor, &c. ([25]), Bram well B.,who differed from the Court in the final conclusion, says at page 340:\u2014\nI in no way doubt the correctness of what Lord Wensleydale said in the North Yorkshire R. Co. v. The Great Northern Railway Co. (3)\nColeridge J., in Mayor of Norwich v. Norfolk Railway Co. ([26]), in speaking of the well considered judgment of Lord Langdale in Colman v. Eastern Counties R' y Co. ([27]) says:\nThis language points to an undenied distinction between a difference of purposes and a difference of means and modes by and through which the same purpose is to be effected, and where in any particular instance the lawfulness of a change is in question it will be discussed accordingly on different principles.\nAnd after speaking of a corporation attempting to carry on or substitute a purpose different from that for which it has been created, he says:\nIf once you establish the substantial difference of purpose there is therefore no longer any question of degree or convenience. But where the corporation merely adopts different means or modes by or through which the original purpose is to be effected, the question will turn not on the want of power, but on the interests and con sent or otherwise of those affected by the change and all considerations of degree and convenience will be material.\nAnd again he says:\nWhen one considers the immense extension and increase of corporate bodies in modern times, the vast variety of purposes for which they are created, the complication of circumstances under which they are to act, the liability to error in the formation of prospective plans as to detail, and the ever arising improvements in the means and appliances of mechanics and science, it would seem that public convenience and policy, as well as good sense and justice, require that within the limits of a substantial adherence to purpose the empowering clauses of incorporating instruments should be construed largely and liberally, so as not to defeat the purpose by a too narrow restriction of the means.\nAnd Lord Campbell C. J. says:\nIn South Yorkshire Railway and River Dun Co. v. Gt. Northern Railway Co. ([28]), (I believe the most recent case upon the subject), my brother Parke, after observing that individuals and corporations which are the creations of law are bound by their-contracts as much as all the members of a partnership would be by a contract in which all concurred, goes on to say: But where a corporation is created by Act of Parliament for particular purposes, with special. powers then indeed another question arises, their deed. though under their corporate seal, and that regularly affixed, does not bind them, if it appear by the express provisions of the statute creating the corporation, or by necessary or reasonable inference from its enactments, that the deed was ultra sires, that is, that the legislature meant that such a deed should not be made.\nThe question then appears to me to be simply this, whether it can be reasonably made out from the statute that this covenant is ultra sires; or, in other words, forbidden to be entered into by either the plaintiffs or defendants.\nThere is no doubt a distinction between a benefit building society and a freehold land society.\nKindersley V. C. thus speaks of benefit building societies ([29]):\nTheir object is that any individual member may borrow money from the society to enable him to buy or build a house, mortgaging it to the society as security for the money borrowed, and ultimately making it absolutely his own by paying off the mortgage out of his subscription.\nIn Grimes v. Harrion ([30]), Sir John Romilly said:\nThere is in my opinion a great distinction between a freehold land society and a benefit building society. A freehold land society buys land with the funds contributed by the menbers of the society and then divides it amongst them \u00ab but a benefit building society ad vances to its borrowing members money derived from the subscriptions and which the borrowing members themselves lay out in the purchase of land or buildings, and then mortgage them to the society. But this is quite clear that in both cases the members must be bound by the rules constituting the society to which they have become parties and upon which they have acted.\nThe case of Queen v. D'Eyncourt ([31]), seems to me to be on all fours with this case, and to establish that there was no change of purpose, but simply a carrying out of the purpose contemplated by different modes and means.\nThe object of the society in that case, registered in 1852 under the 6 and 7 William IV. cap. 32 for the registration of Benefit Building Societies, as a benefit building society, was to enable its members by weekly subscriptions to purchase freehold property in shares; that every member upon receiving the money advanced to him should execute a mortgage of the property offered as a security for all payments due or to become due according to the rules, upon his share or shares. In 1853 the directors purchased a freehold estate partly by the subscriptions of the members and partly with money borrowed for that purpose, and it was divided into allotments among such of the members as desired to have land.\nIn 1855 L., who was a subscribing member, agreed to take two allotments and to continue his weekly subscriptions. In 1858 the company decided not to receive any further subscriptions from investing members, but to consider them as withdrawing members. After March 1855, L. discontinued the payment of his weekly subscriptions, and after notice of arbitration, pursuant to one of the rules and 10 Geo. 4 ch. 56 s. 27, an award was made against him for payment of \u00a369 8s. 4d Upon his refusal to pay that sum an application was made to a Police Magistrate to enforce the award, which he declined to do. Upon a rule calling upon the magistrate to enforce the award, it was held: \" That the society had not ceased to exist by reason of the purchase of the land; that if that was a misapplication of the funds the remedy for members who had not assented to it was in a Court of Equity.\"\nIn that case, as in this before us, the society purchased land instead of its members doing so, with money advanced to them. It was contended, as in this case, that the society ceased to be a Benefit Building Society and lost the statutory powers given by Statute 6 & 7Wm 4 ch. 32. But it was established that converting the society from a benefit building society into a free bold land society was not illegal, and was not a contract contrary to the policy of the act, and though the society could not compel a member to take an allotment instead of money, the members might agree among themselves that instead of the members receiving money the funds and credits of the society should be applied in the purchase of a tract of land to be afterwards allotted to them\nCockburn C.J. thus speaks in The Queen v. D'Eyn court ([32]):\u2014\nThis was a society registered as a Benefit Building Society under Statute 6 & 7 W. 4 ch. 32, and according to the rules, which have been duly certified, subscriptions and fines became payable by Lay-ton, who was a member, and he has not paid. them.\nThe main answer to the claim of the society is that it has been dissolved. It is said that by an arrangement among themselves the members have changed the purposes of their society and converted themselves into a Freehold Land Society, by applying the funds in the purchase of land, and therefore the society is put an end to. But that does not follow. If there has been a misappropriation of the funds contributed by the members, that is a case for the intervention of a Court of Equity on the application of any member who thinks himself aggrieved. But the society does not cease to exist because it does something which its rules do not warrant. A Court of Equity would restrain the directors from misapplying the money recovered under the award, but so long as the society exists the members are bound by the rules, and the question of an alleged misapplication of its funds is foreign to the jurisdiction of the magistrate under the statute.\nCrompton J. ([33]):\u2014\nThe converting the society from a Benefit Building Society into a Freehold Land Society is not in the nature of an illegal conspiracy. The society took certain powers under the Act of Parliament, by which its members received an amount of money to enable them to purchase land, and afterwards arranged among themselves that land should be purchased and allotted among them. There is nothing illegal, immoral, or vicious in that, so as to be void: it does not even amount to a contract contrary to the policy of the Act. The society could not compel a member to take an allotment instead of money; he would have a right to say: \" I do not claim through this arrange ment for allotting the land, but under the rules of the society,\"\u2014he traces his title from the arrangement made when he entered the society. Blackburn J. ([34]):\u2014\nHow has Layton, who had become a shareholder, taken himself out of the provisions of the Benefit Building Society Act ? The rules of this society are framed with the view of enabling the members to purchase land. in fact the members have agreed among themselves that, instead of the members receiving money, the funds and credit of the society shall be applied in the purchase of a tract of land to be afterwards allotted among them. That was so far illegal, that under the rules they had no right to do it; it was a breach of trust. But Layton was a party to that proposal, and agreed to take part of the land so purchased on the terms of his paying his weekly subscriptions as usual. If that agreement had been carried out he would have got an allotment; and it would have been the same as if he had paid for it and the society had returned the money to him by way of loan.\nI therefore think this transaction, thus carrying out the objects of this society in strict accordance with its rules, is not ultra vires\u2014that is, in the language of Parke; B., ([35]) \"it is not forbidden expressly or by implication by the Acts of Parliament relating to these companies, and I am happy to find that the law of this case coincides with the honesty of it and does not sanction the breach by the defendants company of the solemn contract into which they have fairly entered and from which they are trying to escape.\"\nSTRONG J.\u2014I am compelled to dissent from the majority of this court as well as from the court below. The opinion of Mr. Justice Cross, who differed from the other members of the Court of Queen's Bench, seems to be in all respects well founded. It appears that the purchase of lands by the appellants and the contract with Desmarteau and others for building the 24 cottages entered into upon the 7th of October, 1874, as well as the deed of arrangement of the 10th of September, 1877, founded on the previous deed, were all ultra vires of the appellants and void. Taking this view of the case, it will be unnecessary to consider the question raised as to the status of the respondents.\nThe appellants are a non-permanent building society incorporated under the Con. Stats. L. C. ch. 69 from which their powers are to be ascertained The principal matter for our determination is, therefore whether that Act conferred upon them power to enter into contracts for the purchase of lands for the purposes for which the lands in question were avowedly acquired, and whether they have power to enter into building contracts such as that for the construction of the twenty-four cottages which Desmarteau agreed to build for them by the second agreement of the 7th October, 1874. The general law as to the power of corporations in the Province of Quebec is contained in art. 358 of the Civil Code which is as follows:\u2014\u2014\nThe rights which a corporation may exercise besides those specially conferred by its title, or by the general laws applicable to its particular kind, are all those which are necessary to attain the object of its creation; thus it may acquire, alienate and possess property, sue and be sued, contract, incur obligations, and bind others in its favor\nThe law of England upon the subject of the powers of corporations is stated by the Lord Chancellor (Cairns) in a late case ([36]), in the House of Lords, approving the definition of the rule laid down by Mr. Justice Black burn in the same case in the Exchequer Chamber; Lord Cairns there says:\nI do not entertain any doubt that if on the true construction of a statute creating a corporation it appears to be the intention of the legislature, express or implied, that the corporation shall not enter into a particular contract, every court, whether of law or equity, is bound to treat a contract entered into contrary to the enactment as illegal, and therefore wholly void, and to hold that a contract wholly void cannot be ratified. It thus appears that the law of England is less strict than that of the Province of Quebec, as explicitly declared by the code; for, whilst by the latter a corporation is deemed to possess no powers except such as are expressly or impliedly conferred upon it by the instrument of its creation, by the English law a corporation is held to have all legal powers which are possessed by a natural person, except such as are either by express words or by implication prohibited by the statute, (either general or special) charter, or articles of association which has called it into legal existence.\nA late American work on the law of corporations ([37]), points out that the decisions of the American courts have laid down a rule on this subject identical with that which had been adopted by the Quebec code, and therefore a rule which in its mere terms of statement differs from the definition adopted by the House of Lords in Riche v. Ashbury Railway Carriage and Iron Co., but adds that the law is substantially the same in both countries in its effects and result inasmuch as a power which, according to the doctrine of the Supreme Court of the United States would be considered as so foreign to the proposed objects of a corporation as not to be impliedly conferred upon it, would equally, according to the English rule, be extra vires as impliedly prohibited. I mention this apparent distinction merely to show that there is no reason why English authorities should not apply, not of course directly as binding decisions, but so far as they appear to have been well decided as guides in a case like the present.\nThere has been some confusion in the cases arising from the use of the term ultra vires being indiscriminately applied to the Acts of corporations Or the governing bodies of corporations objectionable on very different grounds; it is sometimes applied to acts in which the governing body of the corporation, such as a board of directors, have transcended the powers delegated to them, though the Act objected to was not beyond the powers of the corporation itself; in other cases, it has been applied to acts of the corporation itself, which, though not beyond the capacity conferred upon it by the Act of incorporation, exceeded the powers to which the by-laws or constitution had limited the exercise of their powers; but in its more general and proper signification it is applied to acts in excess of the powers conferred on the corporation by its Act of incorporation or charter. I refer to these distinctions for the reasons that most of the cases cited in the appellant's factum belong to the first and second, and not to the last of these classes.\nThe enquiry which we must make in the present case is thus confined to this does the Con. Stats. L. C. ch. 69 give authority to non-permanent building societies, formed pursuant to the provisions of that Act to enter into such contracts as those of the 7th Oct. 1874 for the purchase of these lands and the building of cottages.\nIt is to be observed, in the first place, that no authority to hold real estate is given to the society otherwise than by the 10th section, which empowers the society to take and hold real estate mortgaged, assigned or hypothecated to it to secure payment by the members of the shares, or to secure loans or advances made by the society. This is the only express power on the subject.\nThe purpose for which such societies are constituted are declared in the second sub-section of the 1st section of the Act as follows:\nSuch society shall be constituted for the purpose of raising by monthly or other periodical subscriptions of the several members of the said society, in shares not exceeding the value of $400 for each share, (and by subscriptions not exceeding $4 per month for each share), a stock or fund for enabling each member to receive out of the funds of the society the amount or value of his share or shares therein for the purpose of erecting or purchasing one or more dwelling houses, or other freehold or leasehold estate, such advance to be secured by mortgage or otherwise to the said society until the amount or value of his share or shares is fully paid to the said society with the interest thereon, and with all fines or liabilities incurred in respect thereof.\nThis section contains all that is to be found in the Act as to the object and design of the society; and it is manifest that it does not confer power to purchase or acquire land, or to build houses. The objects are very plainly stated; they are to carry on the society until, by means of the monthly subscriptions of the members, the interest in loans fines, and other legitimate sources, the capital stock or fund is realized, when the society will terminate and members who have not by borrowing received their shares in advance will be entitled to be paid the full amount of the shares for which they sub scribed and a further object is, to advance on sufficient security upon freehold or leasehold lands, the amount of their shares to borrowing members, the security being not of course to re-pay the loan, but to continue the monthly payments or subscriptions on the borrower's shares, interest and fines, until the termination of the society in the manner before mentioned. It is true, it is said, that the intention is to enable members to lay out the amount of their shares advanced to them, in purchasing or building houses, but there is nothing in the Act making it obligatory upon them so to apply the money which they may raise by borrowing upon, or taking their shares in advance, for they may, as, in practice, is constantly done, use the money in any way they may think fit and there is nothing authorizing the society to lay out the money for them in the purchase of land or in building houses. So far from the Act conferring any power upon the society to acquire land or enter into building contracts, we find the 10th section giving express power to take land in the only way, and for the only purpose, contemplated by the legislature, namely, as security for money advanced. And even as regards surplus moneys, by which I mean moneys in the hands of the society arising from subscriptions and other legitimate sources authorized by the Act, and not taken up by borrowing members, and which, therefore, the interests of the society require should be invested in some manner in order that a profit may be derived, we find that the only investments of such moneys authorized are those indicated in the 10th section, namely, mortgages of real estate, the stock of chartered banks, and other public securities of the province. From this 10th section I think it is evident that it was not the intention of the legislature to empower building societies to invest in the purchase of land or in the building of houses. If they can so invest, it can only be because some implied power to do so is to be inferred, but I have read the Act many times and have failed to find any ground for such an implication, and the respondents have failed to point out any particular clause from which it may be inferred. If we were so to hold, we should be obliged also to hold that it was open to the society to invest in any securities they might think fit and to construe the 10th section as in no way restrictive, but as merely expressing what was already implied. Such a mode of construction is not, in my opinion, admissible. I think the only use to which the moneys of the society can be put before its termination, is loans on mortgages to borrowing members, and investments in mortgages, bank shares and public securities.\nThat I am right in this view of the construction of the Act is I think confirmed by the consideration that the scheme which these societies were intended to carry out was borrowed from the early Building Societies Acts in England, and it is clear that without special powers they were not authorized to purchase land, That the object of the English societies was the same as this, appears from the case of The Kent Benefit Building Society ([38]), when Kindersley V.C. describes the object of such societies to be:\u2014\nThat any individual member may borrow money from the society to enable him to buy or build a house, mortgaging it to the society as security for the money borrowed, and ultimately making it absolutely his own by paying off the mortgage out of his subscription.\nThe same case also shows that it was not within the scope of the powers conferred by the Act of parliament authorizing the creation of such societies that they should themselves acquire land by purchase.\nIn short, the conclusion I come to is, that whilst the expressed object, of the society is to enable members to buy or build houses, yet that object is to be attained, and attained only, in the mode of operation pointed out by the act, namely, by borrowing money from the society, and with the money purchasing or building houses, and that this mode of carrying out the scheme of the act is essential, and one to which its purposes are to be restricted; and I cannot agree that this prescribed mode of proceeding can be set aside, and the same result secured by the society itself purchasing houses and lands or building houses and reselling them to members.\nTherefore these contracts of the 7th October, 1874,. were ipso jure, void and inexisting, and being so void were not susceptible of confirmation, and consequently the deed of arrangement of the 10th September, 1877, was likewise void and this action must therefore fail.\nIt is said, however, that the former judgment of the Superior Court rendered on the 12th May, 1877, in an action brought to recover the amount of instalments alleged to have become due on the contracts of the 7th October, 1874 is sufficient to establish the defence of chose jug\u00e9e pleaded to the present action, I am unable to assent to this. The defence now pleaded that the contracts were ultra wires was not raised, in that action. But it appears from the judgment itself that there never was any actual adjudication in favor of the plaintiff in the former action of any disputed questions, on the contrary the \u201cconsid\u00e9rants \" of the judgment show that the action would have been dismissed upon the ground that all payments received from shareholders up to the time of the institution of the action had been paid over according to the contracts, if the defendants (the present appellants) had not consented to a judgment for the sum of $4,703.09. A judgment thus rendered by consent cannot have the effect of chose jug\u00e9e as to the legal validity of the obligation sued upon, in a subsequent action upon the same obligation, for it amounts to nothing more than this that there being certain matters in dispute between the parties, an arrangement or \"transaction\" takes place between them, which is by consent confirmed and made exigible by the judgment of the court. Such a judgment cannot have the effect of a judgment recovered adversely, and no more concludes the appellants from now setting up the defence of ultra vires to another demand, founded on the same deed than the voluntary payment of the amount for which the judgment was allowed to pass would have done. Further, a judgment in respect of one instalment portion of the debt, does not constitute res judicata as regards subsequent instalments, being other portions of the same debt.

Aussi fait-elle la distinction entre les nullit\u00e9s qui sont contraires an but de la loi et celles qui n'affectent que les moyens employ\u00e9s pour parvenir an but de loi.\nDans le cas actuel, la transaction attaqu\u00e9e avant \u00e9t\u00e9 compl\u00e9t\u00e9e, il n'est pas an pouvoir de la compagnie appelante, d'invoquer son incapacit\u00e9, comme l'\u00e9tablit l'autorit\u00e9 suivanee:\u2014\nBut when a transaction of the kind now under consideration is completed on the part of the other contracting party, every principle of common sense and equity requires that the corporation should not be permitted to repudiate payment therefor, or the other party due completion thereof by itself on the ground that the transaction though admitted to be within its possible capacities, it outside its actual powers then called into existence The very defence dis closes fraud Brice ([39]).\nWhen a contract to which a corporation is a party has been fully executed on the other part, and nothing remains to be done but the payment by the corporation, it will not be allowed to set up that the contract was ultra vires. Oil Creek, etc, R. R. Co. v. Pasoenger Transp. Co. ([40]).\nA corporation is estopped from setting up the derence in an action to recover money loaned to it that the money was borrowed and expended in a business beyond the corporate powers, that the lender knew the use intended was ultra vires makes no difference, so long as the purpose was not in itself one of an immoral or illegal character.\nL'appelante a cite plusieurs decisions des tribunaux d'Angleterre qui maintiennent ses pr\u00e9tentions jusqu'\u00e0 Un certain point Elles sont fond\u00e9es sur le statut 6 et 7 William 4, ch. 32, qui declare que les Benefit Building Societies sont form\u00e9es dans le but de cr\u00e9er au moyen de souscriptions p\u00e9riodiques, un fonds pour permettre aux actionnaires:\nTo erect or purchase one or more dwelling houses, or other real or leasehold, estate to be secured by way of mortgages to such society until the amount of his or her share shall have been fully repaid.\nLe chapitre 69 de nos statuts, qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 model\u00e9 sur le statut imp\u00e9rial 6 et 7 William 4, ch. 32, a donn\u00e9 aux soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de b\u00e2tisses, organss\u00e9es en vertu de ses dispositions la facult\u00e9 d'assurer leurs avances non-seulement par hypoth\u00e8que (by way of mortgage), mais aussi par tout autre moyen,\nSuch advance to be secured by mortgase or otherwise to the said society,\ntandis que le statut imp\u00e9rial n'admet que le moyen de l'hypoth\u00e8que (mortgage). En cons\u00e9quence de cette extension de pouvoir les pr\u00e9c\u00e9dents cites par 1 appelante n'ont gu\u00e8re d'application dans la pr\u00e9sente cause. Cependant malgr\u00e9 les termes restrictifs de l'acte 6 et 7, William 4 on trouve la cause de La Reine v. d'Eyncourt et al. ([41]), parfaitement analogue au cas actuel, dans laquelle ii fut d\u00e9cidC que l'acquistiion d'immeubles contrairement au mode indiou\u00e9 par l'acte 6 et 7 William 4 ch. 82 n'avait pas eu l'effet de mettre fin \u00e0 l'existence de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9.\nLa soci\u00e9t\u00e9 dont il s'agit dans la cause de La Reine vs. D'Eyncrourt, apr\u00e8s avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 organis\u00e9e, comme la compagnie appelante, pour l'acquisition do. propri\u00e9t\u00e9s an moyen de souscriptions p\u00e9riodiques, en vertu de I'acte 6 and 7 William 4 ch. 32, dont les dispositions sont en grands partie reproduites dans le ch. 69, Stat. Ref., B.C., acheta, partie avec l'argent re\u00e7u des souscripteurs, et partie avec de l'argent empiunt\u00e9 \u00e0 cet effet, des terrains qui furent ensuite divis\u00e9s en lots et partag\u00e9s entre ceux qui voulurent s'en porter acqu\u00e9reurs. Ceux qui n'avaient point re\u00e7u de lots continu\u00e9ront comme membres d\u00e9posants (investing members) \u00e0 la diff\u00e9rence de ceux qui avaient re\u00e7u des lots. Laxton, l'un de ceux qui avait pris des lots et continu\u00e9 sa souscription, fut averti comme les autres que la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 ne recevait plus de souscription des membres d\u00e9posants, mais qu'elie les consid\u00e9rerait comme des membres retir\u00e9s. Apr\u00e8s cet avis ii cessa de payer sa souscription et une sentence arbitrale (award) fut prononc\u00e9e contre lui pour la somme de \u00a360-8-4, montant de ses arr\u00e9rages. Sur son refus de payer, une demande fut faite an magistrat pour faire executer la sentence; mais celui-ci refusa de i'accorder. Sur une r\u00e8gle de cour pour ordonner an magistrat d'ex\u00e9cuter la sentence, la cour du Bans de la Reine d\u00e9cida que la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 n'avait pas cess\u00e9 d'exister en consequence de l'achat de terrains, que s'il y avait en emploi illegal des fonds de Ia soci\u00e9t\u00e9, le moyen d'y r\u00e9m\u00e9dier pour les membres qui n'y avaient pas donn\u00e9 leur consentement \u00e9tait de s'adresser \u00e0 la cour de Chancellerie, et que la sentence arbitrale avait \u00e9t\u00e9 due ment prononc\u00e9e. Voici comment s'exprime \u00e0 ce sujet Cockburn, .C.J., ([42]).\nThis was a society registered as a beneflt building society under statute 6 and 7 William 4, c. 32 and according to the rules which have been duly certified subscriptions and fines became payable by Laxton who was a member and he has not paid them.\nThe main answer to the claim of this society is that it has been dissolved. It is that by an arrangement among themselves the members have changed the purposes of this society and converted themselves into a freehold land society, by applying the funds in the purchase of land, and, therefore, the society is put an end to. But that does not follow. If there has been a misappropriation of the funds contributed by the members, that is a case for the intervention of a court of equity on the application of any member who thinks himself aggrieved. But the society does not cease to exist because it does something which its rules do not warrant. A court of equity would restrain the directors from misapplying the money recovered under the award, but so long as the society exists the members are bound by the rules, and the question of an alleged misapplication of its funds is foreign to the magistrate under the statute. It is also said that the resolution of the directors not to call on the investing members for further subscriptions left no shareholders but those participating in the freehold lands scheme. I think that if such a resolution was within the scope of the power of the directors it did not dissolve the society but only made the number of members less than originally contemplated. I think, further, that such a resolution was inoperative and that investing members might insist upon paying up their subscription and getting the benefit of the society, unless they had precluded themselves by concurring in the resolution to treat themselves as withdrawing members. But all these matters are for the consideration of a court of Equity. The magistrate had only to consider, first, whether the society on whose behalf the. application was made was in existence; secondly, whether the person against whom the application was made was a member; and thirdly whether he had become liable, under the rules of the society to pay the sum for which the award was made.\nCrompton, J.:\u2014\nThe converting the society from a benefit building society into a freehold land society is not in the nature of an illegal conspiracy. The society lost certain powers under the act of parliament by which its members received an amount of money to enable them to purchase land, and afterwards arranged amongst themselves that land should be purchased and allotted among them. There is nothing illegal, immoral, or vicious in that, so as to be void i it does not even amount to a contract contrary to the policy of the act. The society could not compel a member to take an allotment instead of money; he would have a right to say: \"I do not claim through this arrangement for allotting the land, but under the rules of the society,\" he traces his title from the arrangement made when he entered the society.\nBlackburn J.: I think it was purposely made the award). How has Lay ton who had become a shareholder taken himself out of the provisions re. the Benefit Building Society Act ? The rules of this society are framed with the view of enabling the members to purchase land. In fact the members have agreed among themselves that, instead of the members receiving money the funds and credit of the society shall be applied in the purchase of a tract of land to be afterwards allotted among them. That was so far illegal that under the rules they had no right to do it: it was a breach of trust. But Layton was a party to that proposal, and agreed to take part of the land so purchased on the terms of his paying his monthly subscriptions as usual. If that agreement had been carried out he would have got an allotment; and would have been the same as if he had paid for it and the society had returned this money to him by way of loan.\nLes raisonnements de ces honorables juges au sujet de la validit\u00e9 des achats de terrain faits contrairement aux dispositions de l'acte 6 et 7 William 4, ch. 32, soit parfaitement applicables \u00e0 cette cause et d\u00e9montrent d'une mani\u00e8re \u00e9videnee que ce qu'il y avait diirr\u00e9gulier dans les proc\u00e9d\u00e9s de l'appelante a \u00e9t\u00e9 couvert par le consentement des actionnaires L'appelante doit \u00eatre renvoy\u00e9e avec d\u00e9pens.\nHENRY J.\u2014I have not written a judgment in this case; but I entirely agree with the Chief Justice and Judge Fournier that this appeal ought to be disallowed for the reasons given by them.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014According to my understanding of the statute by force of which the appellants were author ised to act the contract made by the company for the purchase of the land in question was wholly ultra vires and no action against the company upon that contract can be maintained. The appeal, in my opinion, therefore, should be allowed.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellants: Beique & McGoun.\nSolicitors for respondent: J. Aid.

Ritchie C.J. and Strong Founder Henry and Gwynne JJ\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF QUEEN\u2019S BENCH MANITOBA.\nPermits to cut timber (Man.)\u2014Rights of holders of\u2014Dominion Lands Act, 1879, 47 Vic., ch. 71, sec. 52\u2014Interim Injunction\u2014Damages.\nOn the 21st November, 1881, Sinnott et al. obtained a permit from the Crown Timber Agent, Manitoba, \u201c to cut, take and have for their own use from that part of range 10 E, that extends five miles north and five miles south of the Canadian Pacific Railway track,\u201d the following quantities of timber: 2,000 cords of wood and 25,000 ties, permit to expire on 1st May, 1882, They obtained another permit on the 10th February, 1882, to cut 25,000 ties. In February, 1882, under leave granted by an Order in Council of 27th October, 1881, Scoble et al. cut timber for the purpose of the construction of the Canadian Pacific Railway from the lands covered by the permit of the 21st November, 1881. Sinnott et al. by their bill of complaint claimed to be entitled by their permit to the sole right of cutting timber on said lands until the 1st May, 1882, and prayed that the defendants Scoble et al. might be restrained by injunction from cutting timber on said lands, and might be ordered to account for the value of the timber cut. An interim injunction was granted against Scoble et al. who justified their acts under the Order in Council of the 27th October, 1881, and denied the exclusive possession or title to the lands or standing timber. The injunction was made perpetual by the judge who heard the cause, but, on re-hearing, the judgment was reversed, and it was ordered that an enquiry should be made as to damages suffered by defendants by reason of the issue of the interim injunction at the instance of the plaintiffs. Held, that the decree made on re-hearing by the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench of Manitoba should be affirmed, and that the permit in question did not come within the provisions of the Dominion Lands Act of 1879, and did not vest in Sinnott et al. (the plaintiffs) any estate, right or title in the tract of land upon which they were permitted to cut, nor did it deprive the Government from giving like licenses or others of equal authority to other persons, as long as there was sufficient timber to satisfy the requirements of the plaintiff\u2019s licenses.\nAPPEAL from the judgment given and the decree made by the full Court of Queen\u2019s Bench for Manitoba, reversing the decree made in favor of the appellants by Miller J.\nThe pleadings and evidence are referred to at length in the judgment of Ritchie C.J.\nDalton McCarthy Q.C. for appellants:\nThe question is whether the permits granted by the Department of the Interior to cut timber on Dominion Lands enables licensees to protect their property. The license here is equivalent to a sale of the standing timber, and my first proposition is that having actual possession of this limit with the assent of the Crown, appellants are entitled to exclude trespassers, such as the respondents. Harper v. Charlesworth ([1]); Asher v. Whitlock ([2]); Chambers v. Donaldson ([3]); Gilmour v. Buch ([4]).\nThe recent consolidation of the Dominion Lands Act also shows that the intention was, and is, that these short leases or permits should carry with them the right-to exclusive possession. See Dominion Lands Act, 1883, 47 Vic., ch. 71, sec. 52.\nThe permit gives the appellants leave to cut a certain quantity of timber, and it must be assumed that the Government intended to grant it under statutory powers, because they had no other. If it is held that it must, of necessity, be for a year, the permit should not be held invalid, but that declaration at the end of it which says: \u201cthis permit expires 1st May, 1882,\u201d should be held invalid, as an unauthorized limitation.\nThe appellants were responsible to the Government for damage done to timber on their limit by fire, by provisions of their permit; and the Government could not have intended to allow others on the limit while exacting fulfilment of this provision.\nIn any case they had a right to cut 26,000 ties and 2,000 cords of wood, and further quantity of 25,000 ties under the two permits, and I contend that both permits are perfectly good, but even if the last was not appellants had not cut what they were permitted to cut by the first permit, and were entitled to retain exclusive possession and a choice of locality and timber until all was cut and removed.\nAs to the decree made at the hearing it only directed the continuation of the injunction until the expiry of the plaintiffs permits; but, by mistake, it was drawn so as to continue it indefinitely, and on the settlement of it the defendants\u2019 solicitor raised no objection. The plaintiffs have always been willing, and offered to allow it to be amended in that respect, but the defendants\u2019 counsel did not desire this and said, if you are entitled to an injunction at all that makes no difference.\nHector Cameron Q. C. and T. S. Kennedy for respondents.\nThe plaintiffs bill alleges they were in actual rightful possession of this tract of land, if this fact has not been proved, the bill should be dismissed.\nThe respondents contend then, first, that the appellants have shown no title to the land or timber which would entitle them to interfere with the respondents cutting and removing timber also from the same lauds, and therefore the bill for an injunction will not lie and the appeal must be dismissed.\nAnd second, that they were lawfully cutting and removing timber from off said lands by reason of the agreement with the railway and under rights conferred by the Order in Council\nThe following cases were cited: Carr v. Benson ([5]); Harper v. Charlesworth ([6]).\nDalton McCarthy Q.C. in reply, cited Newby v. Harrison ([7]); Kerr on Injunctions ([8]).\nSir W. J. RITCHIE C. J.\u2014Plaintiffs, by their bill on 1st paragraph, allege that they were in certain and rightful possession of range 10,east of the principal meridian, Province of Manitoba, that extends five miles north and five miles south of the Canadian Pacific Railway track, under and by virtue of a permit to cut timber on Crown Lands issued to plaintiff by Anderson, crown timber agent, by authority of the Minister of the Interior, in accordance with the provisions of the Dominion Lands Act, and are entitled by such permit to the sole right of cutting timber on the said lands until the first of May next.\nIn the second paragraph, that defendants have, from 3rd February, instant, continually, trespassed upon said lands by cutting down and removing timber and trees growing on lands.\nThird paragraph, that defendants continue to threaten and intend to continue to trespass, although requested to desist; have men and teams, cutting and hauling away timber. Plaintiffs pray that defendants may be restrained by injunction and ordered to account and ordered to pay costs and other relief.\nDefendants for answer, say to first paragraph, plaintiffs had a permit to cut on said lands, dated 21st November, 1881, which had been agreed to be given them previous to 1st November, but only to the extent of 2,000 cords of wood and 25,000 ties, and had not sole right to cut timber and other trees on said land.\nAs to the second paragraph of the said bill, we say that by an Order in Council, which is in the words and figures following:\u2014\nCopy of a Report of a Committee of the Honorable the Privy Council, approved by His Excellency the Governor-General in Council, on 1st November, 1881.\nOn a Report dated 2Yth October, 1881, from the Minister of the Interior, submitting an application by the Canadian Pacific Railway Company, for permission to cut ties and timber requisite for the construction of the railway of the territory, lying between Broken Head River and the western boundary of the territory, acquired by the late Government of Canada, from the Indians, under the treaty commonly known as the \u201c Robinson Treaty,\u201d and for a distance throughout of twenty miles in depth on each side of the Canadian Pacific Railway line.\nThe Minister observes that the company represents it experiences difficulty in obtaining the requisite wood for the great extent of railway, which it intends to complete next season.\nThe Minister therefore recommends that the company be given permission to cut timber, for the purposes of construction of the line on any lands belonging to the Dominion, included within the space above described, subject to the payment of dues by the company on each class and kind of timber taken at the rates set forth in the following schedule:\nFence posts, 8 ft. 6 in. long, each, 1 cent. Telegraph poles, 22 ft, long, each, 5 cents; each lineal foot over, 1 cent. Railroad ties, 8 ft. long, each, 3 cents. Rails, 12 ft. long, $2 per M. Stakes, 8 ft. long, each $2 per M. Shingles, 60 cents per ML\nSquare timber and saw logs of oak, elm, ask or maple, $3 B. M.\nPine, spruce, tamarac, cedar and all other woods (except poplar), $2.50 per M.\nPoplar, $2 per M. All other products of the forest, not enumerated, 10 per cent, ad valorem.\nThe committee concur in the above report and submit the same for your Excellency\u2019s approval.\n3. That plaintiffs\u2019 have cut and delivered to railway the said 30,000 ties, and there is standing on the land over and above the amount required to cut the 30,000 ties, trees sufficient to make 75,000 more at least\nThat the Canadian Pacific Railway acquired permission to cut timber on said lands, and defendants contracted with railway company to cut and deliver to them on line of railway between station Ingolf, on the east, and the half-breed line, near the Broken Head river, on the west, 75,000 ties and 4,000 telegraph poles, and railway agreed with defendants that they should have all the rights granted them by Order in Council, reserving to plaintiffs the right to cut ties and other wood to the extent of the contracts, the said railway had entered into with the plaintiffs\u2014the said plaintiffs\u2019 contract, viz,130,000 ties.\n4. Defendants sub-let to Strevel a portion of contract for ties, who sub-let to Trudeau, and he, under instructions from defendants and Strevel entered on land, and cut and hauled away ties, which are the trespasses.\n5. Injunction injurious to defendants, Strevel and Trudeau, and if continued, will prevent defendant from fulfilling contract with railway.\n6. The plaintiff has no right to cut over and above said 30,000 ties, and defendants pray injunction to restrain them from doing so.\nThe following is the permit to cut timber on Crown lands:\nI, James Anderson, Crown Timber Agent, by virtue of power granted to me by the Bight Honorable the Minister of the Interior, do hereby permit M. Sinnott and Company, Winnipeg, Man., to cut and take, and have for his own use from that part of range 10, east, that extends five miles north and (5) fives miles south of the Canadian Pacific Railway tracts, the following quanties of timber:\n2,000 cord of wood, at 25 cents per cord\n$ 500 00\nFence rails, at per 100\n0 00\nFence posts, at do\n0 00\nHouse timber, at per lineal foot\n0 00\n25,000 ties, at 3 cents per tie\n750 00\n$1,250 00\nPermit fee\n0 50\n$1,250 50\n20 per cent, paid\n250 50\n$1,000 00\nAnd I hereby acknowledge the receipt of $250.50 on account. The balance to be paid, and affidavit of the quantity cut, to be made at Crown Timber Office, Winnipeg, on or before the first day of May, 1882. Such permit to be liable to forfeiture for non-fulfilment of any of the conditions set forth in the Order in Council of 17th January 1876, or of this permit, and the holder of this should he not fulfil such conditions, will be subject to the penalties of the Dominion Lands Act, 1879, for cutting without authority.\nGranted under my hand and the seal of the Crown Timber Office, Winnipeg, this twenty-first day of November, 1881.\n(Signed,)\nE. F. STEPHENTON,\nFor Crown Timber Agent.\nThis permit expires 1st May, 1882.\nThis permit extends only to lands owned and in possession of the Crown.\nPERMIT TO OUT TIMBER ON DOMINION LANDS. I, E. F. Stephenson, for Crown Timber Agent, by virtue of power granted to me by the Minister of the Interior and in consideration of the dues hereinafter set forth, do hereby permit Sinnott & Co., of the city of Winnipeg, Manitoba to cut and take and have for their own use or for the purposes of barter or sale from the following described Dominion Lands: That part of Range Ten, East (R. 10, E.); that lying five miles north and five miles south of the Canadian Pacific Railway track, the following quantities of timber: 25,000 ties.\nThe dues on which amount to seven hundred and fifty dollars, and I hereby acknowledge the receipt of one hundred and fifty dollars, on account.\nThe affidavit printed on the back of this permit, showing the quantity cut to be sworn and the balance due thereon to be. paid at Winnipeg on or before the first day of May, 1882.\nThis permit is liable to be forfeited for non-fulfilment of any of the conditions set forth in the Order in Council of 10th October, 1881, or of this permit and the holder of the permit should they not fulfil such conditions, will be subject to the penalties of the Dominion Lands Act, 1879, for cutting without authority.\nGranted under my hand, this tenth day of February, 1882.\n(Signed,) E.

SINNOTT & Co.\nWitness: (Signed,) E, F. STEPHENSON.\nPlaintiffs then put in an agreement between themselves and the Canadian Pacific Railway, dated 3rd January, 1882, whereby plaintiffs agreed to cut and deliver in winter of 1882, on or before 1st May next, 30,000 railway ties and 2,000 cords of wood, to be cut on a certain limit extending west of White Mouth and lying on both sides of the line of the Canadian Pacific Railway.\nThe following evidence was given at the trial:\u2014\nMonkman proves Stephenson was acting Crown timber agent and in sole charge of office.\nPlaintiffs went in to fulfil contracts.

Plaintiffs\u2019 limits are on this. We had all rights of Canadian Pacific Railway, except what had been given, to Stewart and Short. Plaintiffs were not exempted; they applied for it but did not get it till some time after.\nTrudeau says:\u2014\nI am one of the defendants. I know part of this limit. I have known it for two years, there is timber enough there that I have seen on a part of plaintiff\u2019s claim, to make 75,000 to 80,000 ties, and I have not seen all the limit and some I have not seen at all, and a small piece west of a certain line, from the railroad at its southern end, about three miles running north, I have not seen. On the west part of limit, south of railroad, I have not seen at all.\nAnd again he says:\nThere are 15,000 ties that can be got out on corner where I was working.\nW.

Van Home says:\u2014\n25th February, 1882.\nI am General Manager of Canadian Pacific Railway, and have been so since early in December. The defendants have a contract with Canadian Pacific Railway to furnish ties, wood and poles. The Canadian Pacific Railway have a permit to cut on sections 1$ and 14, as per Order in Council. They undertook to supply 75,000 ties, if they were allowed to have the rights of Canadian Pacific Railway on section 15, and as far east on section L4 as Ingolf.\nCross-examination\u2014Nothing was said about Sinnott & Co., or other private rights.\nIn rebuttal\u2014Andrew Mackie knew Sinnott & Co.\u2019s foreman ; says he knows the Sinnott limit pretty well ; I don\u2019t think there are more than 12,00Q ties left.\nJames Jackson:\u2014\nI examined what is left over, and above what Mackie has spoken of; I think there are 6,000 left.\nThis is practically all the evidence in the case. The interim injunction having been continued till the 25th February, on that day the cause came on for judgment, when the following decree was pronounced:\nThis court doth order and decree: That the defendants and their servants, agents and workmen, be restrained from felling, cutting, removing, or otherwise interfering with any timber now being upon the lands in the plaintiffs bill of complaint mentioned, being that part of range 10, east of the principal meridian in the Province of Manitoba, extending five miles north and five miles south from the track of the Canadian Pacific Railway, where it crosses the said range, and that an injunction do issue accordingly.\nThis court doth further order and decree: That it be referred to the Master of this court to take an account of the damage caused to the plaintiffs in consequence of the timber cut by the defendants, or by their authority and direction, and of the value thereof to the plaintiffs and that the defendants do pay such damages to the plaintiffs, when ascertained, forthwith.\nThis court doth further order and decree: That the defendants do pay to the plaintiffs their costs of this suit, and of the interim injunction, and motion to continue the same, forthwith, after taxation thereof by the Master of this court.\nWe are left entirely in the dark as to the reasons which led to the making of this decree, or, indeed, as to whether any reasons were given.\nA re-hearing having been granted before the full court, this decree was reversed by the Chief Justice and Mr. Justice Dubuc, Miller, J., adhering to his original opinion. I cannot discover under what statute, order in council, or legal authority, the permit under which plaintiff claims was issued as this was.\nIf under a legal authority, it did not give the licensee possession of the land covered by the permit, or any interest in all the trees standing on such land; nor did it prevent the Crown from giving a permit to cut on the same land subject to such permit.\nAnd even in my opinion, if this license or permit had been issued under legal authority, it amounted to no more than a mere permission or right to enter on the land and cut the quantity of timber specified in the permit, and gave the licensee no interest in or possession of the land, or exclusive right to cut or property in the standing trees. This permit is entirely different from a license such as that contemplated by the 52nd section of the Dominion Lands Act, which covers all the timber on the land, and gives the licensee the exclusive possession of the and.\nI do not think the plaintiff could complain unless he could show that the holder of the second permit wrongfully interfered with him, and that there was not sufficient to fill the permit and allow any others to cut, and then could he have more than an action on the case. See Beckwith v. McPhelim ([9]).\nLong ago it was held, by the Supreme Court of New Brunswick, that a license to cut timber and remove it from lands does not enure as a grant of the trees until cut under the license. Kerr v. Connell ([10]); and again, that license conveys no interest in the land to the grantee, nor any property in the standing trees. The N. B. & N. S. Land Co. v. Kirk ([11]); Breckenridge v. Woolner ([12]). But it was held that a licensee of Crown land with authority to cut and take away timber may maintain an action on the case against a person wrongfully cutting, in consequence of which the licensee sustains damage. Beckwith v. McPhelim (1).\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nSTRONG J.\u2014I adhere to the judgment of the late Chief Justice of Manitoba in all respects. I think the appellant has shown no title whatever, and that the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nFOURNIER J.\u2014Le permis invoqu\u00e9 par l\u2019appellant n\u2019est pas accord\u00e9 en conformit\u00e9 des dispositions du \u201c Dominion Lands Act of 1879,\u201d et ne conf\u00e8re \u00e0 l\u2019appellant aucun droit de possession \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tendue de terrains sur laquelle il lui \u00e9tait seulement permis de couper du bois de corde, des liens (ties).

HENRY J. concurred.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014The plaintiffs claiming to be in actual and rightful possession of a tract of land twenty miles in length and ten miles in depth, situate in the Province of Manitoba, filed their bill in the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench in Manitoba, alleging that the defendants had trespassed on the said tract of land, and were cutting down and removing there from and applying to their own use, and threatened to continue cutting down, removing and applying to their own use, divers valuable timber trees growing on the said land, and the bill prayed that the defendants might be restrained by injunction from committing the acts aforesaid and other acts of a like nature, and that they may be ordered to account for the value of the timber and other trees cut down, removed and applied to their own use, and for further relief an interim injunction was granted ex parte. The defendants by their answer denied the right and title asserted by the plaintiffs and claimed to have a right to cut the timber they were cutting under authority derived from orders in council of the Privy Council of the Dominion of Canada of equal authority with the right under which the plaintiffs claimed, and they claimed damages for the injury sustained by reason of their work having been stopped by the interim injunction. At the hearing of the case Mr. Justice Miller made a decree that the defendants and their servants agents and workmen be restrained from felling, cutting removing, or otherwise interfering with any timber upon the lands in the bill mentioned, being part of range 10 east of the principal meridian, in the Province of Manitoba, extending five miles north and five miles south from the track of the Canadian Pacific Railway, where it crosses the said range, and that an injunction do issue accordingly; and that it be referred to the master to take an account of the damages caused to the plaintiffs in consequence of the timber cut by the defendants, or by their authority and direction, and the value thereof to the plaintiffs, and that the defendants do pay such damages to the plaintiffs when ascertained. Upon the cause being re-heard by the full court this decree was reversed, and a decree was made in effect dismissing the plaintiffs\u2019 bill with costs, and directing an account to be taken of the loss and damage sustained by the defendants by reason of the interim writ of injunction, and that the plaintiffs should pay to the defendants the amount so to be found due.\nThe plaintiffs appeal from this decree.\nThe title upon which the plaintiffs rested their claim, so far as it is necessary to set it out, is as follows:\u2014([13])\nI am of opinion that this appeal should be dismissed and that the decree pronounced upon the re-hearing should be sustained, and for the reasons stated by the learned judges who constituted the majority of the court and by whom that decree was pronounced, namely: that the permit, under which alone the plaintiffs claim title, neither is or professes to be such an instrument as comes within the provisions of the Dominion Lands Act of 1879, and that it does not vest in the plaintiffs any estate, right, or title in the tract of land upon which they were permitted to cut the quantities of cordwood and ties mentioned, but is and professes to be only a license to the plaintiffs to enter upon the tract in question, arid to enable them to cut thereon the specified quantities of timber mentioned without subjecting them to be treated as trespassers. It gave to the plaintiffs no estate whatever in the land, nor did it deprive the government from giving like licenses or others of equal authority to other persons, whose acting under which, whatever might be their form, the plaintiffs had no right whatever to dispute, so long at least as there was timber growing on the tract more than was sufficient to satisfy the requirements of their own prior license; and there is no pretence that this was not the case here, nor, indeed, did the plaintiffs rest their claim upon any such pretence, but solely upon the ground that, as they contended, the license they had to cut 2,000 cords of wood and 25,000 ties upon a tract of 20 miles long and 10 miles wide, even though it should be covered with timber, vested in the plaintiffs an exclusive right and title, to the possession of the whole of the tract, and to the whole of the timber growing thereon, and to so much, if any, as should be cut by any other person thereon, so long as their license should continue in force which was stated to be only until the 1st May, 1882.\nThe cases relied upon, as decided under the provisions of the Consolidated Statutes of Canada, relating to Crown Timber Licenses issued under that Act, have no bearing whatever upon licenses of the special character of that under which the plaintiffs claim.\nAs to the clause in the decree upon re-hearing, which directs an enquiry before the master, as to the damage sustained by the defendants by reason of the issuing of the interim injunction under the undertaking of the plaintiffs interested therein, I concur in the opinion expressed by Lord Justice Cotton in Smith v. Day ([14]), and in the authority of Novello v. James ([15]) cited by him, decided by Lords Justices Turner and Knight Bruce, the latter of whom, as Vice-Chancellor, was the author of the undertaking as to damages which is inserted in orders for interim injunctions. I am therefore of opinion that the clause should be retained.\nThis case is one which, in my judgment, eminently calls for satisfaction in damages being rendered to the defendants. The plaintiffs have by the claim which they set up, very wantonly, as it seems to me, done great damage to the defendants, and these interim injunctions are, I think, in the courts of this country at least, granted more freely and with less consideration than they would be if it were not considered that they are granted at the whole risk of the plaintiff, in whose interest they are granted as to damages in case upon more mature reflection of the case at the hearing, it should appear that the plaintiff\u2019s right to have had the injunction, cannot be sustained. If a reference as to damages should never be directed, and if it be established that a plaintiff, by giving the undertaking, incurs no responsibility, when the judge grants the injunction by a mistake in law, in a case in which the court, upon mature consideration at the hearing, shall be of opinion that it should not have been granted, these injunctions, which are found so useful in practice, must needs to a great extent fall into disuse, and as observed by Lord Justice Cotton, the courts of first instance will have to deal with those cases in a way in which they ought not to be dealt with. The appeal, in my opinion, should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellants: F. B. Robertson.\nSolicitors for respondents: T. S.

Brunswick Railway Company's line, and such barn was destroyed by fire, caused, as was alleged, by sparks from the defendants' engine. An action was brought to recover damages for the loss of said barn and its contents. On the trial it appeared that the fuel used by the company over this line was wood, and evidence was given to the effect that coal was less apt to throw out sparks. It also appeared that at the place where the fire occurred there was a heavy up-grade, necessitating a full head of steam, and therefore increasing the danger to surrounding property. The jury found that the defendants did not use reasonable care in running the engine, but in what the want of such care consisted did not appear by their finding.\nHeld, reversing the judgment of the court below, that the company were under no obligation to use coal for fuel and the use of wood was not in itself evidence of negligence; that the finding of the jury on the question of negligence was not satisfactory, and that therefore there should be a new trial.\nAppeal from the Supreme Court of New Brunswick, refusing to set aside a verdict for the plaintiff and order a new trial.\nThe facts of the case sufficiently appear in the judgments of the court.\nWeldon Q.C., for appellants. As to the right to use wood in locomotives. See Rex. v. Pease[1]; Falconer v. C. & N. A. R. R.[2]; Toledo R. R. Co. v. Corn[3]; Spaulding v. The Chicago & N. W. R. R. Co.[4]; Collins v N. Y. Central & Hundson R. R. Co.[5]. Ordinary and regular care was taken and proper appliances used. Ball v. G. T. R. Co.[6]; Jeffery v. Toronto & Grey & Bruce R. R. Co.[7]; Freemantle v. London & N. W. R. R.[8].\nGregory, for respondent, relied on Dumnioch v. London & North Staffordshire Ry. Co.[9]; Vaughan v. Taff Vale Ry. Co.[10]; 1 Redfield on Railways[11].\nSir J. W. RITCHIE C. J.\u2014No doubt plaintiff has the right to use his barn as he pleases, but knowing that the Legislature has permitted the running of locomotives on the railway passing his barn, if he chooses to place in his barn combustible materials, and to leave it in such a condition that such combustible materials are exposed to sparks from the engine, though provided with all the usual and requisite appliances for preventing the escape of sparks, and the prevention of accidents, and an accidental spark should ignite such combustible material and cause the destruction of the barn and its contents, the owner must submit to the risk, as a consequence of the Legislature having permitted the use of a dangerous agent; and the question is: Have the defendants used all reasonable precautions and appliances to prevent accidents? It cannot be supposed that the best appliances will absolutely avoid all danger from the emission of sparks; and therefore it behooves parties, through whose premises the railway runs, to understand the risk to which the sanction of the Legislature, in the public and general interest of the country, to the running of locomotives, has subjected them. And, if they choose to leave their property unnecessarily exposed, as in this case, it is their own imprudence, and they must bear the loss.\nI think the fair result of the evidence is, that the fire took place from a spark from the locomotive getting into the hay and igniting it; and if the hay had not been left in the exposed condition it was, the fire would not, in all human probability, have taken place.\nThere was, in my opinion, evidence most proper for the consideration of the jury, as to whether the plaintiff was not guilty of great negligence in placing such a combustible article as hay in a barn so near the railway, with such openings as exposed such combustible material to fire from sparks from passing locomotives.\nI think the correct rule was laid down in Collins v. N. Y. Cen. & Hudson R. R. Co.[12], \"that one whose property is exposed to risk or injury from or by reason of its location, as where it is situated in a position of constant exposure to fire on the side of a railroad, must use such care as prudence would dictate in view of the unavoidable perils to which it is subject.\"\nThe Legislature, then, having allowed the company to run a locomotive on this railway, if parties place combustible materials in such near contiguity to the railway that there is reasonable grounds for believing that they are liable to become ignited from sparks from the locomotive, even though all proper appliances for preventing sparks and all precautions and care are taken, the parties will be liable for contributory negligence if they omit reasonable care on their part to protect their property. Thus, if the plaintiff's barn, when the railway came into operation was, or while locomotives were running is, open, so that under such circumstances sparks would be liable to enter and ignite combustible materials such as hay or straw housed therein, the plaintiff would, in my opinion, be guilty of contributory negligence if he placed such combustible materials in such a barn without having taken the care and precaution of closing the openings through which sparks might enter and lodge in the hay, there being, in my opinion, reciprocal duties as well on those who have combustible material near to the railway as on the railway company to use reasonable care and precaution.\nIn Radley et al v. London & North Western Railway Co.[13], Lord Penzance says:\nThe plaintiff in an action for negligence cannot succeed if it is found by the jury that he has himself been guilty of any negligence or want of ordinary care which contributed to cause the accident.\nBut there is another proposition equally well established, and it is a qualification upon the first, namely, that although the plaintiff may have been guilty of negligence, and although that negligence may, in fact, have contributed to the accident, yet if the defendant could in the result, by the exercise of ordinary care and diligence, have avoided the mischief which happened, the plaintiff's negligence will not excuse him.\nThis proposition, as one of law, cannot be questioned. It was decided in the case of Davies v. Mann[14], supported in that of Tuff v. Warman[15], and other cases, and has been universally applied in cases of this character without question.\nThere is nothing whatever in the judge's charge relative to contributory negligence, though a question is left to the jury on this point. This last question, as appears by the judge's notes, was submitted at Mr. Gregory's request and prepared by him.\nI think there was non-direction (tantamount to misdirection) in not pointing out to the jury the duty of plaintiff, and what would constitute contributory negligence, and stating distinctly to the jury the law in reference thereto. I think the charge defective also, in reference to the fuel used.\nThe Act which allows the use of locomotive engines, necessarily allows the use of such fuel for propelling them as is ordinarily used in the place where the locomotive is run, and if there is a difference as to the emission of sparks in the use of different descriptions of fuel, and there are different recognized precautions in use suitable to each description of fuel, and the precaution applicable to the particular fuel used is adopted, the railway company cannot be held liable for the consequences of a spark escaping and causing damage, no actual negligence being shown on their part. The legislature has sanctioned and authorized the use of dangerous engines, subject to the party using them taking all reasonable precautions. The railway company must use and carry fire along the railway for propelling their engines, and the statute has not limited the company to the description of fuel to be used. If then the company use a well known and ordinary description of fuel, and take all reasonable and known precautions consistent with the use of such fuel, and in spite of such precautions, sparks escape, the company cannot be held liable for the consequences, because they did not use another well known and ordinary description of fuel taking the usual precautions applicable to the use of such fuel. The use of wood cannot be said to be an illegitimate use of the locomotive; if not, and damage results from its use independently of negligence, the party using it cannot be held responsible. In other words, by using wood instead of coal the effect of the legislative authority to run the locomotive is not removed, and they are not left to their liabilities at common law, viz., that of using a highly dangerous machine at the peril of the consequences if it causes injury to others.\nIn the Supreme Court of New Brunswick per Ritchie C.J., in Falconer v. The E. & N. A. Railway Co.[16]:\u2014 \"The fact that an accident has occurred is not of itself \"evidence of negligence, because its occurrence is \"quite consistent with due care having been taken. The \"plaintiff is not entitled to have his case left to the jury \"unless he gives some affirmative evidence of negligence. \"Hammock v. While[17]. In Daniel v. The Metropolitan \"Railway Company[18], Willes, J., says, that to entitle a \"plaintiff to recover in an action for negligence, he must \"establish in evidence circumstances from which it may \"fairly be inferred that there is reasonable probability \"that the, injury resulted from the want of some precaution \"to which the defendant might and ought to have \"resorted.\"\nSee Wharton on Negligence[19]; Sheldon v. The Hudson R. R. R. Co.[20]; Collins v. N. Y. C. & H. R. R. R. Co.[21].\nThe use of coal has not been adopted by reason of its being a safer article of fuel, the use of wood or coal has been determined with reference to economy and convenience. When railways were first established in New Brunswick wood was universally used by locomotives as being the cheapest and most economical fuel. In localities where wood became scarce and dear, and coal more easily obtainable, coal was substituted, so with steamboats in the bay of Fundy and harbor of St. John, coal is universally used; on steamboats plying on the river St. John, wood is generally, if not universally used, and so with reference to fuel in ordinary use in the city of St. John and its neighborhood. The period is not very remote when wood was the fuel in general use, now coal is the article of fuel ordinarily used. In the part of New Brunswick through which this railroad runs (with the exception of the city of Fredericton and its immediate vicinity,) wood ever has been and is the general ordinary fuel of the country.\nJune is by no means a month in New Brunswick characterized by excessive drouth.\nRailroad companies having used all proper care to guard against accident, if injuries occur, they are damnum absque injuria.\nThe appeal should, in my opinion, be allowed with costs.\nSTRONG J.\u2014Although a motion for a non-suit was made at the trial and over-ruled, leave to move to enter a non-suit was not reserved. Two of the objections to the directions of learned judge specified in the notice of motion are as follows, viz: 1. That there was misdirection in not instructing the jury that there was no evidence that the barns of the plaintiff caught fire from the locomotives of the defendant. 2. That if there was any evidence that they did so catch fire, then the learned judge should have fold the jury that there was no evidence to submit to them as to negligence on the part of the defendants in the running of their train or locomotive on the day in question, and therefore the defendants were not liable for the loss. The only evidence to show that the fire was caused by sparks from the defendants' locomotive was that on the day on which the fire occurred a train passed along the railway, and a short time afterwards the respondent's barns, situated about 200 feet from the line of railway, were discovered to be on fire. In the absence of authority I should have doubted if this was sufficient to make a case for the consideration of the jury upon the question of the origin of the fire. I should have thought it not sufficient to prove that the fire might have originated from the sparks thrown out of the locomotive, but that the plaintiff was bound to prove something further to connect the fire with the passage of the engine. In Freemantle v. N. W. Ry. Co.[22] such evidence was, however, held sufficient to make a prim\u00e2 facie case for the consideration of the jury. But from this case I should have thought the plaintiff was bound at least to have given some evidence to show there was no other probable cause to which the fire might have been ascribed; but, assuming there was evidence for the jury, and that they were warranted in their finding as to the origin of the fire, I am of opinion that the plaintiff was bound to go further and give some evidence of negligence, such as the omission to use all proper and reasonable means to arrest the sparks by means of known contrivances for that purpose, and that in the absence of all proof of negligence the onus was not cast upon the defendant of proving that they had adopted and used such precautions; in other words, that it was for the plaintiff to make out his case in the first instance by proving negligence in such a case as the present, as in all other cases of action for negligence. The only evidence of negligence given by the plaintiff was that so strongly relied on by the learned counsel for the respondent at this bar, that the defendants were guilty of actionable negligence in having used wood instead of coal for fuel. It was shown that the locomotive was one adapted for the use of wood. So that the question is just reduced to this: Is a railway company guilty of negligence in burning wood instead of coal in a country in which wood is a kind of fuel in common use? I cannot agree that this is any evidence of negligence. If it were, a railway company would be bound to consume coals as fuel when procurable, though involving a much greater outlay than the use of wood\u2014a proposition so unreasonable as to be wholly untenable. If the fuel used was of an unusual or dangerous kind, then there would be no doubt prim\u00e2 facie grounds for imputing want of care, but when it is of a kind in common use for railway purposes, as in the present case, numerous American authorities show that railway companies are justified in using it.\nI am not able to concur in the view that contributory negligence on the part of the plaintiff was shown by the fact that he maintained his barns in a dangerous proximity to the railway. I apprehend that a landowner has a right to make any use of his land he pleases, and is entitled to be protected in that use against injury from the culpable negligence of others. Upon this point I refer to Fero v. Buffalo, &c., Ry. Co.[23]; Grand Trunk Ry. v. Richardson[24].\nI am of opinion that a rule for a new trial without costs should have been granted, and that this appeal must consequently be allowed with costs.\nFOURNIER J. concurred.\nHENRY J.\u2014This is an action to recover damages alleged to have been sustained by the setting fire to and burning of the respondent's sheds, barns and buildings by means of sparks of fire which issued from a locomotive railway engine of the appellants while passing the premises of the respondent, and it is charged that the same was caused by the negligence and unskilful working of the railway, and the locomotive used thereon and the negligent and unskilful management of the appellants and their servants of the locomotive engine, and the fire and burning matter therein contained; and it was alleged that the locomotive engine was so insufficiently constructed that sparks from the fire therein and portions of the burning matter escaped from the locomotive engine and set on fire and burnt the sheds, barns and buildings, together with certain hay, farming utensils, plant, tools and goods of the respondent. The appellants pleaded that they were not guilty. The appellants, by their charter, were authorized to contract for and equip and operate certain lines of railway, including the one in question.\nThe jury having found that the respondent's barns were burned by means of sparks from the appellants' engine, I do not consider it necessary to question the correctness of their finding. The law is fully settled that where legislative sanction is given to the use of locomotive engines, there is no liability for any injury caused by their use if every known means are adopted to prevent the escape of fire from them and necessary precaution is taken consistent with their ordinary use. As a reasonable result of the evidence the court below did not find, and I think properly, that there was want of any of the necessary precautions on the part of the appellants, and that every means in their power had not been used to prevent the escape of sparks from their engine, but founded their judgment solely on the fact that during the very dry weather at the time the fuel used was wood, and that coal should have been used as not so dangerous or likely to set fire to property on the line. In one of the questions submitted to the jury: \"Did the defendants use reasonable care and caution in the material used for fires on the day in question?\" They answered: \"No, they did not, considering the surroundings, the state of the weather, the season of the year, the state of the country along the line, the dryness of the material and its then liability to ignite flame from sparks.\" To another question: \"What is the ordinary material used in the country\u2014that is wood or coal?\" They answered: \"If for domestic purposes wood, locomotives wood and coal.\" In answer to the question: \"Was the fire caused by the negligence of the defendants?\" They answered: \"Yes,\" but did not point out wherein the negligence consisted. In answer to another question: \"Supposing the jury arrived at the conclusion that fire was caused by sparks from the engine, and that sparks caused the damage, do the jury find that though wood was used, if reasonable care was used, the fire might and likely would not have occurred?\" They answered: \"Yes\" And to the question: \"Supposing wood was the proper fuel, was the running of the engine conducted with reasonable care?\" They answered: \"No.\" Notwithstanding all these questions and answers, it does not appear to me that the findings amount to negligence, for which the appellants would be answerable. The want of reasonable care suggested in the last two questions is in no way definite. It might mean want of care in running with an engine not properly constructed to prevent the emitting of fire or sparks, or it might be the want of care in the use of the engine. I think the court below was right in not founding their judgment upon such vague findings, particularly under the evidence. The judgment is founded on the proposition that if fuel of wood is more likely to do injury than fuel of coal, a railway company must be held to use the former at the peril and risk of paying damages for all injuries occasioned thereby which would not have had happened had coal fuel been used There are many objections to such a ruling, and one, a practical one, which would be the difficulty of determining the question. It is known that what are called hoods are used near the top of every locomotive smoke-stack to prevent egression of lighted sparks, and if those used where wood is the fuel were placed on smoke-stacks for coal they would clog up and the draft would be practically destroyed; and if those intended for coal were used with fuel of wood, the sparks would not be restrained. I take it that if the proper hood is used for coal or wood, as the case. may be, and still an injury is done by the emission of sparks, the company is not answerable. The use of wood for fuel in railway engines is not unlawful, but greater precautions are necessary in regard to the sparks. Being lawful if properly used it may be so used at all times with impunity, and the only obligation imposed by law is to use the proper and well-known precautionary measures and means. There is no evidence that such were not used and employed in this case. To entitle the plaintiff to recover, in an action such as the present, he must prove negligence by showing the proper preventive means were not used on the occasion. In this case he has not done so, and it would be a wrong and and dangerous course to leave the rights of parties to be dealt with and decided upon by the speculative decision of a jury on the probable results of the use of wood instead of coal\u2014I cannot find any precedent for such a submission, and I can discover no principle to sustain it. The law governing cases of this kind, is founded on the immunity awarded to those using locomotive engines on railways, and they have the right at all times, and at all seasons of the year, and in every state of the railway surroundings to use wood for fuel, and they cannot be charged as for negligence for doing what the law permits. The jury found that for locomotives wood as well as coal was the ordinary fuel. I take it a railway company can legally use either at its option, and with the proper precautionary means and appliances can legally use the one as well as the other, and with the same immunity from the consequences of damages done to the property of others.\nI think the judgment appealed from should be reversed and a new trial granted with costs.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014This is an action brought by the plaintiff against the New Brunswick Railway Company as defendants, to recover compensation for a barn and contents, alleged to have burned by sparks of fire permitted to escape from an engine of the defendants through the negligence, as was said, of the defendants and of their servants. The negligence charged in the declaration, as it was when amended at the trial, is thus stated:\u2014\nYet the defendants and their servants not regarding their duty, so negligently and unskilfully built, used and worked the said railway, and the locomotive used thereon, and managed the said locomotive, and the fire and burning matter therein contained, and the said locomotive engine was so insufficiently constructed, that sparks from the said fire and portions of the said burning matter escaped and flew from the said locomotive engine, to and upon the sheds, barns and buildings of the plaintiff, whereby the same, with their contents, were burned, and destroyed to the plaintiff, damages of $250.\nAt the trial the plaintiff tendered evidence for the purpose of establishing that wood (which was the fuel burned in the engine from which the sparks which set fire to the plaintiff's building were said to have proceeded) emitted more sparks than coal. Evidence of this nature was objected to as inadmissible, but was received, and the case as the evidence proceeded was chiefly rested upon the contention that the defendants should for this reason have used coal instead of wood, and that the use of wood under the circumstances was, therefore, such negligence as rendered the defendants liable in this action. The defendants produced evidence to establish that the engine was quite new and was furnished with the best apparatus to arrest the escape of sparks therein and in use in wood burning engines, which this engine was. This evidence was not much questioned, the case for the plaintiff having been rested upon the use of wood instead of coal, and the fact that when passing the plaintiffs place a great pressure of steam was used, the consequence of such increased pressure being to cause more sparks to be emitted than happens under a light head of steam. This latter point was met by the defendants showing that the grade there was steep and an ascending grade to draw the train up which a greater pressure of steam was necessary. There were several objections taken by the defendants' counsel to the evidence offered by the plaintiff, and which was received by the learned judge who tried the case, for the purpose of establishing (as there was no direct evidence upon the point) that the fire which burned the plaintiff's building proceeded from the engine which had passed along the railway close to the plaintiff's barn immediately before the fire broke out, but all that evidence was, I think, clearly admissible. It was also objected by the defendants' counsel that the learned judge wrongly rejected evidence offered by him to show that the plaintiff's property destroyed by the fire had been insured in an insurance office, and that he had been paid for his loss by the insurers, but that evidence was, I think, rightly rejected. The defendants' counsel also desired to put questions to the witnesses under examination for the purpose of obtaining evidence that wood was the fuel in ordinary use upon railways in New Brunswick, This evidence was rejected, but, in my opinion, was admissible and proper to be taken into consideration by the jury upon the question whether the use of wood on the engine in question without more, and in the absence of all other negligence, was, in the opinion of the jury, such negligence as should make them responsible in this action, and more especially was it material upon one of the questions submitted by the learned judge to the jury, namely, \"What is the ordinary material used in the country, that is, wood or coal?\" The learned judge, in submitting the case to the jury, told them that the plaintiff was not entitled to recover unless the damage of which he complained was caused by the negligence of the defendants, and that the plaintiff must establish this negligence to the satisfaction of the jury. He told them further that the defendants had a right to run their railway, but that they must use all proper appliances, care and diligence in working their trains, so as not to do damage to the people through whose property their line passes. This care, he said, extended as well to the construction of all the machinery as to the fuel used. He told them that the mere fact of sparks from the engine igniting the plaintiff's property, does not fix liability on the defendants to pay damages; that there must be negligence on the part of the defendants, and that it was incumbent on the plaintiff to establish this negligence, and that if not proved to their satisfaction the defendants were entitled to succeed. With this charge, as far as it goes, it must, I think, be admitted that the defendants have no just ground of complaint, but it fails to draw the attention of the jury to the points upon which the plaintiff relied as establishing, and upon which the jury were to say whether, in their opinion, under all the circumstances bearing upon the point he had established, that the defendants were guilty of, and, if any, of what, negligence to justify the jury in rendering a verdict against them in this action. The learned judge, however, together with the above charge, submitted certain questions to the jury, and among them the following:\u2014\n1. Did the defendants use reasonable care and caution in the material used for fires on the day in question?\n2. Did the defendants use reasonable care and caution in the material used for firing purposes?\n3. What is the ordinary material used in the country, that is, wood or coal?\n4. Could the defendant have reasonably procured coal instead of wood at the time?\n5. Was the fire caused by the negligence of the defendants?\n6. Would the use of coal have materially reduced the risk of fire?\n7. Supposing the jury arrive at the conclusion that the fire was caused by sparks from the engine, and that the issue of sparks caused the damage, do the jury find that though wood was used, if reasonable care was used, the fire might not, and likely would not, have occurred?\n8. Supposing wood was the proper fuel, was the running of the engine that day conducted with reasonable care?\nThe two first of the above questions which appear to be one and the same, are, as it seems to me, susceptible of two constructions, and which was intended does not very clearly appear, namely,\u2014whether the use of wood, as the material to create the motive power, constituted in itself without more a want of reasonable care and caution, or whether there was a want of reasonable care and caution in the manner in which the wood was used upon the particular engine in question. If this latter was what was intended it would have raised a question, material no doubt, but one which was scarcely suggested at the trial, namely, whether the engine was or not supplied with all proper appliances and contrivances for arresting the escape of sparks, and upon that point the jury should have been asked directly whether the defendants had been guilty of any, and, if any, of what negligence in that particular. If the former was what was intended, then, I think, the question should have been accompanied with some direction explanatory of the circumstances which would make the use of wood as the material for creating the motive power to constitute, if it would constitute, want of reasonable care and caution. To these questions the jury answer in, as it appears to me, a very vague and unsatisfactory manner, not pointing at all to what they considered to be that want of reasonable care and caution which they find to have existed. In the question, as expressed in the first of the above formulas they answer: \"No, they did not, considering the surroundings, the state of the weather, the season of the year, the state of the country along the line, the dryness of the material and its then liability to ignite flame from sparks.\" And to the question as put in the second of the above formulas they simply, answer \"No;\" but what it was that in the opinion of the jury the defendants neglected to do, which they ought to have done, or did which they ought not to have done, which in the view of the above circumstances detailed in their answer they considered to constitute the want of due care, there is no suggestion whatever, so as enable the court to judge whether there was any evidence to support such finding, or to justify a verdict against the defendants, a point of great importance, especially as it appears to me in this description of action, in which the known tendency of juries is so great to render verdicts against railway companies under the influence of sympathy with the plaintiff, instead of in accordance with the facts established in evidence.\nTo the third of the above questions they replied: \"If for domestic purposes wood\u2014for locomotives wood and coal;\" thereby establishing that wood is a material ordinarily in use in New Brunswick for creating motive power in locomotive engines.\nTo the 4th and 6th of the above questions they answer \"yes.\"\nNow, although coal could have been procured by the defendants, as found by the jury in answer to the 4th of the above questions, and although the use of coal might have materially reduced the risk of fire, it by no means follows as a conclusion of law, that the use of wood upon a railway, which for its entire length passes, as was said in the evidence, through a wooded country, where wood is procurable at every station, and which the jury by their answer to the third of the above questions, have found to be a fuel in ordinary use upon locomotives in New Brunswick, is in itself (even though the best appliances known to science and to practical experience to arrest sparks are used, and the utmost care in managing the engine is taken) such negligence as entitles the plaintiff to recover in this action. Whether the defendants were or not guilty of negligence, is a matter of fact to be expressly found by the jury, and what is the particular act or default, which in the opinion of the jury constitutes negligence in each case, should be clearly found and not be left in doubt, for what the jury might rely upon as constituting negligence, the law might pronounce not to be. In cases of this nature, therefore, there should be no doubt as to the acts or defaults which the jury in each case rely upon as constituting the negligence which subjects the defendants to liability. In the present case the answers of the jury leave in the utmost doubt what it is that they rely upon as constituting the negligence of which the defendants are guilty. If they meant that the mere use of wood instead of coal without more, constituted the negligence relied upon, the effect of that finding would be to pronounce it to be illegal for the defendants to use wood-burning engines at all, unless at the risk of insuring all persons against damage by fire escaping from such engines, even though the best possible appliances should be used and the utmost care should be taken to prevent the escape of sparks, and this is a proposition which cannot, I think, receive any countenance in a wooded country described as New Brunswick is to be throughout the entire length of the railway. But the jury do not say, as matter of fact, that this is the negligence of which they find the defendants to be guilty, and that they did not mean to find it to be so would appear from their answer to the 7th of the above questions, in which, by answering the question simply in the affirmative, they, in effect, say, in the words of the question, that though wood was used, if reasonable care was used, the fire might, and likely would, not have occurred. Now, what the want of care here referred to is, is not suggested; all that is said is that if something, not stated what, had been done, or it may mean that if something, not stated what, had not been neglected to be done, it is likely, but not clear, that the fire might not have occurred. The jury do not find any defect in the appliances used to arrest sparks; during the trial that point was scarcely questioned by the plaintiff; they do not find any want of care in the management of the engine to which they find that the fire was attributable. So likewise in their answer to the 8th question, while by answering \"no\" to the question as put to them they in effect find that even supposing wood to have been proper fuel, still that the running of the engine that day was not conducted with reasonable care, but what want of care they find to have existed and whether it consisted of omission or commission there is not the slightest suggestion. Such answers, finding nothing definitely and leaving in the greatest uncertainty what the jury intended to find to have been done by the defendants which ought not to have been done, or to have been omitted to be done which ought to have been done, are, in my opinion, altogether too loose, vague and uncertain to support a verdict against the defendants. As then the jury has not found that there was or whether there was or not any defect in the construction of the engine used upon the occasion of the fire occurring as a wood burning engine, nor any want of proper appliances to arrest the escape of sparks, or any defect in the appliances which were used for that purpose which could and should have been avoided, and as, in my opinion, the mere fact that more sparks are liable to escape from wood than from coal does not make the use of wood as a motive power negligence subjecting the defendants to liability, and as there is so much doubt appearing upon the answers of the jury to the questions put to them, as to what they intended to find to have been done or omitted to be done by the defendants, which constituted negligence subjecting them to liability to the plaintiff, I think the case should be remitted to another jury, who should be required to state what is the particular negligence, if any, of which they shall find the defendants to have been guilty; and that the appeal should be allowed with costs, and a new trial.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellants: Weldon, McLean & Devlin.\nSolicitor for respondent: John C.

The following questions inter alia, were submitted to the jury, and the following answers given:\u2014\nQ. Was the fire occasioned by sparks from the locomotive? A. Yes.\nQ. If so, was it caused by any want of care on the part of the company or its servants, which, under the circumstances, ought to have been exercised? A. Yes.\nQ. If so, state in what respect; you think greater care ought to have been exercised? A. As it was a special train and on Sundays, when employees were not on duty, there should have been an extra hand on duty.\nQ. Was the smoke stack furnished with as good apparatus for arresting sparks as was consistent with the efficient working of the engine? If you think the apparatus was defective, was it by reason of its not being the best kind, or because it was out of order? A. Out of order.\nAnd P. obtained a verdict for $800.\nOn motion to set aside the verdict, the Queen's Bench Division unanimously sustained the verdict.\nOn appeal to the Supreme Court, Held, affirming the judgment of the court below, Henry J. dissenting,\u2014\n1. That the questions were proper questions to put to the jury, and that there was sufficient evidence of negligence on the part of the appellants' servants to sustain the finding. 2. If a railway company are guilty of default in the discharge of the duty of running their locomotives in a proper and reasonable manner, they are responsible for all damage which is the natural consequence of such default, whether such damage is occasioned by fire escaping from the engine coming directly in contact with and consuming the property of third persons, or is caused to the property of such third persons by a fire communicating thereto from the property of the railway company themselves, which had been ignited by fire escaping from the engine coming directly in contact therewith.\n3. The statute 14 Geo. 3 ch. 78 sec. 86, which is an extension of 6 Anne ch. 31 secs. 6 and 7 is in force in the Province of Ontario as part of the law of England introduced by the Constitutional Act 31 Geo. 3 ch. 31, but has no application to protect a party from legal liability as a consequence of negligence.\nAppeal, by consent of parties, under the 27th section of the Supreme and Exchequer Court Act, brought directly to the Supreme Court from a judgment of the Queen's Bench Division of the High Court of Justice for Ontario discharging an order nisi asking that a nonsuit should be entered or judgment for the defendants, or for a new trial upon grounds set forth in the order nisi.\nThe action was brought by the plaintiff in the Queen's Bench Division of the High Court of Justice for Ontario to recover damages for the loss of her buildings in the village of Chippewa, which were destroyed by fire on the 24th of July, 1881.\nThe plaintiff's statement of claim alleged that her buildings caught fire from a conflagration which was negligently allowed to spread from the defendant's buildings, namely, a freight house, owing to carelessness and negligence on the part of the defendants, and that these buildings of the defendants had been set fire to owing to the carelessness and negligence of the defendants, from a train passing over the railway of the defendants.\nThe fire spread and consumed a number of buildings in the village of Chippewa for the loss of which a number of actions were brought, in which it was agreed that the liability of the defendants should be determined by the result of this action.\nThe cause was tried before Mr. Justice Patterson and he put the following questions to the jury, which were answered as appears below:\u2014\nQ.\u2014Was the fire occasioned by sparks from the locomotive? A\u2014Yes.\nQ\u2014If so, was it caused by any want of care on the part of the company or its servants, which, under the circumstances, ought to have been exercised? A\u2014Yes.\nQ\u2014If so, state in what respect you think greater care ought to have been exercised? A\u2014As it was a special train and on Sunday, when employees were not on duty, there should have been an extra hand on duty.\nQ\u2014Was the smoke-stack furnished with as good apparatus for arresting sparks as was consistent with the efficient working of the engine? If you think the apparatus was defective, was it by reason of its not being of the best kind, or because it was out of order? A\u2014Out of order.\nQ\u2014Was there anything in the working of the engine which, under the circumstances, was improper, and what was it? A\u2014In our opinion should not have put on such a heavy pressure of steam, passing the freight house and other buildings, owing to the dry feather at that time.\nQ\u2014Was the state of the freight house such as, under the circumstances, and with reasonable regard to safety from passing trains, ought to have been permitted? A\u2014No.\nVerdict for plaintiff, $800,00.\nThe order nisi asking that a nonsuit should be entered, or judgment for the defendants or for a new trial was on the following grounds:\u2014 1. That there was no evidence given by the plaintiff, of legal evidence of negligence by the defendants upon any of the grounds of negligence relied upon by the plaintiff in support of the alleged liability of the defendants in this action.\n2. That any damages shown, were too remote and not caused by any such negligence of the defendants, as they are in law liable for.\n3. That by virtue of the Act 14, George III., ch. 78, sec. 86, the defendants are exempted from any liability to this action or\n4. For a new trial upon the ground that the finding of the jury on the several questions submitted to them by the learned Judge, is contrary to law and evidence, and for the misdirection of the learned Judge in holding that there was legal evidence to support the same, and also to the weight of evidence at the said trial.\nThe evidence as to the carelessness and negligence of the defendants while running a special train passing their freight shed at Chippewa station, is reviewed in the judgment of Sir W. J. Ritchie C.J. hereinafter given.\nH. Cameron Q.C. and Kingsmill for the appellants contended: 1st. That the defendants are exempted from liability by Act 14 Geo. 3 ch. 78 sec. 86, and cited in addition to cases reviewed in the judgments of the court Richards v. Easto[1]; Dean v. McCarty[2]; McCallum v. G. T. R.[3].\nAnd 2nd. That defendants are not liable for loss caused to a building or property detached and removed at such a distance as the plaintiff's from the defendant's property, on which latter a fire accidentally originated which spread without negligence on the part of the defendants to the plaintiff's property. Ryan v. N. Y. Central Ry. Co.[4] is exactly in point. Also, Pennsylvania R. R. Co. v. Kerr[5].\n3rd. There was no evidence given by the plaintiff of legal negligence.\nCiting inter alia Daniel v. Metropolitan R. R. Co.[6]; Williams v. G. W. Ry. Co.[7]; Hill v. O. S. & H. Ry. Co.[8].\nBethune Q.C. for respondent, contended:\nThat the statute 14 Geo. III. ch. 78 sec. 86 did not apply.\nThat the appellants were liable in three ways:\u2014\n1st. That it was negligence to have had the freight shed in the state in which it was, owing to the dryness of the season and the close proximity of the track to the door, and that having negligently kindled fire in the freight house, the appellants were liable for its extension to the respondent's buildings.\n2nd. That there was negligence in the construction of the screen of the smoke stack in question, because it was proved very clearly that a great shower of sparks came from the smoke stack and fell upon the platform, and that this could not have happened if the screen had been in proper order. The jury have found the screen was out of order, and the evidence of the witnesses amply sustains their finding.\n3rd. That the locomotive was negligently managed in this, that there was great haste on the part of the engineer to get up speed rapidly, and that he worked the engine in such a way as to throw an unusual shower of sparks while passing the freight shed in question, which, owing to the dryness of the season and other matters, was gross negligence, and so the appellants are liable for the improper management by the engineer on the occasion in question. The cases relied on by counsel are reviewed in the judgments of the court.\nSir W. J. RITCHIE C.J.\u2014The following questions inter alia were put to the jury:\u2014\nWas the fire occasioned by sparks from defendant's locomotive? To which the jury answered. Yes. Then if so was it caused by any want of care on the part of the company or its servants, which under the circumstances ought to have been exercised? The jury answer. Yes. And being asked to state in what respect greater care ought to have been exercised, the jury say that as it was a special train on Sunday when employees were not on duty there should have been an extra hand on duty.\nThen come crucial questions:\u2014Was the smokestack furnished with as good apparatus for arresting sparks as was consistent with the efficient working of the engine? If you think the apparatus was defective, was it by reason of its not being of the best kind or because it was out of order? To which the jury answer. Out of order.\nIf there was evidence to support the first and last findings, viz:\u2014That the fire was caused by the defendant's locomotive and that the apparatus of the smokestack for arresting sparks was out of order, the case against the defendants would be established.\nI think the irresistible inference from the evidence clearly establishes that the fire in the shed was caused by sparks from the defendants' locomotive. There was nothing whatever to shake the evidence of the boys, present on the passing of the train; on the contrary all the surrounding circumstances confirm what they said, and the jury evidently believed their testimony, and no reasonable hypothesis has been suggested that the fire in the shed could have been ignited in any other way. If then the testimony of the boys is to be accepted as true, there was evidence from which negligence might be inferred proper to submit to the jury.\nThere was no motion for a non suit, which indicates that defendants assumed there was such evidence in plaintiff's case, but whatever question there may be as to that, the evidence drawn from the defendants' witnesses supplied any deficiency there may have been in the plaintiff's case.\nMr. Domville\u2014recalled, says:\nQ. This is established as the actual screen on the locomotive on the day in question; will you look at it and say what that screen represents in reference to your knowledge of the screens of locomotives used on the Great Western Road? A. Well, it is a fair ordinary screen; I would not consider it a first class One. I would think a screen with several holes in it like that, I would have darned it. I have seen better screens and I have seen a great deal worse. Of course it might have got worn after removing it; the cross wire.\nQ. In regard to the general character of the screen, how would it compare in its mesh and general arrangement with the screens used by the Great Western? A. It would compare favourably with the screens we have been in the habit of using.\nQ. Are there any other screens which would be different from this screen in coal burning locomotives? A. No. The wood burning screen is smaller. I would not have been afraid to run that screen on a train for a short time longer, even in its present state. I would not have condemned the screen for the state it is in now. Without darning, I mean, I would have run that another week rather than stop an engine, and then I would have taken the first opportunity of repairing it.\nQ. Assuming that this screen was removed it was still worth repairing? A. Yes. There is quite enough substance in it which when repaired would answer it still. This would last at least another month, or perhaps five or six weeks.\nQ. In connection with your duties, is there any particular reason why the actual condition of a screen like this should be examined into from time to time? A. We cannot afford to throw away screens, and we exercise due caution in having them darned from time to time. It is greater economy to repair them from time to time than to let them get in such a state that they are beyond repair. You might get a big hole in one side.\nQ. A stitch in time saves nine? A. Yes, that would be the case with this. Q. They are expensive? A. Yes, that would cost about four dollars to put on an engine. It makes a considerable difference in the expense of running trains.\nQ. And what is the ordinary duration of a screen like this? A. From two and a half to three months; and it depends on the material, whether it is really good or not, and as to whether the manufacturer has given you bona fide steel, or put some iron in. What we look for is steel. We pay steel price for it.\nCross-examined: Q.I suppose in very dry weather, when everything is ready to go off like tinder, you would probably be more careful about the meshes of the smoke stacks than in winter? A. We always are, and for that reason our practice to tell the forman to be careful in examining them. Especially in dry weather.\nQ. I see some holes down there; that would emit a pretty large spark? A. Yes. A spark getting through that might set fire to a building in a very short time. Our cones for coal burning engines are as near as possible like that one on plan 4. Ours might possibly have a little more lip. The more lip you have to a cone the less likelihood there is of a spark being driven against the wire. If the whole force came against the wire, it would soon wear the netting through.\nQ. Supposing the cone became displaced so that there was more action on this wire, it would be very much more likely to get through? A. Yes.\nQ. Suppose you found a shower of sparks coming in such a manner that a bare-footed boy had to dance about to get away from them, would not that indicate there was an imperfect mesh? A. If the man had been firing with very small coal, and put it on in a hurry, he might get a shower of sparks like that.\nQ. That shower would be dangerous if it fell on combustible material? A. No doubt. There would be a chance of a blow up if such sparks fell where there had been coal oil.\nQ. Of course a driver in going past a freight house in a villlage ought to be more careful than in the open country? A. Well, I think a man might use a little caution in passing through stations and places like that.\nQ. It would be a very hazardous thing to fire up with small coal in passing by such a place as this in question? A. I do not think a man should do it.\nQ. Can you conceive a shower of sparks coming through a perfect mesh from any other cause than by firing in that way\u2014throwing in small coal? A. Oh, a man might do it by throwing his engine over, and putting on steam in a hurry, and so lift the coal; it is quite possible he might do that. Or if an engine starting away with a train should slip a good deal it might throw such sparks.\nQ. To do that would be dangerous in the proximity of a station? A. Well, that cannot be avoided sometimes in starting. He might do that while he was running, but I do not think any man would go to do that. If he did do that it would be very dangerous.\nQ. So that the sparks could come from the defective netting and also from the defective netting and bad management, as well from one as from the other? A. Yes.\nQ. Do you think you would undertake to run that covering the way it is now in a dry time? A. Yes, I think I would.\nQ. You do not think you would be in great danger of burning the country up? A. There would be more danger than with a perfect netting, of course.\nCharles K. Domville, sworn:\nQ. What is your profession? A. Locomotive engineer.\nQ. In what position are you now? A. I am locomotive superintendent of the Great Western. Division of the Grand Trunk Railway, and I have been for the last six and a half years locomotive superintendent of the Great Western Railway.\nQ. Have you had experience prior to that, practical experience upon railways? A. Yes, I have had charge of the locomotive department of railways since 1851.\nQ. Are you acquainted with the mode of construction of locomotive engines used upon Canadian railways? A. I am.\n(Plan Produced, which was afterwards Marked as Exhibit 4.)\nQ. Perhaps you can give me some of the chief particulars; I have got here what is supposed to be a sort of section of the smoke-stack on the locomotive; what are the chief requisites of a smoke stack in connection especially with the ordinary and usual means which are used to prevent the emission of sparks through the firing up of locomotives? A. The principal things are as shown upon the drawing, the netting across the top and the cone in the centre. This netting is made of fine wire mesh; it is made of different sizes. There is very little difference in them, some people use larger wire than others, and the opening in some is less than others. That inverted cone is for the purpose of the sparks striking against it and returning them into the smoke-box, and it destroys them to such an extent that when sparks are emitted out, the fire is out of them, and they are very little when they do come out. The first result of the firing up is to drive the chief stream under that cone. That cone is so constructed that it carries the whole body with it at first; the whole of the sparks strike that at once. They strike the covering of the cone; there are an immense number of sparks get stuck in the net ting and are returned into the smoke-box. The chief volume of sparks are arrested in their escape by the cone and then thrown back and fall into the smoke-box.\nQ. And reach that in a much smaller condition that they were? A. Yes, very much smaller, the cone breaks the force of the volume which is emitted.\nQ. And also breaks the different sparks into smaller portions? A. Yes, it has that effect. And then they are thrown back into the smoke-box, a great many of them rest there.\nQ. What proportion rests there and are not carried off with the smoke? A. Sometimes there is a very large proportion there; it all depends upon the working of the engine. Those are cleaned out at the end of the journey below.\nQ. Everything which is capable of passing through the screen goes off there in smoke, the small particles? A. Very small particles.\nJames H. Rushton, foreman of the boiler making at St. Thomas:\nQ. What experience have you had in the making of these screens? A. About 12 years.\nQ. Suppose you were perfectly satisfied that a shower of sparks, such as described by these little boys, you would think from that that there must be something wrong with the netting? A. If I saw them myself, I would.\nQ. What would you think was wrong with the netting? A. I would think there were some holes in the netting. I should think there was not any netting there at all.\nQ. Do you think the managing of the engine could have anything to do with that? A. It might.\nQ. Do you think a man could get the fire so shaken up as to send out a shower of sparks like that, either by stirring up his fire or putting on steam? A. Oh, it might throw out a little more.\nQ. That would be very dangerous in passing a station where everything was dry? A. Yes.\nQ. And you think it would be dangerous to run with a netting that would throw out a shower of sparks as described by these boys? A. I should think so.\nQ. You could have a netting to prevent sparks coming out such as described by these boys? A. Yes, if there was any netting at all I do not think sparks such as described by them could come out. If the holes were twice as big as they are now they would not even then get out in such a shower as the boys have described.\nWm. A. Short, master mechanic of the C. Southern railway:\nQ. Suppose you found a shower of sparks coming out on the platform, burning boys' feet and going down their backs, and leaving black marks on the platform, would you think that extraordinary, or is that a usual thing? A. I have seen it. Some platforms have small charred marks on them. It might have been from defective netting in some other place. Q. If the netting was perfect you would not expect to find these indications on the platform? A. No. I was here when the boys gave their testimony.\nQ. If what they said was true, it would indicate that there was something wrong in the netting? A. I did not hardly take so much stock in what the boys said this morning.\nQ. Just assume that what the boys said was true; would you not infer from that that there was something faulty in the netting? A. I cannot say; I have answered you correctly every thing you have asked me.\nQ. If you were on another railway what would you think if you saw what these boys did? A. When an engine is passing I never saw any red-hot sparks yet.\nQ. Assume that you found the same quantity described by these boys as coming out of the pipe and dropping down, would you not infer from that that there was something faulty in the netting? A. I do not know; it is hardly a fair question I think.\nQ. Could what the boys said be true if the netting was perfect? A, No sir, it could not be true.\nQ. Of course it follows that if the boys' stories were true the netting could not be perfect? A. If the netting was perfect you could not get such a shower as that.\nDavid Wright, locomotive foreman at Victoria:\nQ. If you found a shower of sparks as described by these witnesses this morning would you not think there was something wrong with the netting? A. Most decidedly.\nQ. Suppose the cone got a little put to one side? A. It would have a tendency to throw cinders on the opposite side. It would give more space on one side for sparks to go through.\nPatterson Hall, engineer in charge of the locomotive:\nQ. Is it part of your duty to examine the netting? A. Yes. I would not swear to a day or two when I examined it.\nDo you remember whether the coal was ever thrown back so as to burn you while you were on the tender? A. I never felt anything of that sort.\nQ. That would not be possible? A. Well, I suppose it would be.\nQ. Do you think, with a good netting like this, that the fire would ever get through? A. I do not know. I never have been burned that way.\nQ. If a shower of sparks came as to burn the boys' feet, what would you think? A. I would think there was fire?\nQ. Would you think the netting was all right? A. Yes; well, I do not know.\nQ. If fire enough came to burn their feet in that way, would you think the netting was all right? A. No, I would not Q. You would think it was all wrong? A. Yes.\nThe mass of sparks of the character of those described by the witnesses was, as proved by defendant's skilled witnesses, evidence that defendants had not adopted every precaution that science or practical experience would suggest to prevent injury, in other words, the screen was both insufficient, defective or not in proper working order or properly placed on the stack; that had the screen been in proper working order, no such quantity of sparks could have been emitted. The evidence of Short, master mechanic of the Canada Southern Railway, Domville, a locomotive engineer, Rushton, foreman of the boiler works, Wright locomotive foreman and Patterson Hall the engineer in charge on the occasion, all concur in the opinion that if there was such a shower of sparks as described by the boys, the netting could not have been perfect and there must have been something wrong with it.\nIf the fire in the freight shed was caused by the negligence of the defendants, they would be clearly liable for damages occasioned by the fire extending to plaintiff's building.\nThe appeal must therefore be dismissed with costs.\nSTRONG J.\u2014The evidence of negligence was amply sufficient to warrant the judge who presided at the trial in leaving the case to the jury. The large shower of sparks which are proved to have been emitted from the smoke stack of the engine and the evidence as to the condition of the iron netting made the case a proper one for the consideration of the jury. It was argued however that the statute 14 Geo. 3. ch. 78, sec. 86 applied and exonerated the appellants from all liability, inasmuch as the fire was accidental and began on the appellants own property. That enactment is as follows:\u2014\nNo action, suit or process shall be had, maintained or presented against any person in whose house, chamber, stable, barn or other building, or on whose estate, any fire shall accidentally begin, nor shall any recompense be made by such person for any damage suffered, thereby, any law, usage or custom to the contrary notwithstanding.\nThis provision which is an extension of 6 Anne, c. 31, sections 6 and 7, is, I have no doubt, in force in the Province of Ontario as part of the law of England, introduced by the Constitutional Act, 31 G. 3, ch. 31, but I am clear that it has no application whatever to protect a party from legal liability as a consequence of negligence. At common law a person who brings or originates on his land any dangerous element, such as fire or an accumulation of water, or any other thing which if it should escape may damage his neighbour, does so at his peril, negligence being in such cases entirely immaterial. This is shown by the case of Fletcher v. Rylands[9], where persons who formed on their own land a large reservoir of water were held liable on this express ground for damage done to their neighbour by the escape of the water, though no negligence was proved; and Jones v. Festiniog Railway Co.[10] proceeded upon the same principle, it being held that a company who had power to maintain and run a railway to be worked with horse power, no authority being given by statute to run steam engines, were liable at their peril and irrespective of negligence for damage caused by a locomotive which they had made use of. Subsequently in the case of Nichols v. Marsland[11] the same principle was recognised, though an exception to it was also admitted in that case upon the facts there established of the escape of the water having been caused by vis major. The rule of the common law there held applicable to water would, but for the statute before referred to, be equally applicable to fire, and every person who might light a fire in his house for ordinary domestic purposes would but for that enactment be bound at his peril to keep it safely, and liable to his neighbour for any damage which it might cause him though no negligence could be imputed. It was only to mitigate this rule of law that the statute was passed, and it was not intended thereby to alter the law of liability for negligence. Two cases both of high authority establish this very distinctly, Filliter v. Phippard,[12]; and Lord Canterbury v. Attorney General[13]. In the first of these cases the plaintiff on proving negligence was held entitled to recover damages against the defendant on whose land the fire accidentally began, and in the second Lord Lyndhurst rejected the argument that the suppliant in a petition of right was disentitled to recover, because the damage caused to him by a fire beginning on the propertyof the Crown was shown to have been caused by accident, it being also shown that the fire arose from the negligence of the servants of the crown. Inthe fifth edition of Addison on Torts the learned editor, Mr. Justice Cave, recognizes these cases as having settled the law as to the effect of the statute, and I have found no authority and heard no argument which leads me to doubt for a moment that this is a sound conclusion.\nIn some of the United States, the qualification in the case of fire of the principle of liability before stated, which has been introduced by the statute in England seems to have been considered by the courts as applying at common law. The decisions which have adopted this common law relaxation of the general doctrine seem to rest it on the necessity which every one is under to keep and use fire, thus rendering it unreasonable as regards that element to enforce the strict duties which apply to other noxious things; and this view, by which the case of fire is treated as exceptional at common law, and irrespective of the statute, has also prevailed in the Province of Ontario as is established by the cases of Dean v. McCarty[14] and Gillson v. North Grey Ry. Co.[15].\nIt is sufficient, however, here to say, without pursuing the subject further, that neither the statute of George the III, nor the decisions introducing the restriction to the common law rule, in any way relieve persons from liability for their own negligence or from responsibility for the negligence of their servants.\nIt was further argued that the damage proved by the plaintiff was too remote, inasmuch as the fire was not communicated directly to the plaintiff's house but spread from the defendants' property to the houses of third persons from whence it reached the plaintiff's house. There are certainly American authorities sustaining the appellants' contention on this head, but no English case has been cited which would warrant such a proposition and the American cases are far from uniform. The courts which deny the liability in such a case seem to have been influenced by a regard to the serious consequences and enormous liability which a responsibility in damages under such circumstances might involve rather than on any so and principle of law. It seems to me that the well known case of Scott v. Shepherd[16], though the facts are not the same, is in principle directly in point and fully establishes the liability. The subject is discussed in the work of a very able contemporaneous American writer, Mr. Justice Cooley, in his treatise on Torts[17] and although we may not be permitted to cite his work as authority, yet I think a careful consideration of his reasoning will convince any one that the facts in question can have no influence on the question of liability and that the American cases which determine the opposite have no foundation in legal principle.\nThe case was fairly left to the jury, and the appellants have nothing to complain of either on the ground of the verdict being against the weight of evidence or as regards the amount of damages.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nFOURNIER J. concurred that the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nHENRY J.\u2014In dealing with the circumstances of this case I may premise that the statute 14 Geo. 3, ch. 18, sec. 78, has, in my opinion, no bearing upon the present case; and I consider it therefore unprofitable and unnecessary to discuss the several, contradictory decisions given, and views expounded, in respect to it in England. I do not consider that it has any application to cases where damage has been done by fire produced by railway engines when passing through the country. The principles of law applicable to such cases have been so well ascertained and settled by the numerous decisions to be found in the reports in England, in the United States and in this country, that it is unnecessary to debate what has been so fully determined, and that in such a way, as to the leading principles, that they can hardly be misunderstood.\nThe acknowledged principle is that a railway company chartered by the legislature has the right to use its locomotive engines over its lines propelled by steam generated in the usual way; even although the use of the fire by which the motive power is produced is dangerous from its tendency to set fire to objects near to where the engines run; rapid combustion of the fuel is necessary to the production of the necessary motive power and that necessitates a strong draught in the smoke-stack or chimney. That strong draught carries with it partly consumed fuel, in a burning state, calculated to set fire to objects upon which it falls. To prevent such results means were found necessary, and have been adopted and applied for preventing, as far as possible, the sparks of burning fuel from being carried by the draft outside of the smokestack; and the principle established as applicable to the owners of railways and their liability in cases of damage by fire is, that if they were the ordinary and well known means for such prevention they are not answerable for any resulting damages. The points, then, necessary to be established in such cases are first, that the damage was caused by fire proceeding from the engine; and secondly, that the company was guilty of negligence either in not using the proper preventive appliances or in some other way in the management or working of the engine by which the damage was caused; and in some cases the question of contributory negligence on the part of the plaintiff.\nThe jury have found in this case, I will not say improperly, that the fire to the station house of the appellants was caused by sparks from the engine, nor, as it was I think a question of contradictory evidence, can their finding as to the question of negligence arising from the alleged defective state of the hood in the smokestack be set aside; but whether the appellants are answerable under the circumstances in this case is a question in my mind of no small difficulty. The fire did not spread to the house of the respondent, and it must have been ignited by sparks or burning wood having been carried by the wind across a part of the railway station and a street, a distance of over 100 feet. Railway companies have been held answerable for the ordinary consequences of the spread of the fire from their station houses or grounds, but can it be held that they would be answerable for damages resulting from the course that the wind held at the time the damage was caused? If answerable when the sparks should be carried 100 feet they would be equally answerable if they were carried half a mile, or any other greater or less distance, and set fire to and damaged property. If the principle is sound in its application to the one case, it is equally applicable to another, and where should the line be drawn? Railway companies may fairly be held to be bound to know the state of the immediate surrounding territory, and if a quantity of inflamable and combustible matter is on or contiguous to the line of railway, forming the means for ignition and spreading, they may be held bound to know it, and the natural consequences of a fire set to that matter, and to guard against it by the ordinary precautionary means; but I don't think they can be held answerable for an injury that is not the natural or consequential result. Suppose the case of an engine passing through a city, town or village, and sparks, negligently permitted to escape from the smoke stack, passing over several squares and buildings set fire to and burn a house beyond, would the owners of the engine be answerable for the damages resulting solely from the direction of the wind and other independent causes at the time? and if through and by means of frequent changes of wind, whole squares were burnt by the spreading of the fire from the house first set fire to, would the owners of the engine be answerable to the owners of all the houses situated on those squares? If answerable for the first house burnt, what would limit the liability to that one? A difficulty has arisen and has not yet been satisfactorily resolved as to the limit of responsibility where a fire spreads by the ignition of combustible matter along its track, but if the liability of the owners of the engine in the present case is adjudged, the difficulty will be immeasurably increased; and railway companies may be held answerable for the burning of half a city, town or village. In the case of buildings or other insurable property, it is unnecessary so to decide, as insurance is presumed to cover the bulk of such property, and the owners only taxed for the indemnity they obtain. It is, therefore, not so necessary by legal decision to seek other indemnities for them. I don't feel justified or willing to establish a principle having such important consequences and results. In the case of Ryan v. The New York Central Ry. Co.[18] the Court of Appeal of that State decided that, although negligence was proved, the company was not liable in a case wherein the fire commenced in burning some wood in one of the company's sheds, which was also destroyed, and from there by the force of a strong wind the fire was carried to, and consumed, the plaintiffs property, which was distant about 130 feet from the shed. The court holding that the plaintiff had no cause of action against the company, on the ground that the damage to the plaintiff was not the necessary or natural consequence, ordinarily to be anticipated from the negligence committed. That the plaintiff's injury was the remote and not proximate result of the fire in the shed, and too remote to give a cause of action.\nIn a subsequent case, however, Webb v. The Rome Watertown Ogdensburg Ry. Co.[19], the same court, composed partly of other judges, held that where coals were negligently dropped from the company's engine, which set fire to a tie, from which the fire spread to an accumulation of weeds, grass and rubbish lying on the road, and from those spread to a fence, and into plaintiff's woodland, and burnt and destroyed his trees, the plaintiff was entitled to recover. It will be observed that the latter case is plainly distinguishable from the other and from this one. In that case, through the negligence of the company, the means for the spreading of the fire on their own property existed, by which the fire spread to their fence, and thence into the land of the plaintiff. The spreading of the fire from the tie was therefore from a cause for which the company was held answerable. In this case it is not shown, that through the negligence of the appellants, the means for the spreading of the fire from the station-house to that of the respondent existed, In fact the opposite is shown; for there was no combustible matter shown to have existed by which the fire could spread to the barn and house of the respondent\u2014there was an open space of over one hundred feet, formed by an angle of what is marked on the plan in evidence \"First Cross Street,\" and nothing by which the fire could spread, and, therefore, no negligence could be imputed as to the spreading of the fire. In the case of Ryan v. The New York Central Railway Company[20] before referred to, the decision of the court was pronounced in an able judgment pronounced by Hunt J. on the question of proximate and remote damages, and illustrates his views by a supposed case which, with others, he puts. He says:\u2014\nSo if an engineer upon a steamboat or locomotive, in passing the house of A, so carelessly manage its machinery that the coals and sparks from its fires fall upon and consume the house of A, the railway company or the steamboat proprietors are liable to pay the value of the property thus destroyed. Thus far the law is settled, and the principle is apparent. If, however, the fire communicates from the house of A to that of B, and that is destroyed, is the negligent party liable for his loss? And if it spreads thence to the house of C, and thence to the house of D, and thence consecutively through the other houses, until it reaches and consumes the house of Z, is the party liable to pay the damages sustained by these twenty-four sufferers? The Counsel for the plaintiff does not distinctly claim this, and I think it would not be seriously insisted that the sufferers could recover in such a case. Where, then, is the principle upon which A. recovers, and Z fails? Again he says: Without deciding upon the importance of this distinction, I prefer to place my opinion upon the ground that in one case, to wit, the destruction of the building upon which the sparks were thrown, by the negligent act of the party sought to be charged, the result was to have, been anticipated the moment the fire was communicated to the building, that its destruction was the ordinary and natural result of its being fired. In the second, third or twenty-fourth case as supposed, the destruction of the building is not a natural and expected result of the first firing. That a building upon which sparks and cinders fall should be destroyed, or seriously injured, must be expected; but that a fire should spread, and other buildings be consumed, is not a necessary or an usual result. That it is possible, and that it is not unfrequent, cannot be denied. The result, however, depends, not upon an necessity of a further communication of the fire, but upon a concurrence of accidental circumstances. Such as the degree of heat, the state of the atmosphere, the condition and materials of the adjoining structures, and the direction of the wind. These are accidental and varying circumstances. The party has no control over them, and is not responsible for their effects.\nMy opinion, therefore, is, that this action cannot be sustained for the reason, that the damages incurred are not the immediate, but the remote, result of the negligence of the defendants. The immediate result was the destruction of their own wood and sheds; beyond that, it was remote.\nIn the case of Pennsylvania Railroad Co. v. Kerr[21] in the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania the judgment of the court was delivered by Chief Justice Thomson. It was in an action to recover damages for the burning of goods in a tavern, leased by the plaintiff, and which was ignited and consumed, with its contents, by fire communicated from a building set on fire, by sparks from the defendants engine. He says:\u2014\nIt has always been a matter of difficulty to determine judicially, the precise point at which pecuniary accountability, for the consequences of wrongful or injurious acts, is to cease. No rule has been sufficiently defined and general as to control in all cases. Yet there is a principle applicable to most cases of injury, which amounts to a limitation. It is embodied in the common law maxim, causa proxima non remota spectatur\u2014the immediate, and not the remote cause, is to be considered. He then refers to an illustration of the rule to be found in Parsons on Contracts[22] and refers to notes in the same volume at p. 180. He again says:\u2014\nIt is certain that in almost every considerable disaster, the result of human agency and dereliction of duty, a train of consequences generally ensure and so ramify, as more or less, to affect the whole community. Indemnity cannot reach all these results, although parties suffer who are innocent of blame. This is one of the vicissitudes of organized society. Every one in it takes the risk of these vicissitudes.\nAgain:\u2014\nIt is an occurrence undoubtedly frequent, that, by the careless use of matches, houses are set on fire. One adjoining is fired by the first, a third is by the second, and so on, it might be, for the length of a square or more. It is not in our experience that the first owner is liable to answer for all these consequences, and there is a good reason for it. The second and third houses in the case supposed were not burned by the direct action of the match; and who knows how many agencies might have contributed to produce the result. * * * * The question which gives force to the objection that the second or third result of the first eause is remote, is put by Parsons, vol. 2, 180, \"did the cause alleged produce its effects without another cause intervening, or was it made to operate only through, or by means of, this intervening cause?\" There might possibly be cases in which the cause of disaster, although seemingly removed from the original cause, are still incapable of distinct separation from it, and the rule suggested might be inapplicable.\nHe cites Lowrie J. in Morrison v. Davis & Co.[23] in support of his views, who, in giving judgment in that case says:\u2014\nThere are often very small faults, which are the occasion of the most serious and distressing consequences. Thus a momentary act of carelessness set fire to a little straw and that set fire to a house, and by an extraordinary concurrence of very dry weather and high winds, with this little fault, one third of a city (Pittsburgh) was destroyed. Would it be right that this small act of carelessness should be charged with the whole value of the property consumed?\nBigelow, in his list of overruled cases[24] puts down the judgment in Ryan v. New York Central Railway Company[25], as \"denied\" in Kellogg v. Chicago & N. R. Co.[26]. I have examined the latter case and find that although impliedly perhaps but not expressly the principle of remoteness is denied; and, as I read the judgment of the majority of the court\u2014there having been a decision of two to one\u2014it is hardly even impliedly denied. The circumstances in the two cases were somewhat different. In the case of Kellogg v. the Chicago Co. the fire was caused by sparks from the engine which fell on dry grass on the defendant's grounds alongside of the track, and by means of combustible matter was carried to and consumed the plaintiff's stacks of hay, sheds and stables. It was therefore one continuous burning and in that respect different from the circumstances in the other case, and Chief Justice Dixon, who gave the majority judgment, appears to have decided it upon the fact that the fire was uninterrupted throughout, and he so treats it. He says:\u2014\nIf when the cinder escapes through the air, the effect which it produces upon the first combustible substance against which it strikes is proximate, the effect must continue to be proximate as to everything which the fife consumes in its direct course.\nThe distinction drawn by the dissenting judge (Paine) between the result of a fire spreading, as it did in that case, and that of the effect of burning sparks carried by the wind a distance from the building first ignited to another which is consumed is applicable to this case. He says:\u2014\nIt seems to me, that where it is negligently kindled, the destruction of whatever is in such a situation as to burn, by the mere force of the conflagration, without other intervening cause is the direct and proximate consequence of the negligence * * * But, where such a fire is kindled, and by reason of some other intervening cause, it is carried or driven to objects which it would not otherwise have reached, the destruction of such objects would fairly seem to be a remote consequence of the negligence. * * * Thus if a person should negligently set fire to a building in which powder was stored, and the explosion of the powder should throw fragments of the burning building to other buildings that would not otherwise have been reached and set them on fire; or, if an unusual gale of wind, should carry such fragments to a distance with the same result, the damage for the loss of such other buildings might justly be said to be remote.\nWhen however the year after the judgment in that case was given, an application for a rehearing was made, in the judgment thereon given.\nThe law, as laid down in the Ryan and Kerr cases, was denied, and I will not go so far as to say, that the liability must necessarily in all cases be confined to the first object destroyed.\nThere have been and no doubt, there will be, cases where the destruction of a second building by fire communicated from the first, may be found to be the natural and consequential result\u2014where the two are connected by combustible materials, forming part of the one or the other, so that under almost any circumstances the destruction of one must result in the destruction of the other, there can be little doubt that for the destruction of the second through tne burning of the first, the party guilty of the negligent burning of the first should be held answerable for the loss of the second, the burning of which was the direct and natural result of the burning of the first. Such, however, is not the present case. If the wind at the time had been from an opposite or even slightly different quarter, the respondent's house would not have been burnt. The burning of it was, therefore, not alone the usual or natural result. The burning of the respondent's house was not necessarily, and would not have been in ordinary circumstances, the cause of the damage. It may be admitted that if the appellants' building had not been set fire to, the damage to the respondent's would not have been occasioned; but it must be also admitted that, but for the particular direction and force of the wind at the time, the damage would not have been done. Is, then, a party who negligently causes the destruction of his own or his neighbor's house answerable for, not an immediate or ordinary result, but one arising from a cause over which he had no control? If a fire thus caused is in the near vicinity of houses in every direction around it, which would be in no danger unless with the presence of a strong wind, is the party answerable for any one or more of them that the wind happens to carry sparks to? His liability in such a case would not arise from the natural effect of the original cause but from a vis major, which he would have no part in producing, and would he be answerable for the effect of the wind, at one time carrying the sparks to the house of A, and by a change of direction should subsquently carry other sparks from the first building on fire, in an opposite direction to the house of B? Could it be reasonably said that in both cases the damage was the natural and consequential result, and if not in both how could it be said that it was so in either? And is it not the proper conclusion that both were attributable to the fortuitous direction and operation of the wind?\nIn Pennsylvania Railroad Co. v. Hope[27] Chief Justice Agnew delivered the unanimous judgment of the court. It was a case of negligently leaving combustible materials on the railway ground, which ignited; and from which the fire spread to, and consumed the plaintiff's property. He says the question of the proximity of the result of a fire by which the plaintiff's property is destroyed is solely for the jury aided by proper instruction from the presiding judge. He canvasses the judgment in the case of the Railroad Company v. Kerr and sustains the law laid down in it, but distinguishes the two cases. He says:\u2014 As the case was placed before the mind of Chief Justice Thomson, there is no reason to doubt the correctness of his conclusion.\nAgain:\u2014\nFrom the very issue of the thing, the natural probability of a consequence, which ought to have been seen, is a matter of fact to be determined upon the evidence. Every case must depend upon its own circumstances.\nReferring to Railway Co. v. Kerr and Kellogg v. Chicago & N. W. Railway Co.[28], he says:\u2014\nThat in the former the point was: that the burnings were distinct and separate, a series of events succeeding one another, while in that before him, there was but one burning. One continuous conflagration from the time the fire was set on the railroad, till the plaintiff's property was destroyed.\nHe, therefore, unreservedly approves of both judgments\u2014the one deciding, that in the case of the distinct and separate burnings, the damages were remote; but in the case of the one continuous burning they were proximate.\nI have referred to all the English cases and decisions that I could find likely to throw light on the difficulty presented in this case, but I could not find any decision upon the application of the rule of law applicable to a case like the present. Cases are reported, where the damages were occasioned by the setting fire to combustible materials found to have been negligently left on the railway grounds, by sparks from an engine and, the spreading of the fire therefrom, by one continuous conflagration to the properties consumed of the parties claiming damages; but there is no case that I can find where the distinction was drawn, between such cases and one in which damage was occasioned by sparks carried a distance by the wind, and doing damage. As far as I can discover, no case has been determined in England in which it has been decided that damage done, as in this case, was proximate or remote. Whether such damages are the natural, and ordinarily, to be expected, result is a question I believe not yet deliberately decided in England; and, as each case should be decided by its own circumstances, it becomes a question for a jury to resolve in each case. There are no doubt cases where a party may be answerable for such damages but they are not the usual ones. Several cases have been tried in the United States, where it was shown that one continuous fire, spreading from sparks from engines, by means of combustible matter on, and alongside of, the railways, consumed property, wherein the railway companies were held answerable. As to cases like the present, the decisions are not uniform and some of them were decided on the liability imposed by statutes, but, as far as I am capable of judging, the weight of authority favors the classing of the damages in such cases as remote.\nIt is necessary, however, according to the course adopted generally in England and in the courts in the United States, to submit to a jury, the question whether, under the circumstances in evidence, the burning complained of was the natural and ordinary result of the imputed negligence. My own opinion is, that, under the circumstances in this case, there was not a sufficient liability established by the evidence, to justify such a submission; and, still less, for the presiding judge, to withdraw the matter from the jury, as was done, as it appears to me, in this case.\nIn Pennsylvania Railroad Co. v. Hope[29] in 1876 it was expressly held by the Supreme Court of that State that such an issue was for the jury. The head note is as follows:\u2014\nSparks from defendants engine fired a railroad tie, from which rubbish, left by the defendants on their road, was fired, communicated with plaintiffs fence next to the road, and spread over two fields, burned another fence, and standing timber 600 feet distant from the road.\nHeld; that the proximity of the cause was for the jury.\n2nd. In such case, the jury must determine whether the facts constitute a continuous succession of events, so linked as to be a natural whole, or whether the chain is so broken as to become independent, and the final result cannot be said to be the natural and probable consequence of the negligence of the defendants.\n3rd. The rule for determining what a proximate cause is, that the injury must be the natural and probable consequence of the negligence, and that it might and ought to have been foreseen under the circumstances.\n4 Pennsylvania Railroad Company v. Kerr[30] distinguished.\nThe learned judge who presided at the trial put the following questions to the jury, which were answered as follows[31]:\u2014\nIt will thus be seen that the questions and answers just quoted have reference only to the origin of the fire in the freight house of the appellants; and not, in the least degree, referring to the catching on fire of the respondents barn or house. The charge of the learned judge is not reported, and we are unable to judge how he charged in reference to the latter question, if he did so at all. I should judge from the nature of the questions and answers, that the question as to the natural and ordinary result was not in any way submitted. It is in my opinion a clear case of non-direction upon the vital issue to properly determine the case. Had it been a general verdict, without questions and answers, we might possibly assume\u2014but that would perhaps be going too far\u2014that all the necessary issues under the pleadings had been submitted to, and found by, the jury; but such was not the course adopted. The findings of the jury on the questions put to them, are alone insufficient upon which to found a judgment. They only refer to the setting fire to, and destruction of, the appellants property, but in no way refer to that of the respondent. In my opinion the appellants, as a question of law are not answerable to the respondent for the damage she complains of, but if I am wrong in that position, the liability should be ascertained by a jury, on issues properly submitted.\nI think the verdict should be set aside and a judgment of non-suit entered or, under any circumstances, a new trial granted\u2014with costs.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014I concur in the opinion that this appeal must be dismissed, but it is unnecessary, in my opinion to decide in this case whether it is an established legal proposition that a fire originating in negligence can never be a fire \"beginning accidentally\" within the meaning of 14 Geo. 3 c. 78 sec. 86; it is worthy of remark, however, that the observations of Lord Denman in support of this proposition, criticising the opinion to the contrary of Sir William Blackstone as expressed in his commentaries, and the observations of Lord Lyndhurst in Lord Canterbury's case[32], were unnecessary to the decision in Filliter v. Phippard,[33] and are therefore open to the same objections as, in the opinion of Lord Denman, were the observations of Lord Lyndhurst in Lord Canterbury's case. The judgment of Filliter v. Phippard is, by Lord Denman himself, rested upon the ground that a fire which was knowingly and intentionally lighted by the defendant could never be said to be a fire beginning accidentally within the meaning of the statute. Neither that case, therefore, nor that of Vaughan v. Menlove,[34] therein referred to, can, I think, as I have endeavoured to point out in Jeffrey v. The Toronto, Grey & Bruce Ry. Co.[35], be said to establish such a proposition; against it must be taken the opinion of Sir William Blackstone and the express decision of the learned judge Sir John B. Robinson C. J. in Gaston v. Wald[36] and the fact mentioned by Lord Lyndhurst in Lord Canterbury's case, that although cases of damage from the burning of houses by negligence have frequently occurred since the statute, no instance had ever occurred to his knowledge, nor can be found in the books, of an action having been brought to recover compensation for this species of injury, nor is there any trace of any such proceeding.\nThe fact that no trace can be found in the English courts of such an action having ever been brought is to my mind strong evidence that the proposition that a fire originating in negligence can never be a fire beginning accidentally within the meaning of the statute, is at variance with the general impression of the English mind professional and lay, and in the absence of any such action the rule of Lyttleton referred to in the Attorney General v. Vernon[37] may well apply, namely\u2014\"what never was never ought to be.\" When the point does directly arise it will be time enough to consider the foundation upon which the proposition can be, if it can be, supported, and to decide between the opinion of Sir Wm. Blackstone with the dictum of Lord Lyndhurst, though it was unnecessary to the decision of the case before him, supported by the considered judgment of Sir John B. Robinson C.J. on the one side, and the dictum of Lord Denman, which was also unnecessary to the decision of Filliter v. Phippard, on the other.\nThe statute of Geo. 3 referred to has however no application whatever, in my opinion, in actions like the present against railway companies for compensation for injury, alleged to have been occasioned to the plaintiff by negligence upon the part of the defendants and their servants, in the use by them of the dangerous element which they are by law authorised to use, but this non-application of the statute is not because a fire originating in negligence cannot be an accidental one within the meaning of the statute. The principle upon which the liability of railway companies in such cases rests, is, in my opinion, this; by the common law, apart from any statute, where a person for his own private purposes brings upon his premises an engine of an extremely dangerous and unruly character, such as a locomotive engine worked by the dangerous element of fire, which, if it should escape from the fire box, in which for the working of the engine it is contained, is calculated to do much mischief, he must keep that fire confined, so as to prevent its doing mischief at his peril: and if he does not do so he will be responsible for all damage which is the natural consequence of, and directly resulting from, its escape, unless he can excuse himself by showing either that the escape was owing to the plaintiff's fault, or was the consequence of a vis major, or the act of God; this I take to be the principle established by the House of Lords in Rylands v. Fletcher[38]. But the legislature having authorised the use of locomotive steam engines as a motive power, and having authorized the carrying the dangerous element of fire along the railways for impelling the locomotives, the common law is qualified, but conditionally only upon the persons, authorized so to use the fire using it in a proper and reasonable manner (such proper and reasonable manner being estimated relatively to the dangerous nature of the element and the combustible nature of the materials with which it is brought into proximity), and using all the appliances known to science, and taking all reasonable precautions to prevent the fire escaping and to prevent also combustible material upon their property becoming ignited by fire from the engine coming in contact therewith, and so extending into the property of a neighboring proprietor;\u2014in fact conditional upon their adopting all such known appliances and precautions as may reasonably be required to prevent damage to the property of third persons near which the Railway passes, and if they are guilty of any default in the discharge of this duty they are responsible for all damage which is the natural consequence of such default, whether such damage is occasioned by fire escaping from the engine coming directly in contact with and consuming the property of such third persons, or is caused to the property of such third persons by fire communicated thereto from property of the railway company themselves which had been ignited by fire escaping from the engine coming directly in contact therewith[39].\nWe are of opinion (says Bramwell B. when delivering the judgment of the Court of Exchequer in Vaughan v. Taff Vale Ry. Co.)[40], that the statute[41] does not apply where the fire originates in the use of a dangerous instrument knowingly used by the owners or the land in which the fire breaks out.\nAnd in that case in the Court of Exchequer Chamber[42] (while reversing the judgment of the Court of Exchequer upon the ground that as it was found as a fact that the defendants were guilty of no negligence no action lay), Cockburn C. J. states the principle upon which these actions rest thus:\u2014\nAlthough it may be true that if a person keeps an animal of known dangerous propensities or a dangerous instrument he will be responsible to those who are thereby injured, independently of negligence in the mode of dealing with the animal or using the instrument, yet when the legislature has sanctioned and authorized the use of a particular thing, and it is used for the purpose for which it is authorized and every precaution has been observed to prevent injury, the sanction of the legislature carries with it this consequence that if damage results from the use of such thing independently of negligence the party using it is not responsible.\nAnd Blackburn J. says:\u2014\nRex. v. Pease has settled that when the legislature has sanctioned the use of locomotive engines, there is no liability for injury caused by using them, so long as every precaution is taken consistent with their use.\nThe principle of liability then being, that unless every precaution is taken to prevent injury occurring from the fire in the locomotive engine, the party neglecting to take such precaution cannot claim the protection of the statute which authorizes the use of the engine, but is subject to the same liability as he would have been liable to at common law, apart from the statute, for such reason, the statute 14 Geo. 3rd ch. 78 has no application. This it will be observed, also, is the same point as is decided by the judgment in Filliter v. Phippard[43].\nIn these actions, therefore, against railway companies for compensation for damage occasioned by fire proceeding from their engines in the use of them as sanctioned by law the enquiry always is:\u2014Have they complied with the condition subject to which alone the use of the fire, in the manner in which it is used by them, is authorized, and by compliance with which they can alone relieve themselves from liability? Have they used the destructive element under their control with that degree of care which was reasonably requisite, in view of the danger to be apprehended of inflicting injury and which the circumstances in each case called for? Negligence, as said by Willes J. in Vaughan v. Taff Vale Railway Co.[44], is the absence of care according to the circumstances. In this case the evidence clearly proved, and indeed upon this point there was no dispute, that the property of the plaintiff was set fire to by fire directly communicated to it proceeding from a freight shed of the defendants which was on fire and which was situate just across a street in the village of Chippewa, which separated the property of the defendants from that of the plaintiff, and there was abundant evidence to go to the jury upon the question, whether in point of fact this freight shed was or not set fire to, by sparks issuing from an engine of the defendants which had passed there immediately before the breaking out of the fire in the shed. The defendants' contention at the trial was that the smokestack of the particular engine had attached to it a perfect netting or screen to prevent sparks escaping. But there was evidence of the strongest character that a shower of sparks did in fact escape from the smoke stack precisely as the engine passed the shed, and fell on the platform all around about and upon and against the freight shed, and the witnesses of the defendant admitted that if this evidence was true the netting could not have been perfect, what they plainly intended to convey thereby being that, in their opinion, it was not true. The evidence upon this point however, if believed, was quite sufficient to justify the jury in finding, and they did believe it to be true, and accordingly found as a fact, that the freight shed was set fire to by sparks escaping from the smoke stack, and that those sparks escaped by reason of the apparatus for arresting sparks having been out of order; they also found that having regard to the dryness of the season the engine was taken past the freight shed, which was quite close to the track, under too heavy pressure of steam, such heavy pressure having the tendency to cause sparks to escape, and that the state in which the freight shed was (there having been evidence that its floor was saturated with oil and that the building itself, which was of wood, was very dry and inflammable) was not such a condition as having regard to its proximity to passing trains should have been permitted. That there was evidence to go to the jury upon all of these points, and which, if believed (and of its truth they were the sole judges), was sufficient to support these findings, cannot, I think, be doubted; it is therefore unnecessary to consider whether their finding that \"as it was a special train and on Sunday when \"employees were not on duty, there should have been \"an extra hand on duty,\" if it stood alone, would be a sufficient finding of negligence to support a verdict in favor of the plantiff.\nThe learned counsel for the appellants strongly contended that as the plaintiff's buildings were ignited, not by sparks proceeding directly from the engine and falling on the buildings of the plaintiff, but by fire proceeding from the freight shed, the damage so done to the plaintiffs property was too remote to justify a verdict against the defendants. In support of this contention he relied upon a case of Ryan v. New York Central Ry. Co.[45], decided in the Court of Appeals of New York in 1866, which certainly does appear to lay down very distinctly such a proposition. In that case the New York Central Railroad Company, by the negligent manner of conducting an engine, or by the defective condition of the engine, set fire to a quantity of wood in one of their own sheds; the fire consumed the wood shed and spread to, and consumed, the house of the plaintiff situate about 180 feet distant from the shed, and the court held that the plaintiff had no cause of action against the railroad company, on the ground that the plaintiff's injury was not the necessary or natural consequence of, nor the result ordinarily to be anticipated from, the negligence committed, that the plaintiff's injury was the remote and not the proximate result of the fire in the wood shed, and too remote to give a cause of action. In Webb v. The Rome Watertown & Ogdensburg Ry. Co.[46], however, the same court differently constituted in 1872, citing and relying upon Vaughan v. Taff Vale Ry. Co.[47] and Smith v. London & S. W. Ry. Co.[48], held that where coals were negligently dropped from an engine of the defendants which set fire to a tie, from which the fire was communicated to an accumulation of weeds, grass and rubbish, which lay on the side of the track, and thence spread to the fence and into plaintiff's woodland burning and destroying his trees, the plaintiff was entitled to recover. In the report of Smith v. London & S. W. Ry. Co. in the Common Pleas, there is something in the language of Brett J., who dissented from the majority of the court, which upon a cursory view appears also to give countenance to the appellants' contention. He says there[49]:\u2014\nI take the rule of law in these cases to be that which is laid down by Alderson B. in Blyth v. Birmingham Waterworks Co.[50], \"negligence \"is the omission to do something which a reasonable man' \"guided upon those considerations which ordinarily regulate the \"conduct of human affairs would do, or doing something which a \"prudent and reasonable man would not do.\"\nAnd again at p. 103:\u2014\nI quite agree that the defendants ought to have anticipated that sparks might be emitted from their engines, notwithstanding they are of the best construction and were worked without negligence, and that they might reasonably have anticipated that the rummage and hedge trimmings allowed to accumulate might be thereby set on fire. But I am of opinion that no reasonable man could have foreseen that the fire would consume the hedge and pass across the stubble field and so go to the plaintiff's cottage at the distance of 200 yards from the railway, crossing a road on its passage. It seems to me that no duty was cast upon the defendants in relation to the plaintiff's property, because it was not shown that the property was of such a nature and so situate that the defendants ought to have known that by permitting the rummage and hedge trimmings to remain on the banks of the railway they placed it in undue peril.\nAnd again:\u2014\nI am of opinion as matter of fact that no reasonable man could suppose\u2014or at least eight out of ten would fail to suppose\u2014that if by any means the rummage and hedge trimmings on the side of the railway were set on fire, the fire would extend to a stubble field adjoining and so proceed to a cottage at the distance before mentioned.\nAnd he concludes thus:\u2014\nI think that the defendants cannot reasonably be held responsible for not having contemplated such an extraordinary combination of circumstances or such a result. For these reasons I am of opinion that there was no such evidence of negligence on their part as could properly be left to a jury.\nNow, it is to be observed that these remarks of the learned judge as to the remoteness of the damage, and as to its not being reasonably (within the contemplation of a prudent and careful man,) such a natural consequence of the rummage and hedge trimmings being left where they were, as to make the leaving of them such negligence, as standing alone in the absence of any evidence whatever of negligence in the mode in which the fire was used and its escape guarded against, should render the defendants liable, are made by the learned judge to justify the conclusion at which he had arrived that no evidence of negligence proper to be left to a jury was produced. His remarks are not at all addressed to the consideration, whether: if there was evidence that the fire in the rummage and hedge trimmings had been occasioned by a negligent use of the fire carried in the locomotive, and by its being permitted to escape by reason of some negligent defect in the engine, or its screen, or of some other negligence in the conduct of the engine, the fact of the fire having been communicated to the plaintiff's property through the medium of the fire spreading from the rummage and hedge trimmings along the ground through the stubble field to the plaintiff's house and not by sparks emanating from the engine directly striking the plaintiff's house and setting fire to it, would make the injury to the plaintiff in such case to be too remote to constitute a cause of action. This distinction is plainly pointed out in the case when in the Exchequer Chamber[51] where Channell B. says:\nI quite agree that where there is no direct evidence of negligence the question what a reasonable man might foresee is of importance in considering, the question whether there is evidence for the jury of negligence or not, but if it has been once determined that there is evidence of negligence, the person guilty of it is equally liable for its consequences whether he could have foreseen them or not.\nAnd Blackburn J. who entertained doubts similar to those which had been entertained by Brett J. says:\u2014\nI also agree that what the defendants might reasonably anticipate is, as my Brother Channell has said, only material with reference to the question whether the defendants were negligent or not, and cannot alter their liability if they were guilty of negligence.\nAnd after stating the grounds of his doubts of their being sufficient evidence of negligence in that case, he says:\u2014\nI do not say that there is not much in what is said with respect to the trimmings being the cause of the injury and not the state of the hedge, but I doubt on this point and therefore doubt if there was evidence of negligence. If the negligence was once established it would be no answer that it did much more damage than was expected.\nNow, in the case before us, there was, as I have already said, abundant evidence which, if believed, justifies the finding of the jury that the fire in the shed was occasioned by sparks emanating from the smokestack by reason of the apparatus for arresting sparks being out of order, and that the engine should not have been taken past the freight house in that dry season under such a heavy pressure of steam, and as it appears that the plaintiff's buildings were ignited and consumed by sparks conveyed from the burning freight shed, I am of opinion that the injury sustained by plaintiff is a damage naturally consequential upon and resulting from the defendants' negligence found by the jury, and for which the defendants are in law responsible.\nI express no opinion upon the point as it does not arise upon this record: whether damage sustained by another person whose buildings may have been destroyed by fire proceeding from the plaintiff's burning buildings, or from an intermediate building of a third person, whose building had been ignited by fire, proceeding from the plaintiff's building, being carried by the wind to the property of the plaintiff would or not be too remote to constitute a good cause of action against the defendants? Whether or not in such case the negligence of the defendants could be said to be causa causans of such damage? It may be that there must be some point where, in a fire so spreading from house to house, the liability of the defendants ceases even though their negligence be the cause of the occurring of the first fire. In the case of a fire so spreading it may be that in the case of a building far removed from that in which the fire first broke out becoming ignited by fire, proceeding from an intermediate building, there may be some circumstances to be taken into consideration as constituting the causa causans of the damage, which would distinguish that case from that of the fire, as in the case before us, proceeding directly from the defendants' shed but such a point does not arise upon this record. It is stated it is true, in the appellants factum that a number of actions have been brought against the defendants and that it. has been agreed that the defendants liability in those actions shall be determined by the result of this present one. This circumstance however cannot authorize us to import into the consideration and determination of this case any facts not actually appearing in evidence in the case. It may be that the facts in the other cases are identical with those appearing in this case. It may be that in some of the other actions the facts are in some particulars different. How this may be we know not. To all cases similar in their facts to the present our judgment will of course, under the agreement referred to, naturally apply, and if the agreement affects cases, the facts of which may be materially different from those appearing in the present case, that is a matter over which we have no control and with which we cannot interfere.\nUpon the facts, as they appear in the present case, I am of opinion that the damage of which the plaintiff complains is damage naturally consequential upon and resulting from the negligence of the defendants as found by the jury, and that the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellants: Crooks.

Ritchie, Knt., C.J., and Strong, Fournier, Henry and Taschereau, JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.\nWarehouse receipts\u201435 Vic., ch. 5 (D.), Intra vires.\nThe appellants discounted for a trading firm, on the understanding that a quantity of coal purchased by the firm should be consigned to them, and that they would transfer to the firm the bills of lading, and should receive from one of the members of the firm his receipt as a wharfinger and warehouseman for the coal as having been deposited by them, which was done, and the following receipt was given:\nReceived in store in Big Coal House warehouse at Toronto, from Merchants\u2019 Bank of Canada (at Toronto), fourteen hundred and fifty-eight (1458) tons stove coal, and two hundred and sixty-one tons chestnut coal, per schooners \u2018Dundee,\u2019 \u2018Jessie Drummond,\u2019 \u2018Gold Hunter,\u2019 and \u2018Annie Mulvey,\u2019 to be delivered to the order of the said Merchants\u2019 Bank to be endorsed hereon.\nThis is to be regarded as a receipt under the provisions of Statute 34 Vic. ch. 5\u2014value $7,000.00.\nThe said coal in sheds facing esplanade is separate from and will be kept separate and distinguishable from other coal.\n\u201c(Signed), W. SNARR.\u201d\n\u201cDated 10th August, 1878.\nThe partnership having become insolvent, the assignee sought to hold the coal as the goods of the insolvents, and filed a bill impeaching the validity of the receipt. The Chancellor who tried the case found that the receipt given was a valid receipt within the provisions of the Banking Act, and was given by a warehouseman, and that the bank were entitled to hold all the coal in store of the description named in the receipt. This judgment was reversed by the Court of Appeal for Ontario, and on appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada it was Held (reversing the judgment of the Court of Appeal) that it is not necessary to the validity of the claim of a bank under a warehouse receipt, given by an owner who is a warehouseman and wharfinger and has the goods in his possession, that the receipt should reach the hands of the bank by indorsement, and that the receipt given by W.S. in this case was a receipt within the meaning of 34 Vic., ch. 5 (D.)\n2. (Ritchie, C.J., and Strong, J., dissenting), That the finding of the Chancellor as to fact of W.S. being a person authorized by the statute to give the receipt in question should not have been reversed, as there was evidence that W.S. was a wharfinger and warehouseman.\n3. Per Fournier, Henry and Taschereau, J.J., That sections 46, 47 and 48 of 34 Vic., ch. 5 (D) are intra vires of the Dominion Parliament.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1].\nThe facts and pleadings are sufficiently set out in the judgments hereinafter given. See also report of the case in 28 Grant 629.\nC. Robinson, Q.C., and J.F. Smith for appellants:\nThe transaction was one strictly within the Banking Act of 1871. See Royal Canadian Bank v. Ross[2].\nThe firm of J. Snarr & Sons failed to pay the advances made by the appellants, and became insolvent early in March, 1879, and the respondent, who became their assignee, under the Insolvent Act of 1875, has no greater right than the Snarrs would have had. Ayres v. The South Australian Banking Co.[3]; Re Coleman[4].\nAs regards the form in which these receipts were given, sections 46, 47 and 48 of the Banking Act of 1871 (34 Vic. c. 5 D), under which these receipts were taken, were passed to relieve banks from the strict construction which had been placed by the courts in Ontario on the Consolidated Statutes of Canada, ch. 54 and amending Act 24 Vic. ch. 23 s. 1, (see Royal Canadian Bank v. Miller)[5], which strict construction had not, however, been followed in the Province of Quebec, for in Molson\u2019s Bank v. Janes[6], it was held in the Superior Court at Montreal, and afterwards affirmed by the Court of Review, that a warehouse receipt given by the owner of goods (under 24 Vic. ch. 23 before cited, as amending Con. Stat. Can. ch. 54), acknowledging to have received coals into store on account of and deliverable to the order of the bank, transferred the property to the bank without endorsement.\nThe Act of the Dominion 34 Vic. ch. 5, in the enabling part of sec. 46, enacts that a bank may acquire and hold any receipt given them as collateral security for the due payment of any debt which may become due to the bank, under any credit opened or liability incurred by the bank on behalf of the holder or owner of such receipt, or for any other debt to become due to the bank. And by sec. 48, when the warehouseman is at the same time the owner of the goods, etc., any such receipt, or any acknowledgment or certificate intended to answer the purpose of such receipt, shall be as valid and effective for the purposes of the Act as if the person making such receipt and the warehouseman were not the same person.\nThe credit granted to the Snarrs was for a legitimate purpose under the Act, and the receipts were given as acknowledgments intended to answer the purpose of receipts under the Act. The purposes of the Act, for which such receipts are declared to be valid, are to enable the bank to make advances on warehouse receipts, and through other documents specified as collateral securities; and the Act should, to effect this purpose, receive a liberal construction. The British North America Act, by sec. 91, assigned to the Parliament of Canada the exclusive right of legislation as to \u201cbanking, incorporation of banks, and the issue of paper money,\u201d as well as the same right in regard to \u201cthe regulation of trade and commerce.\u201d What are to be considered \u201cbanking\u201d securities, for the purpose of lending money on them by banks, as well as the right to say what constitutes a banking security, and in what manner and to what extent such securities may be taken and dealt with by banks, is a matter pertaining to \u201cbanking\u201d as well as to the \u201cincorporation of banks.\u201d In the latter aspect, such a question goes to the potential capacity of the corporation, which is the creation of the Dominion Legislature. Such legislation must necessarily affect property and civil rights, and the B.N.A. Act, in assigning the subjects under s. 91 to the Dominion Parliament, intended to confer and did confer on it legislative power to interfere with such rights within the province, so far as these latter might be affected by a general law relating to those subjects. Cushing v. Dupuy[7].\nJ. MacLennan, Q.C., for respondent:\nIt is clear that the receipts in question are not such as the statute authorizes. They are signed by W. Snarr, and express that the goods are received from the bank, and are to be delivered to the order of the bank. The real owners of the goods are nowhere mentioned. The transaction is a direct transaction between W. Snarr and the bank. There was no previous holder, as required by the statute. What is required is that a receipt shall be issued and held by some other person than the bank, and that the bank may require it from that other person. The bank therefore cannot succeed under sec. 46. See Bank B.N.A. v. Clarkson[8]; Royal Canadian Bank v. Miller[9]; S.C., in appeal[10].\nNeither can the claim be supported under sec. 48. W. Snarr was not a warehouseman within the meaning of the section. He was not a person engaged in the calling of a keeper of a wharf, of a warehouseman, or of a wharfinger He was a coal dealer. This section is liable to great abuse, and there should be no doubt of a man\u2019s calling in any case to bring him within it.\nBut if he were a warehouseman, the section does not apply, for he was not also the owner of the goods. The goods belonged to the firm, and not to W. Snarr, and the section only applies where the warehouseman is also the owner. Ontario Bank v. Newton[11]; Todd v. London & Globe[12]: S.C, in appeal[13].\nThe provisions of sections 46, 47 and 48, so far as they assume to alter the general law of the Province of Ontario in favor of banks, are ultra vires and void. At Confederation the general law of Ontario was expressed in the provisions of the Consol. Stat. of U.C. 24th Vic. ch. 23, and 29 Vic. ch. 19, and was applicable to banks as to other persons. This law, as regards the general public of the province, is the same as before, and is now found in R.S.O., ch. 116, secs. 14, 15 and 16.\nThe Banking Act of 1871 assumes to change this general law so far as banks are concerned. This is clearly not authorized by the provisions of the British North America Act, and is void. The Citizens Insurance Co. v. Parsons[14].\nExcluding the alterations made by the Dominion Legislature, the bank\u2019s rights must be regulated by secs. 14, 15 and 16 of the R.S.O., ch. 116, and the transactions in question are clearly unsustainable under those sections.\nThe bank can have no claim for coal disposed of by the Snarrs. It was well known they were selling, and it was intended by the bank that they should do so, and they urged the Snarrs to sell. Slado v. Morgan[15]; Re Coleman[16]; Cockburn v. Sylvester[17].\nRITCHIE, C.J.:\u2014\nThis is an appeal by the defendants against the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, on appeal from a judgment of the Chief Justice of Ontario, before whom the action was tried when Chancellor of that province. A decree was made by the Chief Justice in favor of the appellants with costs. The respondent then appealed to the Court of Appeal, which court allowed the appeal, and reversed the decree, with costs. The appellants now submit that the decree was right, and ought not to have been reversed.\nThe firm of John Snarr & Sons, carrying on business at Toronto, dealers in coal, was composed of W.S. Snarr and George Snarr. Their place of business was on the Esplanade, in Toronto, where they had a wharf and coal sheds on the same premises.\nIn the summer of 1878, the firm, desiring a credit for the purpose of importing coal, applied to the appellants to grant it to them, and this the latter agreed to do on the understanding that warehouse receipts of the coal so to be imported would be transferred to them.\nThe circumstances under which they were given and received by the bank were as follows:\nThe Snarrs went to the bank about the middle of July, 1878, and arranged for advances, or a credit of $25,000 on endorsed paper, with warehouse receipts as collateral security on the coal to be purchased with the money. The notes were discounted, and the money put to the Snarrs\u2019 credit before any coal was bought, but they were apparently not allowed to draw upon the account until some of the coal arrived. They then purchased coal and had it consigned and shipped to Toronto; and the vendor\u2019s agent at the same time drew a draft for the price, addressed to the bank. The shipping papers and draft were sent to the bank. The Snarrs called at the bank, drew a cheque upon their account for a sufficient sum to buy a draft on New York for the amount of the draft, and handed this cheque to the manager, or else they wrote across the face of the draft an authority to the manager to charge it to their account. The manager endorsed the shipping bill to the Snarrs, which enabled them to get a delivery of the coal from the vessel, and the manager sent a draft on New York to the vendors. Afterwards when the coal was unladen at the Snarrs\u2019 warehouse, they gave the bank a warehouse receipt. It seems that the account was opened by a discount of a note for $7,000. Other similar discounts followed from time to time, and the Snarrs afterwards used the account as an ordinary deposit and drawing account for their business operations, as well as for the coal drafts, for which no separate account was kept.\nThe so called warehouse receipts given were as follows:\nReceived in store in Big Coal House Warehouse at Toronto from Merchants\u2019 Bank of Canada (at Toronto), fourteen hundred and fifty-eight (1,458) tons stove coal, and two hundred and sixty-one tons chestnut coal per schooners \u2018Dundee,\u2019 \u2018Jessie Drummond,\u2019 \u2018Gold Hunter\u2019 and \u2018Annie Mulvey,\u2019 to be delivered to the order of the said Merchants\u2019 Bank to be endorsed hereon.\nThis is to be regarded as a receipt under the provisions of Statute 34 Vic. ch. 5\u2014value $7,000.00. The said coal in sheds facing Esplanade is separate from and will be kept separate and distinguishable from other coal.\n(Signed,) W. Snarr.\nDated, 10th August, 1878.\nThe following sections of 34 Vic., ch. 5, provide (section 40) that the bank shall not\u2014\nEither directly or indirectly deal in the buying and selling or bartering of goods, wares or merchandise, or be engaged in any trade whatever, except as dealer in gold and silver bullion, bills of exchange, discounting of promissory notes and negotiable securities, and such trade generally as appertains generally to the business of banking.\nThe same section provides that\u2014\nThe bank shall not directly or indirectly lend money or make advances upon the security, mortgage or hypothecation (inter alia) of any goods, wares or merchandise, except as authorized in this Act.\nBy section 41:\nBank may take, hold and dispose of mortgages and hypotheques upon personal as well as real property by way of additional security for debts contracted to the bank in the course of its business.\nSame rights, &c., bank has in respect of real estate mortgaged to it, to be held and possessed by it in respect of any personal estate mortgaged. And section 48 provides that\u2014\nWhere any person engaged in the calling of cove-keeper, keeper of a wharf, yard, harbor or other place, warehouseman, miller, wharfinger, master of a vessel, or carrier, curer and packer of pork, or dealer in wool, by whom a receipt or bill of lading may be given in such capacity, as hereinbefore mentioned, for cereal grains, goods, wares or merchandise, is at the same time the owner of or entitled himself (otherwise than in his capacity of warehouseman, miller, wharfinger, master of a vessel or carrier, cove keeper of a wharf, yard, harbor or other place, curer and packer of pork, or dealer in wool), to receive such cereal grains, goods, wares or merchandise, any such receipt or bill of lading or any acknowledgment or certificate intended to answer the purpose of such receipt or bill of lading, made by such person, shall be as valid and effectual for the purposes of this Act, as if the person making such receipt, acknowledgment or certificate or bill of lading, and the owner or person entitled to receive such cereal grains, goods, wares or merchandise were not one and the same person, and in the case of the curing and packing of pork, a receipt for hogs, shall apply to the pork made from such hogs.\nThe first question which arises, in my opinion, is, does sec. 48 apply to a private person\u2019s warehouse who does not hold himself out to the public as filling the character of one of the callings named in the section and with whom the public have a right to deal as such? The language of the Act is, where any person engaged in the calling of cove-keeper, keeper of a wharf, yard, harbor or other place, warehouseman, miller, wharfinger, master of a vessel or carrier, curer and packer of pork, or dealer in wool, by whom a receipt or bill of lading may be given in such capacity as hereinbefore mentioned as set out in the section I have just quoted at length.\nI think this section was not intended to permit a person, whose business or calling was not one of those mentioned in the Act, to place goods on his private wharf or yard or in his private store or warehouse, and by giving a receipt, or; more properly speaking, as more applicable, an acknowledgment or certificate, make such a security as this Act contemplates banking companies may acquire and hold as collateral security as provided in the 46th section. The calling of the party being once established, then the form of the acknowledgment or certificate need not be too strictly scanned, if it clearly appears on its face to have been intended to answer the purpose of such a receipt as the statute contemplates, which the documents in this case clearly do; for though certainly awkwardly given in the form of a receipt, an awkward attempt at literal compliance with the statute, I see no reason why they may not be fairly treated as an acknowledgment or certificate, it being by the instrument expressly declared \u201cthis is to be regarded as a receipt under the provisions of the statute 34 Vic. ch. 5, value $7,000.\u201d Nothing could more clearly show that this was, in the words of the statute, \u201cintended to answer the purpose of such receipt,\u201d and by which no person could be misled.\nI am therefore driven to enquire whether W. Snarr who signed the receipt was a warehouseman within the meaning of the statute, or John Snarr & Sons, if the receipt can be considered as signed by or for them. It is not pretended that W. Snarr carried on any business other than as one of the firm of John Snarr & Sons. I have read the evidence with great care, and I fail to discover anything whatever to show that Snarrs or any of them were warehousemen in the sense contemplated by the statute, they were wholesale and retail dealers in coal, pure and simple, and the bank dealt with them as such.\nThe very object of the transaction between the bank and John Snarr & Sons having been to enable the latter to carry on such their business as usual by supplying them with the means of doing so, that is, to enable them to procure coal for the business\u2014such advances to be repaid out of the proceeds of the coal sold in the course of such business\u2014the business was so carried on, the manager of the bank urging that sales should be made, though he does wish it to be understood that the sales were not to be made without his sanction, nor without his receiving the proceeds. No doubt the bank expected to obtain, and supposed the acknowledgments they held would secure to them, the proceeds; but the conduct of the manager and all the testimony in the case forces me to the conclusion that the sole business of the Snarrs, during the period of these transactions, was that of dealers in coal, which was carried on by them in dealing with the coal in question as usual, sales by wholesale and retail being openly made without any objection on the part of the bank, and with nothing whatever in the slightest degree indicating the character of warehousemen apparent in the business.\nThe very nature of the transaction is entirely inconsistent with that of warehousemen. Snarrs were not to hold these goods as warehousemen hold goods. They were to carry on their business by selling the goods. No doubt, both parties may have intended to secure the bank on the coal for the advances made by the bank and ultimately to pay the bank out of the proceeds of this coal, but this could only be done under the statute, in the manner therein prescribed; and as the statute in my opinion clearly applies only to persons engaged in the callings named therein, in which enumeration dealers in coal are not to be found, the Snarrs could not secure the bank in the manner they attempted to do. It has been argued that there was evidence to show that Snarrs were warehousemen outside of the coal business, but, in my opinion, there is nothing in the evidence to justify this contention. Let us refer particularly to the evidence as to the business carried on by John Snarr & Sons.\nCooke, the manager of the bank, is examined, and thus answers the questions put to him:\u2014\nQ. Snarrs\u2019 business was that of coal dealers? A. Coal dealers and wharfingers; I believe they received stone and different things of that kind on consignment or to store.\nQ. Whereabouts? A. On the same wharf where they stored their coal; I think their books show; their clerk showed me once a book containing it, and Mr. Snarr himself told me so if that is anything.\nQ. But so far as your transaction with them, their business was buying coal and selling it wholesale and retail? A. I think so.\nQ. Had they the carts for taking it around the city in the ordinary way? A. I believe so.\nQ. You will have to produce your ledger I am afraid? A. Well, the ledger won\u2019t show it. Mr. Robinson\u2014Mr. Snarr told you they were transacting what sort of business? A. That they were wharfingers who made a considerable sum per annum by storing stone and selling coal in consignments; I do not know whether it was Ohio stone or what stone, but storing it and I think to sell,\nAugustus C. Myers, in the employ of Snarr & Sons, in June, 1877, and book-keeper from February, 1878, a witness called by the defendants, is asked:\nQ. What business was Snarr carrying on besides buying and selling coal? Were they doing warehouse business? A. They had some iron stored on the dock and they charged for the storing of that, and there has been one or two loads of stone put there.\nQ. Stored with them do you mean? A. Put there to dock and haul away in a few days.\nQ. Did they charge for it as wharfingers or warehousemen? A. Yes.\nQ. And did they store much iron for the Rochester Iron Company? A. Well, they did; there was none since the latter part of, since 1876.\nAnd again:\nQ. What was the name of their business? A. Dealers in coal and wood.\nQ. What was the character of their business, was it wholesale or retail? A. Both.\nQ. And had they carts teaming about the city? A. Yes?\nQ. Supplying customers? A. Yes.\nQ. And when they would sell wholesale how would that be carried out? A, Well, they would ship by cars, load cars for other places, and when they would send up to the asylum in large quantities,\nQ. And how much would it take to make a wholesale transaction? A. 10 tons or upwards.\nQ. You do not mean selling to dealers? A. Well, to dealers in other places; Rimer was a dealer.\nQ. He sold to Rimer who was another dealer and they shipped coal to other places. A. Yes.\nQ. I suppose that must have been perfectly well known to any person who took notice to their business, the way it was carried on? A. Yes.\nQ. That was an open transaction and no secrecy about it? A. No.\nMr. McCarthy\u2014You spoke about the business they were carrying on as wharfingers two years ago, that they had stored some stone or iron there? A. Some iron; I take from the book the date but there was one cargo received since I was there.\nQ. When was the last cargo? A. In August, 1877, the schooner \u201cFalcon.\u201d\nQ. Then they stored that as wharfingers? A. Yes, and they got so much a ton delivered.\nQ. Was it for keeping it or receiving it on the wharf? A. Well, for receiving and delivering.\nQ. Did they deliver it? A. Yes.\nQ. Where did they deliver it to? A. It was subject to the order from the bank of Hamilton, it was on account of the Rochester Iron Company, and the bank of Hamilton had the charge of it.\nQ. Were they at any expense delivering it? A. They carted it away on carts principally.\nQ. That was the only transaction of that kind while you were there? A. Yes.\nQ. They had a yard in which they stored coal which they bought and deposited too? A. Yes.\nQ. But they did not store coal or wood for anybody else? A. No.\nQ. What about the stone? A. There was some stone went across the docks also in the same way; it was put on the docks and some sand for Gurney.\nHis LORDSHIP.\u2014Are you saying that they are wharfingers and yet dealers?\nWITNESS.\u2014There was some sand received for Gurney that they received 50 cents a ton, that they received and delivered up to Gurney\u2019s foundry.\nQ. In regard to this wharf matter, Messrs. Snarrs had a wharf there? A. Yes.\nQ. And on that wharf they at one time stored some stone for which they charged? A. There has been stone on the wharf.\nQ. They received it and delivered it? A. Yes.\nQ. And I suppose they charged for the time they kept it there? A. They charged so much a toise; that was charged as delivered.\nQ. Then in regard to the iron, they had that on how many occasions? The first iron was there from the time Milloys gave up the dock to Snarrs.\nQ. That would be February in what year? A. In 1876.\nQ. It was left there by Milloys and turned over to Snarrs, and the second iron was in what year? A. August, 1877.\nQ. Both lots of iron belonged to the Rochester Iron Company? A. Yes.\nQ. And how long did it remain there? A. The last of it appears to have gone out April 30th, 1878. Q. How long would it have been there at that rate? A. About eight months.\nQ. And they charged, I suppose, for storing during that time? A. 50 cents a ton.\nQ. And as far as you know is that all the business they did in storing for people? A. Excepting sand that was received for Gurney, and carted up to his place.\nQ. And they charged for that? A. Yes.\nThen as to his dealings with the coal in question, he thus answers the questions;\nQ. How was that coal sold? A. In all quantities; from half a ton up to 100 tons.\nQ. And when was it sold that way, on through from the 2nd of August? A. Yes.\nQ. And these sales were going on from the time the coal was brought in in the ordinary course of their business? A. Yes.\nQ. And that was in the ordinary course of their business, from half a ton up to 100 tons? A. Yes.\nQ. And any person taking any interest in the way their business was managed could see that? A. It was all open as far as I was concerned.\nQ. It was not all sold just the last month or few months, or six weeks before Snarr absconded? A. No.\nQ. But you were selling up to the very time that he absconded? A. Yes.\nQ. Were you selling in large or small quantities? A. Both wholesale and retail.\nQ. Were you selling 100 tons at a time? A. Not very often, we were shipping by cars, 10 or 20 tons, and were also delivering through the city, but we make a regular abstract from the delivery book.\nThen as to Snarrs\u2019 dealing with the coal in question, the manager of the bank says:\nQ. It was the intention all along that this coal should be disposed of and out of the proceeds the notes should be paid; that was your idea? A. Yes.\nQ. That was the reason the notes were taken at three or four months so as to give an opportunity for disposing of it? A. Yes.\nQ. Was it expected that the coal would be sold during the currency of the notes? A. Yes, that was the intention and the idea.\nQ. Well, then, when the notes matured, but one was partially paid and the others were renewed in full? A. Yes. Q. Were they all four months\u2019 renewals, the first notes, were they four months? A. I think they were all four months.\nQ. What excuse was given for not paying, coal had not been sold or what? A. Some contracts that he had expected to get and had not; he said he expected some large contracts which he had not been able to get.\nQ. Did you take any means to see if the coal was there or not? A. Well, I did not take any special means of getting it measured or examined by any expert.\nQ. Did you do anything? A. I went down to the yard once or twice.\nQ. When the renewals were made? A. No, not at the special moment?\nQ. Were you pressing him to sell so as to retire the paper? A. I repeatedly urged him that I hoped he would get the contracts closed so that we could get the money.\nQ. By getting his contracts closed you meant that he should dispose of the coal? A. Yes.\nQ. And you expected the coal to be sold and in that way to pay the notes? A. Yes.\nQ. Did he renew again, or was that the last renewal? Had he absconded before these notes were renewed? A. Yes; they were only renewed once, they were current at the time.\nQ. One note was due in November and he absconded in the beginning of March? A. Yes; I think one note fell due shortly after he went away.\nQ. Nothing had taken place in the interval during which the notes were current? A. I urged him repeatedly.\nQ. What did you say to him? A. I asked him why he could not sell the coal, why he did not get the contracts, and he said it was a very bad time to sell coal, and he had failed in his endeavour to get these contracts, that he expected to sell it shortly, and gave me various excuses from time to time; I pressed him to try to get offers for the coal.\nQ. As a matter of fact the coal was sold very largely? A. Yes.\nQ. And no return had been made to you for it, that was the fact? A. I believe it was so.\nQ. It is said that you urged him to sell the coal; were they authorized to sell it without your authority? A. No; I did not expect that they would make any contracts to sell it without I authorized it.\nQ. And in regard to the sales, had they any authority by which they could sell this coal retail? A. No, not at all, but I permitted them to sell the coal of the \u201cE.P. Dorr;\u201d that was the only case in which I authorized them to sell, I do not recollect any other. Q. Then I suppose other sales would have been made if they had been large sales? A. I expected they would have come and told me, and I would have taken the notes if good.\nQ. But they had no authority to sell otherwise? A. No.\nQ. In other words, did you give them any authority, generally speaking, without reference to you? A. Not at all.\nMR. MCCARTHY.\u2014Was there any bargain of that kind, or why do you say that? A. I have shown you already that I was very particular in transacting this, and I certainly had many conversations with them.\nQ. I ask you when you made this arrangement if you ever made any such arrangement with the Snarrs that they were not to sell coal without authority? A. I did not say that they were to sell without my authority, but I expected.\nQ. Was there any such arrangement made? A. Yes, there was an arangement made.\nQ. During what time? A. During the currency of these notes.\nQ. Tell me about the date? A. During the currency of these notes.\nQ. Well, the currency was six or seven months? A. Well, say four months\u2014I say the first four months.\nQ. Do you swear that? A. Yes.\nQ. That what was said or done? A. That I repeatedly asked Snarr if he could not sell some of this coal to pay these notes, and he gave me various reasons that he had not been able to sell and so required to renew the notes.\nQ. You told Mr. Robinson that you had a right to control the coal? A. Yes.\nQ. I want to know by what power or agreement you had the right to control the coal? A. I would not pass a cheque of his.\nQ. I understand that you were urging him to sell the coal? A. Yes.\nQ. That was a different thing from telling him that he could not sell it without your authority? A. He spoke of the parties to whom he could sell, and I told him that if he could sell the coal to these parties to do it.\nQ. Then you were urging him to sell to different parties? A. Yes.\nQ. Was there anything else\u2014did you ever tell him that he was not to sell coal without your authority and consent? A. I not know that I told him in so many words.\nQ. Then you did not tell him in so many words\u2014you did not tell him in any other way? A. Why, I told him by refusing.\nQ. Did you tell him in so many words or in any other way that he was not to sell the coal without your authority? A. I do not remember in so many words.\nQ. You were urging him to sell the coal? A. To certain parties; he said he expected a large contract from the hospital.\nQ. And what did you say to that? A. I urged him to sell.\nQ. And anything else? A. There were other large firms that he hoped would buy from him.\nQ. And you urged him to sell? A. Yes, and he was to give me the paper, or promised me the notes of those parties.\nQ. Will you, on your oath, say that you told him at any time not to sell any coal without your consent? A. I do not know that I will say that.\nQ. He told you of different parties and you urged him to sell coal to these different parties? A. Yes.\nQ. And you were anxious that he should sell the coal to these parties? A. Yes.\nQ. Did you ever ask him who he was selling to, or tell him he was not to sell? A. We had many conversations about it.\nQ. I want to come at this: you are aware that he was retailing the coal? A. Yes; retailing some coal.\nQ. Did you know? A. I did not know whether he was retailing hard or soft coal.\nQ. Did you know that he was not retailing this coal? A. That is a strange question to ask; I did not know that he was.\nQ. Did you interest yourself in the least? A. I did, as far as it was necessary for me to do.\nQ. In what way? A. I tell you by asking him if he could not sell to these parties he mentioned.\nQ. Did you take any means of seeing that he was not disposing of this coal? A. No.\nQ. Did you ever ask him whether he was not? A. I did not.\nQ. But you knew he was selling the coal? A. Yes.\nQ. And you never took any means of seeing that he was not selling this coal, is that correct? A. No; I went down to his place once or twice.\nQ. You said a moment ago that you took no means to prevent him selling this coal, is that true? A. Yes; I did not take any means to prevent him selling the coal because I did not know that he was selling and therefore did not think it necessary to take any means; I had no idea that he was selling our coal.\nTaking the whole of this testimony together, it seems to me clear beyond a doubt that the business carried on by Snarrs was that of coal dealers, and coal dealers alone, and that there is nothing whatever to justify the conclusion that these Snarrs ever carried on the business of warehousemen, or, at any rate, that they were warehousemen at the time of this transaction, or in reference thereto. The mere fact of their having in two or three isolated instances, two or three years before this transaction, received, under exceptional circumstances, goods to sell on consignment, or received articles to transmit and to deliver, would not justify their being treated as \u201cengaged in the calling\u201d of warehousemen or any of the callings specified in the statute, more especially as they do not appear to have, in any way, held themselves out as warehousemen, or ever even to have previously to this transaction given a warehouseman\u2019s receipt or document in any such capacity, but who, on the contrary, carried on a well known and well established business of an entirely different character, and in furtherance of which the transaction in question had reference, and which cannot make them, in my opinion, warehousemen in the sense of the 48th section, so as to enable them to give, or the bank to accept, the security contemplated.\nAs to the effect on the public of allowing parties, carrying on business of coal dealers, to give valid and binding receipts or acknowledgments of this kind, it is, in my opinion, contrary to the spirit and policy of the law, and calculated to lead to confusion in mercantile dealings and disastrous results to innocent parties; for, if these receipts are valid securities in the hands of the bank, what is to prevent the bank from following the coal and claiming its value from innocent purchasers from Snarrs, on the ground that Snarrs had wrongfully sold the coal on which the bank held a valid and binding security, and of which such wrongful sale could not deprive them? Surely to such a claim, could not the innocent pur- chaser reply with crushing effect: Snarrs were not engaged in any of the callings mentioned in the statute, but were openly and notoriously engaged in the business of wholesale and retail dealers in coals and none other, in which capacity I dealt with them, and they could not give such a security as the bank claims to hold, therefore the sale was good and sufficient to pass the property.\nIt is abundantly clear that the bank cannot recover in this action unless the security they claim to hold on these coals is strictly within the provisions of the statute, the statute expressly declaring that the bank shall not directly or indirectly deal in buying, selling or bartering goods, and shall not directly or indirectly lend money or make advances or loans upon the security of any goods, wares or merchandise, otherwise than that in accordance with the statute and as authorized thereby.\nSTRONG,J.:\nI am unable to agree with the learned judges of the Court of Appeal, who held that the documents called warehouse receipts under which the appellants claimed title to the coal in question in this suit were not good and valid instruments of title under the 48th section of the Banking Act of 1871. That they were intended to be effectual under the statute is declared on their face. The statement that the coal had been received from the bank was in a sense true, since it had originally been consigned to the bank. By the words \u201cto be delivered to the order of the said Merchants bank\u201d the Snarrs expressly acknowledged that they held the coal as the property of the bank. I am therefore of opinion that these instruments were acknowledgments intended to answer the purposes of a receipt within the meaning of those terms as used in the 48th section of the Banking Act of 1871. I differ from the learned judges of the court below, who held that, in order to make a receipt, acknowledgment, or certificate, given by any of the persons engaged in the callings mentioned in this section, who are also the owners of the goods, effectual, there must be a person interposed between them and the bank, and that the acknowledgment cannot be directly given to the bank. It is declared that an acknowledgment, certificate, or receipt, given by a wharfinger, or warehouseman, who is himself the owner of the goods, shall be as effectual as if he were not both owner and wharfinger or warehouseman, and if the owner and wharfinger or warehouseman were not \u201cone and the same person\u201d then such a receipt or acknowledgement as this given to the owner would be a valid charge upon the property in the hands of the bank if transferred to it by indorsement. I consider that the statute cannot be construed as requiring an indorsement in the case of an acknowledgment given by a warehouseman owner, for such a form would be inappropriate and meaningless. What I consider this 48th section to authorize is, that an owner, who is engaged in the calling of a warehouseman or wharfinger and has the goods in his own possession, may by a certificate or acknowledgment given directly to the bank, effect the same purposes as may be attained by a receipt given by a warehouseman to the owner (when they are different persons) and by the latter transferred to the bank. This is the only sensible construction which we can place on the statute and we are bound to interpret it ut res magis valeat quam pereat, which we should not do if we held otherwise.\nTo say that there must be a person interposed between the bank and the wharfinger, for which no good reason can be suggested, would be to add to the words of the sections, which do not point out to whom the acknow- ledgment or certificate is to be given, but merely say that any acknowledgment so intended to answer the purposes of a receipt shall be good; therefore, there, being no reason for requiring the intervention of another person between the owner and the bank, all we have to ascertain is, whether the instrument given was intended to answer the same purposes as a receipt would have answered, if there had been a separation of the characters of owner and warehouseman, and this is plainly shown both by the form of the instrument and the nature of the transaction.\nIf an endorsement were requisite to complete the title of the bank, it would be of course for a Court of Equity, (and this suit was instituted as a suit in equity,) to direct that the title of the bank, as holders for value, should be completed by an. indorsement, as is done in a case of a transfer for value of a bill payable to order, where, by reason of the omission to indorse, the transferee is not clothed with the legal title. And this equitable right the bank would have against the plaintiff, who is an assignee in insolvency and not a purchaser of the coal for valuable consideration.\nBut for another reason, upon which the judgment of Mr. Justice Patterson also proceeds, I have come to the conclusion that the judgment appealed from should be affirmed. The 48th section can have no application unless the insolvents, the Snarrs, are proved to have been persons engaged in the \u201ccalling of warehousemen or wharfingers,\u201d and the evidence shows they were not such persons but dealers in coal and wood. The witness, Myers, who had been book-keeper of the insolvents, says, they were \u201cdealers in coal and wood.\u201d It is true that it is shewn that there was some iron on the wharf when they got possession of it from Milloy for which they received wharfage, and that another lot of iron was received by them, after they got possession, and also charged for, and that on one occasion some sand and on another some stone was received at the wharf; but these three or four occasional and isolated transactions do not show that they were persons engaged in the calling of wharfingers or warehousemen. Further, I cannot agree that William Snarr is to be considered as having been a warehouseman for the firm, the warehouse and wharf were really the leasehold of the firm and the nominal title only was in William Snarr.\nUpon the constitutional question I refrain from expressing any opinion, its determination, in the view of the case which I take, not being requisite for the decision of the present appeal, and in doing so I act upon the principle laid down in the Privy Council in Parsons v. Citizens\u2019 Ins. Co.[18], and which was also acted upon in the Western Counties Ry. v. Windsor & Annapolis Ry. Co.[19]\nThe receipts being for the reason given inoperative under the Banking Act, the respondent, as assignee in insolvency of the Snarrs, and being in that capacity the representative of the creditors, is entitled to insist upon the provisions of the Ontario Chattel Mortgage Act, which avoids these instruments considered as mere equitable assignments outside of the Banking Act.\nI am of opinion that the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nFOURNIER, J.:\u2014\nIn this case I entirely agree with the reasons given by the learned Chancellor on all points. As to the fact of Snarr being a warehouseman, I adopt the finding of the learned judge who tried the case. True, the evidence is not very strong, but still evidence of several transactions by Snarr as a warehouseman was given; the law does not say how many transactions shall be deemed necessary to qualify a person as a keeper of a yard, a warehouseman, &c.\nThen as to the receipt, although not exactly in the form of the statute, still Snarr intended it to meet the requirements of the statute, and if it had been necessary to amend it, the court could have directed it to be amended as prayed for by the appellants. The respondent, being the assignee of Snarr, cannot impeach the form of the receipt any more than Snarr could have done had the latter been a party to this suit.\nThe question has been raised as to the constitutionality of certain sections of the Banking Act, as being an encroachment on civil rights, as they provide the means of making contracts with banks. No doubt contracts entered into with banks under the Banking Act are encroachments on civil rights or civil law, but such encroachments have been declared to be legal and constitutional by the Privy Council in the case of Dupuy v. Cushing[20]. For, when legislating upon subject-matter exclusively assigned by the British North America Act to the Dominion Parliament, civil rights, and even civil procedure, will necessarily be interfered with, and the conclusion arrived at by the Privy Council in that case of Dupuy v. Cushing is perfectly applicable to this case; here the Dominion Parliament, legislating on the subject-matter of banking, interfere with civil rights by saying that banks may take certain receipts as collateral security for the payment of any debt which may become due to the bank under credit opened by the bank for the holder of such receipt; and as held by the Privy Council in Dupuy v. Cushing:\nIt is a necessary implication that the Imperial statute, in assigning to the Dominion Parliament the subjects of bankruptcy and insolvency, intended to confer upon it legislative power to interfere with property, civil rights and procedure within the provinces, so far as a general law relating to these subjects might affect them.\nIf so, how can it be said that the Dominion Parliament cannot, by a general law on banking, passed in order to facilitate commerce, provide certain forms of receipts or certificates which shall be considered to be valid instruments upon which parties may obtain money from banks? I do not think this question to be susceptible of argument since the decisions of the Privy Council. I am of opinion that these sections of the Banking Act are intra vires of the Dominion Parliament. For these reasons, I am for allowing the appeal.\nHENRY, J.:\nIn deciding as to the rights of the parties in this case, it is necessary to consider the bearing upon it of the Acts passed in Canada previous to 1867, and the Act of the Dominion, intituled \u201cBanks and Banking\u201d (34 Vic., ch. 5), or rather the 46th and the four next succeeding sections of it. Section 14 of the first-mentioned Act is as follows:\nAny cove receipt, bill of lading, specification of timber, or any receipt given by a cove keeper, miller or by the keeper of a warehouse, wharf, yard, harbor or other place, for cereal grains, goods, wares or merchandise laid up, stored or deposited in or on the cove, mill, warehouse, wharf, yard, harbor or other place in this Province of which he is keeper; or any bill of lading or receipt given by a master of a vessel, or by a carrier for carrying cereal grains, goods, wares, or merchandise shipped in such vessels, or delivered to such carrier for carriage from any place whatever, to any part of this province or through the same, or on the waters bordering thereon, or from the same to any place whatever, and whether such cereal grains are to be delivered upon such receipt in specie or converted into flour, may, by endorsement thereon by the owner of, or person entitled to receive such cereal grains, goods, wares or merchandise, or his attorney or agent, be transferred to any private person as collateral security for any debt due to such private person, and being so endorsed shall vest in such private person from the date of such endorsement, all the right and title of the endorser to or in such cereal grains, goods, wares or merchandise, subject to, the right of the endorser to have the same re-transferred to him, if such debt is paid when due.\nIt will be observed that by the term \u201cprivate person,\u201d used in the first mentioned act, banks were excluded from its operation. Section 46 of the Dominion Act before mentioned, in language similar in substance and nearly verbatim, extended the provisions of the previous act to banks; but instead of permitting them to take an endorsement of a receipt for a debt already due, as might be done by a private person under the first mentioned act, they were only authorized to take a receipt:\nAs collateral security for the due payment of any bill of exchange or note discounted by such bank in the regular course of its banking business, or for any debt which may become due to the bank under any credit opened or liability incurred by the bank for or on behalf of the holder or owner of such bill of lading, specification or receipt, or for any other debt to become due to the bank.\nThe coal, which is the subject of contention in this case, with a large quantity besides, was shipped for parties named Snarr, who subsequently became insolvent, and the respondent became assignee of their estate in bankruptcy, It was, however, consigned to the bank, who paid for it. The latter, having paid for it, had by agreement a lien on the shipments of coal for the advances made, and indorsed the bills of lading to the Snarrs, who kept a coal warehouse from which they sold, upon obtaining from them receipts signed by W. Snarr, such as the following:\nReceived in store in Big Coal House warehouse, at Toronto, from Merchants\u2019 Bank of Canada, at Toronto, (so many tons stove coal and so many tons chestnut coal) per schooners (naming them) to be delivered to the order of the said Merchants Bank to be endorsed hereon. This is to be regarded as a receipt under the provisions of statute 34 Vic., ch. 5, value $7,000. The said coal in sheds facing the esplanade, is separate from, and will be kept separate and distinguishable from other coal.\nDated 10th August, 1878. W. Snarr. W. Snarr was a member of the insolvent firm, and lessee of the wharf and of the warehouse wherein the coal was stored.\nNo part of it was delivered to the bank or upon their order. Instead of being kept separate, as agreed upon, the Snarrs placed it with other coal of their own, and sold from the warehouse and bins without regard to their agreement.\nWhen the Snarrs became insolvent, the respondent, as assignee, took possession of the coal remaining unsold in the warehouse, and sold it, or the greater part of it, under an agreement with the appellants that he should pay the proceeds of the hard coal into the appellants\u2019 bank at Toronto to the joint credit of the appellants and respondent without prejudice to the rights of either party in respect to the same. The question now is, who is entitled to the amount so paid into the bank, and subsequently paid into court, and also as to any coal of the description specified in the receipts remaining in the warehouse or sold subsequently by the respondent?\nQuestions have been raised as to the validity of the receipts as what are commonly known warehouse receipts under the statutes referred to. Before, however, considering the validity of the receipts it is important to consider the question of the ownership of the coal before the Snarrs were placed in possession of it. It having been consigned to the bank, who paid for it and had a lien upon it, as security for the money advanced, the property in it and the right to the possession of it vested in the bank; and the Snarrs could obtain no title to or possession of it, except through the bank. The latter gave them no right or title to it, but merely gave them the custody of it as warehousemen to be kept separate from any other coal, and to be delivered to the order of the bank, just as they might have done to any other person having the means of storing it. No property in it passed to the Snarrs or out of the bank and, independently of the validity of the so called warehouse receipts, the property in the coal was in the bank; but the receipts are evidence of the terms under which the Snarrs got possession of the coal, and which shows plainly that they got such solely as the bailees of the bank. It is true that under the arrangements the Snarrs had an equitable claim to obtain the coal on repayment of the bank\u2019s advances, and that equitable claim was all that went to their assignee. If then the Snarrs\u2019 had no title to or property in the coal, except as I have said, how can their assignee claim any? The latter can only have the property, rights, and interests of the insolvents to deal with. The Snarrs would be estopped by their agreement contained in the receipts from making any claim of property in the coal until the advances were repaid or tendered to the bank, and the same estoppel meets their assignee. Independently, then, of the receipts, as warehouse receipts under the statute, the appellants should be adjudged to have been the owners of the coal and as such entitled to our judgment.\nThe statute of Canada first mentioned is still in force in Canada, as far as I can discover. The Dominion statute does not in any way repeal or alter it, but merely extends it to banks. They adopt the wording of the previous acts and provide that:\nThe bank may acquire and hold any cove receipt, or any receipt by a cove keeper or by the keeper of any wharf, yard, harbor or place, any bill of lading, any specification of timber or any receipt given for cereal grains, goods, wares or merchandise, stored or deposited in any cove, wharf, yard, harbor, warehouse, mill or other place in Canada, as collateral security for any debt to become due to the bank.\nIt will be noticed that the receipt is not required to be signed by a warehouseman. It is valid if signed \u201cby the keeper of any wharf, yard, harbor or other place.\u201d The receipts in evidence in this case were signed by W. Snarr, who is proved to have been the lessee of the warehouse in which the coal was deposited; and that to my mind is sufficient, as soon as he receives goods, wares or merchandize to be warehoused and held for another party; but there is evidence of W. Snarr being a warehouse keeper for other parties at different times before the signing of the receipt. The Act does not mention \u201cwarehousemen\u201d as necessary parties to give receipts; but, on the contrary, the term is not even used to indicate the party or parties by whom they are to be signed. What right, therefore, has any court to require that a receipt, to be valid, should be signed by one who has a warehouse in which goods are frequently deposited.\nWe must get at the objects of the Legislature by giving to the words of an Act their proper and ordinary meaning: but we have no right to attribute to the legislature any intention but what is fairly deducible from the words used. To require then more than I have said would, in my opinion, be requiring what was not intended or provided for.\nIf the bank, by way of lien, had the property in the coal and the possession of it, what law would prevent them from storing it for safe keeping in any store, warehouse, or place they pleased and taking an accountable receipt therefor? And having such a receipt as the statute prescribes, what objection could be raised if the bank assigned it to another bank within the provisions of the statute? For the bank to store or deposit the coal as was done in this case no statutory provision was necessary. In doing so the bank would be only exercising a common law right over their own property.\nThe Dominion statute provided in terms for the assignment to banks of receipts obtained by other parties, and to enable such parties to transfer the property mentioned as security to the banks making advances to them.\nThe prohibitory provisions of section 40 of the Banking Act before mentioned do not apply to the circumstances of this case. The bank did not lend money to the Snarrs upon the security of the receipts. The money had been previously lent and no mortgage or hypothecation was given by the Snarrs to the bank. The bank held the property under the bills of lading and had a lien upon it for their advances to pay for it, which they might hold. They were not trading with the property as prohibited by that section, but having advanced the money to pay for it, it was held as collateral security for the payment of certain notes then running. I see nothing in law or equity to prevent their doing so.\nThe question of the validity of the provisions to be found in section 46 and succeeding ones on the ground that they constitute an interference with the functions of the Local Legislatures under the British North America Act, which gives to the latter the right to legislate in relation to \u201cproperty and civil rights in the province,\u201d has been raised. The previous section (91) of that Act, however, gives to parliament the right to legislate in regard to \u201cthe regulation of trade and commerce, and banking, incorporation of banks, and the issue of paper money,\u201d and the concluding clause of section 91 provides: that\nAny matter coming within any of the classes of subjects enumerated in this section shall not be deemed to come within the class of matters of a local or private nature comprised in the enumeration of the classes of subjects by this Act assigned to the legislatures of the provinces.\nThe subjects of \u201cbanking\u201d and incorporation of banks give, and no doubt the section intended to give, to Parliament full and exclusive powers to deal with those subjects, and I cannot for a moment believe that the power to deal with \u201cproperty and civil rights in the province\u201d was intended in any way to interfere with or control the action of Parliament in respect of the subject of banking. It is the policy of the Act to give exclusive jurisdiction in legislation, either to Parliament or to the legislatures of the provinces. It was impossible to specify in detail the extent of the powers of either so as to remove all doubts, and therefore the several provisions of the whole Act and its object must, in many cases, be fully considered to enable a right judgment to be formed. If the provisions of section 46 and those following it were necessary in the interests of the country, what power existed in the local legislatures to enact them, affecting as they do the subjects of \u201cbanking and incorporation of banks,\u201d given exclusively to Parliament. We must, I think, conclude that when the two subjects were placed within the powers of Parliament, without any limitation, no limitation was intended, and that everything necessarily connected with banking should be within the powers of Parliament; although interfering, in some respects, with \u201cproperty and civil rights.\u201d There are many of the subjects in section 91 given to Parliament, which to as great an extent as in the case I am now considering, interfere in some respects with \u201cproperty and civil rights;\u201d \u201cnavigation and shipping,\u201d \u201cinland fisheries,\u201d \u201cbills of exchange and promissory notes,\u201d \u201cbankruptcy and insolvency,\u201d and others I might mention as amongst the number; and if Parliament had not the power to pass the Act in question in regard to the receipts referred to in section 46, because of interference with the matters of \u201cproperty and civil rights,\u201d it would indeed be but consistent to say that for the same reason Parliament had not the exclusive right to deal fully with the several subjects I have just referred to or any of them. I could give further reasons for sustaining the legislation referred to, but I consider it unnecessary to do so. The concluding clause of section 91, which I have quoted, was evidently intended to remove any reasonable doubt as to the plenary powers intended to be given to Parliament in regard to all the subjects in that section enumerated, and to subordinate to them the powers given to the legislatures as far as is necessary to legislate in regard to the subjects so enumerated.\nOne other question remains, as to the identity and ownership of the coal remaining in the warehouse when the Snarrs became insolvent. The law, however, is well settled. It is shown that the Snarrs improperly mixed the coal they received under the bills of lading assigned to them by the bank, and which W. Snarr agreed to keep separate, with coal of their own of the same kind, so that the one could not be distinguished from the other. Under such circumstances, the bank was entitled to the mixed coal to the extent of the quantity the Snarrs received under the transfers of the bills of lading. As the quantity left in the warehouse and taken possession of by the respondent was less than the quantity so received by the Snarrs, the bank is entitled to the whole sum paid into court.\nFor the reasons I have given, and for those others contained in the judgment of the learned chancellor who tried this case, I am of opinion that the judgment of the Appeal Court should be reversed, and the decree of the learned Chancellor affirmed with costs.\nTASCHEREAU, J.:\nI am of opinion that Snarr, having been found by the judge at the trial to be a warehouseman, and there being on the record some evidence in support of that verdict, which evidence stands entirely uncontradicted, he must be held by this court to be such a warehouseman.\nI am also of opinion that the warehouse receipt in the case is sufficient under the Act, and that the property of the coal duly passed to the bank in virtue of such receipt. If deficient in form, the Snarrs or their assignee cannot take advantage of it, because they had covenanted to give a good receipt.\nThe sections in question of the Banking Act are, in my opinion, clearly within the legislative power of the Dominion Parliament. I would allow the appeal, and restore the first judgment.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellants: Smith, Smith & Rae.\nSolicitor for respondent: John Leys.\n[1] 8 Ont.

But if the mark made indicates no design of complying with the law, but on the contrary a clear intent not to mark with a cross as the law directs, as for instance by making a straight line or round O, then such non-compliance with the law renders the ballot null.\nDivision I, Sombra\u2014During the progress of the voting, at the request of one of the agents, who thought the ballot papers were not being properly marked, the deputy returning officer, who had been putting his initials and the numbers on the counterfoil not on the ballot papers, initialled and numbered about twelve of the ballot papers, but finding he was wrong, at the close of the poll, he, in good faith and with an anxious desire to do his duty, and in such a way as not to allow any person to see the front of the ballot paper, and with the assent of the agents of both parties, took these ballots out of the box and obliterated the marks he had put upon them.\nHeld,\u2014(Gwynne and Henry, JJ., dissenting,) that the irregularities complained of, not having infringed upon the secrecy of the ballot, and the ballots being unquestionably those given by the deputy returning officer to the voters, these ballots should be held good, and that said irregularities came within the saving provisions of sec. 80 of the Dominion Elections Act, 1874, Jenkins v. Brecken followed, 7 Can. s. C. R. 247.\nPer Henry, J., that although the ballots should be considered bad, the present appellant, having acted upon the return and taken his seat, was not in a position to claim that the election was void.\nThe Judge at the trial refused to allow a witness to be examined on a supplemental charge of a corrupt practice before the evidence on the principal charges had been closed.\nHeld.\u2014That it was in the discretion of the Judge when to receive the evidence, and as no tender of it was subsequently made, the refusal of the Judge could not be made the subject of appeal,\nAppeal from the judgment of Galt, J., rendered on the 12th January, 1884, declaring that the appellant (J. J. Hawkins,) was not duly elected a member of the House of Commons for the electoral district of Bothwell, but that the Honorable David Mills was elected, dismissing the petition against the respondent James Stephens (the returning officer at said election,) with costs to be paid by the petitioners, and giving judgment in favor of the petitioners with costs to be paid by the appellant (J. J. Hawkins), other than the costs of the said J. Stephens, which were directed to be paid by the petitioners.\nThe petition, pleadings, and the facts of the case fully appear in the judgments hereinafter given, and more particularly in the judgment appealed from, which is as follows:\n\"GALT, J.:\u2014The petition, briefly stated, charges the returning officer Stephens with having \"wilfully, unlawfully, and improperly neglected and refused to include in his addition of the votes the number of votes given for each candidate from the statements in the ballot boxes returned by two of the deputy returning officers, and which two statements gave the Hon. David Mills a majority of votes over those given for the said John Joseph Hawkins, the result of which was to give to the respondent Hawkins a majority of votes. \"The petition further charges the returning officer with having improperly and unlawfully permitted the deputy returning officers for certain polling sub-divisions after the ballot boxes were opened to amend or put in statements as to the voting at their polling subdivisions, and in adding up and determining the number of votes for each candidate, which gave the respondent, Hawkins, a majority. That the returning officer declared the said Hawkins elected and declared his intention of making his return to the writ of election accordingly, whereupon proceedings were, within the time in that behalf limited by the 14th section of 41 Vic., duly taken to have a final addition or summing up of said votes made by the proper judge in that behalf, and such proceedings were thereupon had before such judge that the number of votes given for each candidate, from the statements contained in the several ballot boxes returned by the deputy returning officers, was re-summed up, and the said judge duly certified to the said returning officer, that upon adding and summing up the votes given at the said election for the respective candidates, as shewn by the said statements, he found and declared that 1,576 votes were given for the said Mills, and 1,564 for said Hawkins, and that the said Mills was elected for the said electoral district by a majority of 12 votes; that thereupon it became the duty of the said returning officer to declare the said Mills elected, and to make his return to the said writ accordingly; but that he unlawfully and improperly refused to declare the said Mills elected, but made a special return to the writ in which he declared the said Hawkins as having a majority of votes, and setting forth the foregoing certificate of the learned judge, but that he, the returning officer, had been served with no certificate of a re-count of said ballots, nor had the said ballots been re-counted. The petitioners then allege that the said Mills had a majority of the votes, and claim the seat for the said Mills. The petition then charges corrupt practices, etc., etc.\n\"The answer of the respondent Hawkins may be shortly stated to be that he was duly elected, that his majority had been reduced by the improper conduct of certain of the deputy returning officers, that the judge of the county court had improperly refused to recount the ballots, and charging corrupt practices, etc., etc.\n\"The answer of the respondent Stephens sets out the circumstances under which he refused to count the votes given in No. 3 Division of Dawn, and in No. 1 Camden, but as I shall have occasion to refer to these cases at length it is unnecessary to set forth the particulars of the defence, and he denies all improper conduct on his part. After the case was at issue an order was made for the production of all the ballots and papers, and the whole of the ballots were examined and corrected before me at the trial, so that, except in so far as the returning officer is concerned, the course pursued by the deputy returning officer, in either signing or omitting to sign the different statements of votes, is of no consequence. The result of the counting before me showed a majority in favor of Mr. Mills of 9, the totals being for Mills 1,574, and for Hawkins 1,565.\n\"There are three sub-divisions at which the statements of votes were in question before me, viz.: No. 3 Dawn, No. 1 Sombra, and No. 1 Camden. The facts as regard No. 3 Dawn are very simple, there was no statement of votes either signed or unsigned in the ballot box, and consequently the returning officer very properly refused to include them in his addition of the votes, and, singular to say, when the different parcels were opened each of the votes must have been rejected, the deputy returning officer having endorsed on each ballot paper the number of the voter on the voter's list, so that there could be no difficulty whatever in ascertaining how each elector had voted; fortunately this mistake cannot be said to have had any effect on the result, as the numbers were so close, there being a difference of only five in favor of Mr. Mills. These votes are not included, either in the count before the returning officer, the re-summing up of the votes by the learned judge of the county court, nor in the re-count before myself.\n\"Division 1, Sombra: The returning officer included the votes in this division in his count so that he has nothing to answer respecting it. When the packages of ballots for this division were opened and examined before me it was found that none of the ballot papers were initialled by the deputy returning officer, and Mr. Cameron contended that all these votes should be disallowed.\n\"The gentleman who had acted as agent for Mr. Hawkins was examined as a witness; he stated that the deputy returning officer had put his initials and the numbers on the counterfoil, not on the ballot paper; this was precisely what was done in the case of Jenkins v. Brecken, reported in the current volume of Supreme Court reports, and on the authority of that case I overruled the objection. The witness, however, stated that he told the deputy returning officer he thought this was wrong, that he put no mark on the ballot; the officer looked over the Act, but found nothing to satisfy his mind; he did, however, initial and number some of the ballot papers, about twelve, but when at the close of the day he took these ballots out of the box he carefully obliterated the mark he had put upon them Mr. Cameron then urged that these must necessarily be rejected as the deputy returning officer had no right to interfere in any way with the ballots after they had been placed in the box, and that as it was not known for which of the candidates the votes had been given the whole should be disallowed, and therefore the election should be declared void, as it could not be said that the disallowance of these votes might not change the majority. It is quite plain that whatever the deputy returning officer did, he did in good faith and with an anxious desire to do his duty; no person was allowed to see the front of the ballot papers, and as there can be no reason for supposing they were not the very papers furnished by him and used by the voters, I see no reason why they should now be rejected. I may say I looked at the ballot papers when they were before me, and I could see no trace of any mark on any of them. The deputy returning officer was not examined, I presume, because, on the evidence given by the respondents' agent, I had overruled the objection.\nThe case of division 1, Camden, remains to be considered. This is by far the most important, as it was in conseqence of the returning officer refusing to count these votes, the respondent Hawkins appeared to have a majority and was declared elected by the respondent Stephens. It was represented to me by Meredith, Q.C., who appeared for Mr. Stephens, that that gentleman had been bitterly attacked and all sorts of improper motives imputed to him, and he was desirous of giving his evidence to exonerate himself from all such charges. The evidence on this part of the case (that is to say the re-count of the votes) had been closed when this was said. I told Mr. Meredith I could see no evidence whatever of any improper conduct on the part of the returning officer; he appeared to me to have acted with a desire to do his duty, and that it was quite unnecessary for him to refute charges which, in my opinion, had no foundation; and if he had made a mistake in rejecting the statement in question it was after he had exercised an impartial judgment. When the returning officer on the day appointed proceeded to add up the votes as set forth in the statement enclosed in the ballot boxes, it was found that in several cases the statements were unsigned; the returning officer stated that he did not feel authorized to add in the votes set forth in these statements. On this being said, several of the deputy returning officers who were present came forward and signed their statements, which were then received and counted by the returning officer. These statements are all in the form under sec. 57. The deputy returning officer for 1 division, Camden, was not present, and he swore that he had been advised to be absent from home on that day; the consequence was that the returning officer refused to accept the statement contained in the ballot box, and virtually disfranchised all the voters in that division. It was proved that the gentleman who had acted as agent for Mr. Mills at this poll, and who had received a certificate from the deputy returning officer, under sec. 58 of 37 Vic. ch. 9, signed by him, produced the certificate to the returning officer and desired him to accept that in lieu of the unsigned statement; this he refused to do, and, in my opinion, acted properly in so doing, as there is nothing in the Act which authorizes him to act on anything but the statement contained in the ballot box The simple questions then are: \u2014Should the returning officer have acted on the unsigned statement, and if not, should he have acted on the certificate of the re-summation by the learned judge of the county court? The answer to these questions are of no consequence now so far as the election is concerned, as all the ballots have been re-counted, but they are of importance to the returning officer.\n\"By sec. 10 of 41 Vic., amending sec. 55 of 37 Vic., ch. 9\u2014\n\"Immediately after the close of the poll the deputy returning officer shall open the ballot box and proceed to count the number of votes given for each candidate. In doing so he shall reject all ballot papers which have not been supplied by the deputy returning officer, all those by which votes have been given for more candidates than are to be elected, and all those upon which there is any writing or mark by which the vote could be identified. The other ballot papers being counted and a list kept of the number of votes given to each candidate and of the number of rejected ballot papers, all the ballot papers indicating the votes given for each candidate respectively shall be put into separate envelopes or parcels; and those rejected, those spoiled and those unused shall each be put into a different envelope or parcel, and all those parcels being endorsed so as to indicate their contents shall be put back into the ballot box.\n\"By sec. 57 of 37 Vic., ch. 9\u2014\nThe deputy returning officer shall make out a statement of the accepted ballot papers, of the number of votes given to each candidate, of the rejected ballot papers, of the spoiled and returned ballot papers, and of those unused and returned by him, and he shall make and keep by him a copy of such statement, and enclose in the ballot box the original statement, together with the voter's list, and a certified statement at the foot of each list of the total number of electors who voted on each such list, and such other lists and documents as may have been used at such election. The ballot box shall then be locked and sealed and shall be delivered to the returning officer, or to the election clerk, who shall receive or collect the same. \"The deputy returning officer and the poll clerk shall respectively take the oaths in forms Q. and R. to this Act, which shall be annexed to the statement above mentioned.\"\n\"The statement found in the ballot box is as follows:\n'Statement under sec. 55.\n'Election for the electoral district of Bothwell, held on Tuesday, the 20th day of June, 1882.\nVotes given for Hawkins,\n44\nVotes given for Mills,\n72\nRejected,\n5\nUnused,\n101\nSpoiled,\n1\n'I certify the within statement to be correct.\n'Deputy Returning Officer.'\"\n\"On this being produced, Mr. Cameron objected that there is no statement under 57, that this is a statement under sec. 55, but not signed by the deputy returning officer, and that there is no affidavit annexed. No statement is signed under sec. 55, what is required by that section is that upon opening the ballot box the deputy returning officer shall proceed to count the number of votes given for each candidate, and to reject certain votes; then the other ballot papers being counted and a list kept of the number of votes given to each candidate and of the other ballot papers, shall each be put into a separate envelope, and all these parcels shall be put back into the ballot box; nothing is said about placing the list in the ballot box. Then comes sec. 56, which has no bearing on this question; and then sec. 57, which requires a statement of the number of votes etc.; and by sec. 59 the returning officer shall 'add together the number of votes given for each candidate from the statements contained in the several ballot boxes returned by the deputy returning officers.' This, therefore, is the only mode by which the returning officer can make his return, as he has no authority to re-count or even inspect the different parcels. I have examined the forms furnished to the deputy returning officer, not only in this division, but also at the other divisions in which the returning officer allowed the statements to be signed. In all these cases I find forms under sec. 55, and one under sec. 57, so that it appears impossible that a deputy returning officer could with the slightest attention to his duty make a mistake between them. It appears to me there were two under sec. 55 and one under sec. 57. I have already pointed out that there is no statement required under sec. 55, but these forms are used in giving certificates to the agents of the candidates. The certificate given to the agent of Mr. Mills was produced; it is exactly the same, the writing the same and the figures the same, as that found in the ballot box, which is unsigned. I was under the impression at the trial, not having had an opportunity of ascertaining the difference between the statements contained in the paper furnished to the deputy returning officer, that the only error was in the deputy returning officer having omitted to sign a proper statement. I find now that I was mistaken. There was no statement prepared under section 57, and moreover, as was urged by Mr. Cameron, there was no affidavit annexed to the unsigned statement. It is true there was an affidavit in the prescribed form, but it was not annexed to any statement or other paper, and it is specially required by section 57 that it shall be annexed to the statement required by that section, and by which alone the returning officer is to be guided in adding up the votes. I find, therefore, the returning officer was right when he refused to count the so-called statement in his recapitulation of votes.\n\"The question that remains is, whether the returning officer was justified in returning Mr. Hawkins after receiving the certificate of the learned judge of the County Court. By section 14, 41 Vic., ch. 6, 'in case it is made to appear within four days after that on which the returning officer has made the final addition of the votes for the purpose of declaring the candidate elected, on the affidavit of any credible witness, to the County Judge of any county in which the electoral district, or any part thereof, is situated, that such witness believes that any deputy returning officer at any election in such electoral district in counting the votes has improperly counted or rejected any ballot papers at such election, or that the returning officer has improperly summed up the votes, etc., the said judge shall appoint a time, within four days after the receipt of the said affidavit by him, to re-count the votes, or to make the final addition, as the case may be, and shall give notice in writing to the candidates, or their agents, of the time and place at which he will proceed to re-count the same, or to make such final addition, as the case may be, and shall summon and command the returning officer and his election clerk to attend then and there with the parcels containing the ballots used at the election, which command the returning officer and his election clerk shall obey.'\n\"It is plain from the foregoing that there are two courses open to a party interested in disputing the return, and these depend on the nature of the objection. The returning officer, having no control over the ballots, has nothing to do with them or a recount of them, but he is responsible that his addition of the different statements is correct; if therefore the complaint is against the action of the returning officer it must necessarily be for a re-summation. But if the objection is that the ballots themselves have been mis-counted or improperly counted by the deputy returning officers, then there must be a re-count of the ballots, and the learned judge is, by the 4th sub-section, directed to re-count the votes according to the rules set forth in section 55 of the Dominion Elections Act of 1874. Within the time limited by the Act, application was made to the learned judge for a re-summation of the statements, not for a recount of the votes, on the ground that the returning officer had improperly refused to count the statements from 3 Dawn and 1 Camden; the learned judge thereupon made the following order, addressed to the candidates, the returning officer and the election clerk:\n\"'You are hereby required to take notice that I, on the application of Matthew Wilson, Esq., solicitor for David Mills, one of the candidates at said election, and on reading the affidavit, etc., have appointed Monday, the twenty-sixth day of June, A.D. 1882, at the hour of eleven, in the forenoon, at my chambers in the town of Chatham, to make the final addition of votes taken at said election on 20th June, 1882, and that at said time and place I will proceed to make such final addition, etc.\"\n\"The parties did attend before the learned judge, upon which occasion a protest was delivered by Mr. Atkinson, as counsel for respondent Hawkins, protesting against any alteration being made in the return, unless on a general re-count of the votes. This objection was over-ruled by the learned judge, who made the following order:\u2014\n\"'Pursuant to an appointment and order made by me on 24th June, 1882, and in the presence of David Mills and John Joseph Hawkins, and of James Stephens, returning officer, and Charles Stephens, election clerk, and after hearing counsel for all parties, and adding and summing up the vote given at said election for the respective candidates, as shewn by the statements of the various deputy returning officers, I find and declare that fifteen hundred and seventy-six votes were given at said election for said David Mills, and fifteen hundred and sixty-four votes for said John Joseph Hawkins, and that the said David Mills is elected for said electoral district by a majority of twelve votes. To which I hereby certify, and of all of which I notify you, the said James Stephens, returning officer.'\" \"This result was obtained by adding to each of the candidates the number of votes given at No. 1, Camden, there being no mistake in the original summation by the returning officer.\n\"The returning officer made a special return to the Clerk of the Crown in Chancery, setting out all the facts and concluding: 'I have not been served with any certificate by the Judge of the County Court of the county of Kent of the result of the re-count of votes made by him, as provided by sub-section four of section sixty-seven of said act, nor with any other certificate or document other than the paper marked B, hereto annexed.\u2014(already set out.)\n\"'Having received no certificate of a re-count of ballots, or of a result of a re-count of the votes at said election, as provided in sub-section four of section sixty-seven of said Act, I have deemed it my duty under the circumstances set out in this, my report, to allow the declaration made by me to stand, and make the return accompanying this report, and which return is so made upon the grounds and for the reasons mentioned in this my report.'\"\n\"For the reasons already given, I consider that on an application for a resummation only, the learned judge has nothing to do with the deputy returning officer; his duty is simply to reconsider the addition of the different statements as made by the returning officer. In the present case the recapitulation of votes made by that officer stated that there was no statement signed by the deputy returning officer at division 1, Camden, and therefore the learned judge should have taken some steps to ascertain the number of votes given at that division before altering the recapitulation of the returning officer; and this could only have been done by a re-count of the ballots, as there was no statement with an affidavit annexed, nor in truth any statement under section 57 of the statute; and he should have certified the result to the returning officeer. This was not done, and I therefore think the latter was not bound, nor would he have been justified in altering his return. It is to be observed the returning officer, in his return to the clerk of the crown in chancery, set forth fully all the circumstances of the case, and it does appear to me that so far as his conduct in adhering to his original return is concerned it was quite unnecessary to make him a party to the present petition, as an application might have been made to the court to amend the return.\n\"There were a number of charges of corrupt practices by the respondent Hawkins, but as I had declared that I found Mr. Mills had a majority of votes, they were not proceeded with. The respondent Hawkins then proceeded to call witnesses in support of charges of corrupt practices against Mills by himself and his agents. A number of witnesses were examined, but I find that none of the charges were proved.\n\"I give judgment declaring that John Joseph Hawkins was not duly elected, but that the Honorable David Mills was duly elected.\n\"I dismiss the petition against James Stephens, with costs to be paid by the petitioners.\n\"I give judgment in favour of the petitioners, with costs to be paid by the respondent, John Joseph Hawkins, other than the costs of the said James Stephens, which are to be paid by the petitioners.\n\"(Signed,)\n\"Thomas Galt.\"\n12th Jan., 1881\nFrom this judgment, the respondent in the court below (Hawkins) appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada, limiting his appeal in his notice of appeal as follows: \"And further take notice that the said respondent, Hawkins, limits his said appeal to the following questions, viz., the learned judge should not have held the Hon. David Mills entitled to the seat, but should have held the respondent, Hawkins, entitled to retain his seat, or should have ordered a new election upon the grounds:\n\"1. The learned judge upon the count of the ballots counted a number of ballots in favour of Hon. David Mills, which should not have been counted, on the ground that the same were improperly marked, or were marked so that the same could be identified, and refused to count a number of ballots for the respondent, Hawkins, which were properly marked and should have been counted for him.\n\"2. The learned judge should have refused to count any of the ballots cast in polling division number one for the township of Sombra, said ballots not appearing to be initialled by the deputy returning officer, and no evidence having been given at the trial to identify them as the ballots supplied by the deputy returning officer.\n\"3. The learned judge should have disallowed as many of the ballots cast at number one polling division in the township of Sombra, as appear by the evidence to have been initialled and numbered by the deputy returning officer, and such initialling and numbering to have been after the close of the poll obliterated by the deputy returning officer.\n\"4. The learned judge should have refused to count any ballots for polling division number one for the township of Camden, there being no proper statement or verification of the ballots cast, or of the result of the poll at said polling division.\n\"5. The learned judge should not have declared Hon. David Mills entitled to the seat in consequence of it appearing upon the scrutiny of the ballots at polling division number three for the township of Dawn were so marked as to enable the voters to be identified.\n\"6. The learned judge should have held charges number two, twenty-one and twenty-three in the schedule to the objections of the respondent, Hawkins, filed, to have been proved, and should have held that David Mills was incompetent to take his seat, on the ground that the evidence upon said charges showed corrupt practices committed by the agents of said Mills, and that one vote should have been struck off from the number of votes cast for said Mills for each of the persons referred to in said charges, or proved by the evidence thereunder to have been guilty of corrupt practices and the learned judge should have admitted further evidence of agency in respect of said charges and such evidence should now be admitted.\n\"7. The learned judge should have allowed the respondent, Hawkins, to give evidence upon the additional charges of corrupt practices set forth in the schedule put in at the trial, and evidence upon said charges should now be admitted. Dated this 26th day of January, 1884.\"\nThe principal question upon which the appeal in this case was decided, was as to the validity of the votes in Division No. 1, Sombra. The rulings of the learned judge at the trial as to the ballots in the other divisions, which were objected to as being imperfectly marked, were affirmed.\nMr. Hector Cameron, Q.C., for appellants:\nUpon a scrutiny of the ballots at the trial it appeared that none of the ballots cast at polling division number one for the township of Sombra contained' the initials of the deputy returning officer for that polling division, and no evidence was given to show that the ballot papers were those supplied by the deputy returning officer. These ballots ought to have been rejected by the deputy returning officer under the provisions of sec. 55 of the Dominion Elections Act, 1874, inasmuch as prim\u00e2 facie they are not the ballot papers supplied by the deputy returning officer and there is no evidence contra, and if these ballots are held good and counted the secrecy of the ballot might in any polling place be evaded and the evident intent of the Act frustrated. Sec. 80, Dominion Elections Act, does not remove the difficulty inasmuch as it cannot be said that the election at this particular polling place was conducted in accordance with the principles laid down in the Act.\nThese ballots, to the number of ten or twelve, were, before being deposited in the ballot box, initialled and numbered by the deputy returning officer of that polling division, and after the close of the poll, when the ballots were being counted, the deputy returning officer improperly obliterated said numbers and initials, and it was his duty, under the provisions of sec. 55 of the Dominion Elections Act, 1874, to have rejected these ballots on account of their having upon them a writing or mark by which the voter could be identified.\nUnder these circumstances the petitioners cannot show that the said Mills has a majority of legal votes. The ballots cast at number one polling division for the township of Sombra are illegal votes, or at least ten or twelve of these votes were improperly counted, and if so, the court cannot say which candidate has a majority of legal votes; therefore the election should be declared void. The case of Jenkins v. Brecken[1], relied on by the petitioners, is clearly distinguishable.\nThe irregularities in regard to the voting at number one polling division for the township of Sombra, and at number three polling division for the township of Dawn, resulted practically in open voting, and does not come within the saving provisions of sec. 80, Dominion Elections Act 1874, and there should be a new election.\nI submit further on behalf of the appellant that corrupt practices have been proved to have been committed on behalf of the Hon. David Mills, sufficient to entitle the appellant to have such a number of votes struck off from the votes polled for the said Mills, as to disentitle the said Mills to the seat and to leave the appellant with a majority of legal votes, and that corrupt practices have been shown to have been committed by agents of the said Mills, by reason whereof the said Mills is disentitled to the seat, under the provisions of the Dominion Elections Act, 1874.\n[The learned counsel then reviewed the evidence on this part of the case.]\nThe learned judge at the trial erred in refusing to permit the appellant to enter upon evidence in respect to the various corrupt practices set out in the supplementary list put in at the trial, inasmuch as no order had been made limiting any time within which the appellant should give particulars of the charges of corrupt practices upon which he intended to rely, and inasmuch as there is no provision for obtaining such particulars from the appellant. It is submitted, therefore, that the appellant should have been allowed as a matter of right to enter upon such evidence and that at any rate, as a matter of discretion, such particulars should have been allowed at the trial, and that the appellant should now be allowed an opportunity of giving evidence thereunder. (Rule VIII., under Dominion Elections Act, 1874.)\nMr. Lash, Q. C., for respondents:\nUpon the authority of the case of Jenkins v. Brecken in this court, it is not competent for Mr. Hawkins to affirm the validity of the election by taking his seat thereunder and claiming still to hold it, and at the same time to disaffirm the election and seek to have it avoided because of alleged irregularities by those who conducted it.\nIt is contended that the ballots at No. 1 Sombra should all be rejected because not initialled by the deputy returning officer. The case of Jenkins v. Brecken settles this question, and such ballots should be counted. Then as no objection was raised to such ballots before the deputy returning officer, the appellant cannot now raise such objection under sec. 66 of the Dominion Elections Act, 1874.\nThough the ballots cast at No. 1 Sombra appeared to have by the evidence borne initials and numbers which were afterwards rubbed off, yet there are no means now of ascertaining for whom such ballots were cast, and as the appellant has not filed a petition or otherwise attacked the election on this ground he cannot now claim that it is void because of the irregularity. The secrecy of the ballots was preserved, and no objection was taken at the close of the poll.\nThe irregularities complained of are such as are covered by section 80 of the Act.\nThen, as to the corrupt charges against Mr. Mills none of them were proven, and the judge came to a proper conclusion with respect to them. Even if any such practice had been committed the person guilty thereof was not an agent of Mr. Mills, and the evidence to prove the agency was not properly tendered. It was in the discretion of the judge at the trial when to allow evidence as to additional charges.\nRITCHIE, C.J.:\nThis is an appeal from a decision of Mr. Justice Galt unseating the sitting member and declaring that Mr. Mills was duly elected as member for the House of Commons for the electoral district of Bothwell. Objections were taken before us with reference to individual ballots which have imperfect crosses or marks on them. During the argument we sustained the rulings of the learned judge as to these, with the exception of some which were retained for further consideration, but, however decided, they cannot have any effect on the result of this case. After a good deal of consideration, I find it impossible to lay down a hard and fast rule by which it can be determined whether a mark is a good or bad cross. I think that whenever the mark evidences an attempt or intention to make a cross, though the cross may be in some respects imperfect, it should be counted, unless, from the peculiarity of the mark made, it can be reasonably inferred that there was not an honest design simply to make a cross, but there was also an intention so to mark the paper that it could be identified, in which case the ballot should, in my opinion, be rejected. But, if the mark made indicates no design of complying with the law, but, on the contrary, a clear intent not to mark with a cross as the law directs, as for instance, by making a straight line or a round O, then such noncompliance with the law, in my opinion, renders the ballot null. The irresistible presumption from such a plain and wilful departure from the terms of the statute being that it was so marked for a sinister purpose.\nI am aware that in coming to this conclusion I am differing from the decision in the case of Woodward v. Sarsons[2], but I cannot bring my mind to the conclusion that a ballot should be refused when there is evidence of an honest attempt to make a cross. One ballot objected to which was marked, as may familiarly be said, by an inverted V, thus A. I think this good as showing an intention to make a cross and no indication of an intent at identification. There are also two ballots upon which are to be found more crosses than one. If the principle I have just referred to is a correct one, then these ballots should be received. However, as there are two ballots on the other side marked in the same way, it would make no difference in the conclusion if we ruled otherwise.\nIn poll No. 4, Chatham, there was a ballot good on its face found in the spoiled ballot envelope, and not among the rejected ballot papers. This ballot could not either affect the election. There was nothing on the ballot to show that it could have been rejected on the ground alleged, viz: because it was marked for both parties. Now, I have looked at it, and I cannot discover the slightest mark of any kind whatever on the ballot, except the X opposite the name of Mills. The returning officer swears \"none rejected.\" No hypothesis has been put forward which could justify the ballot being rejected except that it is alleged it was treated as marked for both candidates. My own eye sight tells me that there is on this ballot nothing whatever to justify this allegation, on the other hand there is, in my opinion, a very reasonable hypothesis that the voter may have wrongly marked the ballot, and discovering his mistake returned it to the officer as spoiled and got another in its place.\nThe returns of the officers show that 139 voted at this polling place, and 139 were counted without the two, of which this is one, alleged to have been spoiled, which is conclusive that this could not have been a rejected ballot.\nThen there are the statements given by the deputy returning officer under secs. 55 and 57, in which it appears that the accepted ballot papers were 139 in number, and then the sworn statement that \"one hundred and thirty-nine votes were polled in polling district No. 4, Chatham. In my opinion, therefore, the judge was right in treating this ballot as a spoiled ballot and not a rejected ballot. Then really the only point in this case which could affect the election is the one raised in reference to No. 1 Sombra. I entirely agree with the learned judge that the case of No. 1 Sombra is directly within the principle of the case of Jenkins, v Brecken[3]. The learned judge thus summarizes the evidence as to No. 1 Sombra.\n[The learned Chief Justice then read from the judgment of Galt, J.[4]]\nThe agent of Mr. Hawkins and the deputy returning officer appear to have been equally at fault, as to the strictly correct course to be pursued, and both appear to have been acting in good faith and desirous of doing what was legal and right. The opinion of the deputy returning officer, influenced no doubt by what Mr. Hawkins's agent said, changed his mode of procedure, which was exactly that pursued in the Brecken case, and initialled and numbered about 12 of the ballot papers when he seems to have thought he was in error in changing the course he at first adopted, and returned to his original mode of procedure; but does not meddle with the ballots so irregularly initialled. On the close of the poll, however, having evidently, from changing his mode of numbering and initialling, and reverting to his original practice, become satisfied that the course he had adopted was not regular and proper, he obviously endeavored, in the presence of the agents of the parties, to remedy the irregularities; and so when the poll was closed and the ballot box opened, as the learned judge expressed it: \"The returning officer in good faith and with an anxious desire to do his duty,\" endeavored to remedy the wrong he had committed by carefully and effectually obliterating the marks he had put on these ballots so completely, the learned judge says, \"that he could see no trace of any mark on any of them.\" He also says that no person was allowed to see the front of the ballot papers, (and which I think is the fair inference from the evidence,) whereby the secrecy of the ballots was preserved and the identity of the ballots, as furnished by him and used by the voters, clearly established, because they must have been the very papers furnished by him and used by the voters, otherwise they could not have had the numbers and initials of the deputy returning officer on those which he obliterated, and all this in the presence of the agents of both parties without the slightest objection on their part, but, on the contrary, the fair inference is, with their implied, if not expressed, assent and concurrence. And this is the fair inference from the evidence of Dawson, the respondents' agent, and I may say if they had been seen by the deputy returning officer, I should doubt whether even this would affect the question, because the secrecy in such a case would be as much preserved by the oath of the deputy returning officer as in the case of ballots he marks for illiterate voters.\nIt seems to me that this in no way differs from the principle acted on in Jenkins v. Brecken, but is a much stronger case for the application of that principle. The only difference being the rectification of the error or irregularity by the officer at the close of the poll. The appellant's contention is, that this rectification made a ballot bad in the box good out of the box, but this, though on the surface plausible, is, in my opinion, by no means a legitimate or accurate way of stating the case; if literally so, it is no more nor less in effect than was done in the Brecken case. In what respect does the present case differ substantially from that of an officer inadvertently marking a ballot and giving it to a voter and before being used he discovers that he has improperly marked it, and then and there effectually expunges the mark and hands it to the voter? In such a case he immediately, before any harm is done, corrects his error. In the present case the officer, in the fair and legitimate discharge of his duty, innocently, but irregularly, marks a ballot; discovering his error at the very first moment it could be done, in the presence of the agents of the parties, he proceeds to undo what he had improperly done, and he accomplishes this in such a manner that the secrecy of the ballot is preserved, and also in such an effectual way that there is no possibility that any party could be injured thereby, and this, too, in the presence and without the slightest objection or protest on the part of the agents of the candidates. Under such circumstances I can discover no difference practically between the case of correcting the error before or after the polling, the effect being precisely the same in both cases. I am therefore by no means prepared to hold that, in the case of an accidental and innocent irregularity, honestly and bon\u00e2 fide rectified on the spot before any injury has or can have resulted either to the candidates, the voters, or to the public, such rectification can be ignored and the irregularity relied on as invalidating the election. At the same time I am free to say I think the actions of the deputy returning officers should be always watched and subjected to rigid scrutiny.\nBut assuming this to be an irregularity and the rectification of it equally irregular, if ever there was a case to which section 80 of the Dominion Statute is applicable it seems to me this is peculiarly that case. That section is as follows:\u2014\nNo election shall be declared invalid by reason of a non-compliance with the rules contained in this act, as to the taking of the poll or the counting of the votes, or by reason of any want of qualification in the persons signing a nomination paper received by the returning officer, under the provisions of this act, or by any mistake in the use of forms contained in the schedules to this act, if it appears to the tribunal having cognizance of the question, that the election was conducted in accordance with the principles laid down in this act, and that such non-compliance or mistake did not affect the result of the election.\nNow, as regards these votes, it cannot be doubted the election was conducted in accordance with the principles laid down in the act, and I think it equally clear that any non-compliance with the rules contained in the act, as to the taking of the poll or the counting of the votes, did not affect the result of the election.\nThe secrecy of the ballot was not infringed, the ballots are unquestionably those given by the deputy returning officer to the voters, the voters have freely marked them for the parties for whom they desired to vote, the candidates have got the benefit of the votes marked for them, the public have had the benefit of the votes so cast so far as they affect the return of one or other of the candidates. On what principle, then, or with what object, should the election be set aside? The only reason alleged, as I understand the contention, is that as the ballots alleged to have been marked were bad ballots when put in the box and cannot now be identified, and so picked out, it cannot be told for whom the parties using them voted, and therefore all the votes polled at that polling place should be excluded from the count. But this contention answers itself, and so far from establishing the invalidity of the election furnishes, in my opinion, an overwhelming reason why the validity of the election under sec. 80 should, so far as this polling place is concerned, be sustained; this construction, while it strictly preserves the principles on which it is provided the election shall be conducted, prevents to a large extent the election from being jeopardized or defeated by the default or innocent action of the returning officers, which evidently was the intention of the legislature in enacting section 80. Therefore, with regard to these votes also, I concur with the learned judge, who tried this case, that they should be held good.\nThere were some charges of corrupt practices by reason whereof the appellant claims that Mr. Mills is disentitled to the seat. One is the Mowat-Gordon case; the second, the Bachard case, and the 3rd, the Craig case. These the learned judge who tried the case thought had not been sustained as there was not any proof of agency. I have carefully read the reasons given by the learned judge and looked at the evidence, and I am not prepared to say that he has arrived at a wrong conclusion in any of these cases, even if he was wrong in concluding that the loan of five dollars by Gordon to Mowat was not a bribe (a rather doubtful case) as there is clearly no evidence to show that Gordon was the agent of Mills, the most that could be done would be to strike off that vote and that would not affect the election.\nThere is one point which, it is alleged, was not dealt with by the learned judge, but is now relied on by Mr. Cameron, though not included in the notice of appeal, viz., the right to tender evidence of agency in the case of Craig, I think the counsel has not placed himself in a position in the lower court to claim that privilege on appeal. As to another point, viz., the refusal to allow charges to be added, the learned judge exercised his discretion, which he had a perfect right to do.\nFor these reasons, I am opinion, that the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nSTRONG, J.:\u2014\nWhile agreeing that the ballots in this case were sufficiently marked, I am not prepared to lay down any general rule as to what is or is not to be deemed a sufficient marking, or whether a cross or an attempt to make a cross is indispensable. I desire also to add that by assenting to the grounds upon which the judgment proceeds, I do not mean to preclude myself from the right to consider in any future case in which the question may arise, whether any mark put on a ballot by mistake and in good faith by a deputy returning officer is to be held a ground for rejecting the ballot. Subject to these observations, I concur with the Chief Justice.\nFOURNIER, J.:\u2014\nPar leur p\u00e9tition les Intim\u00e9s ont r\u00e9clam\u00e9 pour l'honorable David Mills, le si\u00e8ge de la division \u00e9lectorale de Bothwell \u00e0 la Chambre des Communes, actuellement occup\u00e9 par l'Appelant. Celui-ci a r\u00e9pondu qu'il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 duement \u00e9lu pour la dite division, mais n'a pas produit de contre-p\u00e9tition attaquant la validit\u00e9 de la dite \u00e9lection. Cependant, comme il en avait le droit en vertu de la sec. 66 de l'acte d'\u00e9lection de 1874, il a all\u00e9gu\u00e9 des actes de corruption commis par l'Intim\u00e9 et ses agents, suffisants s'ils sont prouv\u00e9s, pour emp\u00eacher son adversaire d'\u00eatre d\u00e9clar\u00e9 duement \u00e9lu.\nL'honorable juge Galt, qui a proc\u00e9d\u00e9 au proc\u00e8s de cette p\u00e9tition, a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que M.

Il a en m\u00eame temps renvoy\u00e9 les accusations de men\u00e9es corruptrices.\nC'est de ce jugement qu'il y a appel \u00e0 cette cour.\nL'Appelant ayant, en vertu de la sec. 48 de l'acte de Cour Supr\u00eame r\u00e9glant l'appel \u00e0 cette Cour en mati\u00e8re, d'\u00e9lections,\u2014donn\u00e9 avis qu'il limitait son appel \u00e0 certaines questions \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9es dans son avis, la Cour est en cons\u00e9quence appel\u00e9e \u00e0 ne se prononcer que sur les questions suivantes\n1. Les bulletins trouv\u00e9s dans la bo\u00eete de scrutin du poll no 1 du township Sombra ne portant pas les initiales du d\u00e9put\u00e9 officier rapporteur devaient-ils \u00eatre rejet\u00e9s pour cette raison?\n2. Comme il est en preuve que dans le m\u00eame poll dix ou douze bulletins portant les initiales du d\u00e9put\u00e9 officier-rapporteur et le num\u00e9ro du votant sur la liste \u00e9lectorale ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9s par le d\u00e9put\u00e9 officier-rapporteur dans la bo\u00eete du scrutin\u2014et qu'au d\u00e9pouillement du scrutin, les initiales et les num\u00e9ros mis par le dit d\u00e9put\u00e9 officier-rapporteur ont \u00e9t\u00e9 par lui effac\u00e9s\u2014ces dix ou douze bulletins ne devraient-ils pas aussi \u00eatre retranch\u00e9s?\n3. L'\u00e9tat du poll trouv\u00e9 dans la bo\u00eete du scrutin au poll n\u00b0 1, township de Camden, n'\u00e9tant pas sign\u00e9 par le d\u00e9put\u00e9 officier-rapporteur tous les bulletins du poll ne devraient-ils pas \u00eatre rejet\u00e9s?\n4. Tous les bulletins d\u00e9pos\u00e9s au poll n\u00b0 3, township de Dawn, \u00e9tant num\u00e9rot\u00e9s, ont \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9s par le juge; au lieu de simplement rejeter les bulletins n'aurait-il pas d\u00fb, comme le pr\u00e9tend l'Appelant, d\u00e9clarer l'\u00e9lection nulle en cons\u00e9quence de cette irr\u00e9gularit\u00e9 et de celles qui ont eu lieu au poll n\u00b0 1, Sombra?\n5. Enfin, les accusations de men\u00e9es corruptrices sont-elles prouv\u00e9es?\nDans l'examen des bulletins nous en avons trouv\u00e9 un certain nombre marqu\u00e9s d'une mani\u00e8re qui n'est pas strictement conforme \u00e0 la loi qui exige que le voteur fasse une croix dans la division du bulletin o\u00f9 se trouve le nom du candidat pour lequel il entend voter. Pour les personnes habitu\u00e9es \u00e0 l'usage de la plume, le signe d'une croix est tr\u00e8s facile \u00e0 faire; mais il n'en est pas de m\u00eame pour les personnes illettr\u00e9es. On sait par une exp\u00e9rience de tous les jours quelle difficult\u00e9 \u00e9prouve la plupart de ces personnes \u00e0 se servir de la plume, lorsqu'elles sont appel\u00e9es dans les affaires ordinaires, \u00e0 faire leur marque d'une croix comme attestation de leur signature. C'est tellement le cas que la plupart du temps, celui qui \u00e9crit leurs noms au bas d'un document, est le plus souvent oblig\u00e9 de tenir et m\u00eame de diriger la plume que ces personnes se contentent de toucher pour accomplir la formalit\u00e9 voulue. Aussi, n'est-il pas \u00e9trange de voir sur les bulletins beaucoup de croix tr\u00e8s irr\u00e9guli\u00e8rement faites. S'il fallait rejeter tous les bulletins ne portant pas une croix semblable au fac simile donn\u00e9 par la loi, un grand nombre de voteurs se trouverait de cette mani\u00e8re priv\u00e9 de l'exercice de leur droit de franchise. Mais la loi doit-elle \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9e aussi strictement? Son but \u00e9tant d'assurer le secret du vote, ne doit-on pas consid\u00e9rer au contraire comme valides les bulletins faisant voir \u00e0 leur face une tentative faite de bonne foi pour faire une croix ainsi que la loi le veut?\nParmi les bulletins que nous avons examin\u00e9s, il s'en est trouv\u00e9 o\u00f9 la tentative du voteur \u00e0 faire une croix se rapprochait plut\u00f4t de la forme d'un V que de celle d'une croix; quelques-uns ont mis deux croix; d'autres y ont fait une seule ligne soit perpendiculaire, soit horizontale. La premi\u00e8re chose \u00e0 faire avant de d\u00e9cider de la validit\u00e9 du bulletin \u00e9tait sans doute d'adopter une r\u00e8gle uniforme d'apr\u00e8s laquelle ils seraient tous admis ou rejet\u00e9s. Nous avons d\u00e9j\u00e0 pour nous guider dans cette op\u00e9ration les principes \u00e9nonc\u00e9s dans la cause de Woodward vs Sarsons[5], o\u00f9 les m\u00eames difficult\u00e9s au sujet de la marque des bulletins ont \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9es et dans laquelle la cour (C. P.) a adopt\u00e9 les r\u00e8gles suivantes qui sont d'une application \u00e9vidente \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente cause.[6]\nThe ballot paper must not be marked so as to show that the voter intended to vote for more Candidates than he is intitled to vote for, nor so as to leave it uncertain whether he intended at all, or for which Candidate he intended to vote, nor so as to make it possible, by seeing the paper itself, or by reference to other available facts, to identify the way in which he has voted.\nIf these requirements are not substantially fulfilled, the ballot paper is void and should not be counted, and if it is counted, it should be struck out on a scrutiny.\nBut the placing of two crosses, or a single stroke (thus 1) in lieu of a cross, or a straight line (thus, 1)\u2014one mark like an imperfect letter P in addition to the cross, or a star instead of a cross, or a cross blurred or marked with a tremulous hand, or a cross placed on the left hand side of the ballot paper, or a pencil line drawn through the name of the Candidate not voted for, or a ballot paper torn longitudinally through the centre\u2014Held not to avoid the vote, in the absence of evidence of connivance or pre-arrangement.\nLes r\u00e8gles ci-dessus \u00e9nonc\u00e9es ont \u00e9t\u00e9 consid\u00e9r\u00e9es comme contenant une saine doctrine et en partie adopt\u00e9es par les juges. Dans le cours de la discussion de cette cause l'honorable juge en chef ayant soumis \u00e0 l'examen de ses coll\u00e8gues une r\u00e8gle formul\u00e9e de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 couvrir \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s toutes les difficult\u00e9s qui peuvent \u00eatre soulev\u00e9es \u00e0 propos de la marque des bulletins, tous les membres de la Cour y ont donn\u00e9 leur adh\u00e9sion. Cette r\u00e8gle n'est toutefois pas susceptible d'une application aussi g\u00e9n\u00e9rale que celle \u00e9nonc\u00e9e dans la cause de Woodward et Sarsons, car on ne pourrait pas l'invoquer pour valider un bulletin, comme dans les cas ci-dessus cit\u00e9s, ne portant par exemple qu'une seule ligne perpendiculaire ou horizontale. Dans ce cas suivant notre r\u00e8gle on ne peut pas consid\u00e9rer qu'il y a eu de bonne foi une tentative de faire une croix, et les bulletins marqu\u00e9s de cette mani\u00e8re seraient rejet\u00e9s. Je n'ai pas besoin de r\u00e9p\u00e9ter ici la formule de cette r\u00e8gle que l'honorable juge en chef a d\u00e9j\u00e0 lue tout au long dans ses notes sur cette cause.\nL'examen des bulletins ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 fait d'apr\u00e8s les r\u00e8gles ci-dessus \u00e9nonc\u00e9es, le r\u00e9sultat devant cette Cour a \u00e9t\u00e9 le m\u00eame que devant l'honorable juge Galt, donnant une majorit\u00e9 de neuf voix \u00e0 M. Mills.\nLa question soulev\u00e9e au sujet des votes au poll n\u00b0 1, Sombra, dont la nullit\u00e9 est demand\u00e9e par l'appelant, parce que les bulletins ne portaient pas les initiales du d\u00e9put\u00e9 officier-rapporteur est d\u00e9j\u00e0 venu devant cette Cour dans la cause de Jenkins et Brecken[7].\nSur ce point la d\u00e9cision de la Cour est r\u00e9sum\u00e9 comme suit:\nThat in the present case, the Deputy Returning Officer having had the means of identifying the ballot papers as being those supplied by him to the voters, the neglect of the Deputy Returning Officers to put their initials on the back of these ballot papers not having affected the result of the election, or caused substantial injustice, did not invalidate the election.\nL'appelant pr\u00e9tend que cette d\u00e9cision ne saurait s'appliquer \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente cause, parce que la preuve faite dans celle-ci est insuffisante pour identifier les bulletins. Cependant dans l'une comme dans l'autre, les initiales ont \u00e9t\u00e9 mises sur la marge au lieu d'\u00eatre sur le dos du bulletin. Le voteur muni d'un semblable bulletin le rapportait au d\u00e9put\u00e9 officier-rapporteur qui avait toute la facilit\u00e9 possible de s'assurer que c'\u00e9tait bien le bulletin qu'il avait donn\u00e9, en enlevant la marge portant ses initiales, avant de mettre le bulletin dans la bo\u00eete du scrutin. Il acqu\u00e9rait par l\u00e0 une connaissance positive que le bulletin d\u00e9pos\u00e9 \u00e9tait bien celui qu'il avait fourni. Il est vrai qu'il a manqu\u00e9 dans cette cause une preuve qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite dans celle de Jenkins. Le d\u00e9put\u00e9 officier-rapporteur et le clerc du poll n'ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 entendus comme t\u00e9moins pour confirmer par leurs t\u00e9moignages le fait de l'identit\u00e9 des bulletins. La raison de cette omission est que l'un de ces officiers \u00e9tait mort, (le d\u00e9put\u00e9 officier-rapporteur) et l'autre absent aux Etats-Unis, lorsque la preuve a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite. J. P. Dawson, l'un des agents de l'Appelant \u00e9tait pr\u00e9sent \u00e0 l'ouverture de la bo\u00eete du scrutin et \u00e0 l'exception de quelques minutes il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent au poll toute la journ\u00e9e. Il a vu le d\u00e9put\u00e9 officier-rapporteur prendre les bulletins de la bo\u00eete, les compter et les lui montrer ainsi qu'aux autres agents qui \u00e9taient pr\u00e9sents. Il n'a vu aucune irr\u00e9gularit\u00e9 dans la mani\u00e8re de conduire l'\u00e9lection \u00e0 ce poll, si ce n'est celle qui forme le sujet de la deuxi\u00e8me question. Cette irr\u00e9gularit\u00e9 consiste dans le fait que dix ou douze bulletins sur le dos desquels se trouvaient les initiales du d\u00e9put\u00e9 officier-rapporteur et le n\u00b0 qui se trouve vis-\u00e0-vis le nom du voteur sur la liste \u00e9lectorale ont \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9s \u00e0 autant de voteurs qui les ont remis au d\u00e9put\u00e9. Celui-ci les a d\u00e9pos\u00e9s ainsi marqu\u00e9s dans la bo\u00eete du scrutin. La chose s'est pass\u00e9e de la mani\u00e8re suivante: Dawson, l'un des agents de l'Appelant, rapporte que le d\u00e9put\u00e9 officier-rapporteur ayant mis ses initiales sur la marge des bulletins et qu'il ne les avait pas mises sur le bulletin m\u00eame, lui en fit la remarque en lui disant que ce n'\u00e9tait pas suivant la loi,\u2014sans toutefois lui dire comment il devait faire. Apr\u00e8s cette observation le d\u00e9put\u00e9 officier rapporteur mit ses initiales et les nos. sur dix ou douze bulletins. Ayant ensuite examin\u00e9 la loi et n'y trouvant pas la solution qu'il cherchait, il revint \u00e0 sa premi\u00e8re mani\u00e8re de ne mettre ses initiales que sur la marge sans aucune marque sur le bulletin.\nLorsque le d\u00e9put\u00e9 officier-rapporteur, \u00e0 la cl\u00f4ture du poll, sortit les bulletins de la bo\u00eete au scrutin, il les montra un par un \u00e0 chacun des agents des candidats. Lorsqu'il arriva aux bulletins portant les num\u00e9ros et ses initiales, il les effa\u00e7a avec un morceau de caoutchouc, et les compta; il n'en fut pas compt\u00e9 d'autres que ceux qu'il avait sortis de la bo\u00eete. Il d\u00e9clare aussi n'avoir pas vu d'autre irr\u00e9gularit\u00e9 dans la mani\u00e8re de conduire l'\u00e9lection \u00e0 ce poll que celle qui a eu lieu par rapport \u00e0 ces 10 ou 12 bulletins marqu\u00e9s comme susdit Il dit aussi que personne n'a pu voir comment avait vot\u00e9 ceux qui avaient d\u00e9pos\u00e9 des bulletins marqu\u00e9s, parce que les marques en furent effac\u00e9es avant qu'ils ne fussent compt\u00e9s et si bien effac\u00e9s que l'honorable juge Galt n'a pu voir la moindre trace de ces marques. Quant \u00e0 l'identit\u00e9 de ces bulletins, elle est certaine, puisqu'ils ont pu \u00eatre reconnus par les num\u00e9ros et les initiales comme \u00e9tant ceux fournis par le d\u00e9put\u00e9 officier-rapporteur. La preuve \u00e9tablit aussi positivement que le secret du vote n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 viol\u00e9 par ces irr\u00e9gularit\u00e9s.\nOn peut encore fortifier la preuve faite de l'identit\u00e9 de tous les bulletins, tant de ceux qui ne portaient pas originairement d'initiales que de ceux sur lesquels les initiales et les num\u00e9ros qui y avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 mis ont ensuite \u00e9t\u00e9 effac\u00e9s, par le serment solennel que le d\u00e9put\u00e9 officier-rapporteur \u00e0 ce poll a pr\u00eat\u00e9 pour constater la r\u00e9gularit\u00e9 de ces proc\u00e9d\u00e9s. Entre autres choses il d\u00e9clare qu'il a tenu le poll correctement, constate le nombre de votes donn\u00e9s \u00e0 chaque candidat, \u00e0 son poll, et d\u00e9pose de plus:\nThat to the best of my knowledge and belief, it contains a true and exact record of the votes given at the polling station, in the said polling district, as the said votes were taken thereat; that I have faithfully counted the votes given for each candidate, in the manner by law provided, and performed all duties required of me by law; and that the report, packets of ballot papers, and other documents required by law to be returned by me to the Returning Officer, have been faithfully and truly prepared and placed within the ballot box, as this oath will be,\u2014to the end that the said ballot box, being first lawfully sealed with my seal, may be transmitted to the Returning Officer according to law.\nSi la preuve en cette cause n'est pas aussi forte que celle faite dans la cause de Jenkins, elle est toutefois suffisante pour nous convaincre que les bulletins d\u00e9pos\u00e9s au poll n\u00b0 1, Sombra, malgr\u00e9 les irr\u00e9gularit\u00e9s auxquelles il a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait allusion ci-dessus, sont certainement les m\u00eames que ceux qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 fournis par le d\u00e9put\u00e9 officier-rapporteur, et qu'il a compt\u00e9s \u00e0 l'ouverture de la bo\u00eete du scrutin dans laquelle il les avait d\u00e9pos\u00e9s. Maintenant ces irr\u00e9gularit\u00e9s ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 commises de bonne foi, sans aucune intention quelconque d'\u00e9luder les dispositions de la loi, n'est-ce pas le cas de faire application du principe admis par cette cour dans la cause Jenkins vs. Brecken au sujet du d\u00e9faut d'initiales sur les bulletins, tant \u00e0 ceux qui n'ont jamais eu d'initiales qu'\u00e0 ceux sur lesquels apr\u00e8s avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 mises, elles ont \u00e9t\u00e9 effac\u00e9es\nIl n'est peut-\u00eatre pas sans danger d'admettre qu'un d\u00e9put\u00e9 officier-rapporteur ait pu changer l'\u00e9tat d'un bulletin; mais si la chose n'est jamais faite autrement qu'elle l'a \u00e9t\u00e9 dans la pr\u00e9sente cause, c'est-\u00e0-dire de la meilleure foi du monde, dans l'unique but de r\u00e9parer imm\u00e9diatement et avant qu'aucun tort n'en f\u00fbt r\u00e9sult\u00e9, et du consentement de tous les agents des candidats, une erreur qui, si elle n'e\u00fbt pas \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9par\u00e9e alors, auraient pu avoir de graves cons\u00e9quences;\u2014il est bien certain qu'il ne saurait jamais r\u00e9sulter d'inconv\u00e9nients d'un tel proc\u00e9d\u00e9 fait dans les circonstances o\u00f9 l'a \u00e9t\u00e9 celui dont il s'agit. Il en serait tout autrement, s'il y avait la moindre preuve que le d\u00e9put\u00e9 officier-rapporteur en agissant ainsi avait la plus l\u00e9g\u00e8re id\u00e9e que ce changement pouvait profiter plut\u00f4t \u00e0 l'un qu'\u00e0 l'autre des deux candidats, je n'h\u00e9siterais pas alors \u00e0 mettre de c\u00f4t\u00e9 toute la votation faite \u00e0 ce poll. Je suis en cons\u00e9quence d'avis que la d\u00e9cision de l'honorable juge Galt sur les deux questions concernant les irr\u00e9gularit\u00e9s qui ont eu lieu au poll n\u00b0 1, Sombra, \u00e9tant conforme \u00e0 celle de Jenkins vs. Brecken et au principe de la sec. 80 de l'acte des \u00e9lections de 1874, doit \u00eatre confirm\u00e9e.\nLa troisi\u00e8me irr\u00e9gularit\u00e9 dont se plaint l'appelant est fond\u00e9e sur ce que l'\u00e9tat du poll trouv\u00e9 dans la boite du scrutin au poll n\u00b0 1 Camden ne portait pas la signature du d\u00e9put\u00e9 officier rapporteur. Cette question a eu une grande importance dans cette cause; car l'officier-rapporteur se fondant sur cette irr\u00e9gularit\u00e9 n'a pas compt\u00e9 les votes donn\u00e9s \u00e0 ce poll, ce qui a eu l'effet de donner une majorit\u00e9 apparente \u00e0 l'appelant qu'il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 \u00e9lu. L'officier-rapporteur mis en cause pour r\u00e9pondre de sa conduite \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard, a \u00e9t\u00e9 reconnu par l'honorable juge justifiable d'en avoir agi ainsi. Comme il n'y a point d'appel de cette partie de cette d\u00e9cision, il ne reste qu'\u00e0 savoir si malgr\u00e9 cette omission de la signature, suffisante pour excuser l'officier-rapporteur, les votes enregistr\u00e9s \u00e0 ce poll ne devaient pas \u00eatre compt\u00e9s. Dans un d\u00e9compte de la votation ordonn\u00e9 par le juge du comt\u00e9 \u00e0 la demande de l'intim\u00e9 les votes omis \u00e0 ce poll furent compt\u00e9s et l'\u00e9tat de la votation d\u00e9clar\u00e9 comme \u00e9tant de 1676 pour l'intim\u00e9 et 1564 pour l'appelant. Toutefois l'ordre du juge n'ayant pas \u00e9t\u00e9 communiqu\u00e9 \u00e0 l'officier-rapporteur, celui-ci fit son rapport conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la d\u00e9termination qu'il avait prise de ne pas accepter l'\u00e9tat non sign\u00e9 qui est dans la forme suivante:\nStatement under sec. 55.\nElection for the Electoral District of Bothwell, held on Tuesday, the 20th day of June, 1882.\nVotes given for Hawkins,\n44\nVotes given for Mills,\n72\nRejected,\n5\nUnused,\n101\nSpoiled,\n1\nI certify the within statement to he correct.\nDeputy Returning Officer.\nSi, comme l'a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 l'honorable juge Galt, les pouvoirs de l'officier-rapporteur, ne lui permettent pas d'examiner les bulletins pour v\u00e9rifier cet \u00e9tat il n'en est pas de m\u00eame du juge appel\u00e9 \u00e0 faire un d\u00e9compte de la votation. Sans entrer dans la consid\u00e9ration des devoirs respectifs de ces deux officiers, il est indubitable que sur la contestation de l'\u00e9lection, le juge, qui a pr\u00e9sid\u00e9 au proc\u00e8s de cette p\u00e9tition avait droit de se servir non-seulement des documents trouv\u00e9s dans la bo\u00eete du scrutin, mais d'autres preuves secondaires qui auraient pu lui \u00eatre fournies, pour arriver au v\u00e9ritable chiffre de la votation. Sa juridiction est compl\u00e8te \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard. L'examen des bulletins devant la Cour en premi\u00e8re instance et ici ayant constat\u00e9 le v\u00e9ritable \u00e9tat de la votation, la question d'irr\u00e9gularit\u00e9 du certificat est ici sans importance, car il est \u00e9vident qu'elle n'a nullement affect\u00e9 le r\u00e9sultat de la votation.\nLa quatri\u00e8me question est au sujet du poll no 3 de Dawn. L\u00e0 tous les bulletins ont \u00e9t\u00e9 num\u00e9rot\u00e9s et rejet\u00e9s pour cette raison, L'appelant ne s'en plaint pas pas, mais il s'appuie sur ce fait et sur celui des dix bulletins du n\u00b0 1 Sombra, sur lesquels les nos. et les initiales ont \u00e9t\u00e9 effac\u00e9s, pour demander la nullit\u00e9 de l'\u00e9lection pr\u00e9tendant que ces faits \u00e9taient de nature \u00e0 affecter le r\u00e9sultat de l'\u00e9lection. Malheureusement il ne peut \u00e9tablir cette cons\u00e9quence,\u2014car il est absolument impossible de conna\u00eetre pour qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9s les dix ou 12 votes du poll n\u00b0 1 de Sombra\u2014et quant \u00e0 ceux de Dawn, leur rejet n'est \u00e9videmment pas \u00e0 son d\u00e9triment, mais \u00e0 celui de son adversaire qui avait une majorit\u00e9 de cinq votes sur lui, dans ce poll.\nL'appelant peut-il apr\u00e8s avoir maintenu la validit\u00e9 de l'\u00e9lection et occup\u00e9 son si\u00e8ge en Chambre, en demander maintenant la nullit\u00e9, sans avoir pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 de p\u00e9tition \u00e0 cet effet et sans s'\u00eatre conform\u00e9 \u00e0 toutes les formalit\u00e9s voulues par la loi pour \u00eatre admis \u00e0 demander la nullit\u00e9 d'une \u00e9lection? Cette question n'est pas nouvelle; elle s'est pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e plusieurs fois d\u00e9j\u00e0 devant les tribunaux et notamment devant cette Cour dans la cause de Jenkins et Brecken, et dans celles de Sommerville et Laflamme[8] o\u00f9 elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 jug\u00e9e en sens contraire aux pr\u00e9tentions de l'appelant.\nD'ailleurs avant de d\u00e9clarer nulle une \u00e9lection pour cause d'irr\u00e9gularit\u00e9, les tribunaux exigent d'apr\u00e8s l'autorit\u00e9 suivante Woodward v. Sarsons[9] une preuve que l'appelant n'a pas faite:\nTo render an election void under the ballot act, by any reason of non observance of or non compliance with the rules or forms given therein, such non observance or non compliance must be so great as to satisfy the tribunal before which the validity of the election is contested, that the election has been conducted in a manner contrary to the principle of an election by ballot, and that the irregularities complained of did affect or might have affected the result of the election.\nLes moyens de nullit\u00e9 fond\u00e9s sur les irr\u00e9gularit\u00e9s mentionn\u00e9es plus haut sont \u00e9videmment insuffisants d'apr\u00e8s cette autorit\u00e9 et doivent \u00eatre rejet\u00e9s.\nIl ne reste plus que les accusations de men\u00e9es corruptrices pratiqu\u00e9es par l'Intim\u00e9 ou ses agents. Apr\u00e8s avoir lu avec soin la preuve que l'Appelant a offerte \u00e0 ce sujet, je me bornerai \u00e0 dire que le verdict de l'honorable juge Galt est le seul qu'il pouvait rendre en se fondant sur cette preuve, et que c'est avec raison qu'elles ont \u00e9t\u00e9 renvoy\u00e9es.\nPour toutes ces raisons je suis d'avis' que le pr\u00e9sent appel doit \u00eatre renvoy\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens, et que l'Appelant n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00fbment \u00e9lu, mais que l'honorable David Mills a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00fbment \u00e9lu.\nHENRY, J.:\nI concur in the conclusion arrived at in the court below by the learned judge who tried this case, and also with the learned Chief Justice of this court, with the exception of one point, and that is as regards the ballot papers which were numbered by the returning officer in No. 1 Sombra and handed to the voters and then returned to him so numbered. The statute provides that the ballots should only have his initials and these have not. In the case of Jenkins v. Brecken I was of opinion that it was a fatal defect, but the majority of the court on that point were of a contrary opinion, and therefore on that point we must be governed by the decision in that case. But as to the numbering of the ballot papers it is a very different thing, for by numbering them the returning officer could identify the voter, although if he had only put his initials on them he would be unable to do so. The clear intention of the statute is, that no mark shall be put on the ballot which can leave that ballot open to a suspicion that it was so marked in order to identify the voter, and if such a mark is put on a ballot, it should, in my opinion, be declared illegal and bad. All these questions have been decided in the case of Woodward v. Sarsons[10], and the head note in that case giving the result of the judgment, is as follows:\nTo render an election void under the ballot act, by reason of a non-observance of or non-compliance with the rules or forms given, such non-observance or non-compliance must be so great as to satisfy the tribunal * * that the election has been conducted in a manner contrary to the principle of an election by ballot.\nUnder this decision it appears to me that all the votes objected to as improperly marked and allowed by the learned judge in the court below were properly allowed, and the only question then is as to the ballots objected to as having been numbered. Now, the object in not allowing the papers to be numbered, is to prevent anybody finding out for whom the parties who got these ballots have voted. If we allow a ballot paper, which is numbered when handed to the voter, to be valid, then we put it in the power of the returning officer who has put the number on, with the aid of others, to be able to say for whom these persons voted. It seems to me that in every such case the law has been evaded, and there is not that secrecy which the candidates under the statute are entitled to exact. It is true that in this case it is contended that the returning officer acted in good faith, but if we are to be called to decide upon that question of good faith, it will be opening for this court, as well as for the court below, an issue which was never intended to be tried under the statute. Under these circumstances I am justified in arriving at the conclusion that when a ballot paper has been numbered it is a ballot paper which should not be counted, because a returning officer would always be able, by referring to his notes, to ascertain for whom the voter has voted, and he can communicate his knowledge to his friends and thereby secrecy has been done away.\nBut in this case the appellant, although he does not claim to retain the seat on this ground, claims that the election should, in consequence of these ballots having been numbered, be declared void.\nThe question, it appears to me, is whether he is, as appellant in this case, in a position to ask this court to arrive at such a result. In the case of Jenkins v. Brecken, the learned Chief Justice says:\u2014\nHe (the respondent) accepts the return which gave him a majority of votes, takes his seat in Parliament as a duly elected member, and when his right to hold the seat is attacked, urges on this court to adjudge that at a legal election, regularly and properly held, he was elected by a majority of the electors, and that the majority being so in his favor, he is lawfully entitled to hold the seat he now occupies, but with the same breath, he says: If you cannot find the majority in my favor, then the whole election is irregular, illegal and void, and must be set aside; so that the validity or invalidity, according to his contention, is made to depend upon his having or not having a majority of votes; in other words, he says, through his counsel: If you find I have a majority of votes, it's a right good election and should not be disturbed, but if you find Mr. Brecken has the majority, its a dreadfully bad election by reason of divers illegalities and irregularities, and, forsooth, in the public interests should not be allowed to stand. In the meantime, bad as this respondent contends the election is, great as is the public exigency, when he has not the majority, that it should be set aside, he finds it a good enough election to enable him to take his seat in Parliament and make laws for those unfortunate electors who have by these illegalities, mistakes, or irregularities of the returning officers, been prevented from legally electing their members.\nBut this contention cannot prevail. It shocks common sense. If he wished to attack this election, he should have attacked it by petition, depositing his $1000 as security, when all the candidates at the election would be respondents, as would the returning officer whose conduct is complained of, as provided by section 64.\nMy brother Strong, in reference to this point also says:\nThe petition was filed by Mr. Brecken claiming the seat as having a majority of the legal votes. If the appellant desired to raise this question as to the validity of this election he should have presented a petition himself praying its avoidance, but this he has not done.\nThe 66th section of the act of 1874, manifestly does not enable him to impugn the election as wholly void and irregular, without a petition; it merely enables a respondent to a petition, by which the seat is claimed, to recriminate, by shewing that even if the petitioner should prove that he has a majority, he is, by reason of the illegal conduct of himself or his agents, disentitled to have the seat awarded to him.\nIn that case although differing from the majority of the court on the point as to the initialling of the ballot papers, I said\nAs to the other point, I think it was the duty of the sitting member, if he did not wish to allow the respondent to take the seat, to resign his own seat, and file a petition setting forth grounds to avoid the whole election. Then all parties interested would have been heard, which has not been the case here. They are not here, and this court cannot take upon itself to decide upon the rights of parties who have not been brought before it.\nIn reference, therefore, to these votes if the appellant had not taken his seat and the respondent was now sitting, according to the views I entertain, I think the appellant as a petitioner would have been entitled to have had the election declared void, but having taken his seat, in the face of the judgment of Jenkins v. Brecken, I cannot see how we can now at his request declare that the seat he is claiming should be declared void.\nIt is true that the appellant in this case could have the election declared void on account of acts of disqualification committed by the respondent or his agents, but as there is no evidence, in my opinion, to arrive at such a conclusion, I have come to the conclusion that in the present case the appellant is not entitled to the seat, and that the respondent is entitled to retain the seat to which he has been declared entitled by the judgment appealed from.\nGWYNNE, J.:\nI have entertained\u2014and I confess I do still entertain\u2014grave doubts whether we should not be acting more in conformity with the spirit of the Dominion Elections Act, if we should insist upon a precise fulfilment of the terms literally prescribed by the 45th sec. of the Act, by requiring every ballot paper, in order to constitute a good vote, to be marked with a single cross. The statute having prescribed a particular description of mark, and that prescribed being so easily made, it should, I think, be required as the only mode of complying with the statute. It would seem, however, that some people have a difficulty in making this so simple mark if we may judge from the very imperfect attempts to make it appearing upon some ballot papers; to avoid, therefore, as far as possible running the risk of avoiding an honest vote, I concur in adopting as the rule by which the court shall be governed in all questions to arise as to the sufficiency of a mark upon ballot papers in order to constitute a good vote, the rule as laid, down in the judgment of his lordship the Chief Justice in this case, however difficult the application of that rule may be in some cases, and however imperfect it may be in enabling us to draw with certainty the correct inference upon the question whether a particular mark was put upon the ballot with an honest or with an improper intent. In Woodward v. Sarsons[11] the Court of Common Pleas in England held, that there being two or more crosses on a ballot paper did not invalidate the vote. Although there is this difference between the Imperial Act, upon which that case proceeded, and the Dominion Elections Act, that in the former the directions as to the manner in which a voter shall mark his ballot paper are contained in a schedule to the Act and not in the body of the Act, whereas in the Dominion Election Act they are prescribed in the body of the Act itself, still, as to the question whether two or more crosses upon a ballot paper should invalidate a vote, I cannot say that I see any difference between the two Acts; for the prohibition as to marking a ballot paper with any mark so that it could be identified is, in both cases, in the body of the Acts. Such double marking is treated in Woodward v. Sarsons as merely indicating, in an emphatic manner, the intention of voting for the one candidate. While the double marks may be, and perhaps in some cases are, put upon ballot papers merely with that intention, they may also be, I think, and perhaps in some cases are, put upon them with quite a different intention; namely, with the intention of affording means by which the voter could be identified for the purpose of procuring for him, in accordance with a promise to that effect, pecuniary recompense for his vote; and the possibility of their being used for this latter purpose seems to my mind, I confess, a sufficient reason for disallowing all ballot papers so marked. If they are to be disallowed only upon evidence being adduced of an arrangement having been made that the voter should put such additional crosses upon his ballot paper, the difficulty of proving such pre-arrangement will be always so great, that we shall defeat, I fear, the object of the act, and render void a very material part of it which imperatively prescribes that all ballot papers having any mark upon them by which the voter could be identified shall be rejected.\nAs, however, uniformity of decision in matters of this kind is all important, and as I cannot see any substantial difference in this particular between the Dominion Elections Act and that upon which Woodward v. Sarsons was decided, and as my learned brothers are all of opinion that such double marking should not ipso facto avoid a ballot, I concur in considering the point as settled by the judgment of the Court of Common Pleas in Woodward v. Sarsons. So doing, and adopting the rule as laid down by the Chief Justice in this case of all the contested ballot papers, there is only the one marked with an inverted V at polling division No. 6 Chatham which I am not satisfied comes within the rule as above laid down, and which, therefore, I think, should be disallowed. The disallowance of this ballot would, however, make no difference in the result arrived at by the learned judge.\nI see nothing in the case which would justify any interference with the judgment of the learned judge upon any of the cases of corrupt acts, nor, indeed, with his judgment upon the other points in the case save only in one, which, however, is, in my judgment, the one upon which the whole case turns; and with the greatest deference for the opinions of the learned judge and my learned brothers in this court, I am bound to say that I am of opinion that the deputy returning officer at polling division No. 1 Sombra, erred in counting as good the votes contained in the ballot papers which had been marked by himself with the numbers on the voters' list opposite to the names of the voters to whom those ballot papers were given. Both under the express provisions of the statute, and the judgment of the Court of Common Pleas in England in the case of Woodward v. Sarsons[12], those ballots should not have been counted, but should have been rejected for precisely the same defect as avoided all the votes cast at the polling division No. 3 Dawn.\nThe duty of the deputy returning officer at the close of a poll is imperatively prescribed by the 55th sec. of the Dominion Elections Act of 187 as amended by the 10th sec. of the act of 1878, 41st Vic., ch. 6. That section enacts that immediately after the close of the poll the deputy returning officer shall proceed to count the number of votes given for each candidate, and in doing so he shall reject all ballot papers upon which there is any writing or mark by which the voter could be identified. Now it cannot be questioned that a voter could be identified by his number on the voters' list being on his ballot. Whether in point of fact he was, or was not, so identified at the time of the counting is a matter of no importance in the eye of the law. The statute in effect declares that a mark by which a voter could be identified is sufficient to avoid the ballot upon which such mark is.\nNeither does the statute make any difference as to the persons by whom such mark may be put upon the ballot. By whomsoever it was put upon it, the statute equally avoids the ballot and prescribes imperatively that it shall not be counted. In the present case, as in that of Woodward v. Sarsons, the avoiding mark was put upon these ballots by the deputy returning officer himself. In that case it was not doubted that the 234 ballot papers so marked were void; they were declared to be such and that they could not be counted, but there the not counting them made no change in the result of the election because the candidate for whom 234 of the ballots thus rejected were cast had independently a majority of legal votes cast for him. The only difference which exists between that case and the present, is that the deputy returning officer here, when proceeding with the count, assumed to rectify, as he thought, the mistake which had been committed by himself, so that he might count the ballots so marked, and although the statute said they should not be counted, he proceeded to erase and has so successfully erased the numbers with which he had marked the ballot papers that they cannot now be identified, and so it cannot be ascertained for whom the votes in those ballot papers were given. The only question therefore is, was it competent for the returning officer to erase those marks and then to count the ballot papers. There is nothing in the statute vesting such authority in him, and, in the absence of an express provision to that effect, I am of opinion that he had no authority whatever so to do, and that we cannot sanction his act in so doing without in effect repealing the statute, the sole duty of the deputy returning officer after the ballot papers are put into the ballot box and the poll is closed, and his sole authority, is to count ballots therein as directed by the statute, and not to count but to reject, and to return as rejected, all ballot papers upon which there is any writing or mark by which the voter could be identified. Such a mark being on the ballot paper avoids the ballot. This being so, the ballot is void from the moment it is put into the ballot box with the avoiding mark upon it; and because it is so void the statute says it shall not be counted. The statute gives no power to the deputy returning officer to make a void ballot good and then to count it. His simple duty was to reject all ballots that were in the ballot box when he opened it which the statute directed him to reject, and to count only such as the statute directed him to count. All those being rejected which the statute said should not be counted, the rest only were to be counted. He had no authority whatever to erase any thing being on any ballot paper which he found in the box upon opening it at the close of the poll. If he might make a bad vote good, which he had himself made bad by putting the prohibited mark upon a ballot paper, I cannot see why he might not make a bad vote good in a case where such mark had been put upon it by the voter. In this particular case I am free to admit that there is nothing in the evidence which justifies us in imputing to the deputy returning officer anything but an error of judgment, but if the imperative language of the statute should be disregarded because the officer's conduct was attributable solely to an error of judgment, it must needs be disregarded also in the case of a corrupt officer, who might do the same thing from a corrupt motive which he had the tact to conceal or to make to appear to be innocent; so to rule would be plainly to repeal the statute, and to substitute a totally different provision from that which the statute in express terms enacts.\nIn the present case the deputy returning officer by the mistake which he committed with intent, no doubt, to correct his first mistake, has unfortunately made the matter worse than it would have been if he had left the ballot papers with the prohibited mark upon them, for thereby he has rendered it impossible for the tribunal trying the election petition to say for which candidate those marked ballots were cast, and the result is that as the majority either way is so small, it is impossible to say which of the candidates had a majority of good, valid and countable votes. Had he suffered the marks which he had wrongly put upon the ballots to remain there unerased, we could have seen for whom the votes were given, and we could have determined as in Woodward v. Sarsons whether they had or not, and in what manner, affected the result of the election; but having erased the marks and counted the ballots, as it is now impossible to identify the ballots which he so counted, and which the statute declared should not have been counted, we cannot say which candidate had the majority of good votes, and we have therefore, in my opinion, no alternative left to us but to say that there has been no election. It has been argued that such a decision would be at variance with our judgment in Jenkins v. Brecken, but there is really no resemblance whatever in this particular between that case and the present. In that case the sitting member, alter that the petitioner had, upon a scrutiny, succeeded in establishing that he had polled a majority of good legal votes, claimed the right of insisting under the 66th section of the Controverted Elections Act of 1874, 37 Vic. ch. 10, that the election was wholly void apart from the result arrived at on a scrutiny, and for reasons altogether unconnected with the question as to which of the candidates had polled a majority of legal votes. The contention of the sitting member was that, although his opponent had established that he had polled a majority of the legal votes, still the election should be avoided by reason of the returning officer not having properly regulated the polling districts as to the numbers of the voters, not having supplied the deputy returning officers in certain districts with a sufficient number of ballot papers, and not having in one district provided sufficient accommodation in the polling booths; and it was held that such objections could not be made by way of recrimination under the 66th sec. of 37th Vic., ch. 10, and that if they should prevail at all they should prevail wholly independently of any enquiry as to who had the majority of the votes polled. It is obvious that between that case and the present there is no parallel whatever. Here the whole matter is connected with the scrutiny, and is confined to the question\u2014which of the candidates had the majority of legal votes polled for him? The petitioners insist that Mr. Mills had. The respondent insists that he himself had, but, in investigating for the purpose of determining the question thus raised, it appears that at one of the polling booths certain ballot papers were marked in such a manner that the voters using those ballot papers could be identified, and that these ballot papers were counted although the statute imperatively prescribed that they should not be counted. These ballot papers, as the deputy returning officer when counting them erased the marks which he had himself put upon them, cannot be identified, and therefore it cannot be ascertained for whom the voters using them voted. The ballot papers having, however, been illegally counted by the deputy returning officer, ballot papers equal in number to those illegally counted should, in my opinion, be rejected from the votes cast at this polling division; but as it is impossible to say from which of the candidates the illegally counted ballot papers should be deducted, the result is that it is impossible by reason of the slight difference in the number polled for each to say which of the candidates had a majority of the legal votes. Under these circumstances the tribunal upon which is cast the duty of determining which had such majority, must needs find itself incapable of determining this question, and has no alternative therefore left to it but to declare that there has been no election, and that all that has taken place must be set aside and a new election held to enable the constituency to solve the difficulty; and to this effect, in my opinion, our report to the Speaker of the House of Commons should be.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellant: Blake, Kerr, Lash & Cassels.\nSolicitors for respondents: Fitzgerald & Beck\n[1] 7 Can.

SITTING- FOR THE TRIAL OF THE ABOVE NAMED ELECTION CASE.\nDominion Controverted Election\u2014Railway Pass\u201437 Vict., ch. 9, secs, 92. 96, 98 and 100\u2014-Questions of fact in appeal. Agent, limited powers of.\nIn appeal, four charges of bribery were relied upon, three of which were dismissed in the court below because there was not sufficient evidence that the electors had been bribed by an agent of the candidate; and the fourth charge was known as the Lamarche case. The facts were as follows:\u2014One L., the agent of C., the respondent, gave to certain electors employed on certain steamboats, tickets over the North Shore Railroad, to enable them to go without paying any fare from Montreal to Berthier, to vote at the Berthier election, the voters having accepted the tickets without any promise being exacted from or given by them. The tickets showed on their face that they had been paid for, but there was evidence L. had received them gratuitously from one of the officers of the company.\nThe learned judge who tried the case found as a fact that the tickets had not been paid for, and were given unconditionally, and therefore held it was not a corrupt act.\nHeld\u20141. (Foumier and Henry, JJ., dissenting) that the taking unconditionally and gratuitously of a voter to the poll by a railway company or an individual, whatever his occupation may be, or giving a voter a free pass over a railway, or by boat, or other conveyance, if unaccompanied by any conditions or stipulations that shall affect the voter's action in reference to the vote to be given, is not prohibited by 39 Vict., ch. 9 (D).\n2. That if a ticket, although given unconditionally to a voter by an agent of the candidate, has been paid for, then such a practice would be unlawful under section 96, and by virtue of section 98 a corrupt practice, and would avoid the election.\n3. That an agent who is not a general agent but an agent with powers expressly limited, cannot bind the candidate by anything done beyond the scope of his authority.\nAs to the remaining three charges the Court was of opinion that, on the facts the judgment of the Court below was not clearly wrong and should therefore not be reversed. (Fournier and Henry JJ., dissenting on the charge known as the Maxwell case.)\nAPPEAL from a judgment delivered on the 21st of February, 1883, by Mr. Justice Doherty, dismissing the election petition against the return of the respondent, at the election which took place in June, 1882, for the electoral district of Berthier, to the House of Commons.\nThe petition in this cause was presented, in the usual form as to corrupt practices, without claiming the seat. This petition was supplemented by a list of particulars consisting of twenty-six charges.\nPetitioners called and examined a large number of witnesses, and at the hearing, they abandoned all but five of the charges, persisting only in the 1st, 2nd, 8th and 20th, and in the additional particular A.\nOn appeal four charges of bribery were relied upon, 1st, the Lamarche case; 2nd, the Chalut case; 3rd, the Rithier & Cote's case; and 4th, the Maxwell case. The particulars of these charges are stated in the judgments hereinafter given.\nMr. Doutre, Q. C., and Mr. Mercier, Q. C., for appellants:\nAs to the Lamarche case.\nThe only question to decide on this question is whether the grant of free passes, some 20 in number, amounts to a corrupt practice, according to the Dominion election Act, 1874.\nWe submit that it is a corrupt practice according to sections 92, 96 and 98 of said Act.\nThe respondent was the conservative candidate, the railway was a government railway under the control and management of the Quebec conservative government. The passes were delivered by the officials of the road to convey electors to the poll, at the special request of respondent's agents. These passes were delivered the day before the polling day, and all these men were paid at the end of the week their full salary, although they lost a day and a half. Then it is established by the evidence that the value of these passes was $1 50cts. each. There is no doubt that these men would not have gone to Berthier that day, if they had been obliged to pay their travelling expenses and lose their salary during their absence.\nThis is a payment of a carriage to convey voters in violation of sec. 96. There is no actual payment proved, for Lamarche says he did not pay for these passes. But it comes to the same thing, and we fail to see the necessity of an actual payment of money, under the circumstances, to constitute a corrupt practice. To maintain such a system would be simply to give to a government, holding railways, the means of controlling, in a very extraordinary way, the elections of the whole country.\nBut suppose there is any doubt that this act falls under sec. 98, it seems that it can be brought under sec. 92, which constitutes a corrupt practice with the giving of any valuable consideration to an elector in order to induce him to vote or to favor the election of a candidate.\nThis point was specially raised in the celebrated case of Cooper and Slade, before the House of Lords in 1858 ([1]). Hickson v. Abbott ([2]). See also Leifgh and Lamarchand ([3]).\nIn the North Simcoe election case ([4]) it was decided in 1811 by Vice-Chancellor Strong that the hiring by an agent of the respondent of a railway train to convey voters was a payment of the travelling expenses of voters within the meaning of section 71 of 82 Vict., ch. 21, and was a corrupt practice.\nAccording to the ruling in the Selkirk case ([5]), the 96th section of the Dominion Elections Act, 1874, is included in the 98th section of the same Act ([6])The gift to electors of passes on railways, for the purpose of allowing those voters to go at all to the polls was declared in 1881 to be a corrupt practice in Hickson v. Abbott ([7]).\nIt seems to us very clear that under the circumstances of this case the election ought to be voided on account of the delivery of these passes. They were a valuable consideration given to electors to induce them to vote. They were practical payment of travelling expenses, and it is quite indifferent whether this payment of travelling expenses was made with money or with a valuable consideration of any kind.\nTo uphold such a system would be to encourage the worst kind of bribery; for it would be to allow a candidate to convey any amount of voters to the polls by way of passes granted by a friendly railway company.\nThe Bolton ([8]) case cited by Mr. Justice Doherty has no authority here; and the Principles laid down by Judge Mellor are entirely opposed to our own jurisprudence.\n[As to the three other charges, the argument of counsel sufficiently appear in the judgments.]\nMr. Lacoste, Q. C, and Mr. Bisaillon with him for respondent.\nAs Lamarche is admitted to have been an agent, the only question which arises is whether Lamarche has violated the 96th section of the Act by \" having promised to pay, or paying for any horse, team, carriage, cab or other vehicle, by any candidate or by any person on his behalf, to convey any voter or voters to or from the poll, or to or from the neighbourhood thereof at the election.\"\nThe passes were given gratis; they were never paid for, and were given unconditionally. Lamarche or Labelee acted merely as would have acted any person voluntarily and gratuitously conveying voters at the poll with his own carriage, and the judge in the court below so found.\nThe appellant's proof entirely fails to bring the charge under the provisions of the said 96th section of the Act, but the petitioners contend that the passes given to the voters by Lamarche were things of value, and that they were given as a v valuable consideration,\" to induce said, voters to vote for respondent at the election. This question has been already fully discussed in the Boton case ([9]) where it was decided that the giving of a pass was not a valuable consideration under the Act. See also Rogers on Elections ([10]), where all the cases on this point are collected.\nThen as to whether Lamarche has violated section 92, We submit that there has been no violation of that section because no payment was made. There is nothing in the law to prevent a railway company any more than a private company from granting a free conveyance to the voter. Cooper v. Slade is distinguishable on this point. Hickson v. Abbott ([11]) and the Simcoe case ([12]) relied on by appellants, are not applicable, because in those cases the tickets were paid for and the election was avoided not under section 92 but under section 96\nMr. Mercier, Q. C, in reply.\nRITCHIE C. J.:\u2014\nThere are in this case four charges which the petitioners rely on, viz.:\u2014\n1st. The Lamarche case.\nThe charge in this case is in these words:\u2014\nQue pendant la dite \u00e9lection, le dit Edouard Octavien Cuthbert, directement et indirectement, par lui m\u00eame, par le moyen d'autres personnes, et de ses a agents autoris\u00e9s, et entr'autres par Olivier Lamarche, marchand de Berthierville district electoral de Berthier, de la part et du consentement et \u00e0 Ia connaissance r\u00e9elle du dit Intim\u00e9, a pay\u00e9 les d\u00e9penses de v voyage et autres d\u00e9peness d'un grand nombre d'\u00e9lec teurs du dit district electoral de Berthier pour les aider \u00e0 se rendre \u00e0 l'\u00e9lection, et \u00e0 s'en retourner, \u00e0 se rendre aux on aux environs des bureaux de votation et entr'autres \u00e0 Octave Boucher, Jean Baptiste Godin, Alexandre Godin, Narcisse Boucher, Louis Valois, Pierre Latour, tous navigateurs de l'Ile Dupas, dans le district \u00e9lectoral de Berthier,' Joseph Plouffe, Alfred Bruno, Dolphis Rocrais, Dolphis Mass\u00e9, Servius Mass\u00e9, J Joseph Page, Octave Parent, tous navigateurs de Berthier dans le dit district Lafontaine de Qu\u00e9bec, employ\u00e9 civil; Narcisse Boucher, navigateur de Trois Rivi\u00e8res, district de Trois Rivi\u00e8res; Pierre Arpin, navigateur de Lanoraie, dit district de Berthier; Dolphis Buron, navigateur de Berthier, district \u00e9lectoral de Berthier; Charles Rocrais, navigateur du m\u00eame lieu; Alfred Chiquette, ma\u00eetre de pension de Montr\u00e9al, district de Montr\u00e9al; toutes ces personnes \u00e9tant \u00e9lecteurs de la division \u00e9lectorale de Berthier et d\u00f9ment qualifi\u00e9s \u00e0 voter \u00e0 la dite election, et ayant v vot\u00e9 \u00e0 la dite election donnant \u00e0 chacune des dites personnes, un billet de passage sur le chemin de fer Quebec, Montr\u00e9al, Ottawa et Occidental, et autres v valeurs et d'autres mani\u00e8res pour les conduire dans le u dit district \u00e9lectoral de Berthier aux ou aux environs d des bureaux de votation, o\u00f9 chacune des dites personnes avait respectivement droit de voter, et que les dites personnes ont ensuite revendu les dits billets de passage, qu'ils avaient ainsi obtenus gratis et dans un but frauduleux, ill\u00e9gal et de corruption, et pour les engager \u00e0 voter pour le dit Intim\u00e9, et ont retire de ces ventes des sommes d'argent ou autres valeurs qu'ils ont gard\u00e9es pour leur usage personnel exclusif.\nLamarche, the agent of Cuthbert, gave to certain parties employed on certain steamboats, being persons qualified to vote at the Berthier election, tickets or passes over the Quebec, Montreal, Ottawa & Occidental Railway, to enable them to go, without paying any fare from Montreal to Berthier to vote at such election It is very clear, indeed, not denied, that these voters travelled free on these tickets from Montreal to Berthier to vote, and voted there, but it is denied that they were given with any corrupt intent, or that the giving of these tickets or passes amounted to bribery or corrupt practices within the meaning of the Dominion Elections Act, 1874, and it is alleged that nothing was said or done by Lamarche corruptly to induce these persons to vote for or aid the respondent in his election, but that the passes were given unconditionally, and, therefore, there was no violation of the Dominion Elections Act 1874. The judgment of the learned judge in the court below would seem to proceed on the authority and applicability of the cases of Cooper and Slade ([13]), and the Bolton case ([14]). In the case of Cooper and Slade a conditional promise to pay travelling expenses was held to be bribery.\nIn the Bollon case, it was submitted that the sending of the letters and railway passes was either an act of bribery according to the doctrine laid down by the House of Lords in the case of Cooper and Slade (1) or a simple act of bribery within the meaning of the Corrupt Practices Act, 1854, sec. 2; and secondly, that if it was not an act of bribery still that it was an illegal act which had been systematically and wilfully done for the purpose of influencing the election, and that as such it ought to be held to have avoided the election.\nThe court held in the Bolton case that there was not a conditional promise, but had it been: \" If you come and vote for the respondent the expense of obtaining a railway ticket will be paid,\" Mr. Justice Mellor says: \" This would, no doubt, have brought it within the case of Cooper and Slade.\" 1 think neither the case of Cooper and Slade nor the Bolton case are at all applicable to the present, because I cannot satisfy my mind that the tickets were in this case given on any such condition as would legally constitute the act a case of bribery under the 92nd section. In the English acts there are no such enactments, as sections 96 and 101 of the Dominion Act of 1874 and it is under these sections that this case must, in my opinion, be determined. Under these sections the charge is not that of bribery, but of a corrupt practice by virtue of the prohibition of section 96 and the declaration of what offences shall be corrupt practices, as quite distinct from acts of bribery as provided against in section 92. Those provisions which are not to be found in the English Act of 1854 are as follows:\n37 Vic. ch. 9 section 96:\nAnd whereas doubts may arise as to whether the hiring of teams and vehicles to convey voters to and from the polls, and the paying of railway fares and other expenses of voters, be or be not according to law, it is declared and enacted, that the hiring or promising to pay or paying for any horse, team, carriage, cab or other vehicle, by any candidate or by any person on his behalf, to convey any voter or voters to or from the poll or to or from the neighbourhood thereof, at any election, or the payment by any candidate, or by any person on his behalf, of the travelling and other expenses of any voter, in going to or returning from any election, are and shall be unlawful acts; and the person so offending shall forfeit the sum of one hundred dollars to any person who shall sue for the same; and any voter hiring any horse, cab, cart, wagon, sleigh, carriage or other conveyance for any candidate, or for any agent of a candidate, for the purpose of conveying any voter or voters to or from the polling place or places, shall, ipso facto, be disqualified from voting at such election, and for every such offence shall forfeit the sum of one hundred dollars to any person suing for the same.\nSection 98:\nThe offences of bribing, treating or undue influence, or any of such offences, as defined by this or any other Act of the Parliament of Canada, personating or the inducing any person to commit personating, or any willful offence against any one of the six next preceding sections of this Act, shall be corrupt practices, within the meaning of the provisions of this Act. Section 101:\nIf it is found by the report of any court, judge or other tribunal for the trial of election petitions, that any corrupt practice has been committed by any candidate at an election, or by his agent, whether with or without the actual knowledge and consent of such candidate, the election of such candidate, if he has been elected, shall be void.\nIn my opinion this offence or corrupt practice maybe complete without the slightest intent to bribe, as where a candidate or his agent knowing a voter intended to vote for the candidate and therefore required no inducement to do so, chooses to pay such a voter's railway fares or travelling expenses. In such a case, notwithstanding the voters may have accepted the free passage without any condition or promise being exacted from or given by them, the offence provided against by sec. 96 would be complete, though no offence of bribery could be thereby established, while on the other hand, if the voting for the candidate was made by the voter to d\u00e9pend on the condition that he should be paid his railway fare and travelling expenses, then the offence of bribery would be made out, and parties so offending would be guilty of a misdemeanor under section 92 to which persons offending against the 96th section are not made liable.\nThe question here being, whether what is complained of was a corrupt practice under the 96 and 98 sections, let us see how the case stands.\nIt is established that Lamarche was the respondent's agent. The learned judge says \" the proof summarized shows that he was a strong partizan and supporter of respondent, was a member of his committee, canvassed some and was engaged and interested in favor of respondent,\" and the judge further says that \" Lamarche gave passes for 17 to 20, and that he gave them to the voters referred to and that they did travel free on them from Montreal to Berthier to vote and voted; this,\" he says, \" is not and cannot be disputed.\" It is difficult to believe that those tickets or passes \"were not placed in Lamarche's hands to enable him to convey voters to the polls who would vote for the respondent, or that when he delivered such tickets he did not well understand and believe that the voters to whom tickets were so supplied would proceed to Berthier and record their votes for the respondent, and that they did so.\nThen, were these tickets paid for? The fair inference, in the absence of evidence to the contrary would seem to be that these tickets or passes were purchased from the government to be used for the conveyance of voters to vote for the respondent, and so in point of law the railway fares of these voters were paid for by the agent of the respondent who used these tickets and supplied them to the voters; or if not actually paid for by him were so used by him, knowing them to have been paid for\nThen there is the evidence of Parent, one of those voters, and he produces the ticket supplied to him, which certainly goes far to show that these tickets were purchased and paid for, the ticket on its face stating that it was paid for though issued at a reduced rate. He says:\nQ.\u2014Avez-vous vu M. Olivier Lamarche ce jourl\u00e0?

Vous a-t-il demand\u00e9 pour qui vous alliez voter? \" we find no answer given.\nAnd this likewise negatives, if it does not dispose of, the hypothesis that these voters being employees of the Richelieu Navigation Co. were travelling by the railway free under an alleged usage whereby the employees of the railway company and the Richelieu Navigation Co. were permitted to travel free, a usage by no means clearly proved to have existed, stud which, had it existed. there is no evidence it was acted on in this case on the contrary had it been acted on there would have been no need for the interference or instrumentality of Lamarche, who was in no way connected with either company.\nInasmuch then as the statute has specially mentioned the paying of railway fares, and section 96 was expressly passed to put an end to any doubts that might arise in reference thereto, considering the great, dangerous and corrupt influence that can be exercised in favour of particular candidates through the instrumentality of railway tickets I think when such means are resorted to for bringing voters to the polls (by the candidate or his agents) the operation should be very narrowly watched and very strictly scrutinized, and as the fair and natural inference prim\u00fb facts is that passengers travelling on railways, do so by paying the regular fares, a certain presumption is raised that when voters travel on a railway to the polling place on tickets supplied by the candidate, or his agent, that such tickets have been paid for by such candidate, or his agent in accordance with the usual course of the business of the railway, and this, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, appears to me to be much strengthened when the ticket shows on its face that it had been paid for, and it does seem to me to be a thin and flimsy cover indeed under which to allow the candidate or his agents supplying voters with such paid tickets, for what the law designates a corrupt practice, to screen the transaction by simply alleging that these tickets came to his or their hands enclosed in an envelope and leave the matter there. if there were any exceptional circumstances to withdraw the transaction from the operation of the statute, the burthen of disclosing such circumstances would, in my opinion, rather be on the candidate or his agents than on the petitioner, as the former have the knowledge within themselves, and were the persons who can best explain the matter, while on the Other hand in almost if not quite every case the means of exposing the details of the illegality of the transaction (by the petitioner) would be a matter of impossibility, establishing that a candidate or his agent has supplied voters with paid tickets by the instrumentality, of which they have gone to and returned from the polls, clearly, to my mind, establishes a prim\u00fb tacie case. I cannot for a moment suppose that this strong partizan and supporter of the respondent obtained these passes with the patriotic, philanthropic or charitable view of enabling all these men to vote free of expense at the election, wholly irrespective of whom they would vote for I cannot believe that he did not know that if he got them to Berthier they would vote for the respondent and that he obtained the tickets and distributed them so that he might in the interest of the respondent secure their attendance and their votes at the polls for the respondent. No one can believe that Lamarche, who says he knew all these seafaring men and who adds \"Je connais nos ennemis et nos amis,\" would furnish a ticket to any voter whom he thought would be an enemy at the poll nor doubt that he had a full reliance as to how the votes would be given. Giving these tickets to the voters was not as Willes, J., in Cooper v. Slad\u00e9 suggests:\u2014\nMerely to induce the voters to come to the place of polling, and tot to vote at all or come there and vote for the rival candidates. Such suppositions, he says, are possible, but, speaking mildly, improbably in a high degree, because plainly inconsistent with the object for which the party was striving, namely, to get votes for his side.\nMr. Cuthbert, though examined, says nothing of this transaction, and neither Mr. Labelle nor Mr. Seneca in whose name the tickets were issued, nor any other person connected, with the railway have been examined to explain at whose instance, or on what consideration, these passes were issued, if they were not issued in the interest of the candidate to be used by his agents as tickets duly paid for, or otherwise than as expressed on their face. It is not suggested that Labelle did anything wrong, and in the absence of any evidence to show that the tickets were not regularly issued on being duly paid for, or that the tickets expressed on their face what was not literally true, I have very great difficulty in seeing how they can be treated as issued gratuitously. This was then \u00e0 Government railway run in the interest of the Province at large. and not in the interest of any individual election candidate. It is not, therefore, to be presumed that the Government allowed it to be so used or that it was so used by the employees of the Government of their own mere motion.\nI have, therefore, the greatest difficulty in arriving at any other conclusion than that these tickets were paid for, and that their distribution and user in the manner detailed in the evidence should be regarded in no other light than as amounting to a payment by the agent of the candidate on his behalf of the travelling expenses or railway fares of voters going to and returning from the election at Berthier, which if so would be an unlawful act under section 96 and by virtue of section 98 a corrupt practice, that section enacting that any wilful offence of section 96 shall be a corrupt practice which simply means purposely doing that which the section forbids and which by virtue of section 100 avoids the election, that section declaring that any corrupt practice committed by a candidate or his agent shall render the election of such candidate if he has been elected void\nThough I am strongly impressed with these considerations I cannot lose sight of the principle which governs courts of appeal in dealing with the decisions of courts of first instance on questions of fact.\nThe learned judge of the first instance has found against this view of the evidence which has so strongly impressed me\u2014his decision on the evidence being, that these tickets were not paid for in which conclusion I understand my brothers Strong and Gwynne entirely concur. As this is a question of fact, pure and simple, the finding of the judge who tried the case should not be lightly disturbed, nor should an election be lightly set aside. When this finding is thus supported by two of the five judges sitting in this court, making three of the six judges who have heard this case I cannot but distrust my own judgment, and such doubts are thereby raised in my mind as to the correctness of the conclusion I should have been disposed to arrive at if the decision rested with myself alone without any conflict of opinion that, considering an Appellate Court should not reverse on a question of fact without its being made apparent that the court below was clearly wrong, and the so often expressed opinions of judges that before a judge should upset an election, he should be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the election was void under such circumstances I think I am bound to give the respondent the benefit of the doubt thus created.\nI am unable to say that 1 feel such confidence in my own impressions, strong though they be to the contrary, as would justify me in saying that I am entirely satisfied that the Judge was clearly wrong in the conclusion at which he arrived and therefore I do not feel that I should be justified in reversing his decree.\nI think taking, unconditionally and gratuitously, a voter to the poll by a Railway Company, or an individual of whatever his occupation may be, or giving a voter a free pass over a railway, or by boat or other conveyance, if unaccompanied by any conditions or stipulations that shall affect the voter's action in reference to the vote to be given, is not prohibited by the statute. If it is against public policy, as I may think it is, that railway companies or others, having control of public conveyances, should be permitted to do this, its prohibition not being provided for by the statute, it is a casus omissus, which can only be remedied by Parliament. The courts cannot declare any Act illegal and corrupt, though one candidate may be thereby much benefitted, to the injury of the other which has not been made so by the law.\nObjectionable, as unquestionably in my opinion such a proceeding is, as unfairly and unduly affecting the election, and possibly illegal as it may be as against the public interest and public policy, that officers or employees having the management of government railways, in which the public at large are individually and collectively equally interested, should issue free tickets to be distributed gratuitously, though unconditionally, in the interest of a particular candidate or party, yet, as the statute has not prohibited such a proceeding and has not declared such an Act to be illegal and a corrupt practice, or provided that it should invalidate the election I do not think this court has without statutory authority, any power to avoid an election for this cause.\nThe second charge is the Cot\u00e9 and Rithier case. The learned judge says: \"I see no proof at all sufficient to establish the agency of Cot\u00e9 \"\u2014a conclusion from which I do not feel myself justified in differing.\nAs to the case of Maxwell, of St. Damien, I have no doubt the money was sent to bribe Maxwell and if it can be established that it was done by an agent of the respondent must annul the election. The evidence is full of suspicions, but whatever suspicious there may be, there is no evidence of the agency of Daveluy that I can put my hand on.\nThe case of H\u00e9nault is not quite so clear. Daveluy gives the letter containing this money to St, Cyr, who was not proved to be defendait's agent, at Hochelaga, to be forwarded to Maxwell at Berthier he meets Lamarche, the acknowledged agent of the respondents, and asks him who was going to St. Damien and was informed by him that it was H\u00e9nault. The inference is clearly that in asking who was going to St. Damien he was seeking to discover who was going there in the interest of the respondent. He seeks H\u00e9nault and gives him the money, telling him he was told there was money in it. H\u00e9nault was going to speak for respondent, as the judge says, evidently with his knowledge and consent. Though the money passed through the hands of H\u00e9nault and however suspicious the transaction is throughout, I cannot say the evidence sufficiently establishes that he was anything more than the bearer of the letter ignorant of the nature of the transaction, and therefore not a participator as the agent of the candidate in the act of bribery.\nThis case, surrounded as it undoubtedly is by the gravest suspicions, is not, however, so clearly made out as to justify me in reversing the judgment of the learned judge.\nas to the Chalut case, I think this was nothing more than a bone tide payment of the expenses of Chalut, and was neither colorable nor corrupt, and therefore I agree with the learned judge that in this case petitioners have also failed to establish a charge of personal bribery against the respondent. The appeal will therefore be dismissed but I think without costs, following the course of the judge below, as I think the case a most proper one for the fullest investigation. STRONG J.:\u2014\nThe appeal was confined to four distinct cases of alleged corrupt practices, which I will consider separately.\nThe first case is that of Olivier Lamarche, the facts of which may be concisely stated as follows:\u2014 Lamarche had his home at Berthier where his family resided but carried on business at Montreal. He was constantly passing between the two places on board the steamers of the Richelieu Navigation Company, and thus came to know the men comprising the crews of their vessels. He was, undoubtedly, as the learned judge has found on most ample evidence, an agent of the respondent, being an active member of his committee at Berthier, On the day before the polling day, Lamarche went on board the steamer Three Rivers \" having a list of the names of those men of the crew who were voters in this County and asked some of them if they would go to Berthier to vote. He says he knew all these men the friends as well as the enemies of the political party with which he was allied. Some of the men thus appealed to, said that they would not go to Berthier unless they were furnished with free passes over the railway. It appears that Lamarche then went to Mr. Labelle the ticket agent of the Northern Railway, and applied for free passes for 17 or 20 men. These passes were furnished to him being handed to him the same day enclosed in an envelope, by Mr. Goodeve, a clerk employed in the railway office. In my view of the evidence it appears very clearly established that these tickets were granted freely by the railway authorities; that they were not paid for by Lamarche, or by any one else, nor was it intended they should be paid for. Lamarche took these passes on board the steamer \"Three Rivers\" and left some of them with the captain, and gave others to men. who were voters and some 8 or 10 men went by the railway, travelling on these passes the same day to Berthier, and voted there the next day. It does not appear 'that Lamarche imposed any conditions upon those to whom he delivered passes, as to how they were to vote, or that he requested them to vote for the res pondent, or made any enquiry of them as to their intensions with regard to the candidate for whom they were to vote. Upon this state of facts, two questions of law arise 1st. Was the furnishing of these railway passes or tickets to the voters in question a payment of travelling expenses within the 96th section of the Dominion Elections Act 1874? 2nd. Did it constitute bribery or a corrupt practice, within the 92nd section of the same Act?\nOn both these questions I concur in the conclusions arrived at by the learned judge before whom this petition was originally heard, that Lamarche, in delivering these railway passes to the voters named, did not commit a corrupt act under either of these sections.\nAs regards section 96, by which \"the payment by any candidate, or by any person on his behalf of the travelling and other expenses of any voter in going to or returning from any election \" is declared to be an unlawful act, and which, by section 98, is further declared to be a corrupt practice, and consequently an act avoiding the election by the express, provision of sec. 102, it cannot apply for the plain reason that there was no payment of expenses. The tickets or passes are proved to have been granted gratuitously by the railway authorities and consequently all that was done amounted to just this, and no more that the railway at the request of an agent of the respondents, carried certain voters from Montreal to Berthier free of charge and it cannot be contended that this is equivalent to a payment of travelling expenses any more than the carrying of a voter to the poll by a third person in his own carriage, at the request of a candidate or his agent could be said to come within this provision of the statute ([15]).\nIn order to bring a case within this 96th section there must be a payment of money for the expenses. If money is paid by a candidate or his agent for the travelling expenses of a voter, I should not consider it material in order to avoid the election within this 96th section, as distinguished from the case of section 92, that any condition was imposed upon the voter that he should vote for any particular candidate. The case would be within the words and spirit of the enactment if it could be shown that there was an actual disbursement made by the candidate, or his agent, for the purpose of paying any voter's expenses, regardless altogether of any stipulation or promise that his vote should be cast for a specified candidate. I repeat, however, that here there was no disbursement of money, and consequently there has not been, in this respect, the commission of any such corrupt act as involves an avoidance of the election under section 96. If as in the Bolton case ([16]), the tickets had been paid for, or even agreed to be paid for by Lamarche, I should have considered that that would have amounted to a payment of travelling expenses and that consequently the election ought to be set aside.\nWhen the Bolton case was decided the state of the law in England was such that the payment of travelling expenses did not avoid the election but was merely an illegal act, subjecting the person committing it to a penalty, and Mr. Justice Mellor in that case, although he decided that sending a railway pass which had been paid for and which entitled the holder of the pass to exchange it for a ticket, did. not, having regard to the statutory provisions which, then existed avoid the election was still of opinion that it was an illegal act within the statute; and this opinion, as I understand that case, was founded upon the fact of the pass having been paid for.\nThen as regards section 92 it seems to me that the conclusion of Mr. Justice Doherty, and the reasons upon which that conclusion was founded, was upon the authorities also entirely correct This 92nd section is as follows:\u2014\nEvery person who directly or indirectly, by himself, or by any other person on his behalf, gives, lends, or agrees to give or lend, or offers or promises any money or valuable consideration, or promises to procure, or endeavour to procure, any money or valuable consideration, to or for any voters, or to or for any person on behalf of any voters, or to or for any person, in order to induce any voter to vote or refrain from voting, or corruptly doss any such act as aforesaid on account of such voter having voted or refrained from voting at any election.\nShall be deemed guilty of bribery and punishable accordingly.\nThis provision is a literal transcript of sub-sec. 1 of sec. 2 of the Imperial Act, 17 and 18 Vic, c. 102, and consequently the English decisions upon this latter enactment are express authorities to guide us in applying this 92nd section of our own act. Then the question we have to decide here is narrowed to this: Did the giving of these railway passes or tickets to the voters named constitute a giving of valuable consideration to such voters to induce them to vote? That the giving of these passes or tickets by Lamarche was the giving of a v valuable consideration \" within the meaning of the statute, I entertain no doubt. That a railway ticket is a token of value is plain since it enables the holder of it to procure an advantage which, without it, he could only obtain by the payment of money. So far, therefore, the case is brought within the statute, and it is shown that a valuable consideration was given to voters by the respondents' agent, Lamarche. Is it, however, shewn that the case is brought within the other condition of the statute, which requires that the valuable consideration shall have been given \" to induce such voter to vote?\" Upon the construction to be placed upon these words, the decision must depend. Whatever doubt we might have felt in placing an interpretation upon this expression, if we had been called upon now to do so for the first time, we are relieved from any difficulty on this score by the decisions upon the corresponding Imperial enactment, which, being many in number and emanating from courts and judges of the highest authority, are conclusive of the present case, if any question of statutory construction can be concluded by authority. It is to be observed that there is nothing in the evidence to establish that Lamarche imposed any condition upon the voters to whom he gave the passes, that they were to vote for the respondent, or that he even invited or requested them so to vote, or to vote at all. It may indeed well be presumed that, from his constant and familiar intercourse with these men, he knew their political bias so well that he considered it superfluous to attach any such condition or make any such request. Indeed, I gather from his expression, \"Je connais nos ennemis et nos amis,\" that he admits this was the case. It does not not appear, however, that he withheld any tickets from any voters amongst the crews because he supposed they were adverse to his party, but that the tickets were given to all the men who had votes. These being the well established facts the case of Cooper v. Slade decided in 1856 in the Exchequer Chamber, is an authority conclusively showing that the conduct of Lamarche, in the present case, did not amount to an act of bribery within this 92nd section of the Act of 1874. It was there held that in order to make out a promise to pay, or the payment of travelling expenses, to be a promise, or giving of a valuable consideration, to induce a voter to vote within the words of the claim under consideration, it must be shown that such a payment or promise was conditional upon the voter voting for a particular candidate. This decision was approved of as regards the law by the House of Lords in an action brought to recover a penalty, and, the judgment of the House having been delivered by Law Lords of great eminence, it must be deemed conclusive of the law upon this point. In the judgment delivered in the Exchequer Chamber in this case of Cooper v. Slade, with which the House of Lords agreed so far. as the law and the construction of the statute and the meaning to be attached to the words, \"induce \u00e0 voter to vote,\" were involved, though it differed as to the application of the principles of law to the facts there proved in evidence, Alderson, B., lays down the law in the following words :__\nAn unconditional promise of travelling expenses to a voter to go to the place of polling, with leave to him to vote or not, as and how he likes, seems to us certainly not a promise of money to induce the voter to vote, being neither a promise with that view nor directly calculated to cause it.\nAnd Williams, J., who differed from the rest of the court, did so expressly upon the ground that the letter which had been written to the voter by the agents of the candidate was to be construed, not as an absolute but as a conditional promise to pay the expenses\u2014an opinion which was also that of the House of Lords. This case of Cooper v. Slade was followed in the case upon which the decision of the learned judge in the case now under appeal was founded, that of the petition\n(1) 2 O'M. & H. 146. for the Borough of Bolton, decided in 1874 by Mr. Justice Mellor ([17]) where it was held upon state of facts indistinguishable from those before this court in the present case (with the single exception that there the ticket or pass sent to the voter had been paid for whilst here it was granted by the railway company gratuitously), that the delivery of a railway pass to a voter to enable him to go to the poll free of expense, accompanied with a request to him to vote for the candidate by whose agent the pass was sent, was not, in the absence of any expressed condition that the pass was only to be used for the purpose of enabling him to vote for the candidate in whose interest it was furnished, bribery or a corrupt act either at common law or within the statute. The principle of the decision in these cases is very clearly defined in the opinion of Baron Channel in Cooper v. Slade in the House of Lords and in that of Mr. Justice Mellor in the Bolton case where he points out that a pass or ticket being given unconditionally, as the facts establish beyond dispute that the passes or tickets furnished by Lamarche were given in the present case, that there is no bargain or agreement at all that the voter shall vote in a particular manner, or that he should vote at all, that he may go to the poll and there refuse to vote or vote against the candidate from whose agent he has received the ticket or pass without being guilty of the breach of any obligation. I will quote a short passage from the judgment in the Bolton case, which appears to me to have a direct application here. The learned Judge says:\u2014\nThe voter was not bound by any other consideration than an honorable one that is to say this is sent to me that I may go to the poll. If I were to take advantage of the opportunity afforded by this ticket, not to vote, but to go to Bolton on my own business, or to vote for the other side, I should be doing a shabby thing. That appears to me to be the only sort of obligation, something arising from the idea of honor or good faith, by which a voter receiving such a pass might be affected. But it is entirely free from that question which was the turning point in Cooper v. Slade. If he had voted for the other candidates, could they have recovered back the value of this pass from him? They could not. He was under no other obligation by accepting that pass than that which his own sense of honor might dictate: he was under no legal obligation whatever, and therefore it is not, in my opinion, within the case of Cooper v. Slade.\nEvery word of this is applicable to the facts in evidence here, and I am of opinion that the learned judge who heard this petition was entirely right in adopting the law as thus expounded by Mr. Justice Mellor, and dismissing the charge accordingly.\nFor the sake of distinctness, and in order that there may be no misapprehension of the grounds on which this opinion is founded, I think it right to add, though it may involve repetition, that had the tickets been purchased by Lamarche, and either paid for or agreed to be paid for, I should have considered the case as coming within the 96th section, which prohibits the payment of travelling expenses; and had the tickets been given to the voters upon the express condition or stipulation that they were to vote for the respondent, or had they promised so to vote, I should have thought the case within the principle of the actual decision in Cooper v. Slade, and so a corrupt act, avoiding the election under sec. 92.\nIt was forcibly argued by the learned counsel for the appellants, that although the railway authorities were not in any sense agents of the respondent, yet the granting free tickets by the managing officer of a government railway, or a railway company, was a practice so liable to abuse and one which would open the door to such an overwhelming amount of undue influence, that we ought, on grounds of public policy, and irrespective of any identification of the railway authorities with the candidate, and in the absence of all proof of agency, to mark it with disapproval by setting aside the election upon that ground alone. To this argument I can only repeat the answer already given by the Chief Justice, that if we were to accede to this argument we should be making, not administering, the law, and that whatever grounds such considerations may afford for alteration of the law, that is a matter for the appreciation of the Legislature and not one which can influence the decision of the courts.\nChalut's Case.\nThe conduct of the respondent and his agents in this case seems to me entirely free from any taint of illegality. Mr. Chalut was a warm supporter of the respondent, and the chairman of his principal committee. He was asked to go to a parish at some distance to canvass and make arrangements for the election, and $20 were sent him by the respondent for his expenses, and $5 by Mr. Tranchemontagne, a member of the committee. I can see no objection to this. The money was not an unreasonable indemnity for the ex-expenses and the loss of time of a professional man\u2014a notary\u2014for some four days. It is not and could not have been pretended that it was a colourable payment, cloaking a bribe, and I know of no law which prohibits the bonu fide employment of electors for lawful purposes incidental to the election. The case was rightly dismissed by the court below.\nCot\u00e9-Rithier's Case.\nIt is sufficient to say as the learned judge held, that there was no evidence of any agency to identify the respondent with any act of Mr. Cot\u00e9, and it is matter of surprise that this case, decided on grounds so very plain and satisfactory as those on which it has been placed by Mr. Justice Doherty, should have been made the subject of appeal.\nMaxwell's s Case.\nIt cannot be denied that the contents of the letter sent by Daveluy to Maxwell create a strong presumption that the money enclosed in it was intended under color of paying for the entertainment of voters at a preceding provincial election, for the purpose of unduly influencing Maxwell and inducing him to support the respondent; in plain words, for the purpose of bribing him and this presumption is not removed or weakened but rather strengthened, by the extremely unsatisfactorily account which Maxwell gave of the transaction between Daveluy himself, and especially by his story about the account for butter and shingles which is only put forward after the adjournment of the court has given him an opportunity of conversing with others. But the evidence wholly fails, in my opinion, to connect the respondent with the corrupt act of Daveluy, if we are to assume such an act as established. There is no proof of the agency of Daveluy himself. St. Cyr, though an agent of the respondent, as being a member of the committee is not shown to have been privy in any manner to the purpose of Daveluy, or to have been cognizant of the contents of the letter in which the money was enclosed or of the purpose for which it was designed. As to H\u00e9nault his agency was a limited agency\u2014that of a public speaker\u2014and for his acts beyond those performed in that character the respondent cannot be made liable. No proposition in election law is better established than that an agent who is not a general agent, but an agent with powers expressly limited, cannot bind the candidate by anything done beyond the scope of his authority. Windsor ([18]); Durham ([19]); Bodmin ([20]); West burg ([21]); Blackburn ([22]) North Norfolk ([23]); Harwich ([24]).\nH\u00e9nault was a paid agent, not a voter, having no connection with the election or with the respondent beyond this, that he was brought from Montrell and employed to make a speech on the Sunday after mass at the church door at St. Damien. Anything he did in the course of this special agency would have bound the respondent, but everything done out of the line of his special employment as an orator can, on the authorities referred to. have no such effect. I therefore concur with Mr. Justice Doherty in the conclusion at which he arrived in this as well as in the other cases, and I am of opinion that the appeal must be dismissed with costs. It is satisfactory to be able to come to this conclusion, as upon a consideration of the whole evidence, I am convinced that the respondent desired and did his best to ensure a pure election, and I cannot help adding that I think the learned judge who tried the petition should have dismissed it with costs, which is the only respect either as regards the results arrived at in the court below, or the reasons given for those results, in which I find any ground for differing from the judgment appealed against.\nFOURNIES, J.:\nLa petition attaque l'\u00e9lection de l'Intim\u00e9 pour men\u00e9es corruptrices pratiqu\u00e9es par lui-m\u00eame et par ses agents.

J Je connais nos ennemis et nos amis La veille de l'\u00e9lection il se rendit \u00e0- bord des bateaux a vapeur Trois-Rivi\u00e8res, Chambly, Terrebonne et Qu\u00e9bec pour y voir les \u00e9lecteurs de Berthier qui \u00e9taient employ\u00e9s \u00e0 bord de ces bateaux Il ajoute qu'il a toujours fait cette besogne dans les elections qui out eu lieu l'\u00e9t\u00e9.\nIi fit ce jour-l\u00e0 deux visites \u00e0 bord de ces bateaux, ,la premi\u00e8re entre neuf et dix heures du matin, pour s'assurer de la pr\u00e9sence et des dispositions des \u00e9lecteurs qui se trouvaient \u00e0 bord de ces bateaux et la seconde vers une heure de l'apr\u00e8s-midi pour leur donner les billets de passage qu'ils avaient exig\u00e9s de lui lors de sa premi\u00e8re visite pour aller voter\nD'apr\u00e8s le t\u00e9moin Joly c'est entre 8\u00bd et 9 heures du matin que Lamarche s'est rendu \u00e0 bord du Trois Rivi\u00e8res.\nEn arrivant, dit ce t\u00e9moin, ii a h\u00e2l\u00e9 un papier: il a nomm\u00e9 thus les voteurs \u00e0 bord; apr\u00e8s qu'il a eu fini, il y a une couple de voteurs qui out dit: \"on aimerait \u00e0 partir aujourd'hui: si on ne part pas \"i aujourd'hui, on n'y va pas et on aimerait \u00e0 avoir notre passage \" Dour aller et revenir et on aimerait \u00e0 aller chacun chez nous \" avant d'aller voter.\" C'est tout ce quo j'ai vu.\nQ\u2014 Il avait une liste des \u00e9lecteurs qui travaillaient \u00e0 bord ii les a appel\u00e9s?\nR\u2014Oui, monsieur; il avait leurs noms sur un petit papier.\nQ\u2014Et tous les \u00e9lecteurs appel\u00e9s sontils venus?\nR\u2014H manquait peut-\u00eatre bien quelques-uns.\nQ\u2014Combien y en avait il \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s s\nr\u2014Six \u00e0 sept.\nQ\u2014Voulez-vous nous en nommer quelques-uns?\nR\u2014Oui, monsieur: Alfred Bruneau, il y avait: Dolphis Rocrais\nQ\u2014Ensuite?\nR\u2014Il y en avait d'autres, je no me rappelle pas de leurs noms l\u00e0, mais je sais qu'il y en avait d'autres.\nQ\u2014Ils out dit qu'ils voulaient avoir leur passage pour aller et revenir\nR\u2014Oui, monsieur.\nQ\u2014Qu'est-ce que Lamarche a dit l\u00e0?\nR\u2014Il a dit: \" J'ai af\u00efaire \u00e0 aller \u00e0 bord d'un autre steamboat, je viendrai tous vous les apporter.\" Je n'ai pas connaissance quand ii est revenu.\nQ\u2014Savez-vous si ces gens-l\u00e0 sont partis, toujours, pour aller voter. r\u2014Oui monsieur.\nQ\u2014Vous dites que vous n'avez pas connaissance quand ii est revenu?\nR\u2014Non, monsieur.\nQ__Quelle heure pouvait-il \u00eatre quand il est venu dans ce temps-l\u00e0?\nR\u2014Ertre huit heures et demie et neuf heures.\nQ\u2014Du matin?\nR\u2014 Oui, monsieur.\nQ\u2014Pour qui Lamarche cabalaitil?\nR\u2014Il cabalait pour M. Cuthbert.\nQ\u2014Etaitil bien connu comme un partisan du D\u00e9fendeur?\nR\u2014Je pense que oui.\nQ\u2014Le saviez voss vous-m\u00eame quo c'\u00e9tait un partisan de M.Cuthbert?\nR\u2014 Il avait l'air joliment chaud\nQ\u2014Dans toutes les elections pr\u00e9c\u00e9dentes o\u00f9 M. Cuthbert s'\u00e9tait pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 avait-il l'habitude de travailler?\nR\u2014Oui, monsieur.\nQ\u2014C'est un partisan z\u00e9l\u00e9, n'es-ce pas?\nR\u2014Oui, monsieur.\nDolphis Rocrais est un de ceux qui sont all\u00e9s voter avec un billet de passage fourni par Lamarche. L'extrait suivant de son t\u00e9moignge confirme le fait important rapport\u00e9 par Joly que ce sont les \u00e9lecteurs qui out demand\u00e9 des passes pour aller voter lorsque Lamarche s'est pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 \u00e0 bord des bateaux la premi\u00e8re fois le matin; qu'il est ensuite revenu pour leur apporter les passes.\nIi s'exprime comme suit \u00e0 ce sujet:\nQ\u2014Qui vous avait donn\u00e9 cette passe?\nR\u2014C'est M. Lamarche.\nQ\u2014M. Olivier Lamarche?\nR\u2014Oui.\nQ\u2014Quand a-t-il \u00e9t\u00e9 vous donner cette passe?\nR\u2014Je no puis dire le temps.\nQ\u2014Est-ce la veille ou l'avant-veille do la votation?\nR\u2014C'est la veille.\nQ\u2014Le matin?\nR Il est venu \u00e0 bord le matin.\nQ\u2014Qu'est-ce qu'il est venu faire le matin? r\u2014Il est venu voir comment il y avait de voteurs \u00e0 bord.\nq\u2014Lui avez-vous parl\u00e9?\nR\u2014J\u00e9tais aupr\u0141s.\nQ\u2014Qu'est-ce qu'il a dit?\nR\u2014Il a dit qu'il avait affaire \u00e0 aller \u00e0 terre.\nQ\u2014Quand ii est venu pour demander les nms, comment a-t-il deman\u00e9\u00e9 cela et \u00e0 qui parlaitil?\nR\u2014 A. M. Pag\u00e9 et \u00e0 plusieurs autres.\nQ\u2014Qu'est-ce qu'il a dit?\nr\u2014 Il a demand\u00e9 le nom des voteurs.\nQ\u2014Avait-il une liste \u00e0 la main?\nR\u2014Je no peux pas dire.\nQ\u2014A-t-il demand\u00e9: un tel un tel est-il ici comment a-t-il demand\u00e9 \u00e7a?\nR\u2014Je sais qu'il a deman\u00e9\u00e9 les noms des voteurs.\nq\u2014Les voteurs d'o\u00f9? de Chicago, de Qu\u00e9bec, do Ia Chine?\nR\u2014De Berthier\nQ\u2014Qu'est-ce qu'ils cnt r\u00e9ponddu?\nR\u2014Ils ont dit qu'il y en avait et ils sont venus; pas tous.\nQ\u2014Plusieurs sont venus?\nR\u2014Oui d'autres \u00e9taient en avant.\nQ\u2014Qu'est-ce qui s'est dit, ont-ils parl\u00e9 de billets do passage?\nr\u2014Ils ont deman\u00e9\u00e9 des passes?\nQ\u2014Qui a deman\u00e9\u00e9 ces passes?\nR\u2014Quelqu'un de nous.\nQ\u2014Pour aller et revenir?\nR-\u2014On a deman\u00e9\u00e9 des passes pour descendre.\nq\u2014Qu'est-ce que M. Lamarche a dit?\nR\u2014Il a dit: jo vais aller \u00e0 terre, j'ai d'autres affaires, et il nous a laiss\u00e9s comme \u00e7a. Ensuite il est revenu, il s'en allait midi, je crois, il nous a apport\u00e9 des passes. Premi\u00e8rement, il a \u00e8t\u00e8 au salon et ensuite il nous a donn\u00e9 nog passes.\nDolphis Mass\u00e9 confirme les m\u00eames faits:\nQ\u2014Qu'est-ce quo vous a dit le capitaine Duval quand ii vous a donn\u00e9 cette passe-l\u00e0?\nR\u2014Premi\u00e8rement, M. Lamarche est venu \u00e0 bord demander quels \u00e9taient les voteurs qu'il y avait dans le Steamboat moi-m\u00eame, je lui ai nomm\u00e9 dos gens que je connaissais qui avaient droit do vote il a marqu\u00e9 les noms, et ii a monte en haut au salon; il a demand\u00e9 an capitaine Duval la permission d'avoir les voteurs: le capitaine a dit: avec plaisir, je no puis pas refuser cela; ils sont ma\u00eetres d'aller pour qui bon leur semblera; do sorte que M. Lamarche a parti i il est all\u00e9 \u00e0 terre, et je n'ai pas vu rien do plus. Q\u2014Il a vu les \u00e9lecteurs?\nR\u2014Pardon; il a eu la permission du capitaine, et ii est venu \u00e0 born dans l'apr\u00e8s-midi; il a monte au salon; il est venu trouver le capitaine; il a vu plusieurs des gens qui sont ici presents et qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 entendus comme t\u00e9moins. Je n'ai pas vu donner les passes moi-m\u00eame. mass au moins ii a monte en haut et ml a donn\u00e9 des passes au capitaine. J'en ai eu une qui venait du capitaine. Je no peux pas dire si elle venait de M Lamarche ou de d'autres mass je l'ai eue du capitaine.\nQ\u2014A-t-il \u00e9t\u00e9 question do passes devant vous quand Lamarche est venu?\nR\u2014La question des passes, je no puis pas dire rien \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard des passes des autres. J'entendais dire quo plusieurs d\u00e9siraient en avoir, mais je ne peux pas dire rien de plus.\nOctave Parent constate aussi le fait des deux visites de Lamarche de la mani\u00e8re suivante:\nQ\u2014Avez-vous vu M. Olivier Lamarche ce jour-l\u00e0?\nR\u2014Oui, monsieur.\nQ\u2014Eh bien, dans quelle occasion et \u00e0 quel propos, l'avez-vous vu?\nr\u2014je l'ai vu au gangway de l'arri\u00e8re qui s'informait des gens qui avaient droit do vote et ii appelait leurs noms.\nq\u2014Il avait une liste?\nR\u2014Celui qui \u00e9tait l\u00e0 il avait un petit morceau de papier et celui qui se trouvait present il disait: il est ici\nQ\u2014Ensuite?\nR\u2014Il m'a demand\u00e9: Vas-tu voter? J'ai dit oui. Il & dit: Si tuveux aller voter, je vais aller te chercher une passe. Jo lui ai dit: C'est bien correct. Dans l'apr\u00e8s-midi, il est venu avec une passe, ou un ticket; c'\u00e9tait pareil \u00e0 celui qui est exhib\u00e9; je puis vous la montrer.\nJoseph Page parle aussi de la visite du matin mais il commet une erreur \u00e9videnee en disant que c'est alors qu'il a eu sa passe:\nQ.\u2014Dites \u00e0 la Cour dans quelles circonstances et o\u00f9 il vous a donn\u00e9 cette passe.\nR.\u2014Il est venu le matin \u00e0 bord du steamboat le Trois Rivi\u00e8res, il m'a deman\u00e9\u00e9 si je descendais; j'ai dit: oui i il a dit: \" Voil\u00e0 une passe si tu veux descendre, descends.\" J'ai descendu.\nQ.\u2014Aviez-vous besoin de cette passe-l\u00e0 pour descendre?\nR.\u2014Eh bien ! je pense quo oui. Q. \u2014Vous connaissez bien M. Lamarche?\nR.\u2014Oui, on a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9lev\u00e9s ensemble ici.\nQ.\u2014Il avait une liste, je suppose, avec le nom des \u00e9lecteurs?\nR.\u2014Oui, je lui ai vu une liste.\nQ.\u2014A-t-il demand\u00e9 des informations pour savoir si un telet un tel \u00e9taient \u00e0 bord?\nR.\u2014Oui, je le lui ai dit.\nQ.\u2014Vous lui avez donn\u00e9 les noms des \u00e9lecteurs de Berthier qui \u00e9taient \u00e0 bord?\nR.\u2014Oui, de ceux que je pensais qui avaient droit de voter.\nQ.\u2014Il les a tous vus ces \u00e9lecteurs-l\u00e0?\nR.\u2014Oui.\nQ.\u2014Et il leur a donn\u00e9 une passe comme \u00e0 vous?\nR.\u2014Je pense bien que oui; ils ont tous descendu.\nDans son t\u00e9moignage, Lamarche dit qu'il est all\u00e9 deux fois \u00e0 bord des bateaux pour y voir les navigateurs qui \u00e9taient \u00e9lecteurs; ii y est d'abord all\u00e9 le matin et v est ensuite retourn\u00e9 dans l'apr\u00e8s-midi vers une heure ou deux. C'est apr\u00e8s sa premi\u00e8re visite aux bateaux qu'il a vu M. Labelle, l'agent des billets (ticket agent) du chemin de fer Q. M. O. & O., pour se procurer les billets qu'il a remis aux \u00e9lecteurs.\nTous ces t\u00e9moignages \u00e9tablissent d'une mani\u00e8re certaine que Lamarche est d'abord all\u00e9 aux steamers une premiere fois pour s'assurer du nombre de voteurs qu'il y avait et de leurs dispositions \u00e0 aller voter. Les connaissant tous d'avance et depuis longtemps des conservateurs comme lui-m\u00eame, il n'a pas eu, paraIt-ll, le trouble de les solliciter de voter pour son candidat, l'Intim\u00e9, car ils \u00e9taient eux-m\u00eames de ses partisans, bien dispos\u00e9s \u00e0 voter, mais \u00e0 une condition cependant, celle d'avoir leur passage pour aller et revenir. C'est la premi\u00e8re chose dont on l'informe, comme le rapporte le t\u00e9moun Joly: \" On aimerait \u00e0 partir aujourd'hui i \" si on ne part pas aujourd'hui on n'y va pas, et on aiimerait \u00e0 avoir notre passage pour aller et revenir, \" et on aimerait \u00e0 aller chacun chez nous avant d'aller v voter.\" Ils ont demand\u00e9 des passes, dit Rocrais J J'avais besoin de cette passe-l\u00e0 pour descendre,\" dit Page.\nAinsi renseign\u00e9 sur la disposition de ces \u00e9lecteurs de ne pas aller voter \u00e0 moins l'avoir leur passage gratuitement, Lamarche se rend aupr\u00e8s de M. Libelle, le prepose \u00e0 la vente des billets de passage ticket agent) sur le chemin de fer Q. M. 0. et 0., alors la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 du gouvernement de Qu\u00e9bec qui lexploitait pour son propre compte.\nLamarche rapporte comme suit son entrevue avec M. Labelle:\nQ -Vous n'avez pas eu besoin do demander d'autorisation, ii vous les a accord\u00e9s do suite?\nE\u2014Oui, quand je suis all\u00e9 au bureau de M. Labelle je lui ai dit que i avais vu M. La-m\u00e8re et que je lui avais deman\u00e9\u00e9 de laisser descendre les navigateurs. Je lui ai dit que M. La-m\u00e8re leur donnait la permission do venir voter. Quand je lui (M. Larn\u00e8r\u00e9) ai deman\u00e9\u00e9 cola ii ne m'a pas demand\u00e9 si c'\u00e9tait pour M. Cuthbert ou M. Sylvestre. Je lui ai dit: Jo voudrais les avoir pour venir voter. Il m'a dit: c'est malais\u00e9, il faudra quo vous vous arrangiez avec le capitaine. il faudra qu'il les remplace par les matelots du Chambly. T\u00aacho de voir 10 capitaine Lamoureux et le capitaine Duval pour qu'ils arrangent. Jo les ai vus et le capitaine Lamoureux du Chambly a promis des hommes au capitaine Duval du Trois Rivi\u00e8res Si ce dernier allait faire son voyage do plaisir le lundi soir.\nEnsuite, c'est alors que je suis all\u00e9 au bureau do M. Labelle. Jo lui ai dit qu'il me fallait des passes et ii m'a dit: \" combien t'en faut-il? Jo lui ai dit: dix-sept \u00e0 vingt. Il m'a dit: \" tu reviendras tant\u00f4t.\" Jo suis repass\u00e9, j'allais voir M. Wurtele pour avoir doux hommes qui devaient venir voter; il y en avait un qui \u00e9tait employ\u00e9 sur le chemin \u00e0 lEpiphanie. Il m'a dit: tout \u00e7a sera arrang\u00e9. M Grondines m'a dit: vous avez une lettre ici pour vous.\nCettre lettre contenait les passes ou billets demandes. A l'argument l'Intim\u00e9 a pr\u00e9tendu que ces passes avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9es gratuitement. Il est vrai que Lamarche n'a rien pay\u00e9 pour les obtenir; mais en examinant les passes on voit de suite que ce sont des billets de passages ordinaires faits dans la forme suivante: QUEBEC, MONTREAL AND OCCIDENTAL RAILWAY.\nONE FIRST CLASS PASSAGE.\nFrom Hochelaga to Berthierville and Return.\nIn consideration of the reduced rate at which this ticket is sold it- will only be valid until 22nd June 1882.\nL. A. SENECAL,\nGeneral Superintendent.\nForm E.R. 5708.\nA leur face ii appert que les billets out \u00e9t\u00e9 vendus quoique \u00e0 un taux r\u00e9duit, et la preuve \u00e9tablit que la valeur de ces billets \u00e9tait de $1.50 chaque.\nCe fait constitue-til une violation de la section 96 de l'acte des elections de 1874? Cette section defend le louage de voitures pour le transport des \u00e9lecteurs aux polls, le paiement des passages de chemin de fer ou autres d\u00e9penses des voteurs, par un candidat on ses agents et declare tels actes ill\u00e9gaux et punissables d'une amende de $100. La section 98 met en outre ces actes au rang des men\u00e9es corruptrices.\nDans le cas actuel il y a une preuve prim\u00fb facie du paiement des billets de passage en question. C'est celle qui r\u00e9sulte des billets eux-m\u00eames comportant la d\u00e9claration qu'ils ont \u00e9t\u00e9 vendus \u00e0 prix r\u00e9duits. Lamarche dit bien qu'il n'a rien pay\u00e9 lui-m\u00eame, mais comme ils ne lui sont parvenus qu'apr\u00e8s avoir pass\u00e9 en d\u00e9verses mains il n'est pas en \u00e9tat de dire s'ils out \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9s on remis en \u00e9change du prix ordinaire. L'agent des billets, Labelle, n'ayant pas \u00e9t\u00e9 appel\u00e9 comme t\u00e9moin, on ne doit point pr\u00e9sumer contre la preuve faite par les billets, qu'il les a donn\u00e9s sans en recevoir le prix. D'autres partisans que Lamarche out pu en payer le prix. Labelle lui-m\u00eame, s'il ne l'a pas re\u00e7u de quelqu'un a du sans doute s'en charger puisqu'il les a vendus, ainsi que les billets le comportent. Il est done certain que ces billets ont \u00e9t\u00e9 vendus, bien qu'on ne sache pas par qui ils ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pay\u00e9s. Toutefois, d'apr\u00e8s la preuve ii n'est pas possible de dire quills ont \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9s. Pour en arriver \u00e0 cette conclusion, il aurait au moins fallu faire entendre Labelle pour constater qu'il n'a re\u00e7u de personne le prix des passages en question, et qu'il \u00e9tait autoris\u00e9 \u00e0 faire de pareilles lib\u00e9ralit\u00e9s. En l'absence d'une telle preuve on doit pr\u00e9sumer que Labelle n'a livr\u00e9 les billets qu'apr\u00e8s en avoir re\u00e7u le prix, ainsi que les billets en font foi\nEn cons\u00e9quence je consid\u00e8re la preuve faite comme \u00e9tant suffisante pour constater que le paiement des passages de chemins de fer de ces 17 ou 20 voteuss a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait en contravention \u00e0 l'acte des elections de 1874 Ce paiement \u00e9tant, par la section 98, mis au rang des men\u00e9es corruptrices, dolt entra\u00eener la nullit\u00e9 de l'\u00e9lection\nSi Labelle a donn\u00e9 les billets et s'il avait le pouvoir de le faire, on n'aurait sans doute pas manqu\u00e9 d'en faire la preuve Aucune tentative \u00e0 cet effet n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite. Si les billets ont \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9s sans autorisation ce serait un d\u00e9tournement frauduleux commis au d\u00e9triment du gouvernement, propri\u00e9taire du chemin de fer et le prix lui en serait d\u00fb par Labelle aussi bien que par ceux qui en out profit\u00e9. En admettant m\u00eame qu'il n'ait rien \u00e9t\u00e9 pay\u00e9 et qu'il ne soit rien d\u00fb pour ces billets, leur remise aux \u00e9lecteurs en question et dans les circonstances particuli\u00e8res ci-dessus rapport\u00e9es ne constitue-t-elle pas une violation de la section 92 de l'Acte des Elections de 1874?\nLe premier paragraphe de cette section est ainsi con\u00e7u:\nEvery person who directly or indirectly, by himself, or by any other person on his behalf, gives, lends, or agrees to give or lend or offers or promises any money or valuable consideration, or promises to procure, or endeavour to procure, any money or valuable consideration, to or for any voters, or to or for any person on behalf of any voter, or to or for any person, in order to induce any voter to vote or refrain from voting, or corruptly does any such act as aforesaid on account of such voter having voted or refrained from voting at any election. Sur ce point de la cause, en prenant pour vrai que les billets en question out \u00e9t\u00e9 remis gratuitement, l'honorable juge Doherty s'exprime ainsi:\nThis proposition raised the question which has not, so far as I know, been as yet extensively discussed in the trials of election cases: as to whether a railroad pass given gratis and unconditionally to a voter to go to vote, is, within the meaning of the sec. 92 sub. section 1 \" a valuable consideration '' or of any such value as would support a promise.\nSe fondant sur l'autorit\u00e9 du juge Mellor dans la cause de Bolton ([25])l'honorable juge Doherty en vient \u00e0 la conclusion que des billets donn\u00e9s comme l'ont \u00e9t\u00e9 ceux dont ii s'agit ne constitue pas une valable consideration (valuable consideration) suivant l'intention de l'acte des elections.\nDans cette cause, ii s'agissait de savoir si le paiement des d\u00e9penses de voyage des voteuss constituait un acte de corruption.\nUne circulaire con\u00e7ue dans les termes suivants avait \u00e9t\u00e9 adress\u00e9e \u00e0 des \u00e9lecteurs\nCROSS AND KNOWLES', COMMITTEE ROOMS,\n2nd February, 1884.\nDEAR SIR,\u2014Your name being on the list of Parliamentary voters for this borough, you are entitled to vote at the forthcoming election We inclose you a railway pass, on presenting which at the railway station named you will be furnished with a railway ticket to convey you to Bolton and back airain. I trust you will be able to make it convenient to come over and record your vote in favor of Messrs. Cross and Knowles\nLes' p\u00e9titionnarres pr\u00e9tendaeent que l'envoi de cette lettre et des passes de chemin de fer constituait soit un acte de corruption conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la doctrine consacr\u00e9e par la Chambre des Lords dans la cause de Cooper vs Slade, soit encore un acte de corruption en contravention \u00e0 Ia sec. 2 de l'acte des men\u00e9es corruptrices de 1854; et 2\u00b0 que si ce n'\u00e9tait pas un acte de corruption que c'\u00e9tait dans tous les cas un acte ill\u00e9gal qui, ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 volontairement et syst\u00e9matiquement fait dans le but d'influencer l'\u00e9lection devait avoir l'effet de la faire declarer nulle.\nIl serait inutile de rapporter les arguments faits par l'honorable juge pour \u00e9tablir une distinction entre cette cause et celle de Cooper et Slade dont ii admet la doctrine. Il suffit de dire que suivant son interpretation la circulaire dans cette cause ne faisait pas comme dans celle de Cooper et Slade, de la remise des passes une condition du vote, et que dans son opinion les passes ne pouvaient pas \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9e$ comme une consid\u00e9ration valable (valuable consideration) suivant l\u2019intention de la section 2 de l'acte des men\u00e9es corruptrices. Ayant \u00e9cart\u00e9 ces deux objections, ii lui restait \u00e0 decider si le paiement des d\u00e9peness de voyage des \u00e9lecteurs qui n'\u00e9tait alors, d'aprss la loi imp\u00e9riale, que simplement trait\u00e9 comme un acte illegal, punissable par amende, pouvait avoir de plus l'effet d'entra\u00eener la nullit\u00e9 de l'\u00e9lection\nL'honorable juge, apr\u00e8s avoir fait l'historique de Ia l\u00e9gislation imp\u00e9riale an sujet du paiement des d\u00e9penses de transport des voteurs, et bien clairement constat\u00e9 que la loi anglaise en d\u00e9clarant ce paiement ill\u00e9gal n'en avait pas fait une men\u00e9e corruptrice, qu'elle avait soigneusement \u00e9vit\u00e9 d'en faire la declaration ([26]) conclut en ces termes:\nI agree with the opinion of the late Mr Justice Willes; he was decidedly of opinion that a violation of an Act of Parliament which itself created the offense and provided the penalty could not avoid the election ' all it did was to inflict penal consequences upon the persons who did the act.\nCette derni\u00e8re proposition est certainement correcte et la conclusion \u00e0 laquelle en vient l'honorable juge que le paiement des frais de transport des voteurs tout en \u00e9tant ill\u00e9gal ne pouvait avoir l'effet d'entra\u00eener Ia nullit\u00e9 de l'\u00e9lection et qu'il ne constituait pas une men\u00e9e corruptrice ayant cet effet, est en stricte conformite \u00e0 la loi anglaise. Mais c'est faire une \u00e9trange confusion et m\u00e9connaitre compl\u00e8tement l'\u00e9tat de notre propre legislation sur le m\u00eame sujet que de vouloir faire application \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente cause des principes de la decision rendue par l'honorable juge Mellor en conformit\u00e9 de lois diff\u00e9rentes.\nAu contraire de la loi imp\u00e9riale notre acte d'\u00e9lection de 1874, declare positivement que le paiement du transport des voteurs, est une men\u00e9e corruptrice. La section 96 declare comme suit\nAnd whereas doubts may arise as to whether the hiring of teams and vehicles to convey voters to and from the polls and the paying of railway fares and other expenses of voters, be or be not according to law, it is declared and enacted, that the hiring or promising to pay or paying for any horse, team, carriage, cab, or other vehicle by any candidate or by any person on his behalf to convey any voter or voters to or from the poll, or to or from the neighbourhood thereof, at any election, or the payment by any candidate, or by any person on his behalf of the travelling and other expenses of any voter, in going to or returning from any election, are and shall be unlawful acts.\nLe reste de Ia section prononce une p\u00e9nalit\u00e9 de $100 pour chacune de ces offenses, et la peine de d\u00e9qualification contre tout voteur pour louage de voitures en contravention \u00e0 cette section. La loi anglaise comme notre section 96, a prononc\u00e9 la peine d'amende contre ces offenses \u2014mais Ia n\u00f4tre est all\u00e9e beaucoup plus loin;\u2014par la section 98, elle a declare que les offenses enum\u00e9r\u00e9ss dans Ia sec. 96 constitueraient des men\u00e9es corruptrices suivant l'intention de l'acte des\u00e9lections La sec. 98 declare que :\nThe offence of bribery, treating, or undue influence, or any of such offences as defined by this or any other Act of the Parliament of Canada, personation, or the inducing of any person to commit personation, or any wilful offence against any one of the six next preceding sections of this, Act shall be corrupt practices within the meaning of the provisions of this Act.\nIl est evident, d'aprss la derni\u00e8re partie de cette section que la section 96 se trouve sujette \u00e0 l'effet de la sec 98\u2014et que partant tous les actes mentionn\u00e9s dans cette derni\u00e8re section, sont d\u00e9clar\u00e9s \u00eatre des men\u00e9es corruptrices C'est ce qu'a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 cette Cour dans la cause de l'\u00e9lection de Selkirk, ([27])\nComme on le voit notre legislation ne laisse aucun doute sur la question de savoir si le paiement du transport des voteuss constitue une men\u00e9e corruptrice L'honorable juge s\u00efellor, s'il avait eu \u00e0 decider cette question d'aprss nos lois, n'aurait sans doute pas en un seul moment d'h\u00e9sitation \u00e0 declarer le contraire de ce qu'il a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 correctement d'aprss la loi anglaise.\nL'appelant essaie encore de tirer avantage de l'argument fait par l'honorable juge Mellor pour \u00e9tablir que la remise des passes ne pouvait pas \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme une valable consid\u00e9ration suivant l'inteniion de la sec. 2, acte de 1854\u2014men\u00e9es corruptrices, acte imp. Essayant de d\u00e9montrer qu'il n'y avait pas en cela un acte de corruption, l'honorable juge dit \u00e0 ce sujet :\nIt is difficult to see in what it can be a valuable consideration to a voter. The coming to vote and voting may be so deemed by the sender; he may think he may get value, but it is difficult to see what value the voter gets by a free pass to the poll.\nL'honorable juge ne fait aucun raisonnement pour d\u00e9montrer que la remise d'une passe n'est pas en r\u00e9alit\u00e9 une valable consideration; et ii faut avouer qu'il est difficile, pour ne pas dire impossible, d'en faire pour d\u00e9montrer une pareille proposition. Il se borne \u00e0 dire qu'il est difficile de voir quelle valeur re\u00e7oit le voteur par la remise d'une passe pour aller au poll. Ceci serait assez vrai si l'on fait abstraction des devoirs du voteur. Si l'on consid\u00e9re que son int\u00e9r\u00eat materiel du moment et que pour lui c'est un derangement de ses affaires ordinaires, que c'est une perte de temps d'aller au poll pour laquelle la promenade qu'on lui fait faire gratuitement n'est pas une compensation, on peut alors dire comme l'honorable juge qu'on ne serait pas est 1 avantage du voteur. Mais Si on se place a Un point de vue plus \u00e9lev\u00e9 si on consid\u00e8re que le droit de franchise accord\u00e9 au voteur est un devoir de la plus haute importance qu'il doit exercer librement et sans aucune consid\u00e9ration dans l'int\u00e9r\u00eat public; si on l'envisage au point de vue du principe \u00e9nonc\u00e9 par Lord Mansfield:\nThat one of the principal foundations of the constitution depends on the exercise of the franchise that the elections of members of Parliament should be free, and particularly that every voter should be free from pecuniary influence;\non comprendra alors bien facilement quel avantage valeur ou consid\u00e9ration re\u00e7oit le voteur qui au lieu d'aller de lui-m\u00eame, \u00e0 ses d\u00e9pens, enregistrer son vote, re\u00e7oit ses frais de transport sous la forme d'une passe. Deux voteurs voisins partent ensemble pour aller voter disons, comme dans le cas actuel, de Montr\u00e9al \u00e0 Berthier l'un paie son billet dont le prig est de $1.50, l'autre a re\u00e7u d'un Lamarche quelconque une passe avec laquelle ii fait le m\u00eame voyage sans rien d\u00e9bourser. Par quel \u00e9trange abus du raisonnement peut-on dire que le dernier n'a pas effectivement re\u00e7u sous la forme de cette passe une valable consid\u00e9ration au montant de $1.50. Cette passe pour lui avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9e n'a-t-elle pas autant de valeur que le billet, n'en co\u00fbte-t-il pas autant \u00e0 la compagnee du ehemin de fer pour les frais du transport de celui qui a une passe gratutte que pour celui qui a un billet dont il a pav\u00e9 le prix. Tous deux re\u00e7oivent par leur transport un service de m\u00eame valeur avec la diff\u00e9rence que l'un le re\u00e7oit gratuitement et que l'autre en paie le prix. Pour appuyer cette pr\u00e9tention Si contraire au plus simple bon sens, on fait encore une comparaison qui n'a de valeur que par son manque absolu de justesse. C'est celle de comparer une passe de chemin de fer au service que rendrait un particulier se rendant au poll qui d\u00e9passant en route un \u00e9lecteur qui s'y rend \u00e0 pied lui offre de monter dans sa voiture pour faire ce trajet, Mais on oublie qu'il y a plus de points de dissimilitude que de ressemblance entre les deux choses compar\u00e9es Le particulier est absolument libre dans l'emploi de sa voiture; il n'est sujet au contr\u00f4le de personne; il peut la louer s'il le veut, en donner l'usage gratuitement il n'a de compte \u00e0 rendre \u00e0 personne. Il n'en est pas de m\u00eame des administrations de chemins de fer elles ne sont que des fid\u00e9icommissaires administrant la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 des action narres, sp\u00e9cialement dans le but d'en tirer du profit; leur administration est r\u00e9glement\u00e9e dans ses plus petits details. Elles ne pourraient pas comme un particulier user g\u00e9n\u00e9reusement de leurs moyens de transport, les mettre gratuitement \u00e0 la disposition des \u00e9lecteurs sans une autorisation sp\u00e9ciale \u00e0 cet effet \u00e0 moins de for faire \u00e0 leur mandat. On ne peut donc pas comparer le fait du particulier qui prend en route un voteur dans sa voiture, avec le fait d'\u00e9mission gratuite de passes par les compagnies de chemins de fer.\nIl est inutile de faire remarquer \u00e0 quels abus extraordinaires donnerait lieu l'admission de la doctrine que la remise de passes aux \u00e9lecteurs pour les faire transporter au poll n'est pas une valable consid\u00e9ration constituant un acte de corruption, suivant le parag. 1er de la sec. 92, en m\u00e9me temps qu'une violation de la sec. 96, d\u00e9clar\u00e9e une men\u00e9e corruptrice par la sec. 98. La decision de la Chambre des Lords dans la cause de Cooperet Slade est tout \u00e0 fait applicable \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente cause La condition d'avoir des passes pour aller voter quoique impos\u00e9e \u00e0 Lamarche par les \u00e9lecteurs eux-m\u00eames et accept\u00e9e par lui, n'en constitue pas moins une consid\u00e9ration sans laquelle il est clair comme le disent ces \u00e9lecteurs, ils ne seraient pas all\u00e9s voter. Cette condition fait rentrer exactement le cas actuel sous l'effet de la decision de Cooper et Slade.\nLa question du paiement des frais du transport des voteurs au poll est d\u00e9j\u00e0 venu devant nos cours et a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9clar\u00e9 dans la cause de Hickson vs Abbott ([28]) constituer un acte de corruption. La question a \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9e dans les circonstances suivantes:\nA person had been furnished with a list of voters in Montreal, which he had given to one Boswell with instructions to see them. The respondent telegraphed him two names to be added to the list, and asked him to procure certain canvassers at Montreal and to send them to the county This person sent to Boswell to obtain the canvassers, and gave him nine railway tickets to be furnished to them. Boswell seeing two persons on the platform whom he knew to be voters, going up to vote, gave to each of them one of the tickets. He returned two but it was not proved what he did with the remainder.\nHeld: That under the circumstances Boswell was an agent of the respondent and that the delivery of the tickets to the voters were corrupt aid sufficient to avoid the election\nDans cette cause de Hickson vs Abbott on voit que non-seulement les voteurs comme dans le cas de Berthier \u00e9taient dispos\u00e9s \u00e0 voter, mais qu'ils s'y en allaient de fait, he knew the voters were going' up to vote. Malgr\u00e9 cela la remise des billets de passage dont les \u00e9lecteurs n'avaient pas fait une condition, comme l'avaient fait ceux dont ii s'agit en cette cause, fut consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme un acte suffisant de corruption. A plus forte raison doit-on conclure de la m\u00eame mani\u00e8re lorsque la remise du billet a \u00e9t\u00e9 exig\u00e9e par le voteur comme condition pour aller voter. Dans la cause de North Simcoe ii a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cid\u00e9 par l'honorable vice-chancellier Strong maintenant membre de cette cour, que le paiement des d\u00e9penses de voyage des \u00e9lecteurs pour aller au poll et en revenir, \u00e9tait une men\u00e9e corruptrcce entra\u00eenait la nullit\u00e9 de l'\u00e9lection. La loi d'Ontario sur laquelle cette decision a \u00e9t\u00e9 rendue contenait Ia m\u00eame disposition \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard que la loi f\u00e9d\u00e9rale.\nDans les deux derniers cas cites, ii est vrai que la preuve du paiement des billets dans un cas et celle du paiement du prix d'un train de chemin de fer dans l'autre a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite, mais la position du voteur n'\u00e9tait pas diff\u00e9rente de celle de celui qui re\u00e7oit une passe gratuite. L'avantage dans les deux cas est le m\u00eame, et en r\u00e9alit\u00e9 il y a toujours paiement des frais de transport C'est aux d\u00e9pens du candidat ou de ses agents lorsque le prix des billets est acquitt\u00e9 par ceux-ci, et aux d\u00e9pens de Ia compagnie de chemin de fer lorsque le voteur est transporte au moyen d'une passe donn\u00e9e par celle-ci, et dans tous les cas ii y a un acte de corruption suffisant pour faire declarer l'\u00e9lection nulle\nIl y a in autre cas bien flagrant de corruption, c'est celui de Maxwell, Ce voteur ordinairement partisan z\u00e9l\u00e9 et actif, avait manifest\u00e9 de la mauvaise humeur et de l'indiff\u00e9rence dans l'\u00e9lection dont ii s'agit \u00e0 propos d'une pr\u00e9tendue dette qu'il r\u00e9clamait pour une election ant\u00e9rieure. Deux jours seulement avant la votation ii re\u00e7ut une lettre sans signature, contenant $25.00, et les seuls mots \" envoyez fort vous et vos gar\u00e7ons.\" La lettre ne contenait aucune autre explication La lettre et l'argent furent remis \u00e0 Maxwell par le t\u00e9moin H\u00e9naull, envoy\u00e9 par le comit\u00e9 central conservateur de Montr\u00e9al pour prendre part \u00e0 l'\u00e9lection, etc.\nSur invitation, ii changea sa premiere destination et s'arr\u00eata \u00e0 Berthier. Comme le comit\u00e9 local du d\u00e9fendeur avait besoin de quelqu'un pour aller porter la parole aux \u00e9lecteurs de St-Damien, le lendemain, dimanche, on demanda H\u00e9rault pour remplir cette fonction. Ce dolt \u00eatre le pr\u00e9sident du comit\u00e9, dit-il, qui lui fit cette demande. Jo me rappelle qu'on m'a dit quand je suis arriv\u00e9 ici le soir. le samedi soir, la veille de ce dimanche, je ne connaissais personne dans le comit\u00e9. Mais on m'a dit je sais quo les autorit\u00e9s du comit\u00e9 le pr\u00e9sident ou un autre m'a dit: vous allez \u00e0 St Gabriel et ensuite on m'a dit: vous irez \u00e0 St Damien.\nIl ajoute quo ce sont les gens du comit\u00e9 qui lui ont dit cela et qu'on l'y a fait conduire en voiture.\nPans cette entrevue au comit\u00e9 il se rappelle avoir vu M. Tellier, M. Chalut, des membres importants do ce comit\u00e9 et le d\u00e9fendeur lui-m\u00eame qui savait que H\u00e9nault allait \u00e0 St-Damien. C'est au comit\u00e9 qu'il dit avoir re\u00e7u ses instructions et qu'on lui a dit Qu'il devait aller \u00e0 St-Damienrep\u00e9senter le d\u00e9fondeur et rencontrer suivant toute prohabilit\u00e9 le s\u00e9natour Gu\u00e9vremont. H\u00e9nault avait en outre, le m\u00eame soir, re\u00e7u de St. Cyr, un autre membre du comit\u00e9, Ia commission do remettre personnellement, au nomm\u00e9 Maxwell de St-Damien une lettre en lui disant: \" fais-y attention, ii y a de l'argent dedans.\" La lettre avant d'avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 remise s'\u00e9tant trouv\u00e9e d\u00e9cacbet\u00e9e dans ses poches ii a vu qu'elle contenait la somme do $25 et les mots rapport\u00e9s plus haut: \" Envoyez fort vous et vos gar\u00e7ons.\"\nApr\u00e8s s'\u00eatre acquitt\u00e9 do la premi\u00e8re partie do ses fonctions en adressant la parole aux \u00e9lecteurs de St-Damien, apr\u00e8s la messe, il so rendit chez Maxwell et lui remit la lettre et les $25.00. Ce dernier joua la surprise, et dit en recevant cot argent qu'il devait y avoir erreur.\u2014\" C\u00e0 doit \u00eatre une trompe,\" dit-il. Il a ajout\u00e9 qu'il n'attendait d'argent de personne dans le moment. Sur les instances do H\u00e9nault il prit l'argent en disant: \" C'est bon Si c'est pour moi je le garderai, et si ce n'est pas pour moi, je le renverrai, et ii l'a gard\u00e9.\"\nDans son t\u00e9moignage il donne plusieurs versions contradictoires pour expliquer l'origine do cot argent. Pans ses r\u00e9ponses comme t\u00e9moin il dit quo c'est do l'argent quo Daveluy lui devait et qu'il lui a envoy\u00e9 pour les d\u00e9penses de l'\u00e9lection de M. Robillard; aussi pour une promesse de donner la majorit\u00e9 dans la paroisse et pour des d\u00e9penses faites chez lui Ce n'est pas vingtune piastres qu'il lui avait promis c'\u00e9tait \"une recompense. H\u00e9raut lui a dit que c'\u00e9tait l'argent pour l'\u00e9lection; mais ii ne savait pas si c'\u00e9tait pour celle-l\u00e0 ou bien pour l'autre. Questionne de nouveau sur ce que H\u00e9nault lui a dit en remettant l'argent, il fait le r\u00e9cit incoh\u00e9rent qui suit :\nR.\u2014Il ne m'a dit rien que cola: \" Voil\u00e0 do l'argent quo j'apporte pour les \u00e9lections \" J'ai dit: \" de l'argent pour les elections, j'en porte pas pour personne M. Cuthbert ne m'a jamais mis ou donn\u00e9 d'argent on mains \", J'ai dit: \" l'argent laissez-le en d\u00e9p\u00f4t \" Il a dit: \" Ils m'ont dit do le laisser ici, je le laisse.\" Il a mis l'argent dans les mains do ma femme et ii y est encore. Jo n'ai pas promis une cent dans l'\u00e9lection do M. Cuthbert. ni je n'ai donn\u00e9 une cent \u00e0 personne.\nQ.\u2014Dans ce temps-l\u00e0, vous pr\u00e9tendez qu'il vous \u00e9tait d\u00fb vingtcinq piastres pour l'\u00e9lection do M. Robillard?\nR\u2014Je ne vous dis pas qu'il m'\u00e9tait promis vingt-cinq piastres; je vous ai dit qu'il m'\u00e9tatt promis une recompense.\nPar la suite de son t\u00e9moignage on voit qu'il pretend qu'une promesse de r\u00e9compense lui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 faite par Daveluy dans une election pr\u00e9c\u00e9dente e\u00e6tre Robillard et Sylvestre, et que c'est en execution de cette promesse que les $25 en question lui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 envoy\u00e9es. Il confirme cette assertion dans plusieurs autres parties de son t\u00e9moignage.\nComprenant le danger d'une telle preuve, le savant conseil du d\u00e9fendeur fait de grands efforts pour faire admettre \u00e0 Maxwell que ce devait \u00eatre en paiement d'un compte que Daveluy lui avait fait remettre la somme en question. Malgr\u00e9 cela, Maxwell persiste toujours \u00e0 dire que c'est pour une r\u00e9compense promise. Il dit positivement qu'il n'avait rien vendu \u00e0 Daveluy; que Daveluy ne lui devait rien en dehors de cette promesse, ni pour provisions ni autre chose qu'il aurait eu de lui. Il r\u00e9p\u00e8te encore une troisi\u00e8me fois, positivement, que Daveluy ne lui devait rien. Mais chose extraordinaire, la cour s'ajourne pendant quelques instants, et de suite, Maxwell est approch\u00e9 par Lamarche, l'homme aux billets de chemin de fer, et apr\u00e8s quelques instants d'entretien avec lui, ii revient reprendre la suite de son t\u00e9moignage dans lequel ii contredit, avec une audacieuse impudence, tout ce qu'il vient de dire an sujet des $25. Apr\u00e8s son entretien avec Lamarche, ii demande \u00e0 ajouter ce qui suit \u00e0 son t\u00e9moignage:\nQuand, j'ai dit dans mon examen que M. Daveluy no me devait rien en dehors de cette promesse, je me suis tromp\u00e9. Depuis que j'ai rendu mon t\u00e9moignage je me rappelle, en effet, quo M. Daveluy me devait une tinette do beurre do trente-sept livres et cinq ou six caisses do bardeau. Le tout \u00e9valu\u00e9 \u00e0 vingt deux piastres. Quand j'ai rencontr\u00e9 M. Daveluy ii m'a deman\u00e9\u00e9 si j'\u00e9tais content ; mais no m'a pas dit que l'argent qu'il m'avait envoy\u00e9 \u00e9tait \u00e0 cause do la recompense: c'est moi qui l'ai compris comme cola.\nLes transquestions qui Iui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 soumises font voir que ce r\u00e9cit n'est qu'un tissu de fausset\u00e9s qui m\u00e9riterait plus d'\u00eatre discut\u00e9 dans une poursuite pour parjure que dans une contestation comme celle-ci. Quoi qu'il en soit dans tout cet amas de fausset\u00e9s de contradictions et de mensonges qui forment son t\u00e9moignage, Maxwell en a dit beaucoup plus qu'il ne faut pour prouver l'acte de corruption dont il s'est rendu coupable. Sur ce point je ne crois pas que les opinions de la cour soient partag\u00e9es.\nIl ne reste donc qu'\u00e0 savoir si l'on peut en faire remonter la cons\u00e9quence jusqu'au membre si\u00e9geant et si la preuve de l'agence est suffisante pour produire cet effet.\nLes faits rapport\u00e9s plus haut au sujet d' H\u00eanautt constatent amplement son agence. C'est de St-Cyr, un des membres du comit\u00e9 et partisan actif du d\u00e9fendeur, qu'il re\u00e7oit Ia lettr\u00e9 qu'il doit remettre \u00e0 Maxwell, et du comit\u00e9 qu'il prend ses instructions pour aller soutenir les int\u00e9r\u00eats de la candidature du d\u00e9fendeur, \u00e0 St-Damien, et \u00e0 la connaissance de ce dernier. C'est encore dans le comit\u00e9 que le lendemain ii re\u00e7oit ses instructions et ses documents pour aller repr\u00e9senter le d\u00e9fendeur \u00e0 un poll dans l'Isle Dupas.\nIl n'est pas possible de ne pas consid\u00e9rer H\u00e9nault comme agent du d\u00e9tendeur en appliquant aux faits de cette cause la doctrine \u00e9nonc\u00e9e au sujet de l'agence par le juge Blackburn dans la cause de Taunton. Apres avoir fait observer que les r\u00e8gles concernant l'agence en mati\u00e8res parlementaires sont bien diff\u00e9rentes de celles de. l'agence d'apr\u00e8s Ia loi commune. Il ajoute:\nBut in parliamentary election law. it has long been established that where a person is employed for the purpose of procuring his election, he, the candidate is responsible for the act of that agent in committing corruption, though he himself did not intend it. but even bor\u00e2 fide did his best to prevent it.\nQuoique les faits \u00e9tablissent suffisamment que H\u00e9nault \u00e9tait un agent, si cependant on le consid\u00e9rait que comme Un sous-agent, ses actes auraient encore les m\u00eames cons\u00e9quences sur la validit\u00e9 de l'\u00e9lection. Sir William Ritchie, le pr\u00e9sident de cette cour, a \u00e9nonc\u00e9 ce principe de la mani\u00e8re suivante dans Ia cause de Cimon et Perrault ([29]).\nThe law would indeed be childishly weak were it not able to reach the corrupt acts of a sub-agent. The law as to the employment of sub-agents seems to me very clear. A candidate cannot take the benefit of the services of the individual and repudiate them at the same time ([30]).\nMellor, J., dans la cause de Barnstable.\nLes principes en mati\u00e8re d'agence \u00e9lectorale sont trop bien connus pour qu'il soit n\u00e9cessaire de citer beaucoup d'autorit\u00e9s sur ce point. Il suffit de r\u00e9f\u00e9rer \u00e0 celles contenues dans le factum des Appelants et \u00e0 celles mentionn\u00e9es dans les causes cit\u00e9es.\nComme il est impossible d'ajouter foi \u00e0 l'explication donn\u00e9e en dernier lieu par Maxwell que les $25 \u00e9taient en paiement d'un compte, et que l'on ne peut faire; autrement que d'adopter sa premi\u00e8re version tant de fois \" r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9e que c'\u00e9tait en paiement d'une dette d'une \u00e9lec-tion pr\u00e9cedente, ii n'est pas douteux qu'un semblable paiement est un acte de corruption. Cette question a d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cid\u00e9e bien des fois et entre autres dans Ia cause de North Ontario ([31]) dans celle de coventry ([32]) et aussi dans la cause d' Argenleuil ([33].)\nSil e\u00fbt et\u00e9 possible de donner une explication de ce paiement qui n'e\u00fbt pas \u00e9t\u00e9 aussi compromettante que celle de Maxwell, le D\u00e9fendeur e\u00fbt sans doute fait entendre Daveluy. L'omission de faire entendre ce t\u00e9moin forme une forte pr\u00e9somption que le fait en question ne pouvait pas \u00eatre contredit. Cette doctrine est adopt\u00e9e dans la cause de Bewdley ([34]) et dans celle de Tewkesbury ([35]). Il dolt donc rester \u00e9tabli d'apr\u00e8s les autorit\u00e9s que les $25 \u00e9taient pour payer une ancienne dette d'\u00e9lection. Ce paiement n'e\u00fbt sans doute pas \u00e9t\u00e9 fait pendant l'\u00e9lection qui \u00e9tait \u00e0 la veille de se terminer si l'on n'e\u00fbt pas senti la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 de r\u00e9veiller le z\u00e8le de Maxwell Aussi c'est avec une esp\u00e8ce de cri de guerre qu'on lui remet cet argent: \" Envoyez fort, vous et vos gar\u00e7ons.\"\nJe n'ai aucun doute sur les deux points soulev\u00e9s par ce cas; je suis d'opinion que le paiement des $25, constitue un acte de corruption et que l'agence de H\u00e9nault est amplement prouv\u00e9e.\nIl reste encore deux autres cas ceux de Rithier et de Chalut.\nDans le premier il s'agit des frais de transport d'un \u00e9lecteur au poll, je suis d'opinion que l'agence de Cot\u00e9 qui a fait l'engagement n'est pas suffisamment prouv\u00e9e. Quant an notaire Chalut, il s'agit d'une somme qui lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 payee pour l'envoyer dans la paroisse de Saint-Gabriel pour organiser les partisans du d\u00e9fendeur. C'est comme cabaleur pay\u00e9 (paid canvasser) qu'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 envoy\u00e9 l\u00e0. Ai n'est pas prouv\u00e9 qu'il ait fait aucun acte de corruption ou autre acte ill\u00e9gal quelconque pendant les quelques jours qu'il a pass\u00e9s dans cette paroisse \u00e0 soutenir les int\u00e9r\u00eats de la candidature du d\u00e9fendeur. La section 73 de l'acte des elections autorise l'emploi de cabaleurs salari\u00e9s \u2014mais dans le cas o\u00f9 le cabaleur est voteur il est d\u00e9qualifi\u00e9. C'est la seule peine prononc\u00e9e par la loi. Dans l'\u00e9lection de Qu\u00e9bec-est ([36]) on a mis en question la l\u00e9galit\u00e9 de cette facult\u00e9 qui m\u00e8ne fatalement \u00e0 l'abus. On v avait enjoliv\u00e9 un nombre assez consid\u00e9rable pour faire voir que l'emploi des cabaleurs \u00e9tait un moyen indirect de s'assurer le vote par une consid\u00e9ration p\u00e9cuniaire. Toutefois l'Honorable juge Meredith qui d\u00e9cida la cause, quoique d'opinion qu'il y avait en de l'imprudence dans l'emploi d'un aussi grand nombre de cabaleurs, ne crut pas qu'on s'\u00e9tait rendu jusqu'\u00e0 l'abus. Mais comme ii \u00e9tait evident, que l'emploi de cabaleurs salari\u00e9s ne pouvait avoir que de mauvais effets la legislature de Qu\u00e9bec a fait dispara\u00eetre cette disposition de ses lois \u00e9lectorales. La legislature d'Ontario en a fait autant. Cette disposition ne fait plus tache que dans les lois \u00e9lectorales qui ii faut l'esp\u00e9rer feront bient\u00f4t dispara\u00eetre la facult\u00e9 d'employer ces personnages de caract\u00e8re le plus souvent plus que douteux \u2014ignorants, absolument incapables de traiter des affaires publiques, n'ayant presque pas d'autres armes que Ia calomnie\u2014faisant Ia plupart du temps leur vile besogne la nuit\u2014toujours hors la pr\u00e9sence d'un adversaire et qu'on devrait proscrire comme n'\u00e9tant que des calomniateurs \u00e0 gage. Cependant cette disposition existant encore dans la loi f\u00e9d\u00e9rale il \u00e9tait loisible an d\u00e9fendeur d'en prendre avantage, et comme son cabaleur Chalut, que je ne veux pas du tout comparer \u00e0 ceux auxquels j'ai fait allusion plus haut, n'a fait aucun acte illegal en s'acquittant de sa mission, l'\u00e9lection du d\u00e9fendeur ne saurait \u00eatre aucunement affect\u00e9e en consequence de ce fait.\nEn terminant je veux ajouter une observation sur le principe que l'on a essay\u00e9 d'\u00e9tablir dans cette cour, viz.:\u2014qu'une fois qu'un juge en premi\u00e8re instance a prononc\u00e9 sur les faits, qu'il a rendue comme on dit, son finding sur ces faits, qu'une cour d'appel ne doit pas renverser ce finding. Je crois qu'admettre ce principe est une violation directe du statut qui a cr\u00e9\u00e9 cette cour. Le droit d'appel est sans limite sur le droit comme sur les faits et ii est du devoir de thus les juges d'examiner la preuve comme le juge de premiere instance et de rendre le jugement qu'ils croient que ce juge de premi\u00e8re instance aurait di rendre. Les juges de cette cour ne sont aucunement lies par le jugement de la cour inf\u00e9rieure C'est une grave erreur suivant moi, et c'est une erreur qui priverait un grand nombre de plaideurs de leur droit d'appel. Ce principe n'a jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9nonc\u00e9 comme il l'a \u00e9t\u00e9 dernierement et je crois devoir protester contre une pareille doctrine qui tend \u00e0 faire dispara\u00eetre le droit d'appel dans le neuf-dixi\u00e8mes des causes. Je dois ajouter cependant que lorsque le juge en premi\u00e8re instance prononce sur la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 d'un t\u00e9moin, son appr\u00e9ciation du t\u00e9moignage doit indubitablement pr\u00e9valoir, car il a l'avantage d'appr\u00e9cier le t\u00e9moignage par l'apparence du t\u00e9moin, son hesitation ou sa promptitude \u00e0 r\u00e9pondre et si, dans. un pareil cas, le juge declare qu'il croit un t\u00e9moin plus qu'un autre, alors une cour d'appel ne doit pas intervenir, mais autrement, je le r\u00e9p\u00e8te, je proteste contre l'admission d'une pareille doctrine. HENRY, J.:\nHaving come to a conclusion with regard to the matter of the railway tickets supplied by Lamar die to seventeen or eighteen voters to go from Montreal to Berthier to vote which, to my mind, is sufficient to avoid the election under consideration in this case I think it unnecessary to refer to the other corrupt practices charged. The fact of the agency of Lamarche was satisfactorily proved and admitted on the trial. Is then the giving of the tickets in the way they are shown to have been given by Lamarche, a corrupt act under statutory provision so as to avoid the election?\nThey were issued at a reduced rate for going and returning, and are on their face prima facie evidence that they had, or were to have been paid for. The railway was then owned by the Province of Quebec and operated by a general manager under its government. They were issued by the ticket agent at the request of Lamarche. The latter had been at a previous election a supporter and active canvasser for the respondent, and was well known as such at the late election. He asked for the tickets to be made good from the day he applied for them until the evening of polling day. No names were inserted in them as is done in the case of free passes. This took place at the rail way office in Montreal before polling day.\nFrom the testimony of Lamarche, it appears that he saw the several voters who were sailors working on board of four steamers and obtained their consent to go to Berthier to vote on certain conditions hereinafter referred to He subsequently obtained the consent of the masters of the steamers to the sailors going to Berthier to vote. He then obtained the tickets and the parties, or the most of them, went to that place and voted, as we may assume, for the respondent. The same thing, it appears, had been done at a previous elections, but if it was illegal the repetition must also he: illegal. The first, then, that is told us about obtaining the tickets is what took place between Lamarche, and Labelle the ticket agent. Neither the latter nor Groridine, who gave them to Lamarche, were examined, nor did the respondent in his evidence refer to them, or in any way negative payment for them. Lamarche says he did not pay for them, but there is nothing to show that they were not paid for. Lamarche, then, having given them, and they being worth to each voter that used them about a dollar and a half we must conclude that they were of value to that extent to the parties that got them. Although Lamarche did, not pay for them, it does not follow that they were not paid for. He says he got them as he had done before, but without any explanation as to how, or upon what terms, they had been previously obtained. If they were gratuitously given that could easily have been shown by Labelle or some other in the ticket office. If they had not been purchased it was easy to have shown it. When it was in the power of the respondent to have shown it, and he fails to do so the conclusion should be that they were purchased. The presumption in the absence of any explanation is that they were paid for by, or charged to some one. I think the onus was upon the respondent to show that a public officer situated as Labelle was had assumed the responsibility of giving away the revenue of his employers. I do not mean to say that it might not have been shown that that officer acted by direction from those above him but as far as the evidence upon the point goes,\u2014and by that alone are our conclusions to be arrived at before we reach the point that the tickets were given gratuitously, we must assume that La-belle had done a wrong to those in whose interest he was engaged. I think under the evidence I am not warranted in arriving at that conelusion. That they were not paid for must be an exception to the general rule, and if such an exception was made, it was for the respondent to prove it. In election cases, where attempts are so common to avoid statutory prohibitions, proof of such circumstances are more imperatively required. I am not, however, compelled to decide whether the tickets were paid for or not as I view the law. Lamarche first ascertained how many were willing to go, and then he got a sufficient number of tickets for them. The greater number of the recipients, if not the whole of them went to Berthier and voted, Would all, or any of them, have gone if they had not got them? and had not other conditions insisted on by the voters also been complied with? To see the effects and trace the results of the means adopted by Lamarche to secure the votes of the electors in question, I will refer to one of many statements in evidence. It may be alleged that he when giving the tickets, did not make any condition as to the party for whom the parties were expected to vote. We have, however, the fact that Lamarche was actively engaged as the respondent's supporter at previous elections, and no doubt knew how these men had voted previously. His residence was at Berthier (although he had an office in Montreal), and he personally knew them and no doubt had good reason to believe that every one of them that could be induced to go to the election, would vote for the respondent. His object would be gained if they were induced to go. When on board one of the steamers, the Trois-Rivi\u00e8res he asked a certain number of the employ\u00e9s of that steamer to go to vote at that election. One of the witnesses (Joly) referring to Lamarche, says :\u2014\nIl est arriv\u00e9 \u00e0 bord, du \" Trois Rivi\u00e8res.\" en arrivant ii a h\u00e2l\u00e9 un papier 5 ii a nomm\u00e9 tous les voteurs \u00e0 bord: apr\u00e8s qu'il a eu fini, ii y a une couple de voteurs qui ont dit: \" on aimerait \u00e0 partir aujourd'hui: si on ne peut aujourd'hui, on n'y va pas. et on aimerait \u00e0 avoir notre passage pour aller et revenir et on aimerait aller chacun chez nous avant d'aller voter \"\nIt is shown that Lamarche agreed to those conditions. It appears also from the testimony of other witnesses that at least some of the parties would not have gone to vote but for the inducements offered by Lamarche. In the first place, that their passage by rail going and returning should be provided for free; that they should go the day they were spoken to, and that they should be permitted to remain over a day or more with their families at Berhier. Larmarche, in order to secure their votes had to obtain leave from the masters of the steamboats for the absence of the men from their employment and to provide for their passage by rail, going and returning, as before mentioned. Votes were thus, we may assume, secured for the respondent that otherwise we must also assume he would not have received, The law by which we are to be governed in this case is to be found in sub-sections 1 and 3 of section 92 and in sections 96 and 98. Sub-section 1 is as follows:\nThe following persons shall be deemed guilty of bribery and shall be punished accordingly. Every person who directly or indirectly by himself or by any other person on his behalf, gives, lends or agrees to give or lend, or offers or promises any money or valuable consideration, or promises to procure, or to endeavour to procure, any money or valuable consideration, to or for any voter, or to or for any person on behalf of any voter, or to or for any person in order to induce any voter to vote or refrain from voting, or corruptly does any such act as aforesaid on account of such voter having voted or refrained from voting at any election.\nSub-sect inn 3 is as follows:\nEvery person who directly or indirectly, by himself or by any other person on his behalf, makes any gift, loan, offer, promise, procurement or agreement as aforesaid, to or for any person, in order to induce such person to procure, or endeavour to procure, the return of any person to serve in the House of Commons, or the vote of any voter at any election. Section 96 is as follows:\nAnd whereas doubts may arise as to whether the hiring of teams and vehicles to convey voters to and from the polls, and the paying of railway fares and other expenses of voters, be or be not according to law it is declared and enacted that the hiring or promising to pay or paying for any horse, team, carriage, cab or other vehicle, by any candidate or by any person on his behalf, to convey any voter or voters to or from the poll, or to or from the neighborhood thereof, at any election, or the payment by any candidate, or by any person on his behalf, of the travelling and other expenses of any voter, in going to or returning from any election, are and shall be unlawful acts.\nFor the purpose of showing the applicability of the provisions of sub-section (1) to the circumstances in evidence in this case, it may be briefly read thus:\nEvery person who directly or indirectly, by himself or any other person on his behalf, gives any money or valuable consideration in order to induce any voter to vote or refrain from voting, shall be guilty of bribery.\nIt will be observed and it is in the decision of this case necessary and of the utmost importance to observe, that in that provision there is no reference to any condition as to the party to be voted for. It is simply a provision against the doing of either of two things\u2014 first the inducement to vote and the other to refrain from voting. As I read the prohibition, it matters not whether the party offering the illegal inducement knew or cared how the influenced party would vote. It need not be done corruptly. The mere giving an inducement is the offence. The offence is consummated when a party is induced by any valuable consideration to vote and the offer of the inducement is an offence whether accepted or not. What then have we to try in this case? The fact of the inducement which caused the parties to go and vote, and the question as to their having done so through the means of a valuable consideration. I have already stated it as my opinion that We under the evidence should hold that the tickets in question were purchased at a reduced rate and paid or to be paid for by some one in the interest of the respondent. Those tickets are sis follows:\nSp\u00e9cial.\nQu\u00e9bec, Montreal, Ottawa & Occidental Railway,\nOne First-class Passage.\nFrom Hochelaga to Berthierville and return.\nIn consideration of the reduced rate at which this ticket is sold,it will only be valid 22nd June 1882.\n(Signed), L. A. S\u00e9n\u00e9cal,\nGeneral Superintendent.\nWithout some other evidence it might be alleged that although the tickets were issued in that form they were given by the ticket agent as free passes. We have, however, one of the free passes over that railway in evidence which goes to show that the tickets were purchased. The specimen in evidence of the free passes issued is as follows:\nNo. 19, North Shore Railway (which is another name for the same railway) Aug. 29, 1882.\nPass Mr. A. Buron from Berthier to Montreal. Why issued\u2014on acc.of Richelieu & Ont. Navig. Co. Not tranferable. Free passengers by the acceptance of this pass assume all the risk of accident to their person or property o without claims for damages on the corporation. Void after Sept. 29, 1882. Good for one trip only.\nA. Davis\nSuperintentent.\nForm C.\nAny one looking at such a ticket would most irresistibly conclude it had been purchased and there is nothing in the evidence to show that it was not. It is quite consistent with the statement of Lamarche that such tickets had been arranged about and paid for at the election in question, as well as at previous ones.\nCompare also the terms of the tickets and those of the free passes. The first were transferable and entitled the travellers under them to seek compensation in case of a negligent accident. The latter were not transferable, and, therefore, only valuable to the party named in them, and the holder was prevented by its provisions from seeking compensation in case of an accident. The tickets represented money, as they could have been sold by any one who held them, and the right to travel under one of them would pass to the purchaser. If nothing was paid or to be paid for them, we should expect to have seen that free passes would have been issued by which liability would be limited. My reason for drawing attention to this distinction will be more obvious when I hereafter refer to the judgment of Mellor J., in the Bolton case ([37]), when referring to a free pass. It is however, contended that if the tickets were given by the ticket officer gratuitously to Lamarche, the latter not having paid anything for them, could legally make use of them in the way he is shewn to have done. They were undoubtedly of value to those to whom Lamarche gave them in two ways: first, as a saleable article: and next they enabled each holder to do without cost what he could only have done by paying a dollar and a-half. If in place of the tickets given by the ticket officer (as for this argument we may assume gratuitously), he or some one else had given Lamarche a sum of money, and that he had employed it in a way made corrupt by statute or Common Law, are we to consider how he got the money? He was the acknowledged agent of the respondent, and the latter is as to this inquiry, answerable for his acts; and, regardless how he got the tickets if they were of value, as they undoubtedly were, the offence consisted in the illegal disposition of them. We may be properly told that a candidate or any of his agents might give a seat in his carriage to a voter and drive him to the poll, and I might not possibly decide that the voter had received a valuable consideration within the terms of the section in question but that is not the case under consideration. The section forbids any one by a valuable consideration to induce a party to vote or refrain from voting. I am decidedly of opinion that under the evidence we should assume the tickets in question were paid for, and by the use shown to have been made of them an offence committed against the provisions of section 66.\nIf, however, our conclusion in that respect should be in the opposite direction. I still am of opinion that an offence was committed under sub-section 2 before cited.\nIn the leading case of Cooper v. Slade ([38]) decided by the House of Lords in 1858, the question turned upon the construction of section 2, ch. 102, of the Imperial Act 17 and 18 Vic, and of a letter given in evidence. That section is, in its provisions and language, identical with sub-section 2 before referred to but the former has a proviso, not in sub-section 2, that it \" shall not extend, or be construed to extend, to any money paid or to be paid for or on account of any legal expenses bonu tide incurred at or during the election.\"\nThe letter was as follows:\nSIR,\nThe mayor having appointed Wednesday next for the nomination and Thursday for polling, you are earnestly requested to return to Cambridge and record your vote in favor of Lord Maidstone and F. W. Blade, Esq., Q.C.\nYours truly,\nCharles Balls,\nChairman.\nYour railway expenses will be paid.\nNine out of the ten learned judges decided that the offer to pay the railway expenses of the voter was bribery under section 2 of the Imperial Act before cited. The decision rested upon the promise contained in the letter. It was written by a party for whose acts the candidate was responsible, and although the decision turned on the construction of the letter as embodying only a conditional promise to pay the travelling expenses, I can find little or nothing in the language of the learned, Judges to show that if the promise had. not been conditional the judgment would have been the other way.\nBaron Channell said:\nIt is, in my opinion, unnecessary to decide whether prior to 17th and 18th Vie. ch. 102, the bona fide payment of travelling expenses was illegal. Nor is it, in the view that I take of this case, necessary to decide, whether, since the act, a promise to pay travelling expenses is void within that statute, if unaccompanied by a condition that the person to be paid is to vote for the party promising to pay.\nBaron Watson, referring to section 2 of the same Act, said:\nIt is not necessary that the voter should vote or even promise to vote, to constitute an act of bribery under that provision. It has been suggest that to bring a promise within the provision it must be a conditional promise to pay the travelling expenses if the elector vote for the promiser. It appears to me that it would be equally within the meaning of the act if the promise was unconditional, simply to pay money on the elector voting at all, inasmuch as the candidate may have a full reliance (perhaps erroneously) how the vote would be given, and that such promise would be an inducement to vote, whether conditional or unconditional.\nMr. Justice Wight man was, however, of the opinion (and I must say, contrary to the plain meaning of the words used) that the promise must be to induce the person to whom the promise is made, to vote for a particular candidate.\nColeridge, J., said:\nThis then was a promise of money in order to induce a voter to vote, and whether the payment of travelling expenses per se be legal or not, I am clearly of opinion that to promise to do so, in order to induce a voter to vote, is within the second section of the statute.\nNo other of the judges remarked specifically on the difference between a conditional and unconditional promise. The 98th section of the Dominion Act before mentioned makes the offences created by sub-section 2 corrupt practices to avoid an election. There is no such provision in the Imperial Act before referred to, and under which the decision in Cooper v. Slade was given. I am, however, of the opinion that the decision of all the judges together in that case does not fully decide the question before us, as it was unnecessary they should do so but I adopt the views of Mr. Justice Watson, before cited. I am induced to believe that the Dominion Parliament in enacting the provisions of sub-sec. 2 intended to provide for cases then unprovided for To promise a voter money or other valuable consideration, provided he voted for a particular candidate, would, if he so voted, be bribery at common law, and by previous statutes the promise alone would have been bribery, and if made by a candidate or his agent, would have been cause for avoiding the election. We must assume the legislature intended to go further in the direction of removing improper influences against the perfect freedom of the voters either to vote or refrain from voting. The legislation was, as I think, intended to prevent cases such as the present one. The policy is evidenced by the statutory provisions against the hiring of conveyances and the paying of the travelling expenses of voters. What difference in principle can be found between the paying for an ordinary carriage and the providing of railway tickets? When, therefore, we find from the legislative declaration against the use of undue influence in one direction the policy of the legislature in respect to freedom from such influences, we have the right and it is our duty to construe other provisions enacted by the same legislature in a way to give effect to that policy. The 2nd sub-section should then be read in the light of that policy. It says, in so many words, that the giving of a valuable consideration to induce a party to vote shall be considered bribery and by section 98 the election wherein it is given is avoided. Surely if the legislature meant the provision only to apply to cases of conditional promises, we would find it so expressed. In the case of Cooper v. Slade the declaration did not charge the offence as a promise founded on any condition, but simply on the charge of inducing the voter to vote at the election; and no objection was taken to the count on that ground. If the count had been open to that objection we have every reason to conclude that the learned Attorney General and other eminent counsel for the defendant in that case would have raised it.\nIt is alleged, however, that the decision of Mr. Justice Mellor in the Bolton case before referred to ([39]) modifies to some extent the law as laid down in Cooper v. Slade, but I cannot find it to be so. In that case it was proved that letters with a railway pass were sent by an agent of the respondent to a number of voters who lived at a distance from the borough. The letter was as follows:\nCross and Knowles' Committee Rooms,\nFebruary 2, 1874.\nDear Sir,\u2014\nYour name being upon the list of parliamentary voters for this borough, you are entitled to vote at the forthcoming election. We enclose you a railway pass, on presenting? which at the station named, you will be furnished with a railway ticket to convey you to Bolton and back again. I trust you will be able to make it convenient to come over and record your vote in favour of Messrs. Cross and Knowles.\nThe learned judge fully admitted the correctness of the law as laid down in Cooper v. Slade, but undertook to distinguish the two cases. He had, however, to decide upon the gift of a railway pass which he pronounced of no intrinsic value. It was not a railway ticket but a pass, upon the production of which at the railway office the party would obtain a ticket. It might not in that case have amounted to a valuable consideration, as it really was nothing more than an authority to get what was valuable\u2014a railway ticket. If the ticket was not issued the candidate was at no expense, and it appears to me that it was that consideration that induced the judgment in that case. There was no promise to pay anything as in the case of Cooper v. Slade. After the decision in the latter case the Act 21 and 22 Vic ch. 87 was passed by which a candidate or his agent, \" by him appointed in writing,\" might provide conveyance of any voter for the purpose of polling at an election. By a subsequent statute the provision was limited to county elections The learned judge referred to sections 2 and 23 of 17 and 18 Vic. the latter of which subjects a person who offends against either to a penalty only but does not avoid an election. The learned judge referred also to section 36 of the Reform Act of 1867, which repeals the provision of the Act 21 and 22 Vic. ch. 87 as to boroughs and decided that inasmuch as no legislative enactment provided for the avoidance of the seat, he declared the respondent duly elected.\nThe learned judge said:\nI do not say that a judge could act upon historical evidence when he found the words clear. Yet. when I am asked to decide that the words of the statute which enact that this should be deemed an illegal payment, should have a more extensive meaning than that, I look to the words to see whether they compel me to say so. and I come to the conclusion that they do not. Do they convey an inference to the contrary? I think they do.\nHe then stated the fact that a member of Parliament proposed an amendment to the bill that the providing for such conveyance should be a corrupt practice within the meaning of the Corrupt Practices Act, but that that was negatived. He was, therefore, dealing with a matter totally different under statutory provisions from that now under consideration. His ' decision was founded on two propositions\u2014first, that the pass sent to the voter was of no absolute intrinsic value and second, that had it been so, it was by law no cause for avoiding the election. The case before us is essentially different on both points. I have shewn that the tickets were of intrinsic value and section \u00a38 supplies what the learned judge found absent in the English statutes.\nLooking at the whole of the Dominion legislation respecting elections, we may safely conclude that freedom to exercise the elective franchise unaffected by any improper influence, was intended. There are influences which exert themselves that may or may not be legitimate, but which no legislation can prevent, but those that are prohibited should not be allowed to prevail. As far as I have been able to discover the policy of the legislation, in this country at least, it is not to provide for the return of a member by a majority of the votes in an electoral district, who may by any means be induced to poll their votes, not by a majority made up by the votes of those who, but for improper inducements would not have voted at all not of those who go to the polls at the expense of some other person\u2014a candidate or one of his friends\u2014but by a majority of those who, uninfluenced by such means, and who at their own cost, be it great or small go to the polling places provided for the purpose, and declare their uninfluenced choice. That such is the true policy will not be questioned and as I construe the election statutes which prohibit the giving of any valuable consideration to induce a voter to go to the poll to vote and which provide that doing so shall avoid an election, I consider that it would be in direct opposition to that policy if we decide under the circumstances in uncontradicted proof here, that the respondent was duly elected. I am, therefore, of the opinion that the appeal herein should be allowed and the respondent declared to have been unduly elected with costs. GWYNNE, J.:\nI adhere to the opinion already expressed by me more than once that in these election cases upon the trial of the matters of facts raised in which so much depends upon the manner in which the witnesses give their evidence\u2014their intelligence\u2014and the degree of credibility to be attached to each, we, sitting in appeal from the judgment of a learned judge, who having had the advantage of seeing and hearing the witnesses give their evidence, has passed upon the matters of fact, should never overrule his finding unless (a thing which when the evidence is wholly oral\u2014not contained in any written document\u2014it is difficult to conceive to be possible) the evidence is of such a nature as to convey to our minds an irresistible conviction that the finding of the learned judge upon those mere matters of fact is clearly erroneous. It may be that in some cases, upon reading the evidence as taken down, and without the light thrown upon it by the demeanor of the witnesses, I might arrive at a different conclusion from that arrived at by the learned judge but that would afford no justification for my overruling\u2014upon mere matters of fact his judgment formed under advantages, which, sitting in appeal, I have not, and cannot have; but when the appeal is, or in so far as it is, upon a point or points of law, it is a different matter. Then it becomes my duty to express my opinion upon the law involved in the points appealed, according to the best and utmost of my independent judgment.\nThe points involved in this appeal (all other charges having been abandoned at the trial of the election petition) are comprised in four charges of specific acts of bribery and corrupt practices, alleged to have been committed by duly authorized agents of the respondent, supplemented by a general charge that each and every of those fraudulent, illegal and corrupt practices specifically charged, were committed with the knowledge and actual consent of the respondent. The first of these charges which is called the Lamarche case in short substance is to the effect that one Olivier Lamarche a duly authorized agent of the respondent, with the knowledge and actual consent of the respondent, paid the travelling expenses and other expenses of a great number of electors of the electoral division of Berthier to enable them to go to and return from the polling places and among others, to nineteen named qualified electors of the electoral division of Berthier by giving to each of the said persons a railway passenger ticket of the Quebec, Montreal, Ottawa & Occidental Railway, and other valuable consideration to pass them into the said electoral division to the polling places where each of the said persons had a right to vote, and that the said persons afterwards sold again the said railway passenger tickets, which they had so gratuitously received, and with a fraudulent, illegal and corrupt motive, and to induce them to vote for the said respondent and from those sales have derived sums of money and other valuable consideration, which they have kept for their own exclusive use.\nThat is comprised in this charge, eliminating from it all superfluous and irrelevant matter, which the allegations of the re-sale of the railway tickets by the persons to whom they were given appears to me to be, is, I think, beyond doubt an offence charged as having been committed against the provisions of the 96th section of the Dominion Election Act of 1874 and the charge in substance is, that Lamarche being an agent of the respondent did, with respondent's knowledge and consent, pay the travelling expenses of the persons named in going to and returning from the place where the election was held, by giving to them respectively railway passenger tickets to convey them to and from the polling places where they respectively had votes at the election, free of charge for such conveyance. The charge, however, was treated at the trial as comprising also an offence charged to have been committed against the provisions of the 92nd section of the Act, namely, as an act of bribery, and not merely an illegal act, as an act within the contemplation of the 96th section only is and which by the 98th section is made what is called a corrupt practice as distinct from bribery. This construction is put upon the charge by force of the words in the sentence relating to the alleged resale of the railway tickets by the persons to whom they were given, wherein the railway tickets, (which the persons to whom they were given are alleged to have re-sold, and so not to have used at all for the purpose for which they are alleged to have been given), are described as having been received by them gratis and with a fraudulent, illegal and corrupt motive, and to induce them to vote for the respondent. Now, charges of corruption of this nature should, as it appears to me be stated in these election \"petitions with the same preciseness and certainty as would be required in an indictment or in an action for penalties in neither of which should a defendant be compelled to go to trial or have a judgment pronounced against him upon a count containing two charges so distinct from each other, as an offence against the provisions of the 92nd section is from one against the provisions of the 96th section of the Act. The respondent has, however, raised no objection upon this head, but the charge has been treated at the trial of the election petition and in the argument before us as a single one, but as one which it is competent for the petitioners to sustain as an offence against the provisions of one or other of the above sections in one or other of the alternative cases following, that is to say:\u2014either, 1st, as an act of bribery committed by Lamarche, as the agent of the respondent and with the actual knowledge and consent of the respondent; or 2nd, as an act of bribery committed by Lamarche in his character as agent for the respondent, but without the latter's knowledge or consent; or 3rd, as an illegal and corrupt practice, though not an act of bribery committed by Lamarche, as respondent's agent, with the actual knowledge and consent of the respondent; or 4th, as a like act committed by Lamarche, in his character of agent of the respondent, without the latter's knowledge or consent. A charge of such a many-faced and ambidextrous character, is well calculated, if permissible to take a respondent at great disadvantage, but as no objection upon that head was taken on the respondent's behalf in the court below, I propose to treat the case as it was treated there. By the 96th section of the Dominion Election Act it is enacted as follows: \u2014\n[The learned judge then read the 96th section ([40]) ]\nBy the 98th section any wilful offence against this 96th section is declared to be a corrupt practice, and by the 101st any corrupt practice committed by any candidate or by his agent whether with or without the actual knowledge and consent of such candidate shall avoid his election if he has been elected and by the 102 section it is enacted that if any candidate himself personally commit any corrupt practice, or if any person on his behalf, with his actual knowledge and consent do so, the candidate, besides having his election declared void if he has been elected, shall be incapable of being elected and of sitting in the House of Commons and of voting at any election of a member of the House and of holding any office in nomination of the Crown or of the Governor in Canada. The learned judge before whom the election petition was tried has found as matter of fact, that there was no sufficient proof of hiring or promise to pay, or paying for any horse, team, &c., &c., as prohibited by the 96 section, or of the payment ox. travelling or other expenses of any voter in going to or returning from the election in question, nor of any unlawful act within the meaning of this section, \" On the contrary,\" he says in his judgment:\nI am satisfied from the proof and circumstances that the railroad ticket agent, with what degree of propriety it is not for me to decide here, gave the passes upon which the said voters went to the polls gratis, and that they were never paid for, nor promised to be paid for, and that the proof fails to bring the charge under this head of objection within the provisions of the said 96th section of the Act.\nAnd he therefore found in favour of the respondent upon this charge, although he found as matter of fact, also, that Lamarche was an agent of the respondent at the election. This finding of the learned judge upon a mere matter of fact, I cannot, sitting in appeal, venture to pronounce to be erroneous without violating the rule by which as I have said, I consider myself to be bound in cases of mere matter of fact. But indeed the finding of the learned judge is in strict accordance with the only evidence which was given upon the subject, which was that of Lamarche himself, who, if he is to be believed and the learned judge has believed him never paid or promised to pay for the tickets, but received them from the ticket agent by whom they were issued gratuitously, whether upon his own authority or upon the authority of a superior officer does not appear and as the charge is that it was Lamarche who as the respondent's agent, and on his behalf, paid the travelling expenses of the voters in question, Lamarche's evidence if true, disproves the charge.\nThe charge as framed, is somewhat peculiar. It is not merely that Lamarche, as respondent's agent and on his behalf, &c, paid the travelling expenses of the voters in question in going to or returning from the election, but that he did so by giving to each of the voters named a railway ticket to convey him to the polls. The giving of the railway ticket to the voters named is alleged as the mode by which Lamarche paid their travelling expenses, which tickets, as the charge alleges, the parties to whom they were given sold instead of using them for the purpose for which they were given. As, however, the learned judge who tried the case has found, as matter of fact, that Lamarche neither paid nor promised to pay anything for the tickets, and that they were given to him by the company's agent gratis, the conclusion of the learned judge upon the charge is well founded in law that no offence within the provisions of the 96th section was proved. It was contended by Mr. Mercier, in his able argument before us, although no such point is made in the appellant's factum, that as the tickets upon their face purport to limit the time during which the tickets should be available in consideration of the tickets having been issued at a reduced rate, a presumption is raised that the tickets were paid for by some one which is not displaced by Lamarche's evidence. But the answer to this contention appears to me to be plain; that upon this charge the respondent is not concerned, whether the tickets were or were not paid for if they were not paid for, or promised to be paid for, by the respondent's agent, Lamarche, whose conduct alone is involved in this charge. The respondent cannot be found guilty of corrupt practices committed by his agent Lamarche, nor can the election be avoided upon the suggestion of such a presumption. The presumption might arise in an action to which the company was a party; if in such action a question should be raised whether, in point of fact the tickets were or were not paid for by some one other than Lamarche, but against this, respondent or his agent Lamarche who is charged with having paid for the tickets, the evidence of Lamarche who swears that he did not pay for them but that they were issued to him gratis, if true, as the learned judge has found it to be, is conclusive. The law, as at present existing, does not prevent railway companies, if they please, gratuitously giving tickets which will pass passengers on their railway, even though they be given to voters going to vote at an election. If it be thought expedient to abridge the powers of railway companies in this particular, it is for the legislature to interfere, but there is nothing to prevent companies issuing tickets gratis nor in the form which they use for tickets which are sold at a reduced rate, and in the presence of the testimony, upon oath, of the person to whom these very tickets were issued, that they were issued gratis, the presumption that they were not issued gratis, but were, in fact, paid for, if any such presumption be raised by the form of the tickets, removed.\nThe finding of the learned judge upon the above charge, treating it as containing the allegation of an offence committed against the provisions of the 96th section of the Act disposes, as it appears to me, of the whole charge. The learned judge, however, in his judgment, says as follows:\nBut the petitioners contended at the argument that the passes given to the voters by Lamarche were things of value, and that they were given as a valuable consideration to induce the voters to vote for respondent at the election; thus arguendo contending that respondent, by his agent, had made himself amenable to the provisions of section 92 sub-section 1 of the Act, and thus that he was guilty of bribery through his agent within the meaning of said section. This proposition, (he proceeds to say,) raised the question which has not so far as I know, been as yet extensively discussed in the trial of election cases: as to whether a railroad pass given gratis and unconditionally to a voter to go to vote is within the meaning of the section 92 sub- section I, a valuable consideration, or of any such value as could support a promise. And after referring to the judgment of Mr. Justice Mellor, in the Bolton case ([41]), he says:\nI am of opinion that the passes handed to these voters, unpaid for as Lamarche swears on cross examination, and presented to the voters under the circumstances proved in this case do not constitute the valuable consideration to them contemplated and prohibited by the statute, and that the passes in question are not such considerations within the meaning and intention of section 92 of the Act and I find that the petitioners have tailed to establish the said first charge of bribery and corrupt practices against the respondent or his agent.\nIt is plain, to my mind, from this language of the learned judge that he found, as matter of fact upon a point as to which the most that can be said is that there was contradictory evidence, which however, it was for him to estimate in the light of the value set by him upon the evidence of the respective witnesses, who gave evidence upon the point, that Lamarche gave the tickets to the several voters, without imposing upon them any condition, express or implied, to vote for respondent, and without requiring from them any promise that they would so vote. The question which, as the learned judge says he had to decide was whether a railroad pass given gratis and unconditionally to a voter to go to vote is within the 92nd section. The manner in which he refers to the judgment of Mr. Justice Mellor in the Bolton case which proceeded wholly upon the question whether the promise there relied upon was conditional or unconditional, confirms me in the view which I take of the judgment of the learned judge. He says:\nBefore seeing this authority, I felt inclined to say after much anxious consideration, that tickets, given as these in question were, were not valuable consideration in the Sense of or within the meaning of the Act; in my uncertainty upon this point, I need not say that I felt relief in finding authority so strong, and in the direction of my own inclination.\nI must therefore regard the judgment of the learned judge as finding that as matter of fact the tickets given by Lamarche were not given upon or subject to any condition, express or implied, that the voters to whom they were given should go and vote for the respondent, and as adjudging as a point of law that the tickets having been unconditionally given, no offence against the provisions of the 92nd section was proved. So regarding his judgment, the point which in my opinion we have now to decide is whether, assuming the matter of fact to be well found the law as applied to that matter by the learned judge is correct; for the reason already given I cannot undertake to pronounce the finding of the learned judge upon the matter of fact to be erroneous. That the giving a railway ticket whether purchased for money or obtained from a railway company gratis, by a candidate or any agent of his on his behalf to enable a voter to go to and return from the polling place, and by the production of which to the train conductors he could go to and return from the polling place free of charge to himself if it be given in order to induce the voter to whom it is given to vote for a particular candidate, is the giving of valuable consideration and bribery within the meaning of the 92nd section of the Dominion Act I cannot entertain a doubt but the law as laid down by the House of Lords in Cooper v. Slade ([42]), and followed in the Bolton case ([43]), establishes that to make a promise to pay the travelling expenses of a voter, bribery within the provisions of the English Act 17 and 18 Vic., ch. 102, sec. 2, which are identical with the provisions of 92nd section of the Dominion Act, the promise must be qualified by a condition express or implied that the voter to whom the promise is made should vote for a particular candidate. The same principle, as it seems to me, must apply when instead of a promise to pay the travelling expenses of the voter, there is given to him a railway ticket for the express and bon\u00fb fide purpose of relieving the voter from payment any thing for his conveyance to and from the pooling lace, find which is of a nature that it can only be used by way of payment of travelling expenses as the railway tickets in this case were. The effect of Cooper v. Slade, as it appears to me, is, that in order to constitute the gift of these railway tickets, given for the mere purpose of passing the voters on the railway to and from their respective polling places, to be consideration given in order to induce the persons to whom they were given to vote, within the meaning of the 2nd section, the gift of the tickets must have been qualified by a condition express or implied that the voter should go and vote for a particular candidate. The gift of a railway ticket by which a voter could pass on the railway free of charge to himself must be regarded in the same light and considered in The same manner as the promise to pay travelling expenses. Assuming, therefore, that upon the appellants failing to prove such facts as would establish an offence against the 96th section of the Act, which the particular charge in question clearly alleges, it is competent for them to insist that the charge also sufficiently alleges an offence against the 92nd section I am of opinion that as the learned judge who tried the case has found, as matter of fact (as I understand his judgment as already explained), that the railway tickets given to the voters by Lamarche were clogged with no such nor any condition express or implied, the learned judge was quite right in concluding that no offence against the 92nd section had been established\nAs to Cot\u00e9s case, the learned judge has found, as matter of fact that Cote was not proved to be an agent of the respondent, so as to affect the respondent with his acts. Upon this case it is sufficient to say that I do not see enough to justify me in reversing the judgment of the learned judge upon this pure questiontion of fact. The learned judge was also of opinion that assuming Cot\u00e9 to have been the respondent's agent, the act alleged in the charge was not proved. I have not thought it necessary to enter upon this point, as I do not feel justified in reversing the judgment of the learned judge upon the point of agency. The onus in these appeals is cast upon the appellants to satisfy me beyond all doubt that the finding of the learned judge upon the matters of fact is clearly erroneous, and this they have failed to do.\nThe third charge, which is called the H\u00e9nault-Maxwell case, in short substance, is, that during the election the respondent, through and by one Joseph H\u00e9nault, his authorized agent, gave money to one Joseph Maxwell, a qualified elector in order to induce him to vote in favor of the respondent.\nThis case is certainly one pregnant not merely with suspicion but with the conviction that corrupt conduct was committed by one Daveluy, who, however, was not called as a witness, and who, as the respondent swore, was not directly or indirectly authorized by him to act in any way as his agent, and the question we have to decide is, whether the respondent is to be affected, and his election is to be avoided by the conduct which appeared in evidence of Henault, the person named in the charge as the person by whom the bribery therein charged is alleged to have been committed.\nThis H\u00e9rault was nominated by the respondent's committee to go to a place called St. Damien,on the Sunday before the election, for the sole purpose of speaking in favor of the respondent at the church door after mass where Senator Government was expected to speak and as it seems, did speak in favor of the opposing candidate. At this time H\u00e9nault had no other duty or agency whatever on behalf of the respondent entrusted to him. The learned judge premises his finding upon this charge by stating what the evidence adduced before him upon the point was. He states the evidence of a witness named St. Cr, thus:\nOn St. Cyr's way home from Montreal (to Berthier where he lived), on Saturday before the voting, George Daveluy, of Montreal, who is. not otherwise shewn to have had anything to do with the election gave him a sealed letter at Hochelaga to be forwarded to Maxwell, and on arriving at Mile End Station, Daveluy told him there was money in the letter and to pay attention to it. On St. Cyr arriving at Berthier the same forenoon, meeting Lamarche in the street, he asked him who was going to St, Damien, and that Lamarche told him it was a person named H\u00e9nault. He asked for H\u00e9nault, and gave him the letter, telling him that \"it is a letter which was given to me for Mr. Maxwell. I am told there is money in it.\"\nAgain, the learned judge says:\nThere is no proof of agency on the part of Daveluy, and none at all of the part of St. Cyr, sufficient to compromise the respondent or to affect the election.\nAnd again:\nAs to H\u00e9nault. this was his first visit to the division. He was a stranger there for aught that appears.\nAnd again:\nHe arrived in Berthier the Saturday evening, the eve of his going to speak. He knew none of the committee. The president or some other of the committee told him, \" You will go to St. Gabriel and then to St. Damien. He was sent to St. Damien to speak after mass. He did so and left the money with Maxwell, as stated, but did not in any way canvass or ask his vote. He returned to Berthier and represented the respondent at one of the Polls on the next Tuesday under power of attorney to do so.\nAnd again:\nIt is undoubtedly true that H\u00e9rault came to the division to speak, as he says, for the respondent. As a general agent or canvasser he would have been useless, as being a stranger, He knew nothing of the letter and money referred to until his arrival here (at Berthier). There is no proof that the respondent or his committee knew anything of H\u00e9ndult having such a letter.\nAnd again:\nThe only proof of his agency, apart from his representing respondent at the poll on election day, is the fact that the committee sent H\u00e9nault the Sunday before the polling, evidently with the knowledge and consent of the respondent, to speak for him at the church doors at St. Damien after mass. This appears to be the only act done or part taken by him in connection with the election, except representing the respondent at the poll on the Tuesday as stated.\nAnd the learned judge upon this evidence concludes thus:\nAfter much consideration, I am of opinion that the committee, by sending him for this special purpose, did not make, or intend to make him respondent's agent to act as such generally at his own discretion: and that what passed between H\u00e9nault and Maxwell was entirely out of and beyond the scope of his authority from the committee, express or implied.\nThe letter handed to H\u00e9rault to be conveyed by him and delivered to Maxwell contained the sum of $25 and the sole words following, \"envoyez fort vous et vos gar\u00e7ons but was signed by no one.\nThat the money so sent by Daveluy to Maxwell constituted such corruption as to avoid the respondent's election if Daveluy had been an agent of the respondent, cannot, I think, admit of doubt, even if the money had been sent, as the learned judge seemed disposed to think, and as Maxwell swore to pay for services corruptly rendered by Maxwell to Mr. Robillard, whose agent Daveluy was during an election which had taken place two years previously for the Local Legislature. It is impossible to disconnect the words \"envoyez fort vous et vos gar\u00e7ons,\" from the respondent's election or from the payment of the money, although sent in payment of services rendered at Mr. Robillard's election for the Local Legislature. It may be that Daveluy, who was an agent of Mr. Robillard, as the candidate for the Local Legislature, of the party of which the respondent was the candidate for the Dominion Parliament, was himself a partizan of that party, although not an agent of the respondent, and that he had reason to know or suspect that the services of Maxwell and his boys would not be rendered for the respondent, if the old debt incurred by Maxwell, for like services rendered to Mr. Robillard, should not be paid, and that this was his motive for sending the money, but whatever his motive, the respondent could not be affected by his act if he was not an agent of the respondent, and of his being such, as the learned judge has found, no evidence whatever was offered, and the charge against the respondent was rested wholly upon the contention that H\u00e9rault was guilty of bribery in delivering the letter with the money to Maxwell, and that the respondent is affected by this act of H\u00e9nault.\nThe learned judge has found as matter of fact, that neither the respondent or his committee knew anything of the sending of the letter. The act of sending it must, upon the finding of the learned judge, and the evidence, to be taken to have been the act of Daveluy alone, who was not attempted to be proved to have been an agent of the respondent All persons made Instrumental by Daveluy, in having the letter conveyed and delivered to Maxwell, must therefore be taken to have been Daveluy's agents. When he delivered the letter to SI. Cur asking him to have it forwarded to Maxwell, and when St. Cyr, finding that H\u00e9nault was going to St. Damien, delivered it to him with directions to deliver it; he was acting in accordance with- authority derived from Daveluy, from whom he had received the letter, and H\u00e9nault, by accepting the bailment, became the agent of, and his act in delivering it the act of, Daveluy. The fact that H\u00e9nautt was going to St. Damien upon a special limited agency on behalf of the respondent, could not make his receipt of the letter, addressed and sent by Daveluy to Maxwell, a receipt of it, in his, H\u00e9nault's, character of and as, the agent of the respondent. If H\u00e9nault, when he delivered the letter to Maxwell, was wholly ignorant of its contents, such a proposition could not be entertained for a moment; so to hold would be contrary to every principle of justice, but his having become aware of its contents in the manner explained by him whether such knowledge was acquired wrongfully or accidentally, cannot make any difference in this respect; for if upon receipt of the letter he became quoad it, the agent of Daveluy, for the purpose of conveying it and delivering it to Maxwell, he must have continued to be Daveluy's agent until that purpose should be 'fulfilled. His wrongful or accidental acquisition, before its delivery to Maxwell, of knowledge that Daveluy must have had a corrupt motive in sending it, could not constitute his act of delivering to Maxwell the letter which he had received upon a bailment so to deliver it, derived from Daveluy to be an act done by H\u00e9nault in his character of special agent for the respondent, and by which, therefore, the respondent should be affected. Quoad the letter, H\u00e9nault must continue to hold it until he should deliver it in pursuance of the bailment upon Which he received it in the same character as that in which he had received it, namely as the agent of Daveluy.\nNeither the Bewdley case nor any of the other cases relied upon by the learned counsel for the appellants support the proposition contended for by them, that the respondent can be affected by an act of H\u00e9nault done by him in the character of agent of another person and in pursuance of a bailment derived from that other with whom and whose conduct as in this case we must hold the respondent was in no wise connected.\nThe fourth and last case is the Chalut case. As to this case there does not appear to me to have been any foundation whatever for the charge that the money given to Mr. Chalut was given to induce him to support the election of the respondent, and to vote for him within the sense and meaning of the statute. There cannot be entertained a doubt that the money given to this gentleman, who was president of the respondents committee, and one of the most zealous of his supporters, was given by way of remuneration for his travelling expenses to an outer part of the electoral division, and his services as a lawyer in organizing a canvass upon behalf of the respondent in such part of the division; a purpose in itself quite legal and proper. There is no pretence of anything illegal having been done by Mr. Chalut in pursuance of the commission intrusted to him; if there had been, the charge would have been presented in a different shape, but that it was given, as charged, for the purpose of corrupting Mr. Chalut there does not appear to be any foundation whatever, nor, therefore, any for calling in question the finding of the learned judge upon this charge.\nI think that the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismisssd with costs.\nSolicitors for appellants; Mercier, Beausoleil & Martineau.\nSolicitors for respondent: Lacoste, Globensky, Bisaillon & Brosseau.\n[1] 27 L.

Ritchie, C.J.; and Strong, Fournier, Henry and Gwynne, JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW BRUNSWICK.\nTrespass\u201431 Vic., ch. 60, ss. 2, 19 (D)\u2014Order-in-Council, 11th June, 1879, construction of\u2014Fishery Officer, action against\u2014Notice not necessary\u2014Damages, excessive.\nThree several actions for trespass and assault were brought by A., B. & C., respectively, riparian proprietors of land fronting on rivers above the ebb and flow of the tide, against V. for forcibly seizing and taking away their fishing rods and lines, while they were engaged in fly-fishing for salmon in front of their respective lots. The defendant was a Fishery Officer, appointed under the Fisheries Act (31 Vic. ch. 60), and justified the seizure on the ground that the plaintiffs were fishing without licenses in violation of an Order-in-Council of June 11th, 1879, passed in pursuance of section 19 of the Act, which order was in these words:\u2014\"Fishing for salmon in the Dominion of Canada, except under the authority of leases or licenses from the Department of Marine and Fisheries is hereby prohibited.\" The defendant was armed and was in company with several others, a sufficient number to have enforced the seizure f resistance had been made. There was no actual injury. A. recovered $3,000, afterwards reduced to $1,500, damages; B. $1,200; and C. $1,000.\nHeld,\u2014That sections 2 and 19 of the Fisheries Act, and the Order-in-Council of the 11th June, 1879, did not authorize the defendant in his capacity of Inspector of Fisheries, to interfere with A., B. & C.'s exolusive right as riparian proprietors of fishing at the locus in quo; but that the damages were in all the cases excessive, and therefore new trials should be granted.\nHeld\u2014Also, (Gwynne, J., dissenting,) that when the defendant committed the trespasses complained of, he was acting as a Dominion Officer, under the instructions of the Department of Marine and Fisheries, and was not entitled to notice of action under C. S., N. B., ch. 89, s. 1, or ch. 90, s. 8.\nAppeal from three judgments of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick refusing to enter non-suits or to grant new trials in actions brought in that court by the respondents respectively against the appellant (the defendant in the court below) for breaking and entering upon the respondents' land, and seizing and depriving them of the use and possession of fishing rods, lines and reels, with which the respondents were there fishing in certain waters situate on the said lands, or contiguous to, and flowing by the same.\nA statement of facts for each case is given in the judgment of Ritchie, C. J.\nMr. Harrison and Mr. Burbidge (Deputy Minister of Justice) for appellant, and Mr. Wetmore, Q. C., for respondents.\nThe points relied on and authorities and statutes cited appear sufficiently in the judgments hereinafter given.\nRITCHIE, C. J.:\nIn the cases of Steadman v. Venning, Hanson v. Venning, and Spurr v. Venning, the facts are stated as follows in the appellant's factum:\n1st. Venning v. Steadman\u2014\"This was an action for trespass, assault and malicious prosecution, brought by the respondent against the appellant. The respondent claimed to be the owner or joint owner of a certain lot of land on the Nepisiguit river, situated above the ebb and flow of the tide, and while engaged in fly-fishing for salmon, on the said lot of land, the appellant, who was the Inspector of Fisheries for the Province of New Brunswick, and was at the time acting as such fishery officer, and under direct instructions from the Department of Marine and Fisheries, went upon the land when the respondent was fishing and made a formal seizure of respondent's fishing rod, reel and line, under the Fisheries Act, claiming that he had a right to do so by reason of the respondent's violation of the Order in Council, dated June 11th, 1879, which is in these words: 'Fishing for salmon in the Dominion of Canada except under the authority of leases or licenses from the Department of Marine and Fisheries, is hereby prohibited.' The respondent had no such lease or license, but claimed the right to fish without such lease or license by reason of his being a riparian proprietor.\n\"The case was heard before Mr. Justice Wetmore at the Gloucester circuit, and jury found a verdict for the plaintiff, for $1,220, and the Supreme Court of New Brunswick, on motion made for that purpose, refused to enter a non-suit, or to grant a new trial, and this appeal is now taken.\n\"2nd. In the Hanson case, the respondent claimed to be the owner or joint owner of a certain other lot of land on the south-west branch of the Miramichi river, situated above the ebb and flow of the tide. That case was also heard before Mr. Justice Weldon, at the York sittings, and the jury found a verdict for the plaintiff for $1,000, and the Supreme Court of New Brunswick, on motion made for that purpose, refused to enter a non-suit, or to grant a new trial.\n\"3rd. In the Spurr case the respondent claimed to be the owner or joint owner of a certain lot of land on the Nipisiguit river, situated above the ebb and flow of the tide, and the case was heard before Mr. Justice Wetmore at the Gloucester Circuit, and the jury found a verdict for the plaintiff for $1,220, and the Supreme Court of New Brunswick, on motion made for that purpose, refused to enter a non-suit, or to grant a new trial.\nThe two sections that bear particularly on this case are the 2nd and 19th of 31 Vic., ch. 60.\"\nSec. 2 provides that:\nThe Minister of Marine and Fisheries may, when the exclusive right of fishing does not already exist by law, issue or authorize to be issued fishery leases and licenses for fisheries and fishing wheresoever situate or carried on; but leases or licenses for any term exceeding nine years shall be issued only under the authority of an order of the Governor in Council.\nThe 19th section reads as follows:\nThe Governor in Council may, from time to time, make and, from time to time, vary, amend or alter, all and every such regulation or regulations as shall be found necessary or deemed expedient for the better management and regulation of the sea coast and inland fisheries, to prevent or remedy the obstruction and pollution of streams, to regulate and prevent fishing, to prohibit the destruction of fish and to forbid fishing, except under authority of leases or licenses, every of which regulations shall have the same force and effect as if herein contained and enacted, notwithstanding that such regulations may extend, vary or alter any of the provisions of this Act respecting the places or mode of fishing, or the terms specified as prohibited or close seasons, and may fix such other modes, times or places as may be deemed by the Governor in Council to be adapted to different localities, or may be thought otherwise expedient.\nUnder this statute, on the 11th June, 1879, the Governor in Council passed an Order in Council, which was as follows:\nOn the recommendation of the Honorable the Minister of Marine and Fisheries, and under the provisions of the 19th section of the Act passed in the session of the Parliament of Canada, held in the 31st year of Her Majesty's reign, ch. 60, and intituled: \"An Act for the Regulation of Fishing and Protection of Fisheries.\" His Excellency, by and with the advice of the Queen's Privy Council of Canada, has been pleased to order, and it is hereby ordered, that the following fishery regulation be, and the same is hereby made and adopted:\nFishing for Salmon in the Dominion of Canada, except under the authority of leases or licenses from the Department of Marine and Fisheries, is hereby prohibited.\nIn construing the 19th section of this statute, I think the authority vested in the Governor in Council to forbid fishing except under the authority of leases or licenses was intended to apply to cases such as are referred to in the second section, where the exclusive right of fishing does not already exist by law, or to cases where the Government may, as riparian proprietor, have the right as such to control the fishing, and ought not to be held to apply to cases where the exclusive right of fishing exists by law. Such an absolute prohibition of the enjoyment of their property by riparian proprietors, or what might be still worse by granting a license to one proprietor and witholding it from another, thereby destroying the value of the property of the one, and enhancing the value of the property of the other, would simply be an arbitrary interference with the rights of property pure and simple, and no statute should be so construed as to have such an effect, unless, assuming parliament has the power to enact such a law, it should appear that, possessing such power, such an intention is indicated by clear and unequivocal language or irresistible inference, which it is quite impossible to say exists here, in the face of that well settled canon of construction, that statutes which encroach on the rights of the subjects, whether as regards persons or property, are to receive a strict construction, or as Cockburn, C. J., in Harrod v. Worship[1], says:\u2014\nIt is a canon of construction of acts of parliament that the rights of individuals are not interfered with, unless there is an express enactment to that effect, and compensation given them.\nIn this case, whether parliament has the power absolutely to prohibit, or when or under what circumstances riparian proprietors may be prohibited from exercising their rights, it is not necessary to discuss or determine, because I can find nothing in the statute to justify the conclusion that parliament intended, for no apparent reason, thus to prohibit the enjoyment of riparian rights, and so directly to interfere with property and civil rights.\nI cannot think the legislature contemplated such an interference with the rights of property as the construction contended for would involve. To take away from a proprietor the right of using his property for no assignable reason, and thus to deprive him by statute of the ordinary rights of a subject, is a result which can only be arrived at by necessary and unavoidable construction.\nOn the contrary, reading the statute as a whole, I think a contrary intention may be fairly inferred, if from no other clause, from the second section which recognizes the existence of and protects the exclusive rights of fishing, indicating that those were not the rights with which Parliament was dealing, or to which the provisions relating to leases or licenses were applicable. I am therefore of opinion that the respondent has established that he had the right of fishing where he was fishing, and in doing so, he was not fishing illegally, and that the appellant had no right to enter on the property of the respondent and interfere with him as he did.\nAs to the defendant being entitled to notice by reason of his being and acting in this matter as a Justice of the peace, I think the evidence clearly shows, that in interfering with the respondents in all these cases, he was not acting as a justice of the peace, or in any way in a judicial capacity, or under judicial responsibility, but was acting in discharge of the duty of an Inspector of Fisheries, and that what he did was not done judically in the exercise of any judicial function or discretion whatever. He did not exercise any judicial discretion or profess to act under judicial responsibility. But, on the contrary, he acted merely ministerially under, as he said, explicit orders, over which he claims he had no control or discretion whatever, but which he was bound implicitly to obey. All that he did was as a fishery inspector in accordance with and in obedience to express orders and instructions from the Department of Marine and Fisheries.\nAs to the question of excessive damages, I am most reluctant to interfere with the finding of jurors, but in these cases I regret to say that I cannot differ from Chief Justice Allen in thinking the damages excessive in each case, nor from the rest of my brethren, that by reason thereof there should be a new trial with a view to a re-assessment of these damages by a jury, the legal and proper tribunal for determining that question and one, generally speaking, within their exclusive province. But in this case the damages being, in my opinion, unreasonably large, I think we are bound to send the matter for the consideration of another jury. I cannot bring my mind to the conclusion that the jury assessing these damages at such excessive amounts were not largely influenced in awarding these damages more by the idea that the damages would be paid by the Dominion Government than by the principle of awarding such fair and reasonable compensation or damages, as between the plaintiff and defendant are the natural and proximate consequences of the wrongful act of the defendant, not necessarily the actual pecuniary loss; for in an action such as this, the jury were not arbitrarily tied down to that, but taking into consideration the circumstances of each case, they are to award such damages as will be reasonable and fair, having reference to the relative position of the parties and the manner and circumstances attending the perpetration of the wrongs complained of.\nI think there should be no costs on either side in this court, and that the rule in the court below should be made absolute for a new trial, on account of the damages being excessive, on payment of costs, as in accordance with the practice of that court.\nSTRONG, J.:\u2014\nThese three cases were argued together, the questions involved being the same in each case.\nI agree with the court below, that the justification was not proved. The 1st. sub-sec. of sec. 19 of the Fisheries Act, 31 Vic., c. 60, is as follows:\nThe Governor in Council may, from time to time, make, and from time to time, vary, amend or alter, all and every such regulation or regulations as shall be found necessary or deemed expedient for the better management and regulation of the sea coast and inland fisheries, to prevent or remedy the obstruction and pollution of streams, to regulate and prevent fishing, to prohibit the destruction of fish and to forbid fishing, except under authority of leases or licenses, every of which regulations shall have the same force and effect as if herein contained and enacted, notwithstanding that such regulations may extend, vary or alter any of the provisions of this Act respecting the places or modes of fishing or the times specified as prohibited, or close seasons, and may fix such other modes, times or places, as may be deemed by the Governor in Council to be adapted to different localities, or may be thought otherwise expedient.\nPursuant to the authority conferred by this clause, the Governor General, on the 11th of June, 1879, made an Order in Council, which, amongst other provisions, contained the following:\nFishing for salmon in the Dominion of Canada, except under the authority of leases or licenses from the Department of Marine and Fisheries, is hereby prohibited.\nThe plaintiffs in each of these cases have proved that at the time the trespasses complained of were committed they were fishing in streams above the ebb and flow of the tide, and upon land which was their own private property, or the private property of persons from whom they had a license to fish. The defendant, however, contends that the Order in Council was intra vires of the Governor General, under the 19th section of the Act already read, and that according to the proper construction of its terms it applies to persons fishing on their own property. I cannot agree to the last branch of this proposition, and if it were correct, I should be of opinion that, so construed, the Order in Council would be clearly ultra vires.\nIn the Queen v. Robertson[2], this court determined that the right of riparian proprietors upon streams above tide water, and whose titles were such as to give them, according to the general common law principle the ownership of the beds of the streams to their middle lines, to fish within the limits of their own lands, was a private and exclusive right of property, a proprietary right of the same character as that to the herbage, or trees growing upon the land, or the minerals or game to be found upon it, and that this right of property could not be impaired by any legislation, but that of the Legislature of the Province in which the property was situated, which, under sub-sec. 13 of sec. 92 of the B. N. A. Act, 1867, possesses the exclusive right to legislate concerning \"property.\" And we therefore held that the lease or license of the Dominion Government did not authorize the lessee or licensee to take fish in streams, the beds of which were vested in private owners. It was conceded, however, in that case of the Queen v. Robert son, that the Dominion Government might, under sub-sec. 12 of sec. 91 of the B. N. A. Act, make regulations forthe conservation of fisheries\u2014what are called regulations respecting the police of the fisheries\u2014such as prohibitions against taking fish at certain seasons, using destructive engines, and other rules of a cognate kind.\nIt is argued, now, that the license required by this Order in Council is of this kind, and that a land owner is, by the Order and the act together, prohibited from fishing in streams upon his own land without a license. Such a power, if it exists, must be attributed to this section 19, which certainly confers unusually large powers of legislation upon the Governor in Council; but I am, nevertheless of opinion that this position cannot be sustained. Granting, for the present, that this clause of the statute is sufficiently comprehensive to include the power, as a matter of police regulation, of making, in the public interest and for the preservation of fisheries, an Order in Council restraining unlicensed owners of streams from exercising their full legal common law rights, of enjoying their own property as they may think fit, by requiring that no one should take fish unless licensed, I am still of opinion that the Order in Council falls short of indicating any intention to make such provision. This Order in Council is, of course, to be construed according to the general rules of intepretation applied to statutes. Then, nothing can be better settled than the proposition that no restraint upon the ordinary rights of property, no derogation from the fullest enjoyment of these rights, can be imposed by statute, except by express words. This principle has been so often recognized of late years that it needs but a slight reference to decided cases to show that it rests on the decisions of courts and judges of the highest authority, and ought not to be allowed to be called in question now. In the Metropolitan Asylum District v. Hill[3], Lord Blackburn says:\nIt is clear that the burden lies on those who seek to establish that the legislature intended to take away private rights to show that, by express words or necessary implication, such an intention appears.\nIn the appeal of the Western Counties Railway Co v. Windsor & Annapolis Railway Co.[4], the same principle was acted upon as an established canon of interpretation. The rule is thus stated by Sir Benson Maxwell in his work on statutory construction[5]:\nStatutes which encroach on the rights of the subject, whether as regards person or property, are similarly subject to a strict construction. It is presumed that the legislature does not desire to confiscate the property, or to encroach upon the rights of persons; and it is therefore expected that, if such be its intention, it will manifest it plainly, if not by express words, at least by clear implication and beyond reasonable doubt.\nAnd this statement of the law is supported by the citation of numerous decisions referred to by the learned author. Applying this canon then to the construction of the Order in Council, it is plain that we cannot give the word \"licenses,\" a meaning which would justify the trespasses complained of in this action. There are many fisheries for salmon, such as those in tidal rivers, where there is not, and indeed cannot be, without legislative sanction, any exclusive right of fishing, and to these it must be considered that the licenses required by the Orders in Council were intended to apply. The consequence is, that neither explicitly nor by implication is the requirement of a license made applicable to riparian owners as regards fishing in private streams. To hold otherwise and to determine that the right of fishing by a private owner on his own property was restricted by terms so general as those in which the Order in Council is expressed, would be a flagrant disregard of this most sacred rule for the exposition of written laws.\nThe 2nd section of the Act, by which it is provided that the Minister of Marine and Fisheries may issue fishery licenses where the exclusive right of fishing does not already exist by law, has manifestly no application to a case like the present, where the exclusive right of fishing did actually exist by law. Further, it seems to me, that construing the 19th section of the statute itself on the same principle as that applied to the Order in Council, that it does not empower the Governor General to make Orders in Council restricting the exercise of rights of property by prohibiting the owners of the beds of private streams from taking fish, which are their own property, without having been authorized to do so, by taking out a license.\nThis being, in my opinion, the construction of the Order in Council and the Act under which it was issued, it is not necessary to consider the constitutional question which was argued, as to the powers of the Dominion Parliament under the 12th sub-sec. of sec. 91 of the B. N. A. Act, so to legislate as to require private owners of streams to take out licenses.\nIn Parsons v. Citizens Insurance Co.[6] we are advised by the Privy Council to abstain from expressing opinions on constitutional questions as to legislative powers, unless such opinions are absolutely requisite for the decision of the case in hand, and the Privy Council has itself lately acted on this principle in the case before referred to, of the Western Counties Ry. Co. v. The Windsor & Annapolis Ry. Co.,[7] where their lordships, deciding against the appellants on the construction of the Act, declined to state their views on the question which had been argued before them, as to the constitutional validity of the legislation in question. This rule is also invariably acted on in the Supreme Court of the United States, and has in its favor the weighty reasons which are well pointed out by Mr. Justice Cooley, in his work on Constitutional Limitations[8].\nI entirely agree with the Supreme Court of New Brunswick, in holding that the defendant was not, in the commission of the acts complained of, acting in the character of a justice of the peace, and so entitled to notice of action. Notice of action is not, of course, restricted to cases in which the party claiming the right to it has acted legally, and so has a legal justification. In such cases, notice of action, which is intended to enable the person to whom it is given to tender amends, is of no use, inasmuch as there is a full justification, but it must be shown that the alleged wrongs were committed bon\u00e2 fide with the intention of acting in the character of an officer of the class for whose protection the statute law has required a notice to be given, and in the line of duty of such an officer. In these cases, entering on the lands and the seizures of the rods cannot be attributed to a bon\u00e2 fide intention on the part of the defendant to exercise the functions of a justice of the peace, even supposing him to have been legally invested with that office. The proper duties of a justice of the peace are magisterial and judicial, and these were in no sense judicial acts, but such as we must consider the appellant intended to perform in the execution of the functions of a fishery officer, an office which the defendant undoubtedly held, but one which does not entitle its holder to notice of action.\nThe objections to all the verdicts on the ground of excessive damages are, it seems to me, well founded. This court, under the 4th section of the Supreme Court Amendment Act of 1880, is not now, as it formerly was, disabled from interfering with a verdict on this ground. I read that section as conferring jurisdiction in all cases where the ends of justice may require it, and not as confined to cases in which the verdict is objected to as being against the weight of evidence.\nThe damages here are entirely out of proportion to the wrong. No actual damage was done, except in the case of Spurr, by the seizure and taking away of the rod and the slight injury to the plaintiff's thumb in a struggle, which, according to the evidence of Mr. Burbidge, he engaged in as a practical joke. The whole proceeding seems to have been formal, and to have been so understood by all parties. Nothing like contumely or insult is complained of. The exhibition of a pistol, mentioned in the cases of Hanson v. Venning and Steadman v. Venning, was wrong, but even in these cases, too, the whole matter seems to have been preconcerted and understood between the parties.\nIn cases of personal injury like assaults, the damages must always be more or less arbitrary, as there is no means of measuring them, but I do not understand that the courts will never interfere in such cases. On the contrary, the present state of the law appears to be, as it is laid down in Mayne on Damages[9], where it is said.\nIt is now, however, so well acknowledged, that whether in actions for malicious prosecution, words, or any other matter, if the damages are clearly too large, the court will send the inquiry to another jury.\nThe original verdicts of $3,000 in Steadman's case, $1,220 in Spurr's case, and $1,000 in Hanson's case are, in my opinion, enormous, considering the facts in evidence before the jury, and well warrant, in all three cases, the inference which the court below drew in Steadman's case\u2014\"that the jury were under the influence of undue motives;\" and from the nature of the cases and the evidence presented to the jury, I do not think it an unreasonable presumption that the jury might have supposed that any damages which they might award would ultimately be paid by the Dominion Government, an error against which they might have been usefully warned by the court.\nI have come to the conclusion that this appeal must be allowed, and that there should be a new trial in each case.\nFOURNIER, J.:\nL'Intim\u00e9 est avec quelques autres personnes, acqu\u00e9reur de la New Brunswick and Nova Scotia Land Co., d'un certain terrain, situ\u00e9 sur le c\u00f4t\u00e9 ouest de la rivi\u00e8re Miramichi, au dessus du flux et reflux de la mar\u00e9e. Ce terrain qui s'\u00e9tend de chaque c\u00f4t\u00e9 de la rivi\u00e8re appartenait \u00e0 la susdite compagnie en vertu d'un titre l\u00e9gal. L'Intim\u00e9 et ses associ\u00e9s sont convenus avec la dite compagnie de l'acheter, ont pay\u00e9, partie du prix d'acquisition et ont \u00e9t\u00e9 mis en possession par la compagnie en 1874; ils l'ont occup\u00e9 chaque ann\u00e9e depuis, comme poste de p\u00eache et y ont fait divers autres actes de possession.\nEn 1881, lorsque l'Intim\u00e9 et Mr. Phair \u00e9taient \u00e0 p\u00eacher, l'appelant alors inspecteur de p\u00eache pour le New Brunswick, accompagn\u00e9 de plusieurs autres personnes se rendit sur le terrain et informa Phair qu'il allait saisir sa p\u00eache de ligne. Sur le refus de ce dernier de le laisser faire, \u00e0 moins d'y \u00eatre contraint, l'appelant montra un pistolet en disant que dans ce cas il serait oblig\u00e9 de s'en servir. En pr\u00e9sence de cette menace, Phair c\u00e9da et l'appelant saisit alors sa ligne et autres appareils de p\u00eache. Il en fit autant de ceux de l'intim\u00e9 qui ne les c\u00e9da que sous prot\u00eat. Il para\u00eet que le pistolet n'\u00e9tait pas charg\u00e9\u2014mais ni l'Intim\u00e9 ni Phair ne connaissaient cette circonstance. La pr\u00e9tention de l'appelant est que l'intim\u00e9 faisait la p\u00eache en contravention \u00e0 l'acte des p\u00eacheries et \u00e0 l'ordre en conseil du 11 juin 1879.\nL'Intim\u00e9 avant de se rendre sur sa propri\u00e9t\u00e9 ayant rencontr\u00e9 l'appelant, l'informa de son intention d'y aller faire la p\u00eache. Celui-ci d\u00e9clara alors qu'il le suivrait pour l'en emp\u00eacher. A quoi l'Intim\u00e9 lui r\u00e9pondit en le r\u00e9f\u00e9rant \u00e0 la cause de Steadman v. Robertson (sa propre cause) comme \u00e9tablissant ses droits; qu'il serait injuste d'en agir ainsi. L'appelant invoquant l'ordre en conseil du 11 juin 1879, pr\u00e9tendait que personne ne pouvait p\u00eacher sans avoir une licence du d\u00e9partement de la marine et des p\u00eacheries, l'Intim\u00e9 lui r\u00e9pondit que cet ordre n'affectait pas ses droits et offrit, dans le but de faire r\u00e9gler la question \u00e0 l'amiable, une admission du fait de p\u00eache. L'appelant refusa d'accepter cette proposition, donnant pour raison qu'il avait des instructions du d\u00e9partement et qu'il devait s'y conformer.\nUn verdict a \u00e9t\u00e9 rendu pour $3,000. Le jugement de la cour inf\u00e9rieure refusant un non suit, ordonna un nouveau proc\u00e8s pour le motif que les dommages sont excessifs, \u00e0 moins que le verdict ne fut r\u00e9duit \u00e0 $1,500. Appel de ce jugement.\nLa principale question soulev\u00e9e ici est encore de savoir si un propri\u00e9taire riverain peut, sans une licence du d\u00e9partement des p\u00eacheries, exercer le droit de p\u00eacher dans les eaux non navigables ni flottables qui bordent o\u00f9 traversent sa propri\u00e9t\u00e9.\nLa section 91 de l'Acte de l'Am\u00e9rique Britannique du Nord a bien donn\u00e9 au gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral le pouvoir de l\u00e9gif\u00e9rer au sujet des p\u00eacheries, mais sans lui en avoir attribu\u00e9 la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 l\u00e0 o\u00f9 elle appartenait d\u00e9j\u00e0 aux particuliers en vertu de la loi. Les droits des propri\u00e9taires riverains n'ont \u00e9t\u00e9 aucunement modifi\u00e9s \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard. Ils sont maintenant ce qu'ils \u00e9taient avant la Conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration. Telle a \u00e9t\u00e9 la d\u00e9cision de cette cour dans la cause de la Reine v. Robertson[10]. Cependant l'appelant invoque encore comme il l'a d\u00e9j\u00e0 fait sans succ\u00e8s, dans la cause de Venning v. Phair[11] les pouvoirs \u00e9tendus conf\u00e9r\u00e9s par la 19me section de l'acte des p\u00eacheries au Gouverneur en conseil de faire des r\u00e8glements au sujet des p\u00eacheries. Elle se lit comme suit[12]:\nEn vertu de cette section le r\u00e8glement suivant a \u00e9t\u00e9 pass\u00e9 le 11 juin 1879:\nFishing for salmon in the Dominion of Canada, excepting under the authority of leases or licenses from the Department of Marine and Fisheries, is hereby prohibited.\nCe r\u00e8glement doit-il \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme devant avoir une application g\u00e9n\u00e9rale et obliger m\u00eame un pro\" pri\u00e9taire riverain dans les rivi\u00e8res non navigables ni flottables qui veut exercer le droit de p\u00eache chez lui, \u00e0 se munir d'une licence? Si tel \u00e9tait le cas le riverain n'aurait donc pas le droit exclusif de p\u00eache que la loi lui a reconnu et que les tribunaux ont consacr\u00e9 par leurs d\u00e9cisions. Cependant, loin de le soumettre \u00e0 cette n\u00e9cessit\u00e9, la 2me sec. de l'acte, en exempte les endroits o\u00f9 le droit exclusif de p\u00eache existe. Cette exception n'est pas en contradiction avec la sec. 19 et le r\u00e8glement du 11 juin 1879. Ces diverses dispositions peuvent facilement se concilier de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 recevoir chacune leur effet. La loi n'a certainement pas voulu reconna\u00eetre d'un c\u00f4t\u00e9 les droits du riverain par la 2me section, pour les lui retirer de l'autre par la section 19 et l'ordre en conseil du 11 juin 1879. En exceptant de leur op\u00e9ration les endroits o\u00f9 il existe un droit de p\u00eache exclusif, il reste encore un champ assez consid\u00e9rable o\u00f9 le ministre de la marine et des p\u00eacheries peut exercer le droit de licence. Les sec. 3 et 7 et ss. 6 de la sec. 7 en fournissent des exemples. C'est sans doute \u00e0 ces cas que doivent s'appliquer la sec. 19 et l'ordre en conseil qui peuvent ainsi recevoir leur effet sans qu'il y ait conflit avec la 2me sec. La prohibition d\u00e9cr\u00e9t\u00e9e ne doit donc avoir lien que dans les endroits o\u00f9 il n'existe pas un droit de p\u00eache exclusif. En cons\u00e9quence, les riverains dans les eaux non navigables ne sont pas compris dans cette prohibition et peuvent exercer leur droits de p\u00eache sans \u00eatre tenu de prendre une license.\nL'Appelant a fait \u00e0 l'Intim\u00e9 l'objection qu'il n'avait pas fait preuve de son droit de p\u00eache \u00e0 l'endroit o\u00f9 il avait p\u00each\u00e9, que le titre au rivage et au lit de la rivi\u00e8re appartenait \u00e0 la Nova Scotia and New Brunswick Land Co. Il est vrai que son titre n'\u00e9tait pas encore parfait, mais il \u00e9tait alors l\u00e9galement en possession du terrain en vertu d'une convention pour acheter des propri\u00e9taires, et cela lui donnait le droit \u00e0 une action contre toute personne qui le troublerait sans droit dans l'exercice de son droit de p\u00eache. L'Appelant, en intervenant comme il l'a fait, n'\u00e9tait qu'un wrong doer, parce qu'il n'avait aucune autorit\u00e9 quelconque, ni en vertu de l'acte des P\u00eacheries, ni en vertu de l'ordre en conseil du 11 juin 1879, pour justifier la saisie qu'il a faite. L'obligation de prendre des licences de p\u00eache ne s'appliquant pas aux rivi\u00e8res non navigables, l'Appelant n'avait aucun droit \u00e0 y exercer.\nL'Appelant a fait encore deux autres objections: 1\u00b0 qu'il \u00e9tait prot\u00e9g\u00e9 contre toute poursuite par le ch. 89 des Statuts Consolid\u00e9s, N.-B.; 2\u00b0 que comme juge de paix, il avait droit \u00e0 un avis d'action en vertu du ch. 90 des m\u00eames statuts.\nA ces deux objections, je citerai comme r\u00e9ponse concluante l'opinion de l'honorable juge en chef Allen dans la cause d\u00e9j\u00e0 cit\u00e9e de Phair et Venning.\nI think neither of these objections is tenable. We had occasion to consider ch. 89 in the case of Wood vs. Reed (ante p. 279.) I doubt if the defendant comes within the first section of that Act, the words of which are: 'All sheriffs and other officers of the law,' which, I think, mean policemen and constables, and would not include a fishery officer appointed by the Dominion Government. Neither would the third section apply to the defendant, because in taking the plaintiff's fishing-rod, he was not acting as a justice of the peace. But in addition to these objections, I think the defendant, in what he did, was not acting according to the directions of the Fisheries Act, nor within the jurisdiction thereby intended to be given him, because, in my opinion, the Act never intended to give a fishery officer power to seize fishing rods and in a place where an exclusive right of fishing existed, and which was consequently excluded from the operation of the Fisheries Act. With respect to the other objection, that the defendant was entitled to notice of action, it is sufficient to say he was not acting as a justice of the peace when he did the act complained of, but in another capacity, and therefore the provisions of ch. 90 do not apply.\"\nQuant au montant des dommages, je le consid\u00e8re comme excessif. Il n'y a pas de doute que l'Intim\u00e9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 troubl\u00e9 avec menace de violence dans la jouissance de ses droits comme propri\u00e9taire riverain. Dans les circonstances c'\u00e9tait faire un outrage tr\u00e8s grave \u00e0 un citoyen honorable et paisible qui ne faisait qu'exercer des droits que les tribunaux du pays lui avaient reconnus et qui semblaient \u00eatre devenus incontestables. Il n'y, a pas de doute que des dommages assez \u00e9lev\u00e9s devaient \u00eatre accord\u00e9s pour marquer la r\u00e9probation de la conduite ill\u00e9gale de l'appelant, mais la juste mesure de ces dommages est assez difficile \u00e0 \u00e9tablir. Cependant je crois que le montant accord\u00e9 par le jury est trop \u00e9lev\u00e9 et pour cette raison je crois qu'un nouveau proc\u00e8s doit \u00eatre accord\u00e9.\nHENRY, J.:\nIn the case of the Queen v. Robertson[13] this court decided, I think, unanimously, that a riparian owner was not called upon to take out a lease to fish in the river in the exercise of his riparian rights. The authority of the Dominion Government and the Dominion Parliament is, as I take it, altogether under the Confederation Act, and there the power given to Parliament is to legislate as to the regulation of the sea-coast and inland fisheries. There is no title conveyed to the Government there, either of the sea-coast or of the inland fisheries. Parliament takes its rights to legislate from this Act over inland fisheries, but there was no power given to the Dominion Parliament, in my opinion, to legislate away the private rights of individuals. We decided there was no such power existing; that it is the right of the riparian owner, bounding on unnavigable streams and rivers, to use half the width of the stream or river upon which his land so borders. It is a right appertaining to the property: it is one of the appurtenances to the property, as much as any other. It is a common law right that he has, and unless that right is, at all events, expressly taken away by statute, no legislation otherwise can affect it. The Dominion Government here passed an Act, 31 Vic., ch. 60, authorizing the Governor in Council to make regulations for the better management and regulation of the sea coast and inland fisheries, to prevent and remedy the obstruction and pollution of streams, to regulate and prevent fishing, to prohibit the destruction of fish and forbid fishing, except under the authority of leases or licenses. The next point in the case is to consider what the leases referred must, I think, be intended. It is quite possible that the Dominion may be the riparian owner of large quantities of land in this Dominion through which flow streams where salmon and other fish run, and therefore the power to give leases of these was one that was necessary in order that a party might have an exclusive right of fishing. Under this Act they can grant leases where the land is owned by the Dominion, but, I think, it goes no further. When a party is said to be authorized to give a lease, it pre-supposes that he is the owner of the property to be leased. If the Dominion Government had the riparian rights by ownership, it was necessary that the Act should be passed to authorize the fishery officers to grant leases, and we have the right, therefore, to conclude that the word \"lease\" in the Act, or \"regulation,\" meant a lease of property owned by the Dominion Government. But if it was intended to grant leases of property they did not own, then comes the question as to the power under the Order in Council or under the statute. That question was settled in the case before referred to. Now, what is the Order in Council as to licenses? It is to authorise the fishery commissioner to issue licenses to parties to fish where the exclusive right of fishing does not already exist. What does that mean? If there is an exclusive right already existing\u2014and I maintain, under the common law principle, the riparian owner had the exclusive right\u2014this provision for the issuing of licenses by the Department does not apply at all. It applies only to cases where the exclusive right did not exist. If this be so, what is the jurisdiction here of the defendant? He says:\nUnder these statutes and regulations I went there to prevent the party who had the riparian right to fish from fishing on his own land, because he did not take a lease from the Government,\nwho had no power to give it to him, or a license where none was required. I have shown he did not require a license, because the law said, as plainly as words could make it, in my opinion, that a party who had an exclusive right did not require a license. Here, then, is one of the rights of property tacitly accorded by the terms of the regulation attempted to be attacked, and if the Government had the right to say, \"You cannot fish on your own land without taking a license,\" they could demand a tax so heavy as to prevent the parties using their rights. It is possible that the extreme right to legislate to that extent does exist, but it could only be exercised where there was an extreme public necessity for it. It is possibly true that extreme course, for the purpose of revenue, might be resorted to by the Government, but then very great necessity must be shown before, I think, Parliament would have the right to say to a riparian owner \"you shall not exercise your common law rights of property without paying a tax to the Government.\" It is quite possible that it might be done, and I do not say that in extreme cases it could not be done; but from what we know of the condition of the country, we have no right to conclude that any such necessity exists or existed.\nAs regards notice of action, I have come to the conclusion that the defendant was not acting as a magistrate. He was a magistrate by statute, but only so when he was acting in the capacity of magistrate, or justice of the peace. Here he shows, himself, that he was not acting as such\u2014that he went there under the orders of the department as any agent authorized by the department would have done, and made a seizure. He made the seizure, then, as an officer by the command of the Government. It is true that he might have done what he did as a magistrate, and it is true that under the statute he could, on view, make a seizure of nets or other matters that were being used contrary to the terms of the Act, and he could also make an order to confiscate them, but he shows that he did not make the seizure in that way. If he had said that he went there as a magistrate, of his own motion, and, acting as a magistrate, he would be entitled to notice, but he says:\nI went before a magistrate afterwards to do what I might have done myself had I been acting as a magistrate in the first instance.\nHe was not, I take it, acting as a magistrate in anything he did and he is therefore not entitled to claim the protection of the statute.\nThe only other question is the question of damages. I think the jury assessed the damages under an improper idea. I think that these damages were assessed under the idea that it was a case calling for vindictive damages. It is true, they had a right to assume that the Government might, in its discretion, indemnify the officer called upon to perform this particular duty, still I do not think they had a right to take that into consideration, when they were deciding the only question they ought to decide\u2014what the party was entitled to get for the damage done. Taking that into consideration (and that is the only principle on which a jury is entitled to assess damages in a case like this) I think they exceeded it, and to a pretty large extent If it had been even a good deal more than I would have thought right under the circumstances, I would not have interfered, but I think the difference here is too much when we get up to thousands of dollars in a case where a party is interfered with for a short time, and the damage done to him not of a very serious character. Under the circumstances, I think, if this court could agree upon an amount to which the damages should be reduced, and the parties were willing to take that reduced amount, we could give judgment to that extent, but that not having been done, and the damages being, in my opinion, excessive, the only course, I think, left open to this court, is to set aside the verdict on the ground of excessive damages. Under the peculiar circumstances of the case, I think the ends of justice would require the respondent should not be saddled with the costs in this court, and I quite agree with the decision the learned Chief Justice has arrived at with regard to costs. I think the verdict ought to be set aside on the ground of excessive damages, but on the terms the learned Chief Justice has already stated.\nGWYNNE, J.:\nThese are actions brought by the respective plaintiffs against the defendant, who is Fishery Inspector for the Province of New Brunswick, appointed under the provisions of the Dominion statute, 31 Vic., ch. 60. The declaration in each of the actions, at the suit of Steadman and Hanson respectively, contains counts in trespass and one in case for malicious prosecution, but, as at the trial, verdicts were rendered for the defendant upon the count in case, it is not necessary to refer to that count. The declaration in the action at the suit of Spurr contained but one count, and that in trespass.\nThe trespasses complained of were, that the defendant had entered upon the close of the respective plaintiffs, from and upon which they then respectively were fishing in the waters of the river Miramichi, in the Province of New Brunswick, and then and there wrongfully seized and deprived the plaintiffs respectively of the use and possession of a certain fishing rod, fishing line and reel with which the respective plaintiffs were then fishing in said waters, and then and there hindered and prevented the respective plaintiffs from fishing as aforesaid.\nTo these counts the defendant pleaded not guilty per statute, and specified the following statutes, namely, ch. 8\u00b0, secs. 1 and 2, and ch. 90, sec. 8 of the Consolidated Statutes of New Brunswick, and the Dominion Parliament Statute, 31 Vic., ch. 60, secs. 1, 16, 17, 18 and 19, known as the Fisheries Act of 1868.\nAt the trial, the acts relied upon by the plaintiffs respectively as the acts complained of being proved, the defendant insisted that in doing what he did he was acting in his capacity of Fishery Inspector, and in pursuance of instructions given to him from the Department of Marine and Fisheries for his guidance in acting as such Fishery Inspector, under the authority and provisions of the Fisheries Act of 1868. This was admitted on the part of the plaintiffs.\nBy order in Council of the 11th day of June, 1879, the following fishing regulation was made and adopted:\nFishing for salmon in the Dominion of Canada, excepting under the authority of leases or licenses from the Department of Marine and Fisheries, is hereby prohibited.\nIt was admitted that the plaintiffs were aware of the Order in Council, having seen it published in the Official Gazette, and it was also admitted that under this authority it was that the defendant was acting, but it was contended that (although, as was admitted, the respective plaintiffs were fishing for salmon) this Order in Council had not any application to them, as they were fishing up on their own lands, and where, in consequence, they had the exclusive right of fishing; and it was contended that the regulation by the Order in Council must be limited to the same extent as the 2nd section of the Fisheries Act is, which is limited to places where the exclusive right of fishing does not exist. On the other hand, it was contended that the regulation, as well as the 19th sec. of 31st Vic., ch. 60, under which it was made, must be construed as having general application, and moreover, that whether they should or not be so construed, the defendant was protected in respect of the acts complained of under ch. 89 of the Consolidated Statutes of New Brunswick, or that at any rate he was entitled to a notice of action under the provisions of ch. 90 of the Consolidated Statutes of New Brunswick, and that no notice having been given, he was entitled to have a verdict in his favor, or judgment of non-suit entered. The learned judge refused to non-suit and submitted the cases to the jury as cases proper for them to award damages against the defendant, ruling that the defendant was not entitled to protection under either of the above statutes, and the jury rendered a verdict for $3,000, on the trespass counts in the action at the suit of Steadman, and for $1,000 on the trespass counts in the action of the suit of Hanson, and for $1,220 in the action at the suit of Spurr. Upon motions to set aside these verdicts and to enter a non-suit upon the grounds insisted upon at the time the court sustained the ruling of the learned judge who tried the cases, and upheld the verdicts rendered in all the cases, except in that at the suit of Steadman, in which, having said that they would grant a new trial unless the plaintiff should consent to have his verdict reduced to $1,500, and the plaintiff having consented, the verdict was reduced accordingly, and thereupon they discharged the rule nisi in that case also.\nThe defendant appeals from all of these rules.\nThe defendant, in my opinion, is entitled to prevail upon the point raised by him at the trial under the provisions of the 90th chapter of the Consolidated Statutes of New Brunswick, that is to say, the defendant was entitled to succeed upon the objection that he had not been served with notice of action. By the 1st sec. of the Dominion Statute for the regulation of fishing and the protection of fisheries, it is enacted that:\nThe Governor may appoint fishery officers, whose power and duties shall be defined by this Act and the regulations made under it, and by instructions from the Department of Marine and Fisheries; and every officer so appointed under oath of office and instructed to exercise magisterial powers shall be ex-officio a justice of the peace for all the purposes of this Act and the regulations made under it, within the limits for which he is appointed to act as such fishery officer.\nAnd by the 18th section it is enacted that\u2014\nAny fishery officer or other magistrate may convict, upon his own view of any of the offences both as infractions and for non-compliance, punishable under the provisions of this Act: and shall remove or cause to be removed instantly, and detain any materials illegally in use.\n[The learned Judge read also section 19.]\nAnd by section 16 it is enacted that\u2014 Each and every offender against the provisions of the Act or the regulations under it, shall, for each offence, incur a fine of not more than twenty dollars, besides all costs.\nThe above Order in Council of the 11th June, 1879, containing the prohibition of salmon fishing, except under a lease or license, was proved by the production of the Canada Gazette, in which it was published. In the action at the suit of Steadman, the defendant gave evidence to the effect that he has been and acted as a fishery officer since 1868. His further examination upon this point was dispensed with by the admission of the fact by counsel for the plaintiff, and the statement inserted in the judge's notes, that no question was raised upon this ground. He further stated that he had received instructions what to do, and that he was to exercise magisterial powers under the Fisheries Act, and that in what he did do in the particular case, he did under instructions from the Department of Marine and Fisheries\u2014that he seized the rods for the Queen and gave them up, on condition to be returned when called for. Mr. Steadman having himself been called, said that he knew the defendant was Fishery Inspector, and that he was acting as such. He knew of the Order in Council of 1879, having seen it in the Gazette: that he was satisfied that the defendant was only doing what he was ordered to do, and that the rods were given up immediately, on the understanding that when required they should be returned.\nIn the action at suit of Hanson, it was expressly admitted that the defendant at the time of the alleged trespass was Fishery Inspector for the Province of New Brunswick, duly appointed and sworn, and had been so for some years previously; that he had received instructions from the Department of Fisheries to exercise such power and authority, and to carry out the orders of the Department, and that in the acts complained of he was acting under instructions of counsel for the Department, and under the advice of the agent of the Minister of Justice, and in the action at suit of Spurr, it was also proved that the defendant was Fishery Inspector for New Brunswick, and sworn in as such, and that he had received instructions from the Department to exercise magisterial powers within his district, which was the Province of New Brunswick, and that in doing what he did, he was acting under instructions from the Department, and in his capacity as fishery officer. The contention of the plaintiffs was, that the regulation contained in the Order in Council of the 11th June, 1879, must be construed to be limited to cases coming within the 2nd section of the Fisheries Act, namely, to places where the exclusive right of fishing does not already exist by law, and therefore that it does not apply to the plaintiffs, who were fishing upon their own lands. On the other hand, the contention urged by Mr. Burbidge, on behalf of the defendant, was that the prohibition contained in the Order in Council is not to be so limited, for that it is general in its terms and is made under the authority of the 19th section of the Act, which purports to authorize the Governor in Council to forbid fishing except under the authority of leases or licenses, and that the regulation containing such prohibition should have the same force and effect as if specially contained in the statute, notwithstanding that such regulation might extend, vary or alter any of the provisions of the Act, respecting the places or modes of fishing. This, no doubt, would raise a very important question, if the construction of the Act or its validity were now under consideration; but which of those views is correct, or what is the true construction of the Act, or whether it did or did not authorize the defendant to do the acts complained of and whether if open to the construction, that in terms it did, that part of the Act would or not be ultra vires of the Dominion Parliament, are questions upon which we are not called upon now to express, nor is it, in my opinion, proper that we should express, any opinion, as they have no bearing whatever, nor are they of any importance as regards the question which is now under consideration, namely, whether the defendant was entitled to notice of action or not.\nThat the defendant was acting in his capacity of a magistrate as Fishery Inspector of the Province of New Brunswick, and under the instructions of the Department of Marine and Fisheries, whose orders the statute directs him to obey, and that he was acting under the best legal advice, which, as an officer of the Department, he could get, namely, that of the Deputy Minister of Justice, are points which are not disputed, and these are the points upon which the question of right to notice of action depends. It is as Fishery Inspector and to enable him to discharge efficiently the duties of that office that he is made a magistrate; and all acts done by him in the character of Fishery Inspector and which might have been done by him in his character of a magistrate, acting upon view, as authorized by the statute, must be regarded as done by him in his character of a magistrate which, as being Fishery Inspector, and only as such, he is. The purpose for which notice of action is required to be given assumes that a statute, under the assumed authority of which an act is done, fails for some reason to afford complete protection to the defendant, for if it did afford such protection the statute would be a sufficient defence, but notice of action is required to be given for the purpose of giving to a defendant an opportunity to tender amends, which, of course, involves an assumption that the statute may not afford a justification of the acts complained of. A party's right to notice of action must, of course, depend upon the wording of the particular statute requiring notice to be given to him, but as a general rule, it has been long established, that where the facts are such that a party may be considered as having fair color for supposing that he is warranted by the Act of Parliament in doing that which is made the subject of the action, he is entitled to notice,\u2014that all persons who believe or suppose they are acting in pursuance of the Act of Parliament under which they profess to act are within the protection of a clause requiring notice to be given to them\u2014even though they may have acted illegally. In accordance with these principles a magistrate has been held to be entitled to notice of action for an act done by him as a magistrate, although what he did was not within the scope of his authority, and so likewise, even though he may have acted maliciously; and it has been held that if a defendant was acting as a revenue officer, or even supposed he had legal authority so to act, he was entitled to notice without proving his appointment. Bird v. Gunston[14]; Prestidge v. Woodman[15]; Daniel v. Wilson[16]; Cook v. Leonard[17]; Beachey v. Sides[18]; Hughes v. Buckland[19]; Kirby v. Simpson[20]; Wadsworth v. Murphy[21].\nNow, the provision of the New Brunswick statute, ch. 90, is, that no action shall be commenced against a justice for any official act until one month at least after notice in writing of such action served upon him, &c., &c., &c., and every such action shall be brought within six months next after the cause thereof, and the venue shall be laid and the cause tried in the county where the act was committed, and the defendant may plead the general issue and give the special matter in evidence; and if on the trial of any action the plaintiff should not prove the action brought\u2014notice thereof given within the time limited in that behalf, the cause of action stated in the notice\u2014and that it arose in the county where brought, he shall be non-suited, or the verdict may be entered for the defendant.\nThe word \"justice\" in the above Act is by the Interpretation Act, ch. 118, of the Consolidated Statutes of New Brunswick, declared to signify any justice of the peace for any city, county, or city and county.\nThat the defendant at the time of the committal by him of the alleged grievances which are the subject of these actions, was under the provisions of the Dominion Statute, 31 Vic., ch. 60, sec. 1, a justice of the peace for the county within which he was acting as Fishery Inspector, has not been disputed.\nBy the 18th section of that Act he was authorized, as such Fishery Inspector and justice of the peace to convict, on his own view, for any infraction of any of the regulations made by the Governor in Council under the Act, which regulations were, by sec. 19, given the force and effect of a statutory enactment.\nNeither can it, I think, be doubted that the defendant was acting in his official character of justice of the peace as well as of Fishery Inspector, in virtue of which office he became and was justice of the peace, and so that his acts were official acts within the provision of ch. 90 of the C. S. of N. B., and that he was acting in the belief, and, indeed (as he was acting under express instructions from the Department and under the advice of the Deputy Minister of Justice) in the reasonable belief, however mistaken that belief may have been, that the acts complained of were authorized by the Act.\nUnder these circumstances, the defendant, as it appears to me, is entitled to the benefit and protection given by chap. 90 of the Consolidated Statutes of New Brunswick. I can see no reason why a person acting as a justice of the peace under an appointment as such under the authority of a Dominion Act of Parliament, is not entitled to the benefit of the provincial statute, equally as any other justice of the peace, however appointed; and being, as I think the defendant was, entitled to a notice of action, and not having received any, the plaintiffs should have been non-suited, or verdicts should have been rendered for the defendant.\nThe defendant was also, I think, entitled to the protection intended to be given by chap. 89 of the Consolidated Statutes of New Brunswick, by which it is enacted that:\u2014\nIn any action, suit or proceeding, either at law or in equity for, or by reason, or in consequence of any matter or thing done under and according to the provisions of any Act of the Legislature of this Province, or of the Parliament of Canada, passed or to be passed, that the same was done under and according to the provisions of said Act or Acts, shall be a good defence to any such action, suit or proceeding, either at law or in equity, and the subject matter of such defence may be given in evidence under the general issue or other plea; and any justice shall be deemed to have acted within his jurisdiction for the purposes of this chapter, who acts or has acted within a jurisdiction given, or intended to be given, by any Act of the Legislature of this Province, or of the Parliament of Canada, whether within or beyond the power of such Legislature or Parliament, as the case may be.\nThe words in this statute \"under and according to the provisions of any Act,\" &c., &c., must receive the same construction as, in Hughes v. Buckland[22], was given to the words \"for the protection of persons acting in the execution of this Act, be it enacted that all actions and prosecutions to be commenced against any person for anything done in pursuance of this Act, shall,\" &c.\nIn that case the rule was held to be that a person was protected who acted bon\u00e2 fide, and in the reasonably belief that he was acting in pursuance of the Act of Parliament; that the protection was only required by him who acts illegally, but under the belief that he is right. That those words, \"anything done in pursuance of this Act,\" do not mean acts done in strict pursuance of the Act. So, likewise, as it appears to me, the words \"anything done under and according to the provisions of any Act,\" &c., &c., do not mean anything done in strict accordance with the provisions of such Act, but that in both cases the protection is extended to all who bon\u00e2 fide and reasonably believed that they were authorized to act in the character and manner in which they did act.\nHere the defendant undoubtedly, in his character of Fishery Inspector, filled the character of a justice of the peace, persons filling which character were plainly intended to be protected by the Act, and that the defendant acted as such, and in the belief that he was authorized to act as such, cannot, I think, be doubted, and as he acted under the advice of the Deputy Minister of Justice, it could not, I think, be doubted, that he bon\u00e2 fide and reasonably believed that under of the provisions of the Dominion statute and in his character of justice of peace, which, as Fishery Inspector, he was, he was authorized to do what he did do. This does not appear to have been disputed at the trial; if there had been any doubt upon that point, the question of fact should have been submitted to the jury. Upon this ground, as well as on the other point, as to the defendant's right to have had a notice of action, the defendant was, I think, entitled to have had a non-suit or a verdict for him entered. The appeals, therefore, in my opinion, should be allowed with costs, and rules absolute for non-suit be ordered to be issued from the court below, with costs.\nAppeals allowed without costs.\nSolicitors for appellants: L.

Ritchie, C.J., and Strong, Fournier, Henry and Gwynne, JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF NOVA SCOTIA.\nObstruction in navigable waters, below low water mark\u2014Nuisance\u2014Trespass.\nE. et al. brought an action of tort against W. for having pulled up piles in the harbor of Halifax below low water mark, driven in by them as supports to an extension of their wharf, built on certain land covered with water in said Harbour of Halifax, of which they had obtained a grant from the Provincial Government of Nova Scotia in August, 1861. W. pleaded, inter alia, that \"he was possessed of a wharf and premises in said harbour, in virtue of which he and his predecessors in title had enjoyed for twenty years and upwards before the action, and had now, the right of having free and uninterrupted access from and to Halifax harbour to and from the south side of said wharf, with steamers, &c., and because certain piles and timbers, placed by the plaintiffs in said waters, interfered with his rights, he (defendant) removed the same.\" At the trial there was evidence that the erections which E. et al were making for the extension of their wharf did obstruct access by steamers and other vessels to W's wharf. A verdict was rendered against W., which the full court refused to set aside. On appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada it was\nHeld\u2014(reversing the judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia) that, as the Crown could not, without legislative sanction, grant to E. et al, the right to place in said harbour below low water mark any obstruction or impediment so as to prevent the free and full enjoyment of the right of navigation, and as W. had shown special injury, he was justified in removing the piles which were the trespass complained of.\nAppeal from a decision of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, discharging with costs a rule nisi obtained by the appellant to set aside the verdict or finding of Mr. Justice Weatherbe in favor of the respondents.\nThe appellant and respondents are the owners of two wharves and water lots in the city of Halifax, that of the appellant lying immediately to the north of a public dock, and that of the respondents immediately to the south of said dock.\nThe appellant, and those under whom he claims, have, for upwards of twenty years, been in the habit of bringing vessels to the south side of his wharf adjoining the public dock, and there landing and discharging cargo.\nIn August, 1881, the respondents, who had obtained in 1861 a grant from the Provincial Government of Nova Scotia of certain land covered with water, being a part of the harbour of Halifax, extended their wharf to the northward and thereby prevented vessels and steamers from getting to the south side of appellant's wharf, as they had always done up to that period, and the appellant pulled up the piles and removed the obstructions so that the steamers could get in.\nFor this alleged trespass an action in tort was brought by the respondents against the appellant and one John F. Mitchell.\nThe declaration consisted of three counts and the defendants pleaded inter alia:\n11th. \"That at the time of the alleged trespasses defendant was possessed of a wharf and premises adjoining and to the north of said property, the owners and occupants of which had for the period of twenty years and afterwards before this action enjoyed at all times, as of right and without interruption, the easement, right and privilege of having free and uninterrupted access from and to the Halifax harbour to and from the south side of said wharf with steamers and vessels, and of mooring and fastening the same there while they took in and discharged cargoes and for other purposes; and because certain piles and timbers wrongfully obstructed and interfered with said rights and easements, defendant removed said obstructions, doing no unnecessary damage, which are the alleged trespasses.\"\nUpon the trial it was admitted that the respondents possessed the title to this property which John Esson had in his lifetime.\nThe respondents also put in evidence a grant from the Crown, dated 16th July, 1861, which was contended on the part of respondents covered the locus.\nMr. Justice Weatherbe, before whom the cause was tried, found a verdict in favor of defendant Mitchell, there being no evidence to connect him with the trespass; and the respondents acquiesced in this finding. A verdict, however, was rendered against the appellant Wood in the following terms: \"I find that the alleged trespasses were committed by the defendant Wood within the limits of the property described in the grant from the Crown to John Esson et al., dated 16th July, 1861, against whom a verdict on all the issues will be entered for $175, at which I assess the damages.\"\nA rule nisi to set aside that verdict and judgment was obtained by Wood and discharged by the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, and thereupon Wood appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nMr. Sedgewick, Q.C., and Mr. Gormully for appellant: The obstruction complained of was in the harbour of Halifax and no grant, could deprive the appellant of his right to approach by the navigable waters of the harbour a wharf of which he had a continuous user for over thirty years.\nMr. Graham, Q.C., for respondents:\nThe title of respondents to the property whereon the trespasses were committed was clearly proven upon the trial, and there is no evidence which can sustain the plea of user.\nRITCHIE, C.J.:\nThe erection which the plaintiffs allege the defendant interfered with, and which is the alleged trespass for which they seek damages, consisted of piles driven with a view to the construction of a wharf below low water mark, in the navigable waters of the harbour of Halifax, and which obstructed and prevented the defendant's vessels and steamers from navigating in that part of the said harbour and from getting to the south side of his wharf, as he had been accustomed to do, and which piles or obstructions he pulled up and removed so that his steamers could get to his wharf. There can be no doubt that all Her Majesty's liege subjects have a right to use the navigable waters of the Halifax harbour, and no person has any legal right to place in said harbour, below low water mark, any obstruction or impediment so as to prevent the free and full enjoyment of such right of navigation, and defendant, having been deprived of that right by the obstruction so placed by plaintiffs and specially damnified thereby, had a legal right to remove the said obstruction to enable him to navigate the said waters with his vessels and steamers, and bring them to his wharf. On this short ground I think the appeal should be allowed.\nIt is not pretended that plaintiffs, in placing the piles in question, were doing so under any legislative authority, which alone could justify an interference with the navigable waters of the harbour.\nSTRONG, J.:\nThe 11th plea sufficiently sets up the defence upon which, in my opinion, the appellant is entitled to have this appeal allowed. The defendant was in possession of a wharf in Halifax harbour, to which a line of steamers and other vessels were used to come.\nThe plaintiffs, in 1861, obtained a grant from the Provincial Government of Nova Scotia of certain land covered with water, being part of the harbour, and in August, 1881, they built upon this land an extension of a wharf, of which they were the proprietors, in such a way as to cause an obstruction to the passage of the vessels which had been used to resort to the defendant's wharf. The defendant pulled up the piles which had been driven as supports for this extension, so as to enable the steamers and other vessels to get in to his wharf. The court below have upheld a verdict found against him on this state of facts.\nThe defendant's possession of this wharf is prim\u00e2 facie evidence of seisin in fee, and was sufficient to enable him to justify any acts which an owner seized in fee could justify.\nThe grant to the plaintiffs by the Provincial Government, in 1861, was valid and operative to pass the title to the soil of the harbour included in the grant, but, although the grant was effectual for this purpose, and the plaintiffs had a valid title under it, that did not justify any erection upon the land granted having the effect of obstructing the navigation of the harbour.\nThe title to the soil did not authorize the plaintiffs to, extend their wharf so as to be a public nuisance, which upon the evidence, such an obstruction of the harbour amounted to, for the Crown cannot grant the right so to obstruct navigable waters; nothing short of legislative sanction can take from anything which hinders navigation the character of a nuisance[1]. That these piles did actually interfere with the approach to the defendant's wharf is proved, and this is sufficient to bring it within the case of Dimes v. Petley[2], where Lord Campbell holds that a person is not justified in abating a public nuisance of this kind, unless he can show that he is actually injured by it. Here the defendant does show special injury and, therefore, he was justified in removing the piles, which are the trespasses complained of, and the verdict should have been found for him.\nThe judgment must be reversed with costs, and the rule for a new trial made absolute with costs.\nFOURNIER, J.:\nLes parties en cette cause sont propri\u00e9taires de quais et de terrains couverts par l'eau, situ\u00e9s de chaque c\u00f4t\u00e9 d'un dock public dans la cit\u00e9 et le port d'Halifax. Le quai de l'appelant est au nord et celui de l'intim\u00e9 au sud du dock qui les s\u00e9pare\nDepuis au-del\u00e0 de vingt ans l'appelant \u00e9tait dans l'habitude d'amener des vaisseaux au c\u00f4t\u00e9 sud de son quai, adjoignant le dock public, pour les y charger et d\u00e9charger.\nDans le mois d'ao\u00fbt 1881, les intim\u00e9s firent commencer la construction d'une addition \u00e0 leur quai, du c\u00f4t\u00e9 nord donnant sur le dock d\u00e9j\u00e0 mentionn\u00e9. Cette construction ayant l'effet d'emp\u00eacher les steamers et autres vaisseaux d'arriver au c\u00f4t\u00e9 sud du quai de l'appelant, celui-ci fit enlever la partie de ces travaux qui obstruaient l'acc\u00e8s \u00e0 son quai. Telle est la cause de la pr\u00e9sente poursuite pour voie de faits (trespass).\u2014Un nomm\u00e9 J. F. Mitchell avait \u00e9t\u00e9 compris dans la poursuite.\nL'honorable juge qui a pr\u00e9sid\u00e9 au proc\u00e8s sans le concours d'un jury, a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 par son verdict que la voie de faits avait \u00e9t\u00e9 commise par l'appelant dans les limites d'une concession (grant) faite par la Couronne \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9 en 1861. Mitchell fut mis hors de cause. L'appelant a pris une r\u00e8gle nisi pour faire mettre le verdict de c\u00f4t\u00e9 pour les raisons suivantes: 1o Parce que la ligne nord de la concession (grant) faite aux intim\u00e9s n'\u00e9tait pas prouv\u00e9e, et parce qu'il n'y avait pas de preuve que l'endroit o\u00f9 la voie de fait avait \u00e9t\u00e9 commise \u00e9tait dans les limites de la concession.\n2o Parce que l'appelant avait droit \u00e0 un verdict fond\u00e9 sur le 11e plaidoyer par lequel il r\u00e9clame un droit d'usage (easement) ou servitude depuis au-del\u00e0 de vingt ans pour arriver \u00e0 son quai.\n3o Enfin, le rejet d'un plan original de record dans le bureau des terres de la Couronne.\nCette r\u00e8gle fut renvoy\u00e9e et c'est de ce jugement qu'il y a maintenant appel.\nLes questions qui se pr\u00e9sentent maintenant \u00e0 la consid\u00e9ration de cette cour, sont:\n1o Les intim\u00e9s ont-ils prouv\u00e9, par le titre qu'ils ont produit en date du 16 juillet 1861, un droit exclusif de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de l'endroit o\u00f9 la voie de fait a \u00e9t\u00e9 commise? Ce terrain est d\u00e9crit comme suit:\n\"A water lot or lot of land covered with water, situate, lying and being in the County of Halifax, bounded as follows: Beginning on the southern line of the public dock, at the eastern end of Slater street, and at the north-eastern angle of the wharf property of the said Esson, Boak & Co., at Halifax aforesaid; now running easterly by the course of said line two hundred and ten feet into the harbor, &c., &c.\"\nPar la description contenue dans le titre aussi bien que par la preuve testimoniale, il est \u00e9tabli que le lot en question est enti\u00e8rement couvert par l'eau, et se trouve situ\u00e9 m\u00eame au-dessous de la ligne de la basse mar\u00e9e, dans le port d'Halifax.\nL'honorable juge qui a pr\u00e9sid\u00e9 au proc\u00e8s a bien d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que la partie des travaux d'extension commenc\u00e9e par les Intim\u00e9s et d\u00e9molie par l'Appelant se trouvait dans les limites de leur concession, mais la question de savoir si le titre des Intim\u00e9s leur conf\u00e9rait le droit d'\u00e9lever de pareilles constructions au d\u00e9triment du public dans un endroit du port d'Halifax, toujours couvert par l'eau et servant \u00e0 la navigation ne para\u00eet pas avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9e devant lui. Le dossier ne contenant qu'un extrait du titre, il n'est gu\u00e8re possible de dire quels sont \u00e0 part du droit au sol les privil\u00e8ges conf\u00e9r\u00e9s aux Intim\u00e9s. Sont-ils autoris\u00e9s \u00e0 y faire des constructions qui puissent avoir l'effet d'obstruer la navigation? La concession leur est-elle faite, au contraire, avec la r\u00e9serve des droits du public dans les eaux navigables? On doit pr\u00e9sumer que le titre n'en fait aucune mention, car autrement les Intim\u00e9s n'eussent pas manqu\u00e9 d'all\u00e9guer des conditions qui auraient justifi\u00e9 leur droit de faire les constructions commenc\u00e9es. Il faut donc en conclure que ce titre ne leur a \u00e9t\u00e9 accord\u00e9 que sujet au droit de navigation du public, la Couronne n'ayant pas le pouvoir de les ali\u00e9ner dans les eaux navigables. En admettant m\u00eame, ce qui me para\u00eet assez douteux en point de fait, que les Intim\u00e9s n'ont pas d\u00e9pass\u00e9 la ligne sud du dock public et qu'ils se soient strictement tenus dans les limites de leur concession, leur titre leur conf\u00e9rait-il le droit d'intervenir en aucune mani\u00e8re avec les droits de navigation? Il est certain que non. De plus, ce titre ne pouvait conf\u00e9rer implicitement aux Intim\u00e9s des droits que la Couronne ne peut ali\u00e9ner. Lors m\u00eame que le titre des Intim\u00e9s leur e\u00fbt conf\u00e9r\u00e9 d'une mani\u00e8re sp\u00e9ciale le droit de faire les constructions qu'ils ont entrepris de faire, ce titre eut \u00e9t\u00e9 absolument nul, la Couronne n'ayant pas, \u00e0 moins d'une l\u00e9gislation sp\u00e9ciale, le pouvoir d'ali\u00e9ner les droits de navigation du public. On ne saurait mettre en doute ce principe trop bien \u00e9tabli par les autorit\u00e9s.\nThe right of the Crown to the soil in arms of the sea and public navigable rivers is subject to the public right of passage, and any grantee of the Crown must take subject to such right. Mayor, &c., of Colchester v. Brooke[3].\nThe public right in this respect includes all such rights as with relation to the circumstances of each river, ire necessary for the convenient passage of vessels along the channel. Ib. 26.\nThe bed of all navigable rivers where the tide flows and reflows, and of all estuaries or arms of the sea, is vested in the Crown, but subject to the right of navigation, which belongs, by law, to the subjects of the Realm, and of which the right to anchor forms a part; and every grant made by the Crown of the bed or soil of an estuary or a navigable river must be subject to such right of navigation[4].\nThe right of the public to navigate a public river is paramount to any right of property in the Crown, which never had power to grant a weir, so as to obstruct public navigation; and if a weir which was legally granted in such a river, caused obstruction at any subsequent time, it becoming a nuisance[5].\nAnd in Angell on Tidal Waters[6]:\nThe right of property in tide waters, and in the soil and shores thereof, is prim\u00e2 facie vested in the King, to a great extent, at least, as the representative of the public. To such an extent, that to the rights of navigation and fishery, he has no other claim than such he has, as protector, guardian or trustee of the common and public rights. Hence, the King has no authority, and since Magna Charta, has never had, to obstruct navigation, or to grant an exclusive right of fishing in an arm of the sea.\nThe important doctrine, that public rights, and such things as are materially dependent upon them, cannot be alienated by the Crown, seems to have been established at a very early period. The rule, as laid down by Bracton, is, that these things which relate particularly to the public good cannot be given, sold or transferred, by the King, or separated from the Crown.\nHence, the people of England are not only, prim\u00e2 facie, entitled to the use of the sea, &c., for the purposes hereafter to be considered, but their right in this respect cannot be restrained or counteracted by any royal grant, on the ground that the King is the legal and sole proprietor. In favor of this view of the subject, we have the treatise of Lord Hale, and also the opinion of one of the modern judges of the King's Bench (Mr. J. Bailey), who says, 'many of the King's rights are, to a certain extent, for the benefit of his subjects, and that is the case as to the sea, in which all his subjects have the right of navigation and of fishing, and the King can make no modern grants in abrogation of those rights.' It is unquestionably true, as regards the authority of the Crown, as was asserted by one of the learned judges in Browne vs. Kennedy, in Maryland, that the subject has, de commune jure, an interest in a navigable stream, such as a right of fishery and navigation, which cannot always be restrained by any charter or grant of the soil, or fishery since Magna Charta, at least. The King may doubtless grant the soil covered by tide water to an individual, but the right of the grantee is always subservient to the public rights above mentioned. 'The soil, says Mr. G. Best, can only be transferred, subject to this public trust, and general usage shows, that the public right has been excepted out of the grant of the soil.'\nD'apr\u00e8s ces autorit\u00e9s, il est \u00e9vident que la Couronne n'avait pas le pouvoir de conf\u00e9rer aux Intim\u00e9s le droit d'\u00e9riger dans le port d'Halifax des constructions qui pouvaient interv\u00e9nir avec la navigation. La construction commenc\u00e9e par les Intim\u00e9s, doit donc \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme une nuisance publique, si elle n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 autoris\u00e9e par la loi. Il n'en a \u00e9t\u00e9 cit\u00e9 aucune \u00e0 cet effet. En cons\u00e9quence, les Intim\u00e9s n'avaient aucun droit de porter leur pr\u00e9sente action. Ils doivent succomber \u00e0 cause de l'insuffisance de leur titre.\nL'Appelant par son 11me plaidoyer a invoqu\u00e9 un droit de servitude (easement) exerc\u00e9 depuis plus de vingt ans sur l'endroit o\u00f9 la voie de fait a \u00e9t\u00e9 commise, ainsi que dans le dock avoisinant son quai. La preuve qu'il a faite de l'examen de ce droit n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme suffisante pour le lui faire acqu\u00e9rir par prescription; mais il n'est pas n\u00e9cessaire d'entrer dans l'examen de cette question; car l'endroit o\u00f9 il exer\u00e7ait ce droit de servitude \u00e9tant un dock public, soumis au droit de navigation du public, l'Appelant n'y pouvait pas acqu\u00e9rir par prescription un droit particulier, mais il avait en commun avec le public le droit d'en faire usage pour les fins de la navigation.\nDans le but de s'assurer davantage le droit qu'il exer\u00e7ait de faire usage de ce dock pour l'exploitation de son quai, l'Appelant en obtint, le 20 novembre 1879, une concession du gouvernement de la Nouvelle-Ecosse avec la condition de n'y faire aucune construction, et avec de plus la r\u00e9serve du droit de passage en faveur des sujets de Sa Majest\u00e9. Ce dock \u00e9tant une partie du port d'Halifax, il n'appartenait qu'au gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral et non au gouvernement local d'en disposer. C'est ce que cette Cour a d\u00e9j\u00e0 d\u00e9cid\u00e9 dans la cause de Holman et Green[7]. Ainsi cette concession est nulle; et l'Appelant n'a dans ce dock que des droits qu'il partage en commun avec le public, au lieu de la servitude qu'il a invoqu\u00e9e. Toutefois cette position est suffisante pour lui donner le droit d'exiger que l'entr\u00e9e du dock, et le dock lui-m\u00eame, qui avoisine son quai soit libre de toute obstruction.\nLa preuve a \u00e9tabli que la construction commenc\u00e9e par les Intim\u00e9s et dont une partie a \u00e9t\u00e9 enlev\u00e9e par l'Appelant avait diminu\u00e9 la largeur du dock et de son entr\u00e9e. L'appelant, dans son t\u00e9moignage, dit: que des poteaux avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 pos\u00e9s \u00e0 une distance seulement de 15 \u00e0 16 pieds vis-\u00e0-vis de son quai. L'espace entre les deux quais \u00e0 la ligne de basse mar\u00e9e \u00e9tait de 22 pieds 8 pouces. Au haut des quais la distance \u00e9tait plus consid\u00e9rable, mais elle avait \u00e9t\u00e9 tellement r\u00e9duite par les nouveaux ouvrages que l'Appelant ne pouvait plus faire arriver ses b\u00e2timents \u00e0 son quai. Phalen, le locataire du quai des Intim\u00e9s dont le t\u00e9moignage ne saurait \u00eatre suspect, dit:\nSteamers that had been in the habit of coming into that dock were prevented by Mosher's work.\nMosher \u00e9tait le contracteur des travaux qui avaient l'effet d'obstruer l'entr\u00e9e du dock et d'en diminuer la largeur. Ces t\u00e9moignages ne laissent pas de doute sur le fait de l'existence d'une obstruction \u00e0 la navigation et \u00e0 l'usage du dock, causant une nuisance publique. L'Appelant ayant droit de faire usage de ce dock pour arriver \u00e0 son quai, n'avait-il pas le droit de faire dispara\u00eetre cette nuisance? C'est ce qu'il a fait dans le seul but d'exercer ses droits de navigation et en faisant le moins de dommage possible aux ouvrages des Intim\u00e9s. En cela, il n'a fait qu'exercer le droit que lui conf\u00e9rait la loi de faire dispara\u00eetre une nuisance qui faisait obstacle au passage des vaisseaux allant \u00e0 son quai. Ce principe est bien \u00e9tabli par toutes les autorit\u00e9s. Il suffit d'en citer quelques-unes:\nA fourth remedy by the mere act of the party injured, is the abatement, or removal, of nuisances. * * * * And the reason why the law allows this private and summary method of doing one's self justice, is because injuries of this kind, which obstruct or annoy such things as are of daily convenience and use, require an immediate remedy; and cannot wait for the slow progress of the ordinary forms of justice[8].\nLes constructions de l'Intim\u00e9 \u00e9taient \u00e0 n'en pas douter une nuisance:\nAll obstructions to navigation, whether by bridges, or in any other manner, without direct authority from the Legislature, are public nuisances. Lord Hale, in his treatise de Portibus Maris, notices the several nuisances which may be committed in ports as follows: Building new wharves or enhancing old; the straightening of the port by building too far into the water, &c. * * * *\nAll obstructions to navigation which are not occasioned by misfortune or inevitable accident, and without any fault on the part of the owner, and which are not authorized by the Legislature, are, of course, public nuisances, and as such, subject the authors of them to indictment. It is very well known to be settled law also, that all public nuisances are likewise liable to be abated; and the remedy by abatement is in all respects concurrent with that by indictment[9].\nTomlins' Law Dictionary\nIt is said, both of a common and private nuisance, that they may be abated, or by those who are prejudiced by them, and they need not stay to prosecute for their removal; Wood's Inst., 443; but no man can justify the doing more damage than is necessary, or removing the materials further than requisite, 1 Hawk. P. C., c. 75-76; Tha., 680[10].\nEn r\u00e9sum\u00e9, l'action des Intim\u00e9s ne peut pas \u00eatre maintenue, 1o parce que leur titre m\u00eame en supposant qu'il couvre l'endroit de la voie de fait (tresspass) ne leur a conf\u00e9r\u00e9 aucun droit de faire des constructions qui puissent intervenir avec l'exercice du droit de navigation du public, et qu'une telle concession si elle leur e\u00fbt \u00e9t\u00e9 faite, serait ill\u00e9gale. Le terrain en question \u00e9tant au-dessous de la basse mar\u00e9e, la Couronne n'a point dans ce cas, \u00e0 moins d'autorit\u00e9 l\u00e9gislative, le pouvoir d'ali\u00e9ner les droits de navigation du public. 2o Parce que la preuve a \u00e9tabli que les travaux en question \u00e9taient une obstruction qui emp\u00eachait les steamers d'arriver au quai de l'Appelant; que cette obstruction constituait une nuisance publique que dans dans les circonstances de cette cause l'Appelant avait le droit de faire dispara\u00eetre. Ces deux questions \u00e9tant r\u00e9solues en faveur de l'Appelant, il devient tout \u00e0 fait inutile de s'occuper du rejet du plan dont il se plaint dans la r\u00e8gle nisi. En cons\u00e9quence de ce qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de je suis d'avis que l'appel doit \u00eatre accord\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens.\nHENRY, J.:\nThe appellant is shown to have been, by himself and others, through whom he claims title, for over twenty years previous to the action in this case, in possession of a wharf property in the city of Halifax, Nova Scotia, which extends into the navigable waters of the harbour to which vessels, large and small, resorted to load and unload cargoes. The respondent is also shown to have title to another wharf property, situated to the south of that of the appellant and distant therefrom a sufficient distance to permit the vessels using both wharves to enter the dock between them, and lie as well on the south side of the appellant's wharf as on the north side of the respondent's.\nPrevious to the confederation of the British North American Provinces by the operation of the Imperial Act passed to effect that object, the respondent obtained a grant from the Local Government of a portion of the dock to the northward of his wharf, by which the fee simple in the land covered by the water of the dock was conveyed to him, and since the going into operation of that Act, the appellant obtained a grant of a part of the dock south of his wharf, but on condition that he should not erect any wharf or in any way interfere, by any erection on the granted land, with navigation. Disputes as to the true lines of the grants, and legal questions as to the construction of the descriptions in them existed and were considered on the trial, but it is not, in my opinion, necessary here to refer to them. The respondent, believing he was legally authorized to do so, commenced to build an extension of his wharf by causing piles to be driven in the dock on or within the northern line, as claimed by him, of the land granted to him. By the driving of the piles, and whilst they remained as driven, the dock, south of the appellant's wharf, became so narrowed and straitened that vessels could no longer enter it, or get to the south side of the appellant's wharf, as they had before done, and he caused the removal of the piles. For that act the present action was brought. Was the appellent justified in removing the piles in question as he did? He had, without doubt, the right of easement over the navigable waters of the harbour, for the ingress or egress of vessels to and from his wharf. He had no more. He could not exclude the public from the proper use of the dock for navigable purposes. From the fact that his wharf adjoined the dock, he had, however, special rights of easement, different from those of the general public, in the same way as a man residing in his house adjoining a highway, has the right of ingress and egress from and to the highway. If another should interfere with that right by an erection which deprived him of it, he would sustain special damages while others would only suffer as part of the general public, and would have to depend for redress on a prosecution against the offending party as for a public nuisance; unless, indeed, the nuisance was such as to create an impediment to the use of the highway by any one requiring such use. If a highway be fenced across and a party using it requires to go beyond the fence, he could legally remove it so as to pass through it. So with the occupier of the dwelling house\u2014he would be justified in removing the obstruction to his common law right of using the highway; and so, I think, with regard to the obstruction to the wharf of the appellant, created by the piles driven and placed by the defendant, unless, indeed, he derived title to the land in which they were driven through the grant under which he claims such title.\nThe law in England as to navigable tidal waters has been long settled; and it is not now disputed that a grant of navigable waters, particularly those used in navigation, unless authorized by an Act of Parliament, is void and conveys no right or title. A patent from the Crown, say of a navigable part of the Thames, would in England, be adjudged void. The same doctrine and principles have always been applicable to this country and are founded upon a proper appreciation of, I may say, public common law rights, which are not to be affected, except by the consent of the public, by means of parliamentary action. I am not insensible to the injury that may result from this decision of the matter before us, to many who hold valuable properties in Halifax and elsewhere, solely by the title given them by grants similar to that of the respondent, but sincerely regretting such results, I feel bound to declare the law as I consider it. Courts are only to administer the law as they find it in each case, without regard to expediency or consequences. Parliaments and Legislatures alone can change it.\nFor the reasons given, I am of opinion that the verdict and judgment below, as between the appellant and respondent, should be set aside and reversed, and a new trial granted, with the costs of the appeal to this court to the appellant.\nGWYNNE, J.:\nThis action is one in tort brought against the above appellant and one Mitchell. At the trial which took place before a judge without a jury, a verdict was rendered in favor of the defendant Mitchell and against the defendant Wood; a rule nisi to set aside that verdict and judgment against the defendant Wood having been obtained by him and discharged by the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, this appeal is from the rule and judgment of that court discharging the rule nisi.\nOne of the grounds stated in the rule nisi as entitling him to have the said verdict against him set aside and a new trial granted, was that he was entitled to a verdict under his eleventh plea, on the evidence given at the trial. Wood had pleaded to the action separately from the defendant Mitchell. The declaration consists of three counts.\nIn my opinion, the case may be disposed of wholly upon the defendant Wood's eleventh plea, which is pleaded to all the counts of the declaration, as well to the first, which is framed in trover, as to the other two counts, which are quite inappropriate, as it seems to me, to the facts appearing in the case. The short material substance of the eleventh plea, which, as I have said, is pleaded to all the counts of the declaration, is that the defendant Wood was possessed of a wharf and premises situate in the harbour of Halifax, in virtue of which he and his predecessors in title had enjoyed for 20 years and upwards before this action, and had the right of having free and uninterrupted access from and to Halifax harbour, to and from the south side of said wharf with steamers and vessels, and of mooring and fastening the same while they took in and discharged cargoes, and for other purposes; and because certain piles and timbers placed by the plaintiffs in the waters of the harbor wrongfully obstructed and interfered with said rights, the defendant removed said obstructions, doing no unnecessary damage in that behalf, which are the alleged trespasses. Issue having been joined on this plea as the only answer offered thereto, the only question which arises thereunder was one of fact, namely, was it proved; for if it was, then the plea showed a justification in law of the alleged wrongs complained of by the plaintiffs.\nThat it was proved appears very clear, and it is not disputed that the defendant Wood, the now appellant, was possessed of a wharf as the plea alleges, which wharf is situate in the harbour of Halifax, adjoining a wharf of which the plaintiffs were possessed, and that the plaintiffs, by certain erections which they were causing to be erected for the extension of their wharf out further into the harbour in the navigable waters thereof, over which steamers and vessels navigating the harbor to and from the defendant's wharf were accustomed to pass, did in a very material manner obstruct access to the defendant's wharf, by driving down piles in the navigable waters of the harbour, in such a manner as to do special damage and injury to the defendant, by interfering with and preventing the access to his wharf, over the navigable waters of the harbour, which he was entitled to have and enjoy. That under these circumstances the defendant had a right to do the acts relied upon in his 11th plea as justification of the acts complained of by the plaintiffs in their declaration, cannot, I think, admit of a doubt. This appeal, therefore, in my opinion, must be allowed with costs, and it is not necessary to express any opinion upon the other matters which were discussed, and a rule absolute for a new trial, with costs, to be paid to the defendant Wood, should be ordered to issue in the court below, such new trial to be between the plaintiffs and Wood alone; the verdict in favor of the defendant Mitchell not being interfered with thereby.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for appellant: L.

Ritchie, Knt., C.J., and Strong, Fournier, Henry and Gwynne, JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF NOVA SCOTIA.\nMarine Insurance\u2014Total or constructive total loss, what constitutes\u2014Notice of abandonment not accepted by underwriters\u2014Right to abandon\u2014Sale by master.\nC., as assignee of W., was insured upon the schooner Janie R., to the amount of $2,000 by a voyage policy.\nOn the 14th February, 1879, the Janie R., which had been in the harbor of Shelburne since the 7th of February, left with a cargo of potatoes to pursue the voyage described in the policy, but was forced by stress of weather to put back to Shelburne, and on the morning of the 15th she went ashore, when the tide was about at its height. On the 17th notice of abandonment was given to the defendants (appellants) and not accepted, and on the 18th the master, after survey, sold her. The next day the purchaser, without much difficulty, with the assistance of an American vessel that was in the harbor, and by the use of casks for floating her (appliances which the master did not avail himself of), got her off. There was no evidence whatever of the vessel having been so wrecked as to have been worthless to repair, or to have been so much damaged that she would not have been worth, after having been repaired, more than the money expended for that purpose. The vessel afterwards made several voyages, and was sold by the purchasers for $1,560. In an action brought on the policy against the defendant company, tried before a judge without a jury, a verdict was given in favor of plaintiff for $1,913, which verdict was sustained by the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia. On appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada\u2014\nHeld (reversing the judgment of the courts below), 1. That the sale by the master was not justified in the absence of all evidence to show any \"stringent necessity\" for the sale after the failure of all available means to rescue the vessel.\n2. That the undisputed facts disclosed no evidence whatever of an actual total loss and did not constitute what in law could be pronounced either an absolute or a constructive total loss. Per Strong, J., That the right to abandon must be tested by the condition of the vessel at the time of action brought, and not by that which existed when notice of abandonment was given.\nAppeal from a judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia discharging a rule nisi to set aside a verdict in favor of the respondent.\nThis was an action brought on a policy of insurance issued by defendants for $2,000 upon the hull and materials of the schooner Janie R., to the plaintiff, a mortgagee of the vessel.\nThe action was tried before McDonald, J., without a jury, and a verdict was given by him in favor of the plaintiff for eighteen hundred and forty dollars, together with seventy-three dollars and sixty cents damages in the nature of interest.\nA rule nisi obtained by the defendants to set aside this verdict, was, after argument before the Supreme Court, by the judgment of the court delivered by Weatherbe, J., discharged with costs.\nThe declaration contained two counts upon a policy of insurance for $2,000 issued by defendants under seal to the plaintiff, upon the schooner Janie R. on a voyage at and from Liverpool to Boston returning either to Liverpool or Halifax, and claimed for a total loss.\nThe defences pleaded were:\n1st. That defendants did not subscribe said policy, or undertake and promise as alleged.\n2nd. A denial of the allegation averring interest in plaintiff's assignors, Rhynard and Lohnes. or some or one of them.\n3rd. That the vessel was not lost by the perils insured against or any of them.\n4th. That after the commencement of the risk and before said loss, said vessel, without sufficient cause or excuse, did not proceed on said voyage, and deviated therefrom.\nIt appeared in evidence at the trial that the Janie R. sailed from Liverpool, on the voyage described in the policy on the 5th of February, 1879, with a cargo of potatoes, and owing to bad weather put into Shelburne harbour on the night of the 7th, where she was compelled by adverse winds and bad weather to remain until the 14th, when she left to pursue her voyage. During the night of the 14th she was forced by stress of weather to put back to Shelburne. When approaching that harbour on the morning of Saturday the 15th, part of her steering gear was carried away, she was so iced her anchor would not drop, and she drove ashore with considerable force, the wind being high, at about high water, and was driven up some distance and lay between two rocks The place where she struck was open and exposed to the ocean, and the shore under and around her was rocky and dangerous. Part of her cargo was taken out, and some unsuccessful attempts were made to get her off.\nSome portion of the cargo was carried ashore in bags by men employed by the master. No attempt was made to float the vessel, either with casks, which were eventually used for that purpose by the purchaser with success, nor were other appliances, spoken of by the witnesses, and which could have been procured at Shelburne where there are ship yards, used or even procured. Nothing having been done towards saving the vessel, except hauling on the anchor with the windlass at high tide, the master on Tuesday the 18th sold the vessel as she lay, for something over $100, and she was got off by the purchaser the next day without much difficulty with the assistance of an American vessel and by the use of casks for floating her. It appears from the evidence of McAlpin, a witness for plaintiff, that a vessel was in the harbour, in open water, on Saturday, the day the Janie R. went ashore; whether this was the American vessel which afterwards hauled her off does not appear, but no attempt by the master to obtain the assistance of this vessel spoken of by McAlpin is proved. The vessel was valued in the policy at $5,000.\nNotice of abandonment was given by the plaintiff, with whom the master had communicated by telegraph to the agent of the underwriters in Halifax, on the afternoon or evening of the 17th.\nUpon the trial the policy was admitted without objection, and the interest was proven as averred.\nThe only question raised upon the argument here and in the court below was whether or not the respondent, under the facts in proof, could recover for a total loss. Mr. Graham, Q.C., for appellants, and Mr. Lash, Q.C., and Mr. Gormully for respondent.\nThe arguments and cases cited appear in the judgments.\nRITCHIE, C.J.:\u2014\nThis is an action on a marine policy on the Janie R., which sailed from Liverpool on February 5, 1879, with a cargo of potatoes bound for Boston. On the morning of the 15th she got ashore at the entrance of Shelburne harbour, having been in the harbour since 7th February. Monday, the 17th, notice of abandonment was given to the defendants and not accepted, and on the 18th the master sold her, her owner being present in Shelburne.\nThis question is as much as possible like that involved in the case of Taylor v. Gallagher[1], which we decided in this court, and in which case we held that the evidence did not establish that urgent necessity for the sale which alone can justify a sale by the master, so as to subject the insurers to liability as for a total loss. In this case I think there is nothing whatever to justify a sale by the master under the circumstances detailed in evidence.\nThe captain says that on the morning of the 15th they went ashore. Then, without apparently making the slightest effort to get the vessel off, or any investigation as to her exact position or condition on the shore, or any enquiries, or seeking any assistance in the neighbourhood, he leaves the vessel at daylight, and says he got to Shelburne town, about eight miles, in the morning. When there, he does not appear to have made any enquiries as to the possibility of getting assistance to get the vessel off, but his sole enquiries appear to have been as to getting a survey, and in this view, and this alone, he seems to have visited Shelburne town. This is all the account he gives of this mission, \"Left at daylight and returned with two surveyors about noon. Captain Purvey and Mr. McAlpin were the two.\" The other surveyor, he says, was Captain Dall, who resided near the vessel, and they surveyed her. Having accomplished this he appears for the first time to have turned his attention to getting the vessel off, and this is his account:\nAfter we got back, we put out an anchor astern and tried to heave the vessel off. We carried the anchor out about fifty fathoms. The tide was about half high when we put it out, and we hove on by the windlass when the tide was high. Eight or ten hands hove-on but they did not affect her.\nHe says he communicated with the owners in Liverpool and the plaintiff by telegram before he sold. But he thought the first thing to be done was to get surveyors. Another witness\u2014Mr. McAlpin, one of the surveyors\u2014says:\nThe weather was then comparatively smooth. The wind W.N.W., and we had hopes of getting her off. On the next day we returned about 3 p.m. The tide well up. I think it was rising. I remained there a short time. Saw no efforts made.\nNow, it appears that this vessel was condemned on Monday and sold on Tuesday, and a day or two after, she was got off and repaired, and became a seaworthy vessel sailing as she had done before. She was got off by means of a vessel attached to her, and hauled her off. This witness says he saw a vessel there but did not know her. There was a vessel there which could have taken her off on Saturday, but the captain does not appear to have made the least effort to obtain its assistance. He has to admit that on Saturday it might have been prudent to get the potatoes out first before going to Shelburne. Then he shows what would have been the most natural thing to do\u2014the vessel being on shore, to lighten her. \"If, he says, she had been my vessel, and not insured, I think that would have been my course.\" We have the evidence of this man, who acted as a surveyor, testifying that the course the captain adopted was not the course he should have adopted. \"I am not prepared to say she could not be repaired, at low water, enough to pump out the water,\" and yet he was prepared to condemn her. Common sense points out that unless there was a determination to condemn the vessel, that was the proper course to be adopted, viz:\u2014to examine the vessel, to see whether there were any leaks, and to what extent, to lighten her to repair her, and to use every exertion to get her off. Then he adds:\nI think she could have been repaired for $500, perhaps for $300. I am not prepared to say what I would have done on Sunday, but on Monday we made our report.\nThis is, to my mind, conclusive that the surveyors came to a conclusion before any proper examination was made.\nJohn Purvey, in his evidence, says: \"She was not not making water then.\" As it appears that, after this party went there, she was not making water, how important was it that the cargo should have been got out at the earliest possible period, and this witness will not say she could not have been got off. The witness goes on to say: \"There was an American schooner inside of the point.\" This is another important point, because the vessel was got off by this American vessel. So that at the very time the vessel was sold, there were means at hands to get her off, had the captain chosen to avail himself of them.\nWas it ever heard that under such circumstances, a captain was justified in selling a vessel on shore without making any effort whatever to get her off? I think this is as strong a case as Taylor v. Gallagher, decided in this court[2]. I think the sale was not justified. Under the circumstances, a prudent owner uninsured would have done exactly what the owner under the sale did, viz, would have resorted to the ship yards and got his appliances there, would have put them to the vessel and accomplished what was accomplished, and in one hour she would have been taken off and saved. Under these circumstances, I think there was nothing to justify the sale. After the sale she was repaired, and she became a vessel that went on her way, pursuing her course as an insurable vessel, made several voyages and was finally sold. The utmost extent of the cost of repairing her was $500, the extreme extent of the loss was $300, which deducted from the $1,600 for which she was sold, left $800 of value in the vessel. Besides that, she was much older when she was sold. There must be a most stringent necessity to justify a captain in selling a vessel, and I think that it should not be tolerated that a sale should be made hastily without examination or without the captain having previously made every exertion in his power to get off his vessel.\nUnder these circumstances I think the appeal must be allowed.\nSTRONG, J.:\nThe first question which arises is, was there a constructive total loss\u2014such a loss as justified an abandonment to the underwriters? For two reasons it appears that this must be answered in the negative. First, it is clear that there is no right in a case of stranding to abandon to the underwriters until all reasonable means within his power have been used by the master for the recovery of the vessel. In Parsons on Insurance[3], the rule in this respect is thus stated:\nIt is quite certain, however, that neither stranding nor submerging, nor any loss that leaves the probability of recovery, gives of itself at once and necessarily the right to abandon, for it is the duty of the master to examine sedulously and use to the best of his skill and power all means for recovery; and there is no right to abandon until these means are used, or until it is obvious, from the nature of the loss or the circumstances attending it, that there is but little, if any, hope of success.\nCan it be said that the master, in the present case complied with these essential requirements before the notice of abandonment was given? I am of opinion that it cannot. The evidence of Harlon, one of the plaintiff's witnesses, and of Captain McLean, a witness for the defendant, and the undisputed facts, show very conclusively that the course which ought obviously to have been adopted was not followed. In the first place, the master seems to have been more intent on saving the cargo than the vessel. Instead of landing the cargo by the slow process of carrying it ashore in bags, he ought, having regard to the comparative value of the vessel and the cargo, to have lightened the vessel by throwing overboard such portion of the cargo as he could not expeditiously save. Then he ought to have had recourse to the use of the devices mentioned in the evidence, and which were afterwards successfully used, of floating the vessel with casks, and if this, too, failed, he might have used the \"Sampson Posts\" spoken of by the witnesses. All these appliances could have been got either on the spot or at Shelburne, and were therefore within his reach. Had all this been done, as with reasonable and proper energy it might have been, on the Saturday, there could have been at least four opportunities of endeavouring to float the vessel, by hauling her off with the anchor and cable at high tide, between Saturday and the sale on Tuesday. Then, too, it does not appear that the assistance of the American vessel, which afterwards hauled the schooner off, was asked and that if it had been asked it could not have been procured. In the face of these undisputed facts it is impossible to say that all the conditions which are essential to a right to abandon the vessel to the underwriters were complied with. It is out of the question to say, in the face of the evidence of Harlon, the purchaser, and one of the plaintiffs own witnesses, that the vessel as she lay on the rocks was such a wreck as not to be worth repairing if she was got off. At all events, it was for the plaintiff to prove this, if he could establish it, but there is no evidence whatever of the vessel having been so wrecked as to have been worthless to repair, or to have been so much damaged that she would not have been worth, after being repaired, more than the money expended for that purpose. It would be sufficient to say that it was for the plaintiff to prove this, and that he has not done so, but, from the evidence of Harlon, the contrary is a fair inference, though he does not give the total cost of repair, for, he says, the purchasers sold her, after repairing and coppering her, for $1,560\u2014the coppering having cost $250; the cost of the repairs, he does not give, but he says this price was obtained after the purchasers had made use of her in several voyages, one a fishing trip, and then a voyage to the West Indies. Then McAlpine, one of the persons who held a survey of the vessel, and a witness for the plaintiff, who is a ship-builder, says he will not swear she could not be repaired for $300. It is therefore, in my opinion, fully established that the underwriters are not liable as for a constructive total loss.\nNext, another and independent ground for coming to the same conclusion, is invoked in the appellant's factum, and was also urged in the argument at the bar. It is said that the rule of English law, differing in this respect from that which prevails in the American courts, and is established by the Codes of Continental Europe, is that the right to abandon must be tested by the condition of the vessel at the time of action brought, and not by that which existed when notice of abandonment was given. This contention seems to be well founded.\nLord Blackburn, in his opinion in the case of Shepherd v. Henderson[4], states this rule very decisively. He says:\nThere is considerable difference between the law of England and the law of some foreign countries, France in particular. In the law of England, where notice of abandonment is given and the circumstances are such that the man may reasonably give it, but the underwriter refuses to take it and afterwards an action commences, if in the interim that which the man who gave the notice of abandonment reasonably and properly believed to be a total loss turns out to be not a total loss, it cannot be held that it is. For instance, if a ship has actually been captured and is apparently going off into the enemy's hands, and thereupon notice of abandonment is given; it is perfectly good as matters then stand. But an English frigate meets the ship and re-captures her and brings her back before action is brought, then you must take it that it is not a case of constructive total loss in law at the time when the action is brought; and, as Lord Mansfield said long before, in Hamilton v. Mendes[5], it is a rule of the law of insurance in England that where a thing is safe in fact, no artificial reasoning should be permitted to say that it is not.\nThe same judge in Rankin v. Potter[6], lays down the same rule in even clearer terms, thus:\nEven in the case when the loss is at the time of the notice of abandonment total, though capable of being reduced by a change of circumstances to a partial loss, the assured (unless in the very uncommon case of the notice being accepted) cannot recover as for a total loss, if that change of circumstances does occur before the trial.\nIn Arnold on Insurance[7] the law is stated to the same effect, as follows:\nIn this country an abandonment is not indefeasible until action brought. Till that event, therefore, the loss though at one time total is liable to be reduced to a partial loss, by the restitution of the property under such circumstances, in this country, that the assured may, if he pleases, have possession and may reasonably be expected to take it.\nMr. Parsons in his work[8] recognises the existence of this rule in English law, but points out that the American courts hold that the abandonment, if good at the time notice is given, is indefeasible.\nThe same principle of insurance law was also recognized by the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia in the case of Kenny v. Halifax Marine Insurance Co[9], but I confess I cannot understand its applicability to the facts in that case, since the notice of abandonment was there accepted by the underwriters, which, of course, operated as an immediate cession of the property to them, and as Lord Blackburn says, in the quotation already given, made the abandonment at once indefeasible.\nIf it be said that this rule only applies when the assured can get the vessel back, and that here he could not, as his right to do so was intercepted by the sale, the answer is plainly that there was no valid sale, and the plaintiff's rights as mortgagee have never been divested unless he has lost them by his acquiescence in the sale. That the sale was an unauthorized one is plain when we apply the law to the state of facts disclosed by the evidence already remarked upon in connection with the point regarding the right to abandon. The master has no authority to sell so as to bind the absent owner, (and of course an absent mortgagee must stand in precisely the same position as a quasi owner,) unless compelled to do so by \"stringent necessity.\" That this is the law, the recent cases of Cobequid Marine Ins. Co. v. Barteaux[10]; Hall v. Jupe[11]; and Taylor v. Gallagher[12], establish beyond doubt or question. It is not sufficient to show that the sale was made in good faith, and that the master acted as a prudent owner would have done. The law is now conclusively settled, that nothing but the most urgent necessity, after the failure of all available means to rescue the vessel, will justify him in so acting; if he sells under any other condition, the sale is unauthorized, and nothing passes by it. In the present case, it is true, the owner, the mortgagor, seems to have been on the spot, but, even if he concurred in the sale, which is not proved, but which may, perhaps, be inferred, that can make no difference, for he certainly had no authority to bind either the plaintiff, as mortgagee, or the underwriters. Again, it would seem that the master had no authority to sell so as to bind either the plaintiff or the underwriters without first communicating with them. He must have known that the plaintiff was interested in the vessel, as he communicated with him by telegraph, and the owner was at hand to inform both as to the interest of the plaintiff, and also of the fact of the insurance, and who the underwriters were, and how they could be communicated with. In such cases it seems that the master has no more power to sell, so as to affect the rights of absent parties, than he has to sell in the absence of the owner without first communicating with him, if the means of communication are at hand, as they were here by the telegraph[13].\nIt is apparent, therefore, that there was no valid sale, and consequently the rights of the plaintiff as mortgagee were entirely unaffected by the unauthorised disposition of the vessel which the master assumed to make, and he was as free to enforce his rights as mortgagee against the vessel after she was taken off the rocks as he was before the stranding occurred. There was nothing, therefore, to prevent the operation of the rule, that the restoration of the vessel before action brought does away with the effect of the notice of abandonment and makes a recovery for a total loss impossible. There are doubtless numerous cases, from among which Cambridge v. Anderton[14] may be selected as an example in which the insured has recovered for a total loss, although the vessel has been sold and afterwards got off and repaired. But such are all cases in which the sale was a valid one within the rule which requires a case of \"stringent necessity\" to authorise the master to take such a step.\nA sale by itself is not a loss covered by a policy of marine insurance, it is not a peril insured against; what constitutes the loss in such a case is the state of things which can alone authorise the master to sell. In Gardner v. Salvador[15], Mr. Justice Bayley says:\nThere is no such head in insurance as loss by sale.\nIn Rankin v. Potter[16] the law is there laid down by Mr. Justice Blackburn:\nAs has been often observed, a sale by the master is not one of the underwriter's perils, and is only material as shewing that there is no longer anything to be done to save the thing sold for whom it may concern.\nTo these authorities may be added Lord Campbell to the same effect in the following passage from his judgment in Knight v. Faith[17]:\nThere is no such loss in insurance law as a sale by the master, unless it be barratrous, and a bon\u00e2 fide sale by the master can only affect the insurers when it becomes necessary by prior damage arising from a peril for which they were answerable.\nThe question of the validity of a sale by the master will be found to have arisen in actions against underwriters in connection with the important question, upon which the opinions of courts and judges have so much differed, whether a sale relieves the insured from the obligation of giving notice of abandonment and entitles him to claim for an actual total loss\u2014a question which seemed to have been set at rest by the decision in Rankin v. Potter[18], which, following Roux v. Salvador[19], and Farnworth v. Hyde[20], determined against the opinion of Lord Campbell, that the assured was not bound to give notice when there had been a \"right sale,\" and consequently nothing left to be abandoned to the underwriters.\nBoth counts in the declaration are in form for a total loss, but under a declaration so framed there may be a recovery for a partial loss[21], and this it appears the plaintiff is entitled to proceed for in the present case.\nThe judgment of the court below discharging the rule for a new trial must be reversed, and the rule for a new trial made absolute with costs to the appellant in both courts.\nFOURNIER, J., concurred.\nHENRY, J.:\nThe plaintiff must recover either for an actual total, or a constructive total, loss. There is no evidence whatever of an actual total loss, so we must look at the law and the facts, and see if he has made out a case for a constructive total loss. Mere notice of abandonment amounts to very little, unless the circumstances existing at the time and afterwards, affirm the right of the party to make the abandonment. A mere sale does not convey the property unless the party had a right to make it. The captain is the agent of all parties where the owner is absent, but in this case he was present, and we may dismiss from our minds the law or facts of the sale by the captain as agent, and speak of the sale as having been made by the owner. Can the owner of an insured ship, by giving notice of abandonment, part with the property to another, and then afterwards say: I cannot abandon to you, because I have sold. That would be no excuse in law. He could not first do the act and then plead that act as an impediment in his way to do something else. If there is any difficulty in the position of the owner, he created it himself by the sale. The law is very clear on the question of a constructive total loss. The English authorities lay down the rule that a party cannot recover for a constructive total loss after an abandonment, unless he shows the repairs would cost as much or more than the ship was worth. That is a necessity at the beginning of his right to recover. In this case, then, the plaintiff was bound to show that this was the fact. The evidence, on the contrary, shows that it was not the fact. In order to prove that case, he should have given evidence what the value of the repairs would have been, and, to do so, he should have had a proper survey. As the vessel was got off and repaired, it was competent for him to prove, if the circumstances would justify his doing so, that the vessel would not be worth the amount of the cost of the repairs. This vessel was repaired on the spot, in the harbour. She was in the harbor when she was sold. There is no evidence of sufficient justification to the captain to sell on the ground that the vessel was likely to go to pieces. She was in the harbor, and, although it was possible she might have been more injured by a storm, there is nothing to show she would have been totally destroyed if she had remained there all the winter. But the plaintiff ought to have given evidence of what the cost of the repairs would be, and of the value of the vessel after she was repaired, and, if the one amounted to as much as the other, he would have been entitled to demand for a constructive total loss. That he has not done. At the time this action was brought, that vessel was floating as seaworthy, and it could not be said there was a constructive total loss unless the amount expended was as much as she was afterwards worth. Under these circumstances, without going into other matters, I think the parties have totally failed to establish a constructive total loss, and have therefore not made out the case which the law requires them to make out. I think, therefore, the judgment below should be reversed, and a new trial ordered.\nGWYNNE, J.:\nThe question presented by this case does not appear to me to differ in substance from that which came before us in Gallagher v. Taylor; namely, had the master done everything that it was his duty to do before selling, and was there that urgent necessity to sell which alone could make a sale justifiable; for although notice of abandonment was given in this case the evening before the sale, whereas no such notice was given in Gallagher v. Taylor, still notice of abandonment will not of itself justify a sale or entitle the insured to recover as for a total loss, unless those events have occurred which justify the notice being given; that is to say, which entitle the assured in point of law to abandon to the insurer the thing insured, and to subrogate the insurer in the place of the assured as to all the latter's rights of property in the thing insured. The question here then is, did those events occur? The plaintiff, who was insured upon a schooner to the amount of $2,000 by a voyage policy, claims to recover as for a total loss. The vessel ran ashore upon the morning of Saturday, the 15th February, 1879, when the tide was about at its height within the harbour of Shelburne, on the coast of Nova Scotia, within eight miles of a town of the same name, which is a shipbuilding place. Notice of abandonment was given to the insurers on the evening of Monday, the 17th February, and the vessel was sold by the master at noon of the following day, the insurers having in the interim declined to accept abandonment.\nThe learned judge before whom the case was tried, without a jury, rendered a verdict for the plaintiff for $1,840, being the full amount of the policy less $160, apparently allowed for salvage money arising from the sale of the vessel, to which he added $73.60 for interest from the commencement of the action, making in all $1,913.60. What was the opinion of the learned judge upon the law or the evidence, we have no means of knowing otherwise than by inference from the fact that he has rendered a verdict for the plaintiff for the full amount of the policy. Looking at the evidence as given on both sides there is a conflict upon some points; but looking only at that portion as to which there does not seem to be any conflict, I do not see how we can avoid sending the case back for a new trial with a declaration that the undisputed facts disclosed do not constitute what in law can be pronounced to be either an absolute or a constructive total loss.\nAn absolute total loss entitles the assured to claim the whole amount. A constructive total loss gives him the like right upon condition only of his giving such notice. Absolute total loss occurs only when in the progress of the voyage, the vessel becomes totally destroyed or annihilated, or placed, by reason of the perils against which the underwriter insures, in such a position, that it is wholly out of the power of the assured, or of the underwriter, to extricate her from her peril, or that she was in such imminent danger of destruction that a sale appeared to afford the only reasonable hope of saving any part of her value. Roux v. Salvador[22], Farnworth v. Hyde[23]. Constructive total loss occurs when, by some of the perils insured against, the vessel has become of so little value, that a prudent owner uninsured, would decline any further expense in putting the vessel in a state of repair to pursue her voyage; and if the expense of repairing her, so as to pursue her voyage, be greater than the value of the vessel when repaired, he is justified in declining to incur that expense, and he is allowed to abandon her and to treat the loss as total[24].\nNow, that the vessel in this case was not an absolute total loss, in the sense of having been annihilated, or placed in such a position that it was wholly out of the power of the assured, or of the underwriter, to extricate her from her peril, so as to undergo such necessary repairs as might enable her to pursue her voyage, appears from the fact that when means calculated to get her off were applied by the purchasers she was apparently easily extricated from her peril, and was repaired. It remains, therefore, to consider whether she was in such imminent danger of destruction that a sale appeared to afford the only reasonable hope of saving any part of her value; or, whether the expense of repairing her was such (compared with her value when repaired), as to have justified a prudent owner, uninsured, to decline to incur any further expense upon her. As to the former of these questions the same point arises as arose in Galagher v. Taylor, namely, was there that urgent necessity for a sale, after the fruitless application by the master of every possible means at his disposal for extricating her, which alone would justify him in selling her? Upon the undisputed evidence the facts may be stated to be, that the vessel having run ashore about full tide upon the morning of Saturday, the 15th February, 1879, the master did not then make any efforts whatever to get the vessel off with the tide; that although there was at the time an Italian bark close by in the harbor of Shelburne, where the vessel was ashore, he made no application to her for assistance, but, without giving any orders to lighten the vessel, or to attempt to get her off, in his absence, he went straightway to the town of Shelburne, a ship-building place only eight miles off, not for the purpose of getting any assistance or appliances to get the vessel off, but to get surveyors to come down with the apparent intention of having her condemned. During Saturday, Sunday and Monday, the only efforts made to get the vessel off consisted in hauling upon one anchor thrown out some distance astern, although the master must have known that as the vessel went ashore at high tide, she could not have been so hauled off without lightening her. Instead of lightening her at once by throwing overboard her cargo, which consisted of potatoes loose in the hold, Saturday, Sunday and Monday were employed in saving the cargo by putting the potatoes into bags, carrying them ashore and safely housing them, and on Tuesday, before the sale, the balance of the potatoes remaining in the hold was sold to one Goodrich, who was allowed twelve hours to remove them, and the purchasers of the vessel afterwards were obliged to pay Goodrich for the privilege of throwing the potatoes overboard in order to lighten the vessel so as to haul her off. Although there was an American vessel on Saturday in the harbour in open water as well as the Italian barque, neither the one or the other was applied to for any assistance to get the vessel off. The surveyors, who were brought down on Saturday, condemned the vessel upon Monday by a report which was not produced, but on Sunday, as one of them swore, they concluded to order a sale, although, as that same witness said, they made no examination of the vessel on the Sunday, and could not see the extent of the damage, and that he was not prepared to say that she could not have been repaired at low water enough to pump out the water. The master's efforts, therefore, appear to have been directed rather to saving the cargo, than by throwing it out\u2014as might have been done, overboard at once\u2014to lighten the vessel and save her.\nThe vessel was sold on Tuesday, and one of the surveyors who had condemned her was himself either one of the purchasers, or was employed by the purchasers to get her off, and did succeed in so doing.\nOn Tuesday, as appears by the evidence of Mr. Purvey, one of the surveyors, the purchasers got an American schooner to go down, but she put back without doing anything that day. Hart, another witness called by the plaintiff, says that on Wednesday the purchasers had the American vessel there, and that it was no more stormy on Tuesday than it was on Wednesday, when the American schooner got into position.\nMr. Harlon, one of the purchasers, says that they got her off with the aid of the American vessel and water casks the next night after they bought her. They lost, he says, the first tide after they bought her; it was during the evening tide of the day after they bought her that they got her off. There was no evidence whatever offered to shew why the cargo was not thrown overboard and the vessel lightened on the Saturday, nor why the master did not apply to one or other of the vessels in the harbor for assistance; nor was there any reason to suppose that if the vessel had been lightened at once upon the Saturday she might not have been gotten off as readily on the Saturday, or the Sunday or the Monday before the surveyors signed their report, if the same means had been used as were subsequently used by the purchasers, and by one of the surveyors who condemned the vessel, or that the master could not have made use of the like means. If, therefore, this case depended upon the validity of the sale in the absence of a notice of abandonment, it must needs be governed by Gallagher v. Taylor, and the sale must be held to have been invalid by reason of the absence of all evidence to shew any urgent necessity for the sale, or that the master had exhausted, as was his duty all the means within his power of extricating the vessel and so that there was no absolute total loss. Can then the giving notice of abandonment in this case make any difference? Clearly not for\u20141st. There was no evidence whatever offered as to what was the extent of the damage done, or what the cost of such repairs as would have enabled the vessel to pursue her voyage, or what the value of the vessel when so repaired as compared with the cost of such repairs, so that there cannot be said to have been offered any evidence to establish a constructive total loss; and 2nd. Upon the vessel running ashore it was the duty of the master to use all the means in his power to extricate her from her peril, whether an actual or constructive total loss was relied upon, and if he fails to do so, as the notice of abandoment is of no avail unless the events happen which entitle an assured to abandon, he must fail upon a claim for constructive, equally as upon one for absolute total loss. The case then is resolved into this:\n1st. Here the evidence shews there was no absolute total loss.\n2nd. It shews also that the master did not make use of all the means within his power to extricate the vessel from her peril, and so that he neglected a duty incumbent upon him to discharge before the assured could abandon and subrogate the insurers into his place. 3rd. There was no evidence offered of any constructive total loss.\n4th. The plaintiff therefore was not entitled to recover, except for a partial loss, as to which he made no claim, and if he had, he failed to offer the necessary evidence in support of it.\nIt is said, however, that the plaintiff's right to recover depends on questions of fact, and that the verdict of the learned judge who tried the case without a jury, being in favor of the plaintiff must be taken as having found all the necessary facts in his favor equally as if a jury had rendered the verdict. If the case had been tried by a jury, it must have been left to them with such a direction that it should appear whether they should intend, by their verdict, if in favor of the plaintiff, to find as upon an absolute or constructive total loss, or for partial loss only. If they had found as for an absolute total loss, their verdict must have been set aside as wholly contrary to law and evidence, for the undisputed evidence sufficiently shows that there was no such loss. If they had found as upon a constructive total loss, their verdict must equally have been set aside for the reasons I have already above given.\nThe verdict of the learned judge must be set aside for the like reasons, whether he proceeded as upon an absolute or a constructive total loss.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for appellants: Hugh McD.

Ritchie, C.J., and Strong, Fournier, Henry and Gwynne, JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM PLAMONDON, J., SITTING FOR THE TRIAL OF THE MEGANTIC CONTROVERTED ELECTION CASE.\nAt the trial of the petition, the returning officer, who was also the registrar of the county of Megantic, and secretary of the municipality of Inverness, was called as a witness, and produced in court in his official capacity the original list of electors for the township of Inverness, and provedthat the name L. McM., one of the petitioners whom he personally knew, was on the list. The original document was retained by the witness, and, as neither of the parties requested that the list should be filed, the judge made no order to that effect. The status of the other petitioners was proved in the same way.\nHeld, that there was sufficient evidence that the petitioners were persons who had a right to vote at the election to which the petition related under 37 Vic, ch. 10, sec. 7 (D).\nThe shorthand notes of the shorthand writer employed by the court to take down the evidence were not extended in his hand-writing, but were signed by him.\nHeld that the notes of evidence could not be objected to.\nBefore setting out on a canvassing tour, the appellant, the sitting member placed in the hands of one B., who was not his financial agent, $100 to be used for the purposes of the election. While visiting a part of the county with which the appellant was not much acquainted, but with which B. was well acquainted, they paid an electioneering visit to one K., a leading man in that locality who indicated to B. his dissatisfaction with the candidate of his party, and stated that, although he would vote for the liberal party he would not exert himself as much as in the former elections. The appellant then went outside, and B. asked his host, \" Do you want any money for your church ? \" And having received a negative reply, added, \" Do you want any money for anything? \" K. then answered, \"If you have any money to spare there is plenty of things we want it for. We are building a town hall, and we are scarce of money.\" B. then said, \" Will $25 do?\" K. answered, \" Whatever you like, it is nothing to me.\" The money was left on the table. Then, when bidding the appellant B. good-bye, K. said, \" Gentlemen, re-member that this money has no influence as far as I am concerned with regard to the election.\" The appellant did not at the time, nor at any subsequent time, repudiate the act of B. This amount of $25 was not included in any account rendered by the appellant or his financial agent, and large sums were admittedly corruptly expended in the election by the agent of the appellant.\nHeld, affirming the judgment of the court below, that the giving of the $25 by B. to K. was not an act of liberality or charity, but a gift out of the appellant's money, with a view to influence a voter favourably to the appellant's candidature, and that, although the money was not given in the appellany's presence, yet it was given with his knowledge, and therefore that the appellant had been personally guilty of a corrupt practice.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of Plamondon, J., in the Controverted Election for the county of Meganlic.\nThe petition of the said respondents contained the usual charges of bribery, corrupt practices, &c., by the appellant personally, and by his agents.\nBy the judgment of Plamondon, J., the appellant was found guilty on both sets of charges.\nOn the present appeal, the Supreme Court of Canada affirmed the judgment of the court below on the charge of personal corruption, known as the James Kinnear case.\nThe facts of this case and the evidence relied on appear in the judgments hereinafter given.\nMr. Crepeau Q. C, and Mr. Gormully, for appellant.\nMr. Irvine, Q. C., for respondent.\nRitchie, C. J.\nThe first objection is that petitioners were not candidates and have not legally proved that they were electors having the right to vote at the election to which M the petition herein relates, nor have they proved that those persons are electors, whom the defendant and his pretended agents were accused of having bribed. The Controverted Elections Act (37 Vic cap. 10 sec 7) prescribed that the election of a member may be con-tested by \" a person who had a right to vote at the \"election to which the petition relates. \"\nOf this and other objections not touching the merits of the case, the learned Judge thus disposes in his judgment;\u2014\nM.

The learned Judge thus states his view of this case:\u2014\n\"ler Cas personnel do corruption.\u2014Pendant le cours do la cabale \u00e9lectorale un jour ou deux avant le jour do la nomination, le d\u00e9-fenderr est parti en voiture, do Somerset) avec Jean Charles Beaudette pour aller travailler ensemble \u00e0 l'\u00e9lection. Ce monsieur Beaudette est l'ami intime, le partisan z\u00e9l\u00e9 du d\u00e9fendeurr et il est difficile \u00e0 pr\u00e9tendre qu'il n'\u00e9tait pas autoris\u00e9 par le d\u00e9fondeur \u00e0 agir pour lui. Avant le depart de Somerset le d\u00e9fendeur mit entre les mains de Beaudette une somme de $100.00, pour les besoins de l'election. Ils se rendaient \u00e0 Saint-Pieree de Broughton, L'objet de leur voyage \u00e9tait d'aller voir les personnes influentes sur leur route, pour les int\u00e9resser en faveur de la candidature du d\u00e9fendeur\nChemin faisant ils s'arr\u00eatent \u00e0 Leeds, chez un homme tr\u00e9s influent de Ia localit\u00e9, M. James Kinnear; M. Kinnear est un liberal. Ie d\u00e9fendeur ne l'avait jamais ni vu ni connu; mais Beaudette avait eu quelquefois l'occasion de le visiter en qualit\u00e9 de commis voyageur. Une fois entr\u00e9s, tout naturellement ii est question de l'\u00e9lection. Kinnear dit au d\u00e9fendeur: ' Je n'aime pas le Docteur Olivier si vous \u00e9tiez liberal je voterais pour vous ad lieu d'Olivier mais s'il n'en vient pas d'autres je voterai pour Olivier .' \"\nLe d\u00e9fendeur admet, dans son t\u00e9moignage, qu'il est entr\u00e9 chez Kinnear parce qu'il savait que ce dernier n'aimait pas le Docteur Olivier\nOn prend des rafraichissements poliment offerts par Kinnear et tout en causant le d\u00e9fendeur s'informe de l'\u00e9tat de l'opinion relativement \u00e0 l'\u00e9lection. Kinnear lui r\u00e9pond que les gens l\u00e0 sont en presque totalit\u00e9 des lib\u00e9raux, mais que le Dr Olivier n'est pas aim\u00e9 dans Leeds et que, quant \u00e0 lui, il est dispose \u00e0 ne pas faire grand'-chose pour lui, qu'il voterait pour son parti mais qu'il ne travaillerait pas beaucoup.\nLa dessus le d\u00e9fendeur sort, sous le pr\u00e9texte d'aller voir \u00e0 son cheval. Rest\u00e9 seul avec Kinnear, Beaudette lui dit. A Avez-vous besoin de quelqu'argent pour votre \u00e9glise ? \" Non, r\u00e9pond Kin near, Dieu merci, notre chapelle n'est pas en dette, et je n'ai pas besoin d'argent pour elle.\"\nRefuse mais non rebut\u00e9, Beaudette revient \u00e0 la charge. \" Mais dit-il, vous devez avoir tout de m\u00eame besoin d'argent pour une chose ou pour une autre.\" Kinnear lui r\u00e9pond: \" Si vous avez de l'argent de trop, nous pouvons l'appliquer \u00e0 bien des choses ici, par exemple, nous voulons b\u00aatir un town-hall et nous sommes \u00e0 court d'argent pour le faire.\"\nBeaudette r\u00e9pond: \" Vingt-cinq piastres \u00e7a fera-t-il ? \" Kinnear lit: \" N'importe ce que vous voudrez, c'est pareil pour moi.\"\nL\u00e0-dessus Beaudette d\u00e9pose $25.00 sur la table du salon Le d\u00e9-fendeur, sur cette entrefaite, rentre au salon: l'on se dit bonjour et l'on part.\nDans son examen, le d\u00e9fenderr pr\u00e9tend que Beaudette ne lui a fait part de ce don d'argent que deux ou trois jours apr\u00e8s et qu'il n'en a pas entendu parler auparavant. Mais, outre l'invraisemblance de cette pr\u00e9tention, comment la concilier avec le fait qu'avant leur depart et pendant qu'on \u00e9changeait des bonjours. Kinnear leur dit \u00e0 tous deux: \" Gentlemen, remember that this money has no influence as far as I am concerned, with regard to the election. I vote for Dr. Olivier, he has got my support, but I am not going to exert my-self canvassing among people, as I formerly did,\"\nLe d\u00e9fendeur savait done alors et l\u00e0 Qu'une somme d'argent avait \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e par Beaudette, et cet argent \u00e9tait celui du d\u00e9fendeur. Il n'a ni alors ni subs\u00e9quemment r\u00e9pudi\u00e9 cet acte; au contraire, ii a continu\u00e9, avec Beaudette, sa tourn\u00e9e \u00e9lectorale, et Beaudette a \u00e0 sa connaissance travaill\u00e9 pour lui jusqu'\u00e0 la fin de Ia lutte. Il a done sanction\u00e9\u00e9 l'acte de corruption de Beaudette.\nCe cas si clairement prouv\u00e9 de corruption et tentative de corruption serait suffisant \u00e0 lui seul pour faire annuler l'\u00e9lection et pour faire declarer que le d\u00e9fendeur s'est personnellement rendu cou-pabee de man\u0153uvres frauduleuses au cours de sa dite election.\nBefore setting out on this Election expedition without the instrumentality of a financial agent, the appellant places in the hands of Beaudet $100 to be used for the purposes of the election; of this there can be no doubt, C\u00f4t\u00e9's evidence is clear and conclusive on this point, notwithstanding what Beaudet says:\u2014C\u00f4t\u00e9's language is as follows:\u2013\nQ. Je vous demande si \u00e0 part de. vos d\u00e9penses personnelles vous avez d\u00e9pens\u00e9 d'autre argent ?\u2014J'ai pa\u00e9\u00e9 de l'argent \u00e0 Beaudet et \u00e0 Jean Charles Beaudet.\nQ. Beaudet \u00e9tait-il un de vos agents ?\u2014Non.\nQ. Combien d'argent avez-vous donn\u00e9 \u00e0 Jean Charles Beaudet ?\u2014\nR. A peu pr\u0141s cent soixante-quinze ($.175.90) \u00e0 deux cent vingt-cinq ($225) piastres pendant Ia lutte.\nQ. Vous lui avez donn\u00e9 cela lpour les fins de l'\u00e9lection ?\u2014R. En diff\u00e9rents temps: je. ne me rappelle pas exactement le montant, c'est peut-\u00eatre moins et peut-\u00eatre plus.\nQ. Etiez-vous avec Beaudet cette fois-l\u00e0 ? R. Oui, la premiere fois que je suis monte, j'y ai \u00e9t\u00e9 rien qu'une fois.\nQ. Vous \u00e9tiez avec Beaudet ?\u2014R. Oui.\nQ. Le m\u00eame M. Beaudet auquel vous avez donn\u00e9 deux cent vingt-cinq piastres ($225.00)?\u2014R. Deux cent vingt-cinq ($225.00), ou cent soixante et quinze ($175.00) je ne me rappelle pas bien.\nBeaudet was perfectly familiar with the part of the country they visited on this occasion, but with which appellant was not much acquainted; Beaudet was also well acquainted with Kinnear while Frechette was a perfect stranger to him at the time of the visit.\n.As to Frechette' s pretence that he called on Kinnear simply because he was a trader and not because of the election, he is expressly contradicted by himself and by Beaudet. He says: \u2014\nQ. Vous \u00eat\u00e9s entr\u00e9 la parceque vous saviez qu'il n'aimait pas le docteur Olivier ? R. Oui je voulais le voir. Quand on fait le tour du comt\u00e9 ou va voir les principales gens de la place. C'etait la premi\u00e8re fois que j'allais \u00e0 Leeds. * * * * *\nBeaudet says:\nQuand je suis arriv\u00e9 chez M. Kinnear j'ai introduit M!. Fr\u00e9chette \u00e0 M.Kinnear, et M. Fr\u00e9chette a dit \u00e0 M. Kinnear vu qu'il se pr\u00e9sentait comme candidat que c'\u00e9tait son devoir d'aller le voir comme citoyen.\nCan any one doubt that this was an an electioneering and not a merely friendly social visit which Frechette, though unacquainted with Kinnear, being a trader himself, considered he was owing Kinnear he being also a trader. Had it been such a visit is it consistent with common sense within the ordinary experience of life, I may even say, with human nature, that on such a visit to an utter stranger as Frechette was to Kinnear, that his companion Mr. Beaudet a commer-cial traveller, who, as such, it would seem, often called at Kinnear's place, should wholly apart from the elec-tion, or any influence it was to have on the election exhibit such reckless anxiety to get rid of, not his own, but Frechette's money, dispensing it without the consent and approval of Frechette and contrary to the purpose for which the money was given him, and without the slightest solicitation for, or even intimation, direct or indirect, that there was any object whatever then present to his mind for which his liberality was needed or would be appreciated. Was it ever heard of that a business man, such as Beaudet, in a place with which he was unconnected, except to get money by the sale of goods, not to dispense it gratuitously, on a social visit, nothing in the conversation tending to such a question, should abruptly ask his host, \"Do you want any money for your church ?\" and having received the reply, \"No, thank God, our church is free from debt, I \" don't want any money for it, \" and not content with this rebuff should again ask \" Do you not want any \" money for anything ?\" This, on the idea of its having innocently occurred on a social visit would be incomprehensible. But viewed in the light of the candidature of his companion Frechette, and of his having $100 of Frechette's money in his pocket to be used for elec-tion Purposes, and of the conversation \"with Kinnear immediately preceding the offer in which Kinnear indi-cated so clearly his dissatisfaction with the candidature of Mr. Olivier and the fact that though he would vote for the Liberal party he would not exert himself as much as in former elections, it is entirely intelligible. Can any one doubt that knowing the state Kinnear's mind had been in in reference to Mr. Olivier, Frechette and Beaudet called, and that, finding him still in the same state of mind which Kinnear in no way dis-guised these $25 were left on Kinnear's table to influence, favorably to Frechette, Kinnear's conduct in regard to the election, and can it be doubted that Kinnear felt and knew that Beaudet intended it to have that effect ? otherwise why should he when bidding Frechette and Beaudet good-bye say, \" Gentlemen, remember that this money has no influence as far as I am concerned with regard to the election.\" Of this extraordinary transaction Beaudet, though examined as a witness in the case, gives no explanation, in fact says not one word as to the giving; all he does say is indirectly at variance with the testimony of Kinnear.\nI am wholly unable to look on this as an act of liberality or charity, but a gift with a view to influence Kiinnear pure and simple, and I am equally unable to bring my mind to the conclusion that Frechette was not a party to the transaction, or that he was not aware that the money he supplied Beaudet was thus applied. While we must not act on mere suspicions however strong they may be, but must be satisfied that the corrupt practice has been affirmatively established beyond reasonable doubt, we cannot expect to find in a vast majoritv of cases direct evidence of the fact * in this instance it would be unreasonable to suppose that Frechette would openly and before Beaudet take out this money and offer it to Kinnear as a bribe Pure and simple; equally unreasonable would it be to expect that Beaudet, having received money from Frechette to be used for election purposes would in his presence in like manner offer the bribe to this man or that he would offer it to him as a bribe * but Frechette and he having set out with a common object viz: to forward the election interests of Frechette in which it is clear money was to be used by Beaudet, (otherwise it would not have been furnished him at the outset by Frechette,) and having found Kinnear an influential man of opposite politics in a dissatisfied state of mind as to the candidate of his party where could be found a more desirable subject to operate on ? and, if to be operated on by Beaudet, the holder of the money, what more natural and significant than that Frechette should step out on pretence of looking after his horse and Beaudet thus be furnished with an opportunity ? And can there be a doubt that of the opportunity thus afforded, Beaudet availed himself, feeling no doubt that though Kinnear's vote might not be changed, such liberality so freely and generously bestowed could not fail to have its good effect ? In considering cases of this kind we must bring our common sense to bear we must not ignore our knowledge of human nature nor must we cast aside the experience of life and while we must not presume guilt, we must from the facts and circumstances presented for our consideration arrive at the conclusions which our common sense, our knowledge of human nature and our experience of life naturally and without reasonable doubt fairly lead us. It is only necessary to read the evidence in this case to establish that the learned Judge could have come to no other conclusion than he did.\nCot\u00e9's account of the interview with Kinnear is as follows:\u2014\nQ. Vous avez \u00e9t\u00e9, comme vous avez dit, avec M. Beaudet en voiture, et vous avez visit\u00e9 plusieurs des \u00e9lecteurs en cabalant avec lui i R.

Lui avez-vous parl\u00e9 d'\u00e9lection ?\u2014R. J'ai parl\u00e9 par rapport \u00e0 la lettre qu'il avait envoy\u00e9e \u00e0 M. Piteau. M. Kinnear m'a dit: Je n'aime pas le docteur Olivier* Si vous \u00e9tiez liberal je voterais pour vous au lieu d'Olivier \u00ab mais s'il n'en vient pas d'autre je voterai pour Olivier.\nQ. Votre entrevue avec lui n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 favorable ? R. Je savais bien que Kinnear est liberal: j'allais le voir comme confrere de magasin.\nQ. Vous \u00eates entr\u00e9 la parce que vous saviez qu'il n'aimait pas le docteur Olivier ?\u2014R. Oui. Je voutais le voir.

Et Beaudet est rest\u00e9 avec vous ?\u2014R. Oui\nQ. Beaudet vous a-t-il dit quelque chose par rapport \u00e0 certaines vingt-cinq piastres ($25.00)?\u2014R. Il m'a dit cola quelques jours apr\u00e9s. Q. Quand?\u2014R. Je crois que c'est trois ou quatre jours apr\u00e8s.\nQ. Qu'est-ce qu'il vous a dit ?_R. Ii m'a dit qu'il avait donn\u00e9 vingt-cinq piastres ($25.00) \u00e0 M. Kinnear pour lui aider \u00e0 b\u00e2tir un townhall.\nQ. A part des deux cent cinquante piastres que vous avez donn\u00e9es au comit\u00e9 de Somerset, et des deux cent vingt-cinq piastres \u00e0 Beaudet, cent soixante-quinze piastres \u00e0 deux cent vingt cinq piastres \u00e0 Beaudet et \u00e0 part de vos d\u00e9penses personnelles avez-vous donn\u00e9 d'autres sommes d'argent pendant l'\u00e9lection et pour l'\u00e9lection ?\u2014R. Pas Que je me rappelle. Oui, j'ai donn\u00e9 cinquante piastres ($50.00) au comit\u00e9 de Sainte-Julie quo j'ai envoy\u00e9es pour les d\u00e9penses l\u00e9gales, les orateurs, etc.\nQ.

A part de ce que j'ai donn\u00e9 \u00e0 Beaudet, j'en ai donn\u00e9 au comit\u00e9 do Somerset,\nQ. Combien?\u2014R. Deux cent cinquante piastres ($250.00) \u00e0 peu pres, je ne puis pas dire an juste, c'est pour payer les d\u00e9penses du comit\u00e9, j'ai donn\u00e9 environ deux cent cinquante piastres, deux cents \u00e0 deux cent cinquante piastres, j'ai donn\u00e9 en diff\u00e9rents temps.\nQ.

A-t-il rendu compte do cela ?\u2014R. Non.\nQ. Vous no lui avez pas deman\u00e9\u00e9 non plus ?\u2014Non.\nBeaudet's account of what took place at Kinnear's is as follows:\u2014\nQ. Vous \u00e9tes, si je ne me trompe pas, commis voyageur, c'est-\u00e0-dire quo vous vendez \u00e0 commiussion pour des marchands do gros do Montr\u00e9al, et cela depuis do nombreuses ann\u00e9es ?\u2014R. Oui, depuis dix-sept (17) ans.\nQ. Et durant ce temps-la avez-vous eu occasion do faire connaiussanee avec M. James Kinnear ? \u2014 R. Oui, je le connais depuis nombre d'ann\u00e9es, et je suis all\u00e9 le voir.\nQ. Durant la derni\u00e8re \u00e9lection vous \u00eates entr\u00e9 chez lui avec le d\u00e9* fendeur \"M. Fr\u00e9chette ?\u2014R. Oui. Q. Et vois dites que dans ce temps-l\u00e0 ii y avait bien des ann\u00e9es que vous faisiez des affaires comme commis voyageur et que vous en aviez fait beaucouip avec lui ?\u2014R. Oui, beaucoup avec lui et avec son fils aussii\nQ. Vous \u00e9tiez sur un pied d'intimit\u00e9, je presume, avec M. Kinnear?\nQ. Avant d'entrer l\u00e0, M. Beaudette, a-t-il \u00e9t\u00e9 question entre vous et M. Fr\u00e9chette de quelque chose au sujet de votre visite \u00e0 M. Kinnear ?\u2014R Pas du tout. M. Fr\u00e9chette m'a demand\u00e9 d'aller avec lui il m'a dit: \" tu connais bien des gens.\" Je lui ai dit: c c'est bien, \" et nous sommes partis tous les deux, et nous avois \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 plusieurs places. Quand je suis arriv\u00e9 chez M. Kinnear, j'ai introduit M. Fr\u00e9-chette \u00e0 M. Kinnear, et M. Fr\u00e9chette a dit \u00e0 M!. Kinnear, vu qu'il se pr\u00e9sentait comme candidat que c'\u00e9tait son devoir d'aller le voir comme citoyen.\nQ. Si je vous comprends bien, avant d'aller voir M. Kinnear, vous n'aviez fait aucun complot entre vous et lui pour tendre des em-bCchss \u00e0 M. Kinnear ?\u2014Non.\nQ. Si je ne trompe pas, il s'est pass\u00e9 quelque chose entre vous et M. Kinnear au sujet d'une souscription pour un Town Hall ?\u2014R. Oui\nQ. Voulez-vous dire si le d\u00e9fendeur Frechette \u00e9tait present et a eu connaissance de cette conversation entre vous et M. Kinnear \u00e0 propos de cette souscrition ?\u2014R. Non, M. Fr\u00e9chette, n'\u00e9tait pas dans Ia maison quand j'ai parl\u00e9 avec M. Kinnear.\nQ. Lorsque vous \u00eates enbarqu\u00e9 avec M. Fr\u00e9chette, M. Kinnear a-t-il dit quelque chose pouvant donnera comprendre M. Fr\u00e9chette qu'il avait re\u00e7u quelques lib\u00e9ralit\u00e9s pour lui ou sa municipalit\u00e9 ?\u2014 R. Non; quand je suis sorti avec M. Fr\u00e9chette, la voiture \u00e9tait attach\u00e9e \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s \u00e0 une cinquantaine de pieds de la porte; comme on revirait avec la voiture, M. Kinnear a sorti sur le perron et a dit: \" Ne passez pas chez mon fils James sans arr\u00e9ter le voir.\" C'est ce que nous avons fait.\nQ. Pendant que cette affaire de souscription s'est pass\u00e9e, M. Fr\u00e9-chette \u00e9tait dans le jardin ?\u2014R. Ii \u00e9tait en dehors; j'ai remarqu\u00e9 qu'il avait un jeu de croquet o\u00f9 il y avait des dames et M, Fr\u00e9chette \u00e9tait avec elles \u00e0 s'amuser; c'\u00e9tait \u00e0 c\u00f4t\u00e9 de la maison, on les voyait par le chassis, mais iis ne pouvaient pas entendre la conversation.\nQ. Quand M. Fr\u00e9chette est venu vous rejoindre pour embarquer,M. Kinnear, tout cc qu'il vous a dit est ccci: N'oubliez pas d'aller chez mon fils James ? R. C'est tout cc qu'il a dit.\nAnd then we have the evidence of Kinnear:\u2014\nQ. Do you remember the member elect, Mr. Fr\u00e9chette) in com- pany with Beaudet, going to your house while the canvass for the election was going on ?\u2014A. Yes, they both came.\nQ. Was that before or after the nomination day ?\u2014 It was before.\nQ. It was a day or two before ?\u2014A. I could not say exactly; it was a short time before. It was before the nomination.\nQ. Would you relate, as nearly as you can remember, the conversation which took place with Fr\u00e9chette in the first instance at your houee?\u2014A. Frechette and Beaudet called upon me and said that he was in the neighborhood. I was well acquainted with Beaudet, being a commercial traveller, and calling at our place. They came in and sat down, and Mrs. Kinnear brought some little refreshments and chatted away, and asked Fr\u00e9chette how he was getting along, if he was intending to run. He said yes, that he had great encouragement and intended to go through. After we talked. Alter this he went outside. and Mr. Baaudet was sitting on the sofa. I should say that before this occurred they asked me how the parties felt at the mill, regarding this election. I said that they felt rather cold, a good many of them in the main were so, that they did not like the member that was setting up to run, that the late Dr. Olivier was not very popular in Leeds, and I said if they \u2014I said for my part I was not going to interfere a great deal in this election. 1 was cold about the thing, but at the same time that I would vote for my party, that I was always Liberal, and that I would vote for the Liberal party\u00bb but not exert myself as much as in former elections. Then Fr\u00e9chette went out, and Mr. Beaudet asked me \" Do you want any money for your church?\" I said \" No, thank goodness, our church is free from debt, I did not want any money for it.\" We then continued talking, and he asked me again \" Do you not want any money for anything?\" And I said \" If you have any money to spare there is plenty of things we want it for.\" We were thinking about putting up a public hall here and we were scarce of money. Then Beaudette said, I think, \" Will twenty-five dollars do ?\" I said \" Whatever you like, it is nothing to me.\" I think he took twenty-fire dollars and left it on the parlor table. And after this happened Mr. Frechette then came in, and when I was bidding them good-bye, I said \" Gentlemen, remember that this money has no influence, as far as I am concerned, with regard to the election.\" 1 said \"I vote for Olivier, he has got my support, but I am not going to exert myself canvassing among people as 1 formerly did.\nQ. These last remarks you made in the presence of Mr. Fr\u00e9chette ? A. Yes, they were both going away, and I was bidding them good-bye, and I said \" Now, remember this has no influence with regard to my vote, alluding to the money. I think that is about all that happened.\"\nQ. Did you inform the people that this .....had been given for the purpose of the Town Hall ?\u2014A. No, it still remains there, and I made an offer of it back again to Mr. Beaudet; the money will go for that purpose unless it goes back to those who gave it to me. It was left there, and I often felt sorry about having anything to do with it, and after that, I met Beaudet, shortly after the council here, he did not care about talking about it or anything. I said I think I had better pay you back this twenty-five dollars. It appears something as calling in conscience, I would rather not have it, but he walked on and went away, but it had no influence when the day of the election came. I felt just as anxious to get votes for the Liberal side as before.\nQ. Is it not a fact, Mr. Kinnear, that when Mr. Fr\u00e9chette called at your place that he said because being himself a trader that he considered he was owing you a visit, yourself being a trader ?\u2014A. I explained that, he said he was in the neighbourhood, and called upon me to see me.\nQ. I want to know if there was any mention of your being traders and you older that he thought it was due he should call on you ?\u2014A. I believe it was a sort of a... call, an electioneering call, it must have been, because I had no acquaintance with Mr. Fr\u00e9chette, I had not known him before.\nQ. I mean, you say that you were an old trader, and he Mr. Fr\u00e9-chetee is also a trader, and being in your neighbourghood, and you being an old resident and trader, that he thought it was his duty, as an able man to call and see you ?--A. Well, I do not know about perhaps that might be his idea for that.\nQ. Have you any doubt that if Mr. Fr\u00e9chette had been in your village that he would not have called, if it had not been election time ? Do you mean to say that if it had not been during the election time that Fr\u00e9chette being in your village would not have called ?\u2014A. I could not say for that, the only thing is I have no acquaintance with Fr\u00e9cthette but having acquaintance with Beaudet they might have called. Beaudet has often called,\nQ. Do you undertake to swear, Mr. Kinnear, that when they left, and when you made the remark that you would not be influenced by that, as you said, do you undertake to swear that any mention in reference was made in the presence of Fr\u00e9chette, of the twenty-five dollars that had been left by Beaudet ?\u2014A. No mention whatever after what mention I made of it.\nRe-examined.\nQ. When Fr\u00e9chette came back to the room, and you accompanied them out of their vehicle, they were going away, you then made, ii I understand you rightly, in the presence of Fr\u00e9chette, a reference to the monev that had been left and said the monev would not influence you ? A. I do not think I mentioned money, but I mentioned it would have no influence as far as I referred to it I do not know whether they understood it.\nQ. Could Mr. Fr\u00e9chette have helped understanding that you were making reference to something which had been done, or offered you with the view to influence your vote at the election ? A. I have stated all that occurred.\nQ. Mr. Kinnear, as a matter of fact, have you any doubt at all but that Mr. Fr\u00e9chette called to see you because there was an election going on, have you any doubt in your mind about that at all? \u2014A. They said that they called for another purpose, that it was merely to see me as they were in the neighborhood, but of course as he was running for the county, my impression was that he called to see me with reference to that.\nQ. Is it not a fact that you are the most prominent and most influential person in the neighborhood of Kinnear's Mills ?\u2014A. I have got a certain amount of influence there and there is some there that always vote whatever side I vote for, no matter whether it is Liberal or Conservative.\nThus we have it clearly established by Frechette that $100 was given by him to Beaudet for the purposes of the election directly and not through the instrumentality of a financial agent. In opposition, the subterfuge of Beaudet that the money was not given for the purposes of the election, but on account of an indebtedness of Frechette to him, Beaudet, and that the money was therefore his and not Frechette's; and Fr\u00e9chette and Beaudtt having, in the course of the avowed election expedition come to the house of Kinnear, we have the flimsy pretence of Frechette that, because he was a fellow-trader, he thought he ought to call on him, and that that was the object of the visit, clearly overturned.\nThen we have the introduction into the conversation of the subject of the election, very clearly showing the cause and object of the visit, for in answer to a question to Cole: \" Lui avez-vous parl\u00e9 d'\u00e9lection ? \" R. \" J'ai parl\u00e9 par rapport \u00e0 la lettre qu'il avoit envoy\u00e9e \u00e0 M. Piteau,\" clearly inferring thereby that he was acquainted with Kinnear's feelings.\nThen, so soon as Kinnear had made apparent his dislike, as still existing, to the candidateship of Olivier, and his unwillingness to work for him, or to take as active a part in the election as he usually did in elections, we have the disappearance of Frechette from the room and leaving Beaudet there with Kinnear alone tinder the flimsy pretence of Frechette that he went to look after his horse, which, the evidence shows was tied only about fifty feet from the door and does not appear to have needed any looking after; and the equally flimsy, but different, reason assigned by Beaudet that Frechette left the room to see some ladies playing croquet.\nThen Beaudet's question to Kinnear, immediately on Frechette's leaving, to know if he did not want money for his church, and on receiving a negative answer, Beaude's extraordinary reply to Kinnear that he, Kin-near, should have need of money for one thing or another totally indifferent to Beaudet, so that he got Kinnear to take Fr\u00e9chette's money and then his leaving it on Kinnear's table.\nThen we have the knowledge of the money having been given by Beaudet to Kinnear brought home to Fr\u00e9chette on the spot by Kinnear as they were leaving, and Kinnear's evident intima tion to Beaudet and Frechetee that he thought they would expect it would influence him in the election, and his statement to them that it would have no influence, as far as he was concerned in the election. Then there is the absence of any repudiation of the act of Beaudet at this time or at any subsequent time, though Frechette admits that Beaudet informed him of the particulars of the transaction a day or two after: \" Q. Et vous etiez satisfait. R, Je n'\u00e9tais Pas pour les retirer; ce n'est pas moi qui ai donn\u00e9 l'argent,t where he inferentially adopts the act. The attempt of Beaudet to make it appear that the money was not given him by Frechette for election purposes, but that it was his and not Frechette's money in all which he was directly contradicted by Frechette. The clearly established fact, notwithstanding what Beaudet says that the $100 was given by Frechette to him for the purposes of the election, that this $25 was part of that sum which it would have been a fraud on Frechette if Beaudet, instead of spending it for the purpose for which it was entrusted to him, viz., that of the election had distributed it behind Frechette's back in acts of unsolicited liberality or charity having no bearing on the election; the absence of any explanation by Beaudet though examined respecting the transaction; the contradictions of Beaudet and Frechette. Then we have Cot\u00e9's expenditures. He admits that the election cost him $1500. He thinks there are accounts still to come in. At pages 38 and 39 he says:\u2014\nQ. N'avez-vous Pas dit \u00e0 M. D'Auteuil, le cur\u00e9 d'Ireland, que votre election vous co\u00e9tait quinze cents piastres ($1,500.00) ?\u2014R.

The voters' list prepared under the provisions of the Quebec statute, 38 Vic. ch. 7, when finally completed and filed of record as directed by that statute, is in my opinion the sole evidence required to be produced for the purpose of establishing the right of a person inserted thereon as a qualified voter to vote at an election held thereunder and to file an election petition as such qualified voter. Ample opportunity is given to every one by the provisions of the statute to make objection to all persons inserted on the list as voters while it is in course of preparation, and the utmost precautions are provided to insure its accuracy, so that when it is finally completed and filed of record, as required by the statute, it becomes the title of record of every person inserted thereon to be an elector entitled to vote at an election held under it and as such entitled to maintain a petition calling in question the validity of the election. Neither is there anything in the other purely technical objections urged by the learned counsel for the appellant. The appeal must therefore be disposed of upon its merits.\nThe learned judge before whom the election petition was tried, has avoided the election upon the grounds of bribery and corruption which he had found to have been committed by the appellant personally, and also by others, his duly authorized agents. The learned counsel for the appellant has, upon this appeal, submitted to the correctness of the judgment of the learned judge, in so far as it proceeds upon the acts of the agents of the appellant committed without his knowledge and consent, and has disputed the judgment only in so far as it finds that any bribery or corrupt practice was committed by the appellant personally, or by any agent of his, with his knowledge or consent, the object of the appeal being to get relief from the disqualification of the appellant incident upon the judgment of the learned judge.\nThe charges affecting the appellant personally upon which the judgment of the learned judge proceeds, are five in number.\nThe first is comprised in items No. land 19, inserted in the bill of particulars annexed to the record, which are as follows :\n1st. That the appellant gave from two hundred and fifty to three hundred dollars to one Jean Charles Beaudette, with whist to com* mit bribery during the election, and\n19th. That Jean Charles Beaudette, with the knowledge and consent of the appellant, who had furnished him with money for such purposes, gave to one James Kinnear the sum of twenty-five dollars for the purpose of corruptly influencing the vote of the said. James Kinnear.\nThe learned judge after a careful review of the evidence bearing upon this charge, came to the conclusion that it was clearly proved, and that in itself was not only sufficient to avoid the election, but to subject the appellant to be found guilty personally of corruption. The appellant and his agent, Beaudetts, had the fullest opportunity of explaining their version of this transaction; indeed, they and Kinnear are the sole witnesses upon the charge. It is apparent, however, that the learned judge was very unfavorably impressed with the manner in which the appellant gave his evidence upon all the charges which were under investigation before him, for he premises his judgment with a passage which I transcribe in his own language:\nUne observation trouve ici n\u00e9cessairement sa place. C'est que le d\u00e9fendeur a \u00e9tonnement vari\u00e9 dans les diverses d\u00e9positions et d\u00e9clarations qu'il a donnes. La cour d\u00e9clare sans h\u00e9sitation qu'elle croit de son devoir d'attacher plus de poids aux admissions, affirmations et explications contenues dans les r\u00e9ponses du d\u00e9fendeur \u00e0 1 interrogatoire en chef plut\u00f4t que dans ses depositions subs\u00e9quentes faites exparte et qui d\u00e9c\u00e8lent le besoin et le d\u00e9sir d'amoindrir sinon d'an\u00e9antir compl\u00e8tement la preuve de faits compromet tants, preuve, r\u00e9sultant d'un t\u00e9moignage long et minutieux donn\u00e9 \u00e0 plusieurs reprises, en pleine connaissance de cause, en toute libert\u00e9 sans la moindre pression de pr\u00e9cipitation, et sans le moindre pr\u00e9texte de d\u00e9faut de connaissance de cause le d\u00e9fendeur b\u00e9n\u00e9ficie d\u00e9j\u00e0 suffisamment d'un d\u00e9faut de m\u00e9moire bien remarquable dans son premier interrogatoire.\nNow that Beaudetle gave to Kinnear the $25 and that the money so given was part of the $100 which the appellant had that same morning placed in Beaudette's hands, there can he no doubt. That the money placed by the appellant in Beaudette's hands was so placed for purposes of corruption, and to be expended in a manner similar to the manner in which it was so soon after, and almost in the presence of the defendant applied and that Beaudette's motive in giving the $25, although expressed to be given towards the erection of a public hail at the place where Kinnear lives was in fact in order to induce Kinnear either to vote for the appellant or at least not to vote or work against him, and that the appellant had at the time knowledge of the manner in which the sum of $25 was expended of the source from which it came and of Beaudette's motive in so expending it are all inferences which the evidence warranted and it is sufficient for me to say especially in view of the above extract from the judgment of the learned judge that the learned counsel has failed to convince my mind that the finding of the learned judge is erroneous. On the contrary, I am of opinion that the above inferences flow very naturally from the facts detailed in the evidence, and however serious are the consequences to the appellant, I can see nothing to justify us in reversing the judgment of the learned judge upon this charge.\nAnother of the charges contained in the bill of particulars is that the appellant gave from $30 to $50 to one Porter to commit corrupt acts therewith, and that the money was employed by him for that purpose. The learned judge has found that the appellant enclosed in an envelope addressed to Porter the sum of $20 a day or two before the polling day, and he was of opinion that the sending of this $20 served to purchase the influence and services of Porter, who was to act as an agent of the appellant at one of the polling places.\nOn the back of a piece of paper covering the money were written the words: \" for expenses at your poll.\" There was no signature to this, nor was there any writing save the name and address of Porter, which were on the envelope. Porter could stave no satisfactory account of his application of this money, and he professed to have been ignorant when he received it of the person from whom it came. Now that this money was sent with a corrupt intent was a very natural inference for the learned judge to draw from the facts in evidence, for there was no legal expenses to be incurred by Porter at the poll for which he would require any money; and if sent to him with an honest motive, there was no occasion for such a statement of the purpose for which the money was sent, nor for suppressing the name of the person sending it, nor for omitting to have the amount entered in the account of the appellant's expenses at the election. It was contended, however, by the learned counsel for the appellant, that the finding of the learned judge as to the purpose for which the money was sent was a different purpose from that alleged in the charge, the latter being \" pour faire de la corruption\" and the finding of the learned judge being, that the payment of a sum of $10 for a service which was worth only $3 or $4 \" et envoie de $20 ont servi a acheter l'influence et les services de Porter.\"\nI confess that it appears to me that in these charges of personal corruption, the same preciseness should be required as in an indictment. In this case the evidence, to my mind, rather proves the motive of the appellant in sending the money to have been the corrupt one charged than to influence the vote of Porler, which, as I understood the learned counsel for the appellant is the construction put by him upon the language of the learned judge; but it may be that the words \" ont servi \u00e0 acheter l influence et les services de Porter are open to the construction that the money was given to purchase the good offices and services of Porter in freely treating the voters on the polling day at the poll where Porter was to represent the appellant, a practice which ap pears to have been largely indulged in at some of the polling places by persons acting in the interest of the appellant, in which case the charge \" pour faire de la corruption \" would be established. However, as the first charge is sufficient to support the learned judge's judgment, it is unnecessary to dwell upon this one, or upon the others, which are charges of corrupt treating, as to which latter I think it not inopportune to observe that these charges of corrupt treating appear to me to afford a good illustration of the importance of our being very careful not to set aside the finding of the judge of first instance upon matters of fact unless thoroughly convinced that the finding is erroneous. As to the mere fact of treating, there may not be, and frequently is not, any question raised\u2014the criminality lies in the intent of the party in treating; and judging from the observations above quoted from the learned judge's judgment, I cannot but think that the very unsatisfactory character of the evidence given by the appellant, and his demeanor under examination mainly contributed to induce the learned judge to draw the inference that the intent in the cases adjudicated upon by him was corrupt, and as upon appeal we have not that evidence, before us as the learned judge had, we are not in a position that would justify us in pro enouncing his judgment to be erroneous.\nAppeal dismissed with cos's.\nSolicitor for appellant: Eugene Cr\u00e9peau.\nSolicitor for respondents: Joseph Lavergne.\n",

The action was commenced by the respondents against the appellants on the 16th September, 1881, for injuries which they had severally sustained by being thrown out of a buggy on a highway in Berlin, near a crossing of the appellants\u2019 railway on the previous 9th of June.\nThe cause was first tried before Mr. Justice Galt and a jury, when, on answers to questions submitted to the jury, the judge entered a verdict and judgment for the respondents against the appellants.\nThis verdict was set aside by the Common Pleas Division, and a new trial was ordered, and leave was given to the respondents to amend their statement of claim, the court being of opinion that the original statement of claim did not shew a good cause of action.\nThe statement of claim was then amended, so as to state the facts upon which the respondents relied to maintain their action, in the words following\u2014\n\u201cParagraph 2. On the evening of the 9th day of June, 1881, the plaintiffs were lawfully proceeding from the said town of Berlin to the town of Waterloo, in a carriage drawn by one horse, and upon and by the way of the highway leading from the said town of Berlin to the said town of Waterloo.\n\u201cParagraph 3. In order to reach the said town of Waterloo it was necessary for the plaintiffs to cross the defendants\u2019 railway, in the said town of Berlin, where the said railway crosses the said highway on a level with the said highway.\n\u201cParagraph 4. The plaintiffs proceeded upon the said highway to within a very short distance of the said railway, where it crosses the said highway, when a train upon the said railway in charge of the defendants\u2019 servants came along the said railway and proceeded to cross the said highway without giving the warning or signal of the approach of the said train, as required by the statute in that behalf, and when the said train had gone partly across the said highway the whistle upon the engine attached to the said train was then for the first time sounded, and the horse which the plaintiffs were driving took fright at the very close, unexpected and sudden appearance of the said train, became unmanageable, and upset the said carriage, and the plaintiffs were violently thrown to the ground, and the said carriage was broken, and the said horse ran away, although during all the time aforesaid the plaintiffs drove the said horse with reasonable care and skill.\n\u201cParagraph 4a. While the plaintiffs were proceeding upon said highway in the said carriage as aforesaid, and before the said carriage was upset as aforesaid, the said train (preceded by a locomotive engine attached thereto and forming part thereof) was being rapidly driven along and over the said railway in charge of the said defendant\u2019s servants, and thereupon it became and was the duty of the defendants to ring the bell, or to sound the whistle, which were upon the said engine, at least eighty rods from the place where the said railway crosses the said highway, and to keep the said bell ringing, or the said whistle sounding, at short intervals until the said engine had crossed the said highway, to warn persons travelling along the said highway of the approach of the said train, but the said servants of the defendants did not, nor did any other person, ring the the said bell or sound the said whistle when approaching the said crossing, either at, or within, the said distance of eighty rods from the said point of intersection or crossing, but wholly neglected so to do, by reason whereof the plaintiffs were not warned of the said approach of the said train.\n\u201cParagraph 5. No warning or signal of the approach of the said train towards the said highway on the occasion aforesaid was given as required by law. No bell was rung, nor whistle sounded upon the said engine until the same was partly across the said highway when the said horse immediately took fright and became unmanageable, through no fault of the plaintiffs, and entirely in consequence of the said negligence and carelessness of the said servants of the defendants.\n\u201cParagraph 5a. Because no warning of the said train was given by whistling or ringing the bell as hereinbefore mentioned, the plaintiffs had reason to suppose that no train was then approaching the said railway crossing, and therefore being ignorant of their danger, and being unable to see or hear any approaching train, and believing that no train was coming, the plaintiffs drove with due care as aforesaid much nearer and closer to the said railway crossing than the plaintiffs would have gone on the occasion aforesaid if they had been warned by whistle or bell of the approach of the said train as required by law, and immediately thereupon\u2019 when the plaintiffs had proceeded to within a very short distance of the said railway, as mentioned in the fourth paragraph hereof, the said train came suddenly upon the said highway, and the said horse took fright at the said train, so that the said horse became unmanageable and upset the said carriage, and the plaintiffs then received the injuries hereinafter mentioned, and it was by reason of such neglect to ring the said bell or sound the said whistle as aforesaid that the plaintiffs sustained the damages hereinafter mentioned.\nThe appellants pleaded not guilty by statute.\nThe cause was tried a second time before Mr. Justice Patterson and a jury.\nThe learned Judge after reading s. 104 of the Consolidated Statutes of Canada, ch. 66, put the following questions to the jury:\nFirst, has it been proved to your satisfaction that that duty was not performed? to which the jury answered yes.\nSecond\u2014If you find the signal was given, but not so far as eighty rods from the highway, would it have been heard by the plaintiffs if they had been careful and listened so they could have avoided the accident? To which the jury answered yes, but said that they do not mean that the bell was rung.\nThird\u2014Was it a prudent thing for the plaintiffs to have driven the horse they did where the railway was to be crossed? To which the jury answered yes.\nFourth\u2014Did the plaintiffs use such care as a reasonably cautious person would under the circumstances have used on approaching the railway? To which the jury answered yes\nThe fifth question was not answered and is not material.\nSixth\u2014If the plaintiffs had known the train was coming would they have stopped the horse further from the railway? To which the jury answered yes.\nThe jury then assessed the damages of the respondents\u2014Mary Rosetta, at $600, and of Lydia Ann, $500.\nUpon these answers the learned judge entered a verdict for the respondents.\nOn the 18th May, 1882, the Common Pleas Division granted an order nisi to show cause why the judgment rendered for the plaintiffs, and the findings or verdict of jury upon which the said judgment was based, should not be set aside, and a judgment entered for the defendants, on the ground that the plaintiffs could not maintain an action, as the defendants did not owe any duty to sound the bell or blow the whistle, so far as the plaintiffs were concerned, and on the ground that it was not established that the injury to the plaintiffs complained of was caused by the omission of the defendants to give the signal referred to, and on the ground that the omission to give the signal was not the proximate cause of the injury, or why the said findings should not be set aside and a new trial had between the parties, on the ground that the findings were against law and evidence, and the weight of evidence.\nAfter arguments the order nisi was discharged, Justices Galt and Osler being of opinion that the action was maintainable, and that they could and ought to supply a finding of a matter of fact which the jury had not found. The Chief Justice dissented, holding that the action was not maintainable. The appellants then appealed to the Court of Appeal, and a majority of the judges of that Court affirmed the judgment of the Common Pleas Division. Mr. Justice Burton dissented, agreeing with the opinion of Chief Justice Wilson.\nThe present appeal was from the judgment of the Court of Appeal.\nThe evidence at the trial, besides the statements of the two respondents, consisted of persons in the neighborhood of the crossing, who stated that they did not hear the signals given, and some of them that if they had been given they would have heard them, while others gave evidence to show that either one or both signals were given. The two respondents, who were driving a buggy, said that they did not hear the signals or hear even the noise of the approaching train till they saw it.\nMr. James Belhune, Q.C., for appellants:\nThe appellants submit that except for the statement of claim numbered 5a. the appellants could have demurred. See observation of Osler, J.[3]\nIf the action will lie at all it certainly was necessary for the respondents to prove to the satisfaction of the jury, and to get them to find, that the injury to the respondents happened by reason of the appellants\u2019 neglect to give the signals in question.\nThe majority of the judges of both the courts below have in effect tried that part of the case as jurors, and have supplied a finding which the real jury did not find, and might not have found if the matter had been submitted to them.\nThe respondents rely on marginal rule 321 of the Judicature Act, as enabling the Court to try that issue.\nI submit that this could not in such a case as this be done, or even if the court possessed the power it ought not to have been so exercised in this instance.\nThe respondents required to have the issues of fact tried by a jury. Then attention was called to the importance of the issue as to whether the injury happened by reason of the defendants\u2019 neglect to give the signals. See observation of Osler, J.[4], in the report already referred to. The respondents chose to rest their case on the findings of the jury in answer to the questions submitted, and declined to ask the judge to submit a question as to the causation of the injury, and ought not now to be allowed to raise any question of the kind, but certainly if it is to be raised it must be tried by the tribunal of the respondents\u2019 own choice.\nThe appellants submit that marginal rule 321, already referred to, does not apply to a case of this kind, but if it does, the appellants contend that the divisional court had not, and this court has not, all the materials before it necessary to enable it finally to determine the question of whether the injury was caused by reason of the neglect to give the signals in question.\nIn cases of this kind no court who has not seen the witnesses can determine a question of this kind now under consideration.\nThat the accident happened because the signals were not given is not the necessary result of the findings of the jury.\nThe 6th question is the important one in connection with the matter now being discussed. That question is \u201cif the plaintiffs had known the train was coming would they have stopped the horse further from the railway?\u201d The appellants ask how much further? and do not see where the evidence is upon which the exact place can be fixed. It is not a finding that they would have stopped a quarter of a mile away. The finding is so vague as to be quite useless to enable the the court to determine anything.\nThen I also submit that an action will not lie for a breach of the statute, even if everything else assumed in favor of the respondents, because the damages are too remote.\nMoreover the respondents were guilty of such contributory negligence in attempting to drive the horse across the railway track as should disentitle them to recover, and the appellants did not owe the respondents, in the circumstances which happened, any duty to give the signals. [The learned counsel also relied on the judgments of the Chief Justice of the Common Pleas[5] and the cases therein cited, and the judgment of Mr. Justice Burton in the Court of Appeal[6]]\nMr. Bowlby, Q.C., for respondents:\nThe finding of the jury in answer to the 6th question sufficiently shows that the respondents\u2019 damages were sustained by reason of the appellants\u2019 neglect to give the requisite statutory signals by whistle or bell, when that finding is read in connection with the evidence and the Judge\u2019s charge, which must always be done with the findings of Juries given in answer to questions.\nIt is enacted by \u201cThe Ontario Judicature Act, 1881,\u2019\u2019 rule 321, statutes of Ontario, 1881, p. 108, that upon a motion for judgment, or for a new trial, the court may if satisfied that it has before it all the materials necessary for finally determining the questions in dispute or any of them, give judgment accordingly.\u201d As the appellants\u2019 motion in the court below was for a new trial, under this rule 321 the whole question of the liability of the appellants was open for the court to determine on the pleadings and evidence upon hearing such motion for new trial. This case having already been twice tried by jury, another new trial should not be granted for the mere purpose of asking the jury one additional question, the answer to which the court can foresee to a certainty upon the evidence now before the court and upon which the court itself has full power to find and give judgment by the above mentioned O.J. Act, rule 321, and upon which the evidence is conclusive in favour of the respondents. Hamilton v. Johnson[7]\nThe United States courts have decided railway companies are liable in cases like the present, although there was no actual collision with the train and it is well known that no practical inconvenience or injustice has resulted to the railway companies in that country, where the statute law, in nearly every state, is identical with our own.\nIt cannot be fairly contended that the signals were only required by the statute to prevent persons travelling on the highway from coming into actual collision with the train, because, if the only purpose the legislature had in view in requiring the signals, were to prevent cases of actual collision, signals twenty feet from the crossing would have answered quite as well as signals eighty rods away.\nIt is of the greatest importance to the people of this country, travelling upon the public highways, that the signals required by the statute, to give warning of the approach of trains towards level crossings, should be in all cases strictly observed. See Redfield on Railways[8].\nIn the case of Slattery v. The Dublin and Wicklow Railway Co.[9], it is stated, at pages 1172 and 1175 of the report of that case, that the particular signal for warning people on the highway, which is required by statute, and no other, is what the traveller on the highway is entitled to depend upon.\nThere was no evidence of any contributory negligence, and the jury found there was none. The learned counsel also cited and commented on the following authorities:\nStewart et al v. Rounds[10]; Hill v. Portland and Rochester Railroad Co.[11]; The People v. The New York Central R.R. Co.[12]; Hill v. Louisville & Nashville R.R. Co.[13]; Dyer v. Erie Railway Co.[14]; Whitney v. Maine Central Railroad Co.[15]; Kelly v. St. Paul, Minn. & Man. R. Co.[16]; Renwick v. New York Central R.R. Co.[17]; Plummer v. Eastern R.R. Co.[18]; Daun v. Siffimins[19]; Rosenberger v. Grand Trunk Rwy. Co.[20]\nMr. James Bethune, Q.C. in reply.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nGWYNNE, J.:\u2014\nWe are all of opinion that this appeal should be dismissed. We entirely concur in the opinion of the learned judges of the Common Pleas division of the High Court of justice, and of the Court of Appeal of the Province of Ontario, namely, that the benefit of the 104th section, chap. 66 of the Consolidated Statutes of Canada, is not confined to the case of persons injured in person or property by actual collision with an engine or train crossing a highway. In the neighboring States, where a precisely similar enactment is inserted in railway companies Acts, the courts of law recognize no such limitation, and neither in the language of the clause, nor in reason, is there, in our opinion, anything which would justify such a limitation of the application of the clause. It clearly, as we think, applies to, and must be construed as inuring to, the benefit of all persons who, using the highway which is crossed by a railway on the level, receive damage, either in their persons or in their property, from the neglect of the railway company\u2019s servants in charge of a train to ring a bell or sound a whistle, as they are directed to do by the statute, whether such damage arises from collision or is occasioned in any other manner by the neglect referred to.\nThe learned judge, before whom the case was tried, submitted certain questions to the jury, accompanied by a most careful charge, of which the defendants have no just reason to complain, explaining the reason why each of such questions was put to them, so as to exclude all possibility of the jury failing to understand their object. He told them that the action was founded upon negligence in the defendants:\nIt is alleged, [he told them], that the railway company had a certain duty to perform, and that they neglected that duty, and that it was by reason of that neglect that the accident happened, and [he told them] to bear in mind these two or three principles, because all these things have to be established to entitle the plaintiffs to recover. They must satisfy you, [he said], not merely that the defendants neglected their duty, but that the neglect caused the injury. It is not sufficient for them to show that the railway company neglected to do something which by the statute they were bound to do; they must go further, and satisfy you that the injuries were in no degree caused by their neglecting something which they themselves should have done. I want you, [he said], to understand as clearly as I can explain it, the grounds upon which the plaintiffs, if entitled to recover, must establish their claim. They must show, before they are entitled to recover, that what has happened was brought about by no fault of their own\u2014not by neglect of any thing which they should have done, or which persons who were reasonably cautious and careful would have done under the same circumstances. It must appear that what happened to them was occasioned altogether by the fault of the company\u2014I mean, of the persons who were running the train and who represent the company for this purpose. The company, [he said] is bound to ring the bell or to sound the whistle, and that signal or one of those signals, it does not matter which, has to be repeated at short intervals, not kept continuously going, until the train crosses the highway, the signal to commence at the distance of eighty rods. The company are liable to a penalty if they neglect that duty, whether any person is hurt or not. It does not, however, follow, that if this duty is neglected that necessarily the person who suffers has a right of action. If a person neglects proper caution upon his part, if he has the means of seeing that the train is coming and if his own carelessness has something to do with bringing about the accident which occurs, he cannot excuse himself and claim damages against the railway company because they neglected to give the signals. If he could, by keeping his eyes and ears open, have protected himself, he cannot hold the company responsible. The case is not made out unless the jury are satisfied that the accident was caused altogether by the negligence of the company.\nWith these preliminary observations and farther observations to the like effect, he submitted to the jury the following questions. It was the duty, he said, of the persons in charge of the locomotive to sound the whistle or ring the bell at the distance of at least 80 rods from where the rails cross the highway, and to keep the bell ringing or the whistle sounding at short intervals, until the train had crossed the highway, and he put this question:\n1st. Has it been proved to your satisfaction that that duty was not performed? The learned judge further explained to the jury that he put the question in that shape because he was of opinion that the onus lay upon the plaintiffs to prove, not merely that the train frightened their horse, and so caused the damage, but that the whistle was not sounded nor the bell rung, and he added:\nIf you are satisfied, upon the evidence, that the whistle was not sounded nor the bell rung, either one or the other of them during this space of 80 rods, you will answer \u201cyes.\u201d If you are satisfied that the bell was rung or the whistle sounded during that distance, or if it is left doubtful, you should answer \u201c no,\u201d because the question is, are you satisfied that it was so?\n2nd Question.__If you find the signal was given, but not so far as 80 rods from the highway, would it have been heard by the plaintiffs if they had been careful and listening, so that they could have avoided the accident? Was there such signal as those people should have heard if they had listened?\nThe learned judge then drew the attention of the jury to the whole of the evidence bearing upon these two questions, in a very careful manner, and concluded that it was for the jury to weigh the probabilities and to decide upon the evidence as they should think proper. The evidence was certainly contradictory, but it was for the jury to say which side they believed, and there cannot be, nor is there, any complaint as to the manner in which it was left to them by the learned judge. The jury answered the first question in the affirmative, thereby establishing that they were satisfied that the bell had not been rung, nor the whistle sounded, as required by the clause of the statute. The second question they all answered in the affirmative, adding that by this answer they did not mean that the bell was rung. Conveying their meaning to be that if the signal required by the statute, which, by their answer to the 1st question, had not been given, had been given, it would have been heard by the plaintiffs, so as to have enabled them to avoid the accident. 3rd Question.\u2014Was it a prudent thing for the plaintiffs to have driven the horses they did where the railway had to be crossed?\nAnd he asked this question in view of the evidence given by witnesses who spoke as to seeing the plaintiffs when they started out.\n4th Question.\u2014Did the plaintiff use such care as a reasonably cautious person would, under the circumstances, have used in approaching the railway?\nThis question he accompanied with these further observtions:\nPeople, he said, are bound to use reasonable care. You are not to have in your mind\u2019s eye a timid woman or a rash man, but a person of reasonable caution, able to manage the horse and to drive. Did they act as such? Did they do anything they should not have done, or did they omit to do anything they should have done? Should they have stopped to listen? Did they omit to do anything that a reasonable person, under the same circumstances, would have done?\nThe jury answer these 3rd and 4th questions in the affirmative, thereby conveying their opinion to be, as I think, in view of the charge of the learned judge accompanying the question, we must understand them, that the plaintiffs were not guilty of any contributory negligence.\n5th Question.\u2014What ought they have done which they did not do?\nTo this question the jury gave no answer, from which circumstance the natural and fair inference is, that they could not say that the plaintiffs could have done anything to avoid the accident which they did not do. The learned judge, then, premising that there was still another question which he would put to them, and which touched the right of the plaintiff, to recover, and that was, did they stop their horse as soon as they knew that there was danger, put this 6th question:\nIf the plaintiffs had known the train was coming, would they have stopped the horse further from the railway? which question the jury answered in the affirmative. To the 7th question, which was as to the amount of damages the plaintiffs should receive, the jury answered that one should receive $600 and the other $500.\nNow, that these answers given to questions accompanied by such clear explanation from the learned judge of what, in his opinion, the jury should be satisfied before the plaintiffs could recover, were intended by the jury to be taken as a verdict for the plaintiffs, and that the entry of a verdict upon them for the plaintiffs by the learned judge was a proper entry, cannot, we think, admit of a doubt. It is, however, now objected by the learned counsel for the defendants that the 6th question is too vague to warrant the conclusion being drawn, from the affirmative answer of the jury, to it that the accident would not have happened, even if the signals required by the statute had been given, but admitting that this question might have been put more clearly we cannot, in view of all the questions and of the whole charge of the learned judge accompanying them, doubt that the intention of the jury by their answers to all the questions, taken as the whole, was to convey their opinion to be that the neglect of the defendants\u2019 servants to give the signals required by the statute to be given, was the sole cause of the accident; and that the plaintiffs were not guilty of any contributory negligence, and we think that the answers so given did warrant a verdict and judgment to be entered for the plaintiffs. When questions are submitted to a jury, as they were in this case, if counsel for the defendants should be of opinion that they are not framed so as to elicit answers which would enable the court thereupon to enter a verdict for the plaintiff or defendant, they should object at the time when, if necessary, the question or questions objected to or omitted could be amended or supplied, and if he fails to do so, he should not, after running the chance of the jury answering the questions put in a sense favorable to his client, and failing in that expectation, be heard to make the objection, unless at least the defect in the questions is so apparent that the ends of justice seem to demand their rectification. In the present case we do not think there is any such defect, or any such ambiguity as to how judgment should be entered upon the answers of the jury, as would require us to send this case to another jury. Upon the only objection which was taken by the learned counsel for the defendants, when the questions were submitted to the jury, namely, that the learned judge should have told the jury that the proximate cause of the accident being the appearance of the train, there is no cause of action, we are of opinion, that for the reasons given by the majority of the learned judges in the court below, this objection cannot prevail As to the point taken, that the findings of the jury are against the weight of evidence, we cannot say that this is so. The evidence was contradictory, no doubt, as in cases of this kind it always is, but two courts below have concurred in the opinion that the findings of the jury are not against the weight of evidence. To justify us in arriving at a contrary conclusion, the onus lies upon the defendants to establish their contention beyond all reasonable doubt, and this, it is sufficient to say, they have failed to do.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for appellants: John Bell.\nSolicitors for respondents: Bowlby & Clement.\n[1] 8 Ont.

Ritchie, C.J.; and Strong, Fournier, Henry and Gwynne, JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.\nArticles of partnership, construction of\u2014Partners, rights of.\nThe respondents having on hand large contracts to fulfil entered into partnership with the appellant under the style of J.W. & Co, The respondent A.P.M. subsequently filed a bill in Chancery against W. (the appellant) and his two sons copartners, asking for a decree declaring him and his two sons entitled to receive credit to the amount of $40,000, the estimated value of certain plant, etc., used in the construction of the works done by the partnership. The article in the deed of partnership executed before a notary public in the Province of Quebec, under which the respondent claimed\u2019 to be entitled to credit of $40,000, is as follows:\u2014\n\u201cThe stock of the said partnership consists of the whole of the plant, tools, horses and appliances now used for the construction of said works by the said parties of the first part A.P.M. & Sons; also all quarries, steam tugs, scows; and also all the rights in said quarries that are held by the said parties of the first part, or any of them, the whole of which is valued at the sum of $40,000, and is contained in an inventory thereof hereunto annexed for reference after having been signed for identification by the said parties and notary; but whereas the said plant, tools, horses, appliances, steam tugs, scows, quarries and other items had been heretofore sold by the said party of the first part to the firm of M. & W., of the city of Montreal, hardware merchants, to secure them certain claims which they had against the said A.P.M. & Co., for moneys used in the construction of the works referred to, to the extent and sum of about $24,000 and interest; and whereas the said J.W. has paid said amount of $24,000 and redeemed said plant, tools, horses and appliances and quarries, steam tugs and scows, &c., and now stands the proprietor of the same under a deed of conveyance; it is hereby well agreed and understood that the said plant, tools, horses and appliances that are or may be put on the said work shall be and continue to be the entire property of the said J.W. until such time as he shall have realized and received out of the business and profits of the present partnership a sum sufficient to reimburse him of the said sum of $24,000 and interest so advanced by him as aforesaid, as also any other sum or advances and interests which shall or may be paid or advanced to the present firm or partnership, after which time and event the whole of the said stock shall become the property of the said firm of J.W. & Co., that is to say: That one-half thereof shall revert to and belong to the parties of the first part, and the other half to the said party of the second part, as the said J.W. has a full half-interest in this contract and all its profits, losses and liabilities, and the said A.P.M., W.E.M. and R.M., parties of the first part, jointly and severally, the other half-interest in the same.\u201d\nThere was evidence that the plant had cost originally $57,000, and that it was valued in the inventory at $40,000 at the request of the appellant; it was also shown and admitted that the profits of the business, were sufficient to reimburse the appellant the sum of $24,000 and other moneys advanced, and that there was still a large balance to the credit of the partnership.\nHeld,\u2014(Henry and Gwynne, JJ., dissenting,) that the plant, &c., furnished by the respondents having been inventoried and valued in the articles of partnership at $40,000, the respondents had thereby become creditors of the partnership for the said sum of $40,000, but as it appeared by the said articles of partnership, that the said plant was subject at the time to a lien of $24,000, and that said lien had been paid off with the partnership moneys, the respondents were only entitled to be credited, as a creditors of the partnership, with the sum of $16,000, being the difference between the sum paid by the partnership to redeem the plant and the value at which it had been estimated by both parties in the articles of partnership.\nAPPEAL on behalf of James Worthington, one of the defendants in a suit of Macdonald v. Worthington, instituted in the Court of Chancery of Ontario, from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] which reversed the decree pronounced by the Court of Chancery, said decree having dismissed the plaintiff\u2019s bill with costs and said judgment in appeal having reversed said decree and granted the plaintiff a decree referring it to the master to take the usual partnership accounts, &c.\nThe bill in this cause was filed on 27th October, 1880, by Angus Peter Macdonald as plaintiff against the defendants Worthington and Macdonald. By articles of agreement bearing date the 29th March, 1875, the plaintiff and the defendants the Macdonalds entered into a partnership with the defendant Worthington; the 4th article of partnership, the only material one in this case, is given at length in the head-note. The bill was filed to have it declared that the plaintiff and the defendants Macdonald are under the agreement in question entitled to a credit of $10,000 in the books of the firm of Macdonald and Worthington, being the alleged value of the plant formerly owned by the plaintiff and the defendants the Macdonalds.\nThe bill asked that it should be declared that according to the true construction of the agreement the Macdonalds were entitled to this credit and in the alternative that if necessary the contract should be reformed by inserting a provision giving to the plaintiff and the defendants the Macdonalds credit for the said sum of $40,000.\nThe cause came on for trial before his lordship, Vice Chancellor Proudfoot. The Vice\u2011Chancellor was of opinion that according to the true construction of the contract the plaintiffs are not entitled to the credit of the $40,000 claimed by them. After hearing the evidence for the plaintiff his lordship was also of opinion that there was no evidence upon which the court would be justified in rectifying the contract.\nThe cause was heard in appeal before the Court of Appeal for Ontario and the said court granted a decree rectifying the agreement in question by inserting a provision to the effect that the plaintiff and the defendants Macdonald are entitled to a credit of $40,000, the value of the said plant. From this decision the present appeal was brought.\nMr. C. Robinson, Q.C., and Mr. J.R. Metcalfe for appellant, and Mr. D. McCarthy, Q.C, and Mr. H. Cameron for respondents.\nThe points relied upon and authorities cited by counsel sufficiently appear in the judgments hereinafter given.\nRITCHIE, C.J.:\u2014\nThe Bill in this cause was filed on 27th October, 1880, by Angus Peter Macdonald, as plaintiff, against the defendants Worthington and Macdonald. By articles of agreement bearing date the 29th March, 1875, the plaintiff and the defendants the Macdonalds entered into a partnership with the defendant Worthington. The fourth article of the partnership deed being as follows:\u2014\nARTICLE FOURTH.\nThe stock of the said partnership consists of the whole of the plant, tools, horses and appliances now used for the construction of said works, by the said party of the first part; also all quarries, steam tugs, scows; and also all the rights in said quarries that are held by the said party of the first part, or any of them, the whole of which is valued at the sum of forty thousand dollars, and is contained in an inventory thereof hereunto annexed for reference after having been signed for identification by the said parties and notary; but whereas the said plant, tools, horses and appliances, steam tugs, scows, quarries and other items had been heretofore sold by the said party of the first part to the firm of Morland & Watson, of the City of Montreal, hardware merchants, to secure them certain claims which they had against the said A.P. Macdonald & Company, for moneys used in the construction of the works referred to, to the extent and sum of about twenty-four thousand dollars and interest; and whereas the said James Worthington has paid said amount of twenty-four thousand dollars and redeemed said plant, tools, horses and appliances and quarries, steam tugs and scows, &c., and now stands the proprietor of the same under a deed of conveyance; it is hereby well agreed and understood that the said plant, tools, horses and appliances that are or may be put on the said work shall be and continue to be the entire property of the said James Worthington until such time as he shall have realized and received out of the business and profits of the present partnership a sum sufficient to reimburse him of the said sum of twenty-four thousand dollars and interest so advanced by him as aforesaid, as also any other sum or advances and interests which shall or may be paid or advanced to the present firm or partnership, after which time and event the whole of the said stock shall become the property of the said James Worthington & Company\u2019 that is to say: The one-half thereof shall revert to and belong to the party of the first part, and the other hal to the said party of the second part, as the said James Worthington has a full half-interest in this contract and all its profits, losses and liabilities, and the said A.P. Macdonald, W.E. Macdonald and Randolph Macdonald, parties of the first part, jointly and severally the other half-interest in the same.\nThe bill was filed to have it declared that the plaintiff and the defendants Macdonald are, under the agreement in question, entitled to a credit of $40,000 in the books of the firm of Macdonald & Worthington, being the alleged value of plant formerly owned by the plaintiff and the defendants he Macdonalds.\nThe bill asks that it should be declared that according to the true construction of the agreement, the Macdonalds are entitled to this credit, and in the alternative that, if necessary, the contract should be reformed by inserting a provision giving to the plaintiff and the defendants, the Macdonalds, credit for the said sum of $40,000. The cause came on for trial before his lordship, Vice-Chancellor Proudfoot. The Vice-Chancellor was of opinion that according to the true construction of the contract, the plaintiff is not entitled to the credit of the $40,000 claimed by them. After hearing the evidence for the plaintiff, his lordship was also of opinion that there was no evidence upon which the court would be justified in rectifying the contract\nThe cause was heard in appeal before the Court of Appeal for Ontario, and the said court upheld the decision of the Vice-Chancellor, so far as the construction of the contract is concerned, but reversed his decision on the other branch, and granted a decree rectifying the agreement in question by inserting a provision to the effect that the plaintiff and the defendants Macdonald are entitled to a credit of $40,000, the value of the said plant. From this decision the present appeal is brought.\nI do not think, in this case, any question of reforming the contract arises. I think the clear intention of the parties to be gathered from the deed and the surrounding circumstances and acts of the parties was, that this plant was to be taken into the partnership as capital and the amount was carefully fixed and inventoried for that purpose after full discussion, it being Macdonalds\u2019 interest to get its value established at a high, and Worthington\u2019s, on the contrary, at a low rate.\nI can discover nothing whatever to indicate that Mr. Worthington was to have a bonus for entering into the co-partnership, nor that the plant was to be a present to him, on the contrary the care that was taken to estimate and fix the value of the plant, and to have it duly inventoried in accordance with the principles of the law regulating partnership matters in the Province of Quebec, in reference to capital contributed by individual partners which consume by use or deteriorate by keeping, or which are contributed at a fixed valuation, shows conclusively that the plant, less the amount due Morland, Watson & Co., was to be treated as put in by the Macdonalds, to be accounted for to them on the final winding up of the partnership accounts, It is, in my opinion, now a mere question of the taking of a partnership account, Macdonald being, in my opinion, entitled to a credit on account of the plant, but not to the amount of $40,000 as claimed.\nThe value of plant was arbitrarily fixed and inventoried at $40,000, in my opinion, for the express purpose of establishing that sum as the amount to be taken into the capital account of the partnership.\nThis plant was subject to a payment to Morland, Watson & Co. of $24,000 advanced by them to Macdonald, and they held the property in security for the re-payment of such advances.\nThis sum Worthington agreed to advance to discharge Morland, Watson & Co\u2019s. claim, to be repaid by the partnership out of the profits to be made from the contract. Worthington did advance this amount and was repaid in the manner contemplated, and when so repaid to that extent, the partnership, not the individual partners, was interested in the plant as a partnership capital asset, which both parties in effect contributed, having been to that extent paid for by the earnings to which each were equally entitled. This left the difference between the $24,000 thus paid and the $40,000, or $16,000 as capital put into the partnership to be credited to the individual partner by whom it was contributed, who, clearly was Macdonald, to whom the plant belonged, minus the amount of Morland\u2019s claim which the firm discharged, and for which Macdonald would be no more entitled to be credited than Worthington, the amount having been paid by earnings of the concern in which they were equally interested.\nThe judgment, therefore, of the Appeal Court was, in my opinion, wrong in adjudging that Macdonalds were entitled to a credit of $40,000 instead of for $16,000, being the full amount of any individual interest they had in the plant, and, therefore, the only amount they contributed to the capital or for which they are entitled to a credit.\nSTRONG, J.:\u2014\nThe contract of partnership between the parties to this cause was entered into at Montreal in the Province of Quebec, and was in the form of a notarial deed duly passed before a Notary Public. The parties were all resident at Montreal, and as nothing appears in the evidence to the contrary we must presume that they were also domiciled there. The rule locus regit actum therefore applies to the contract and the construction of it, and the rights of the parties thereunder are to be governed by the law of Quebec. That law is, however, according to the general rule, to be presumed to be the same as the law of Ontario, the lex fori, except in so far as it is established by the evidence to be different from it[2]. Whether the evidence does sufficiently show what the law of Quebec applicable to this contract is, is a matter of some doubt[3]. Two witnesses were called for this purpose, who appear to be competent to prove that law as experts. One of them is Mr. Normandeau, the notary who prepared the deed, the other was the late Mr. Ritchie, a distinguished advocate and Queen\u2019s counsel of the Quebec bar, practising at Montreal. They do not state what the law of the Province of Quebec upon the points involved is, but merely refer to the Civil Code of Lower Canada, as containing in the title on partnership, the law which regulates the rights of parties under contracts like the present. The authorities before cited seem to show that it is not sufficient proof of foreign law thus to produce a Code or Statute, without showing by the evidence of experts, what the written law so referred to actually establishes. But it may be that, as this court is an Appellate Court having to determine the law of Quebec on appeals from that Province, we ought to follow the example of the House of Lords, which in an appeal from Scotland will take judicial notice of the law of England, and will not consider itself bound by the evidence of that law given to the courts in Scotland[4]. I am of opinion, however, that we need not now decide this preliminary question, for after the best consideration I have been able to give this case, it does not appear to me that it makes any practical difference whether we apply the law of Quebec or the English law prevailing in the Province of Ontario, inasmuch as the legal results must be the same under either system. I will then first consider the questions presented for our decision according to the principles of English law. In taking partnership accounts, Lord Hardwicke lays it down that: \u201cEach is entitled to be allowed as against the other everything he has advanced or brought in as a partnership transaction\u201d[5]. This is of course only meant to be applied prim\u00e2 facie, and is a rule liable to be excluded by the agreement of the parties, which agreement again may be shown either by the express terms of the contract or by implication. There is here no dispute so far as certain material facts are concerned. The Macdonalds had these two contracts with the government. They admitted the appellant to a partnership with them for the purpose of carrying out the works to be performed under the contracts. The shares of the partners in profit and loss were accurately ascertained by the articles to be equal as between the appellant on the one side and the Macdonalds, father and sons, on the other. The only question is whether the plant, which Was valued, in a inventory intended to be annexed to the deed, at $40,000, and which was requisite for carrying on the works, and which at the time of the formation of the partnership, was the property of the Macdonalds, is to be regarded as having been contributed by them to the new firm as a bonus or capital for which they were not to be entitled to any credit in account, or whether it is to be considered as having been sold by them to the firm for $40,000, and that as a con sequence they are entitled to receive credit in taking the accounts for this $40,000. Prim\u00e2 facie, if there had been no valuation and no agreement as to the value or price of this plant, I take it to be clear that it would have remained the property of the Macdonalds. There is, however, an express provision in the 4th article of the partnership deed, that it shall become partnership property, and the shares which the partners are to have in it are expressly defined. This was an unnecessary provision, as the law would have implied precisely what the articles state, namely, that in this as in all other partnership assets, the shares are as between the appellant, on the one hand, and the three Macdonalds on the other hand, to be equal. The 4th article declares that this plant \u201cis valued at the sum of $40,000 and is contained in an inventory thereof hereunto annexed for reference after having been signed for identification by the said parties and notary.\u201d The question is then reduced to this: does this valuation taken in connection with the surrounding circumstances, and with the presumption that all parties are to be entitled to an allowance in account for what they bring into the partnership, except in so far as they are expressly excluded from the right to such an allowance, indicate that the Macdonalds were to be entitled to a credit for the amount of this valuation. And I am of opinion that upon a fair interpretation of these articles of part- nership, this is the true construction of this fourth article. The plant in question was indispensible for the purposes of the new firm, to enable them to continue their works, and if they had not purchased the old plant of the Macdonalds, they must have procured it elsewhere. If no provision had been made that the property in the plant should vest in the firm, it would have remained the property of the Macdonalds, and though they might have permitted the firm to use it, at the termination of the partnership they would have been entitled to the exclusive possession of it. Then, for what purpose can it be suggested that this valuation was affixed to the plant, if it was not to show that the amount of the valuation was to be considered a contribution by the Macdonalds to the capital of the firm? The only answer given to this is, that we are to assume that the Macdonalds intended to give the appellant a bonus of $20,000 to come into the partnership. Nothing in the articles themselves warrant any such assumption, the probabilities, as forcibly pointed out in the judgment of the learned Chief Justice of the Court of Appeal, are all against it, and from the history which we have in the evidence of the negotiations which preceded the conclusion of the agreement, such a proposition never appears to have been made by either party. Then the bargaining which took place between the parties preceding the passing of the deed respecting the amount of the valuation, which was first placed by the Macdonalds at $57,130, was objected to by the appellant, and afterwards reduced to $40,000 to meet his views, can be explained in no other way but upon the hypothesis that a sale of the plant by the Macdonalds to the firm was what was intended by both parties. It has been argued that by the agreement thus construed, the appellant would be placed under a great disadvantage, and would, in effect, be paying a premium for his admission to the partnership. That no such consequence follows is, I think, manifest from the consideration that the plant being obviously requisite for carrying on the works, the same amount of capital as that for which it was purchased from the Macdonalds would have been, in any event, necessarily expended in acquiring it. The fourth article of the partnership deed must therefore be construed upon the principle of the maxim \u201c\u0152stimatio facit venditionem\u201d a rule which has an extensive application in French law, with which alone the notary who prepared the deed was familiar, and which is particularly applied to cases like the present, when capital brought into the partnership by one of the partners, not in money but in property, which is handed over in specie, is inventoried and valued[6], in which case, says Troplong, the valuation is taken to show that the intention of the contracting parties has been to render the partnership a debtor for the valuation affixed in the inventory instead of for the things themselves. If, however, I am wrong in the conclusion that the respondents are entitled to this credit, upon the construction of the articles, or rather as a matter of account not excluded by the articles, I entirely agree with the learned Chief Justice of the Court of Appeal that the evidence is amply sufficient to entitle the respondents to a rectification of the deed. The barganing which took place prior to the execution of the articles respecting the valuation, the respondents holding out for the higher amount of their original valuation and the appellant insisting on an abatement, clearly shows that they placed themselves towards each other, as regards this plant, in the attitudes of sellers and buyer, and can only be accounted for on that supposition, and excludes the inference that the plant was to be a gratuitous contribution to the capital by the respondents. A difficulty about rectification, however, arises from this deed having been a notarial instrument executed in the Province of Quebec, which, according to the law of that Province, must remain in the repository of the notary, and cannot be altered except upon a peculiar proceeding known to the law there called, \u201cInscription de faux\u201d or improbation. The original cannot, therefore, be produced for the purpose of rectification, and I do not see how a rectification of the mere notarial copy can be substituted for it. I observed that the order of the Court of Appeal says nothing aboat rectification, although the judgment of the learned Chief Justice certainly points to that as the proper relief to be given.\nIn the view I take, however, the order of the Court of Appeal is perfectly correct in directing, not a variation of the deed, but that the master, in taking the account, should give credit to the respondents for the amount of the valuation. I do not, however, agree that the amount for which credit should be given should be the full amount of the inventory value without any deduction by way of debit. Considering, as I do, that this was in effect a sale of this property by the respondents to the partnership firm to be regarded for this purpose, according to the mercantile notion, as a distinct legal entity from the individual partners composing it, we find that the price was $40,000, but then, on account of this price, a sum of $24,000 has already been paid by the partnership. This $21,000 was the amount for which Morland, Watson & Co. held a charge upon the plant, at the date of the partnership agreement, to secure which amount\u2014and in order, I suppose, to get over the difficulty occasioned by the impossibility, according to the law of Quebec, of validly hypothecating movables\u2014a formal sale of the plant had been made to them upon the terms that they should re-sell it to the respondents upon their debt of $24,000 being paid off. This $24,000 was in the first place paid by the appellant, and for this amount he was afterwards recouped by the partnership. It is clear, therefore, that of the original price of $40,000 which the partnership was to pay as the price of this plant, $24,000 has actually been paid, leaving a residue of $16,000 only unpaid, and the respondents have, therefore, only a right to a credit for this amount, for it cannot, of course, be pretended, in the face of the valuation, that the $40,000 was to be allowed over and above the $24,000 due to Morland, Watson & Co. The order of the Court of Appeal should, therefore, be varied by inserting $16,000 instead of $40,000, or by adding a direction to the master to charge the respondents with the amount paid out of the partnership assets to Morland, Watson & Co.\nIf we are to consider the law of the Province of Quebec as governing the case, either because it is sufficiently in evidence from Mr. Ritchie having deposed that it was contained in the Code, or for the reason that the Ontario courts ought to take judicial notice of that law, inasmuch as the Code derives its force from and is in effect part of a statute of the late Province of Canada, or for the reasons already referred to, that this court should follow the precedent afforded by the practice of the House of Lords in Scotch appeals, I think it will make no difference in the result. The general provisions of the Code as to the interpretation of contracts contained in the articles 1013 to 1021, inclusive, with a few exceptions not applicable here, lay down the same rules as those which apply to the construction of contracts according to the law of England. In taking the account at the dissolution of the partnership and making the partition of the property of the partnership (art. 1898) each partner is entitled to be credited with what he has brought into the partnership, unless his right to such a credit is excluded by agreement, or (according to some authors, whose opinions are again controverted by others)[7], by a presumption which is to be made in the particular case of one partner alone putting in capital and contributing nothing else, and the other only contributing his services,\u2014a case with which we have nothing to do under the facts now before us.\nAnd according to the interpretation placed on art. 1846, property contributed to the partnership at a fixed valuation (as in the present case), is considered to be sold to the partnership upon an application of the rule \u0153stimatio facit venditionem, which is well explained by Troplong in No. 595 of his Contrat de Soci\u00e9t\u00e9. The law of Quebec, if we ought to apply it, which, however, I doubt, would therefore lead to the same result in all respects, with the single exception of relief by way of rectification, as the English law.\nI am of opinion that the order of the Court of Appeal should be varied by reducing the amount for which the respondents are entitled to credit for $16,000, and that subject to this variation the order should be affirmed.\nI think there should be no costs on either side, either here or in the Court of Appeal, both parties having failed in establishing the propositions for which they contended.\nFOURNIER, J.:\u2014\nA.P. McDonald, l\u2019Intim\u00e9, ayant un contrat avec le gouvernement pour des travaux sur le canal de Lachine s\u2019\u00e9levant \u00e0 au del\u00e0 d\u2019un million de dollars, et \u00e9prouvant des difficult\u00e9s s\u00e9rieuses \u00e0 se procurer les moyens p\u00e9cuniaires pour en poursuivre l\u2019ex\u00e9cution, fit des d\u00e9marches pour trouver un associ\u00e9 qui p\u00fbt faire les avances de fonds n\u00e9cessaires. Apr\u00e8s quelques tentatives inutiles aupr\u00e8s de capitalistes \u00e9trangers, il s\u2019adressa, \u00e0 la suggestion de C.J. Brydges, \u00e0 l\u2019Appelant et entra en n\u00e9gociations avec lui pour la formation d\u2019une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 pour la continuation des travaux en question. Les conditions d\u2019arrangement furent d\u00e9battues avec soin, et surtout celle relative \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9valuation du stock d\u2019outillage (plant) qui fait l\u2019objet de la difficult\u00e9 en cette cause.\nL\u2019Intim\u00e9 qui avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 d\u00e9pens\u00e9 tant en travaux pr\u00e9paratoires qu\u2019en travaux d\u2019ex\u00e9cution de ce contrat une somme de $190,000, avait un grand int\u00e9r\u00eat \u00e0 conserver son contrat.\nDans le cours de ses travaux, l\u2019Intim\u00e9 ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 oblig\u00e9 d\u2019emprunter une somme de $24,000 de MM. Morland Watson et Cie, marchands de Montr\u00e9al, leur fit une vente de son outillage sous forme de nantissement et de s\u00fbret\u00e9 collat\u00e9rale pour le remboursement de la somme emprunt\u00e9e. D\u2019apr\u00e8s ses conditions avec Morland, Watson et Cie, l\u2019Intim\u00e9 avait le droit de rentrer en possession de sa propri\u00e9t\u00e9 en les remboursant; mais lors de ses n\u00e9gociations avec l\u2019Appelant, il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas en \u00e9tat de le faire. C\u2019est ce qui l\u2019amena \u00e0 faire avec ce dernier les conditions consign\u00e9es dans l\u2019art. 4 de l\u2019acte de soci\u00e9t\u00e9 ainsi con\u00e7u[8].\nOn voit que la premi\u00e8re partie de cet article contient la d\u00e9claration que le fonds social \u201cThe Stock of the said partnership\u201d consiste dans tout l\u2019outillage alors employ\u00e9 dans la construction des dits travaux par la partie de premi\u00e8re part au dit acte, l\u2019Intim\u00e9 et ses deux fils associ\u00e9s; il en est de m\u00eame des carri\u00e8res, remorqueurs, etc, et aussi des droits dans les dites carri\u00e8res poss\u00e9d\u00e9es par la dite partie de premi\u00e8re part, le tout d\u00e9sign\u00e9 dans un inventaire sign\u00e9 par les deux parties et le notaire, et \u00e9valu\u00e9 \u00e0 $40,000. En d\u00e9clarant que cet outillage composait le fonds social, \u00e9tait-ce l\u2019intention des parties que cette mise de l\u2019Intim\u00e9 entr\u00e2t dans la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 pour devenir un objet commun, ou bien cette mise devait-elle \u00eatre pr\u00e9lev\u00e9e par l\u2019Intim\u00e9 avant partage des b\u00e9n\u00e9fices?\nOrdinairement ceux qui contractent une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 s\u2019expliquent sur la proportion et la nature de leurs mises respectives On ne peut pr\u00e9sumer que les apports sont \u00e9gaux que dans le cas o\u00f9 les parties ont gard\u00e9 le silence \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard. Dans le cas actuel, l\u2019Intim\u00e9 McDonald a-t-il suffisamment d\u00e9termin\u00e9 son apport au fonds social pour conserver le droit de le reprendre \u00e0 la dissolution de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9? Il semble avoir pris toutes les pr\u00e9cautions n\u00e9cessaires \u00e0 cet effet.\nLe contrat de soci\u00e9t\u00e9 dont il s\u2019agit ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 pass\u00e9 dans la province de Qu\u00e9bec, doit, suivant la maxime locus regit actum, \u00eatre r\u00e9gi par les principes du C.C. de cette province. L\u2019art. 1846 contient au sujet des choses mises dans la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 une disposition particuli\u00e8re \u00e0 laquelle les parties, d\u2019apr\u00e8s leurs proc\u00e9d\u00e9s, paraissent s\u2019\u00eatre conform\u00e9es. Il y est d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que celles qui sont mises dans la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 sur estimation arr\u00eat\u00e9e, sont aux risques de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9. Or, celle-ci n\u2019est tenue aux risques que parce qu\u2019elle devient propri\u00e9taire en vertu de l\u2019estimation. L\u2019associ\u00e9 qui a contribu\u00e9 de cette mani\u00e8re au fonds social devient cr\u00e9ancier de la somme fix\u00e9e par l\u2019estimation qui d\u00e9termine le montant de son apport. Comme il s\u2019agissait dans le cas actuel d\u2019un outillage susceptible de diminuer de valeur par l\u2019usage, ou comprend tout l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat que l\u2019Intim\u00e9 avait \u00e0 le faire entrer dans la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 une valeur d\u00e9termin\u00e9e. Cette pr\u00e9caution prise, il ne compromettait nullement sa position en d\u00e9clarant que le fonds social se composait de l\u2019outillage en question, car il en avait fait une vente en faveur de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 au prix de l\u2019estimation arr\u00eat\u00e9e qui servirait au moment de la liquidation \u00e0 r\u00e9gler ses droits. La preuve en cette cause fait bien voir que c\u2019est r\u00e9ellement la transaction qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite.\nCet outillage avait co\u00fbt\u00e9 $57,000 et ce n\u2019est qu\u2019apr\u00e8s de longs d\u00e9bats qu\u2019il fut convenu d\u2019en porter l\u2019\u00e9valuation \u00e0 $40,000, non \u00e0 $57,000. Pourquoi s\u2019arr\u00eater \u00e0 ce chiffre si le stock en question devait devenir propri\u00e9t\u00e9 commune des associ\u00e9s et si l\u2019Intim\u00e9 devait en faire le sacrifice. Le but \u00e9vident de la part de celui-ci \u00e9tait d\u2019obtenir cr\u00e9dit pour son stock avant partage, de m\u00eame que le but de l\u2019Appelant en le faisant r\u00e9duire de $57,000 \u00e0 $40,000 \u00e9tait de diminuer le montant des pr\u00e9l\u00e8vements \u00e0 faire sur les b\u00e9n\u00e9fices lors de la liquidation. Cette premi\u00e8re partie de l\u2019art. 4 me semble avoir simplement mis \u00e0 la disposition de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 le stock en question, sans que l\u2019on puisse en induire une renonciation de la part de l\u2019Intim\u00e9 au droit d\u2019en \u00eatre cr\u00e9dit\u00e9 lors de la dissolution de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9. Le soin tout particulier qu\u2019il a pris de faire d\u00e9terminer son apport confirme cette interpr\u00e9tation, qui d\u2019ailleurs est conforme non\u2011seulement \u00e0 l\u2019art. 1846, C.C, mais aussi \u00e0 la doctrine expos\u00e9e par les commentateurs sur l\u2019art. 1851 C. N. qui contient les m\u00eames dispositions que l\u2019art, de notre code.\nLaurent[9] s\u2019exprime ainsi au sujet des choses apport\u00e9es dans la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 sur estimation.\nEnfin les choses sont encore aux risques de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9, quoiqu\u2019elle en ait la jouissance, lorsqu\u2019elles ont \u00e9t\u00e9 mises dans la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 sur une estimation. Nous avons dit, ailleurs, que l\u2019estimation vaut vente quand les parties contractantes ont int\u00e9r\u00eat \u00e0 ce qu\u2019il en soit ainsi; on suppose dans ce cas que leur intention est de transporter la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 des choses qui doivent \u00eatre restitu\u00e9es par celui qui les re\u00e7oit. L\u2019article 1851 interpr\u00e8te en ce sens l\u2019estimation que font les associ\u00e9s des choses dont ils mettent la jouissance dans la soci\u00e9t\u00e9, sauf \u00e0 eux \u00e0 d\u00e9clarer que l\u2019estimation ne vaut pas vente. Comme la loi parle de choses en termes g\u00e9n\u00e9raux, il faut d\u00e9cider qu\u2019elle s\u2019applique aux immeubles aussi bien qu\u2019aux meubles\u2026\nComment l\u2019estimation doit-elle se faire? L\u2019article 1851 suppose que l\u2019estimation est port\u00e9e dans un inventaire. Tous les auteurs s\u2019accordent \u00e0 dire que ce n\u2019est pas l\u00e0 une condition; elle n\u2019aurait pas de raison d\u2019\u00eatre. Il suffit que l\u2019estimation se fasse d\u2019un commun accord, n\u2019importe dans quelle forme; elle doit se faire de commun accord, parce que c\u2019est sur l\u2019intention des parties; contractantes que la loi se fonde pour d\u00e9cider que l\u2019estimation vaut vente.[10]\nQuel est le droit de l\u2019associ\u00e9? L\u2019article 1851 r\u00e9pond que si la chose a \u00e9t\u00e9 estim\u00e9e, l\u2019associ\u00e9 ne peut r\u00e9p\u00e9ter que le montant de son estimation. Il est r\u00e9put\u00e9 vendeur et, \u00e0 ce titre, il est cr\u00e9ancier du prix.\nTroplong. Droit civil expliqu\u00e9\u2014Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 civile\u2014parle de l\u2019effet de l\u2019estimation dans les termes suivants[11]:\nLa quatri\u00e8me et derni\u00e8re exception a lieu, quand la chose dont la jouissance a \u00e9t\u00e9 mise dans la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 estim\u00e9e (3, Pothier 126). C\u2019est le cas d\u2019appliquer la maxime; estimtio facit venditionem. L\u2019estimation fait supposer (\u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s comme dans le cas de l\u2019article 1551 du Code civil) que la pens\u00e9e des contracteurs a \u00e9t\u00e9 de rendre la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9bitrice de la pris\u00e9e, et non pas de la chose m\u00eame.\nDuranton[12], apr\u00e8s avoir pos\u00e9 le principe que les choses dont la jouissance seulement a \u00e9t\u00e9 mise dans la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 la charge de l\u2019associ\u00e9, passe en revue les diff\u00e9rentes exceptions qu\u2019il re\u00e7oit soit \u00e0 raison de la nature des choses, soit \u00e0 raison de l\u2019intention exprim\u00e9e ou pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e des parties. A la quatri\u00e8me exception en parlant des choses mises sur estimation, dit:\n40. Lorsque les choses, m\u00eame autres que celles qui se consomment par le premier usage, et quoique simplement mises dans la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 pour la jouissance, ont \u00e9t\u00e9 mises sur une estimation port\u00e9e par un inventaire, ou dans l\u2019acte m\u00eame de la seci\u00e9t\u00e9, il est clair que la perte de ces choses concerne aussi la soci\u00e9t\u00e9, et non l\u2019associ\u00e9.\nDans ce cas l\u2019associ\u00e9 ne peut r\u00e9p\u00e9ter que le montant de l\u2019estimation.\nApr\u00e8s avoir expliqu\u00e9 qu\u2019il n\u2019y aurait pas de distinction \u00e0 faire dans le cas o\u00f9 il s\u2019agirait d\u2019immeuble, et le cas ou il s\u2019agirait de simples meubles il fait la remarque que, Les d\u00e9t\u00e9riorations et la simple d\u00e9pr\u00e9ciation concernent la soci\u00e9t\u00e9, et non l\u2019associ\u00e9, puisque celui-ci a conf\u00e9r\u00e9 la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de la chose \u00e0 la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 par cette estimation, quoiqu\u2019il ait entendu n\u2019y metre seulement que la jouissance du montant de l\u2019\u00e9valuatien, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire, dans l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, le droit d\u2019en faire le pr\u00e9l\u00e8vement lors du partage.\nMcDonald en faisant entrer son outillage dans la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 sur estimation se r\u00e9servait donc en r\u00e9alit\u00e9 le droit de pr\u00e9lever le montant de l\u2019estimation lors du partage. Il agissait en cela d\u2019apr\u00e8s l\u2019usage assez g\u00e9n\u00e9ral des soci\u00e9t\u00e9s de commerce dans lesquelles les mises sont rarement confondues quant \u00e0 la propri\u00e9t\u00e9. Le plus souvent chaque associ\u00e9 retire annuellement les int\u00e9r\u00eats de la mise lorsque la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 a suffisamment de fonds pour ses op\u00e9rations.\nJe ne vois pas qu\u2019il puisse y avoir doute sur l\u2019intention des parties en faisant l\u2019estimation du plant; mais dans le cas o\u00f9 il y en aurait, il faudrait d\u2019apr\u00e8s l\u2019autorit\u00e9 de Duranton[13] chercher \u00e0 d\u00e9couvrir l\u2019intention probable des parties; et, pour la conna\u00eetre, il y a lieu \u00e0 consid\u00e9rer l\u2019importance relative des mises. Comme illustration de la solution qu\u2019il donne dans le cas en faveur de la reprise de l\u2019apport il offre le cas suivant:\nSupposons d\u2019abord (dit-il), que tous les associ\u00e9s aient fait une mise en derniers ou autres biens en d\u00e9clarant qu\u2019ils mettaient ou promettaient de mettre dans la soci\u00e9t\u00e9, l\u2019un tel objet, l\u2019autre telle autre chose, un troisi\u00e8me telle sommes, sans autres explications, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire sans d\u00e9clarer que c\u2019est en propri\u00e9t\u00e9 ou en jouissance seulement que consistent les mises. Si l\u2019acte de soci\u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9clare que les contractants auront chacun telle part (\u00e9gale ou in\u00e9gale, n\u2019importe) dans les profits ou dans les pertes il nous para\u00eet \u00e9vident que l\u2019on a voulu s\u2019associer que pour le profit ou la perte; que la jouissance seulement, et non la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 des mises, a \u00e9t\u00e9 commune, et d\u2019apr\u00e8s cela, que chacun doit, \u00e0 la dissolution de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9, retirer son apport, soit en nature, si la chose exist encore dans la soci\u00e9t\u00e9, soit la valeur si elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 vendue ou consomm\u00e9e, ou si elle a p\u00e9ri pour le service de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9.\nIl y aurait encore bien moins de doute si les objets mis par chacuu des associ\u00e9s avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 estim\u00e9s et que les mises fussent \u00e9videmment in\u00e9gales. Cette derni\u00e8re observation s\u2019applique tout particuli\u00e8rement au cas actuel,\u2014McDonald et ses fils ayant apport\u00e9 $40,000 au fonds social, tandis que Worthington ne s\u2019oblige qu\u2019\u00e0 faire des avances au montant de $24,000 dont il devrait \u00eatre rembours\u00e9 sur les profits de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9.\nA la page 439, Duranton cite encore le cas suivant pour faire voir que les parties ont entendu que la jouissance seulement des capitaux serait commune et qu\u2019il y aurait lieu \u00e0 leur pr\u00e9l\u00e8vement.\nMais supposons que Paul et Pierre aient contract\u00e9 soci\u00e9t\u00e9 pour cinq ans et qu\u2019il ait \u00e9t\u00e9 convenu que Paul y verserait 30,000 francs et Pierre seulement 10,000 fr. avec son industrie ou son travail ou simplement qu\u2019il fournirait son industrie ou son travail; s\u2019il a \u00e9t\u00e9 dit dans le contrat que chacun des associ\u00e9s aurait telle part (\u00e9gale \u00e0 celle de l\u2019autre ou non, n\u2019importe) dans les profits ou dans les pertes, il n\u2019y a pas non plus de difficult\u00e9 dans ce cas, car il est \u00e9vident que les parties ont entendu que la jouissance seulement des capitaux serait commune, puisque c\u2019est dans les profits ou dans les pertes qu\u2019elles ont r\u00e9gl\u00e9 les parts, et que le fonds des mises n\u2019est point un profit: il y aura donc lieu au pr\u00e9l\u00e8vement des sommes mises par chacun d\u2019eux, ou par l\u2019un d\u2019eux seulement, et les b\u00e9n\u00e9fices s\u2019il y en ase partageront suivant les proportions convenues[14].\nLes autorit\u00e9s ci-dessus cit\u00e9es auxquelles il est facile d\u2019en ajouter un grand nombre d\u2019autres \u00e9tablissent positivement le droit de l\u2019associ\u00e9 de pr\u00e9lever le montant de l\u2019estimation des choses qu\u2019il a apport\u00e9es au fonds social. Ainsi, d\u2019apr\u00e8s l\u2019article 4 de l\u2019acte de soci\u00e9t\u00e9, et conform\u00e9ment aux autorit\u00e9s l\u2019Intim\u00e9 a droit d\u2019\u00eatre cr\u00e9dit\u00e9 pour sa mise. Il en devrait \u00eatre de m\u00eame d\u2019apr\u00e8s l\u2019autorit\u00e9 de Duranton et les exemples qu\u2019il en donne, lorsque les circonstances font voir que l\u2019intention des parties a \u00e9t\u00e9 de ne mettre en commerce que la jouissance et non la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 des capitaux. L\u2019acte de soci\u00e9t\u00e9 et la preuve ne permettent pas de douter que l\u2019intention de l\u2019Intim\u00e9 \u00e9tait d\u2019\u00eatre cr\u00e9dit\u00e9 pour le montant de l\u2019estimation, Mais d\u2019apr\u00e8s l\u2019article 4 et les circonstances dans les. quelles a \u00e9t\u00e9 form\u00e9 le contrat de soci\u00e9t\u00e9 en question, si l\u2019Intim\u00e9 avait ou non le droit de faire les stipulations qu\u2019il a faites au sujet de son stock, il ne faut pas oublier qu\u2019il existait sur ce stock en faveur de Morland, Watson & Co, un droit de gage au montant de $24,000, Pour retirer ce stock des mains de ces derniers, il fut convenu par le dit acte que l\u2019appelant ferait les avances de fonds n\u00e9cessaires\u2014c\u2019est ce qu\u2019il a fait en payant la somme de $24,000 au moyen de laquelle il est alors devenu lui-m\u00eame et devait devenir propri\u00e9taire de ce stock sous les modifications mentionn\u00e9es en l\u2019art. 4, jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce qu\u2019il e\u00fbt retir\u00e9 des profits de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 une somme suffisante pour se rembourser des $24,000 et int\u00e9r\u00eats par lui avanc\u00e9s ainsi que de toute autre somme qu\u2019il aurait pu avancer pour la dite soci\u00e9t\u00e9. La soci\u00e9t\u00e9 ayant r\u00e9alis\u00e9 des b\u00e9n\u00e9fices, l\u2019appelant a \u00e9t\u00e9 rembours\u00e9 de ses avances \u00e0 m\u00eame les b\u00e9n\u00e9fices de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9. Que devient dans ce cas le stock qui \u00e9tait jusqu\u2019alors conditionnellement sa propri\u00e9t\u00e9? L\u2019article 4 d\u00e9clare qu\u2019il a cess\u00e9 de lui appartenir pour devenir la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9. Quel est le v\u00e9ritable sens de cette disposition? Apr\u00e8s la d\u00e9claration faite au sujet de l\u2019\u00e9valuation du stock indiquant clairement l\u2019intention de l\u2019Intim\u00e9 d\u2019en obtenir cr\u00e9dit, peut-on raisonnablement croire qu\u2019il s\u2019est d\u00e9sist\u00e9 de ses pr\u00e9tentions et que dans cette derni\u00e8re partie de l\u2019art. 4, il fait enfin le sacrifice de son stock en l\u2019abandonnant \u00e0 la soci\u00e9t\u00e9? Mais cet abandon de sa part \u00e9tait d\u00e9j\u00e0 fait par suite de l\u2019effet l\u00e9gal de l\u2019estimation; au lieu du stock il n\u2019avait plus qu\u2019une cr\u00e9ance, le montant de l\u2019estimation. Ce n\u2019est pas l\u2019Intim\u00e9 mais bien l\u2019appelant qui, devenu temporairement propri\u00e9taire du stock en question, par l\u2019acquittement de la cr\u00e9ance de Morland, Watson & Co., s\u2019en dessaisit en faveur de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 sur remboursement de ses avances comme il \u00e9tait tenu en vertu du dit art. 4. Ce droit de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 n\u2019a rien de contraire \u00e0 la premi\u00e8re partie de l\u2019art. 4 qui reconna\u00eet \u00e0 l\u2019Intim\u00e9 une cr\u00e9ance de $40,000 en \u00e9change de ses droits dans ce stock. Par le\u2019 remboursement des avances faites par l\u2019appelant elle en est irr\u00e9vocablement devenue propri\u00e9taire, mais elle n\u2019en est pas moins d\u00e9bitrice de l\u2019estimation, c\u2019est \u00e0-dire que dans le cas de liquidation elle doit tenir compte \u00e0 l\u2019Intim\u00e9 de son apport.\nMais quel doit \u00eatre le chiffre r\u00e9el de cet apport, sera-t-il de $40,000 comme l\u2019a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 la Cour d\u2019Appel, ou bien n\u2019est-il pas, dans les circonstances o\u00f9 il a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait, sujet \u00e0 une diminution? On sait que le stock \u00e9tait grev\u00e9 d\u2019une dette de $24,000, acquitt\u00e9e temporairement par l\u2019appelant. Dans ce cas l\u2019estimation de l\u2019apport ne devrait-elle pas \u00eatre diminu\u00e9e d\u2019autant? Je le crois.\nAubry et Rau.[15], Cours de droit civil fran\u00e7ais:\nD\u2019un autre c\u00f4t\u00e9, chaque associ\u00e9 a le droit de reprendre en nature, avant tout partage, les objets qu\u2019il n\u2019avait mis en commun que pour la jouissance. Si ces objets ont p\u00e9ri ou ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9t\u00e9rior\u00e9s sans la faute des autres associ\u00e9s, celui qui les a apport\u00e9s n\u2019a droit \u00e0 aucune indemnit\u00e9. (Art. 1851, al. 2.) Il en est cependant autrement, lorsqu\u2019il s\u2019agit, soit de chose dont on ne peut user sans les consommer naturellement ou civilement, soit de chose qui, d\u2019apr\u00e8s une convention expresse, ou d\u2019apr\u00e8s leur nature et le but de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9, \u00e9taient destin\u00e9es \u00e0 \u00eatre vendues. Dans ces deux cas l\u2019associ\u00e9 a droit au pr\u00e9l\u00e8vement de la valeur au moment de la dissolution de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9, des choses qui ont p\u00e9ri, et \u00e0 une indemnit\u00e9 \u00e0 raison des d\u00e9t\u00e9riorations qu\u2019auraient subies celles qui existent encore. (Art. 1851, al. 2.) Du reste, les propositions qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8dent, sont \u00e9trang\u00e8res \u00e0 l\u2019hypoth\u00e8se o\u00f9 des objets quelconques, mis en commun pour la jouissance seulement, ont \u00e9t\u00e9 apport\u00e9s sur estimation. Dans ce cas l\u2019associ\u00e9 qui les a apport\u00e9s, a toujours droit au pr\u00e9l\u00e8vement de l\u2019estimation, et ne peut jamais r\u00e9p\u00e9ter que ce prix. (Art. 1851.)\nD\u2019apr\u00e8s l\u2019art. 1851 (1846) l\u2019apport en jouissance est attributif de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 au profit de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 dans les cas suivants: 1. Apport de choses qui se consomment; 2. De choses qui se d\u00e9t\u00e9riorent en les gardant; 3. De choses destin\u00e9es \u00e2 \u00eatre vendues; 4. Enfin de choses mises en soci\u00e9t\u00e9 sur estimation.\nCe qui est pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment le cas dans la pr\u00e9sente cause. Voir d\u2019apr\u00e8s les auteurs quel est l\u2019effet de cette estimation et le droit qui en r\u00e9sulte pour la partie qui Ta stipul\u00e9e, etc, Aubry et Rau, Cours de droit civil fran\u00e7ais.\nMarcad\u00e9 et Pont, Explication du code civil[16]:\n4. Des choses mises dans la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 sur une estimation port\u00e9e dans un inventaire.\u2014De ces choses encore, il est vrai de dire que, quoique apport\u00e9es pour la jouissance, elles deviennent la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 par l\u2019intention pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e des parties. L\u2019estimation qui en est faite constitue en quelque sorte une vente qui rend la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 propri\u00e9taire, \u00e0 la charge de payer, quand elle prendra fin, le prix arbitr\u00e9 entre elle et l\u2019associ\u00e9 au moment o\u00f9 elle s\u2019est form\u00e9e.\nA la page 283, No. 401:\nLes cons\u00e9quences \u00e0 d\u00e9duire de l\u00e0 ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9j\u00e0 souvent formul\u00e9es.

D\u2019une autre part l\u2019associ\u00e9 n\u2019\u00e9tant plus qu\u2019un simple cr\u00e9ancier, non de la chose m\u00eame qu\u2019il est cens\u00e9 avoir vendue, mais de la valeur, il en r\u00e9sulte que, quoi qu\u2019il arrive et soit que la chose existe encore en nature \u00e0 la dissolution, soit que, pour une cause quelconque, elle n\u2019existe plus, il ne pourra jamais avoir droit qu\u2019au pr\u00e9l\u00e8vement du prix.\nL\u2019apport social est sans doute mati\u00e8re de convention. Il peut \u00eatre en propri\u00e9t\u00e9 ou en jouissance seulement. Cette derni\u00e8re esp\u00e8ce a lieu en quatre cas principaux r\u00e9gl\u00e9s par l\u2019art. 1846.\nPothier, Contrat de soci\u00e9t\u00e9,[17] d\u2019o\u00f9 l\u2019Article 1846 a \u00e9t\u00e9 extrait presque textuellement, apr\u00e8s avoir parl\u00e9 de l\u2019apport de corps certains et d\u00e9termin\u00e9s, des choses qui ne se consomment pas par l\u2019usage, dit:\nAu contraire, si ces choses qu\u2019un associ\u00e9 a mises dans la soci\u00e9t\u00e9, \u00e9taient des choses qui se consomment ou se d\u00e9t\u00e9riorent en les gardant, ou qui fussent destin\u00e9es \u00e0 \u00eatre vendues, et qui eussent \u00e9t\u00e9 mises dans la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 sous une certaine estimation port\u00e9e par quelque inventaire, l\u2019associ\u00e9, qui les y a mises pour que l\u2019associ\u00e9 en e\u00fbt seulement la jouissance, est cr\u00e9ancier, non des choses m\u00eames, mais de la somme \u00e0 laquelle monte l\u2019estimation qui en a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite, et les choses sont aux risques de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 et non aux siens.\nC\u2019est \u00e0 ce dernier avis que je m\u2019arr\u00eate comme \u00e9tant le plus propre \u00e0 concilier les diverses parties de l\u2019article 4 de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 donner \u00e0 chacune d\u2019elle un effet plus conforme \u00e0 l\u2019intention des parties.\nEn cons\u00e9quence je suis d\u2019avis que le jugement de la Cour d\u2019Appel d\u2019Ontario devrait \u00eatre r\u00e9duit de la somme de $40,000 \u00e0 celle de $16,000\nHENRY, J.:\nThe respondent in this case filed a bill in the Court of Chancery in Ontario against the appellant asking for a decree declaring him and his two sons, W.E. and Randolph, entitled to receive credit to the amount of $40,000, the estimated value of certain plant and effects transferred by Morland, Watson & Co., to the appellant, to be used in the execution of a contract in the Province of Quebec, taken by the appellant, in which he was interested to the extent of one moiety, and the respondent and his sons to the extent of the other moiety, under certain articles of agreement entered into between them before a notary; or, if found necessary, for a decree to reform the contract.\nThe fourth article of the contract under which the respondent seeks to recover is as follows:\n[The learned judge read art. 4 of the agreement ubi supra]\nIt is shown and admitted that out of the business funds of the partnership the appellant was repaid the $24,000 and interest advanced by him, and in that event the plant, &c., by the terms of the agreement, became the property of the partnership, but the respondent claims that it virtually became the property of him and his sons. It cannot be denied, for it is patent on the face of the agreement, that the appellant, in the words of the article I have quoted, was to have \u201ca full half interest in this contract and all its profits, losses and liabilities.\u201d If, therefore, there was a loss he was to bear one-half of it, and, in case of a profit, he was to benefit in it to the extent of one-half. Out of the sum of the profits he was entitled to receive one-half, but the plant, &c., being under a lien, he and his co\u2011partners each paid one-half of what was sufficient to redeem it. Had it not been redeemed by the partnership funds it would have been the sole property of the appellant. If the property in the plant had remained in Morland & Watson, and had been purchased from them by the partnership as it was by the appellant, it would be owned by the members of the co\u2011partnership according to their several interests. This is exactly what the agreement provides to be the result in case of the purchase by the firm from the appellant.\nIf the law in Quebec prohibited parties from entering into such an agreement as to the ownership of the plant, &c., after the payment of the $24,000 and interest to the appellant as that shown by the article, we would hen have to consider the interests, according to law, of the several co-partners. To admit and give effect to the contention and claim of the plaintiff we should be compelled to award to him and sons property to the value of $40,000, for the purchase of which the appellant had at least paid one-half the purchase money. By the law in Quebec the respondent and his sons had virtually no interest in or title to the property in question, except the right to the use of it under certain limitations before the purchase of it by the appellant. The respondent and his sons were in straitened circumstances and unable to proceed with their contract, or to redeem the property from Morland & Watson, when the appellant came to their relief as far as necessary to enable them to continue it, and not only to recoup the losses they appear to have previously sustained, but to participate in future net profits. Equity and law would at least require them, under the circumstances, to repay to the appellant the moiety he contributed out of the partnership funds towards the repayment of the $24,000 and interest he advanced to Morland & Watson. The respondent might as well have claimed any other property purchased by the firm, and for which the appellant contributed half the cost. The agreement, however, is too plain and comprehensive to admit of a doubt that after the appellant was paid out of the partnership funds the amount he paid Morland, Watson & Co., with interest, he was to own one-half the property. This shows that the $40,000 named as the assets of the partnership was really not Macdonalds but had to be purchased by the partnership. The parties by this agreement declare that to be the destination of it in the most unequivocable and plain terms, and I cannot see how any one could fairly read it any other way. The property being valued at $40,000 was held for $24,000. The interest in it of the respondent and his sons was but $16,00, putting the case most favorably for them. They paid the half of the $24,000, and for that they claim to charge the appellant in account for $40,000, when their whole interest could not amount to over about $28,000; but the agreement entered into by them shows they were willing to take one-half interest in lieu of any claim they had. On that claim, I am of opinion, our judgement should be for the appellant. If the parties had made no special agreement as to the advance by the appellant of the $24,000 to pay off the claim of Morland & Watson, he, having paid that sum, would have been a creditor of the partnership to that amount, and he having one-half interest in the partnership, and that sum having been repaid to him by the partnership, his equitable interest in the stock, plant, &c., would be $12,000, and that of the respondent and his sons $28,000, and not $40,000, as his claim. By the agreement entered into, however, a different result is provided. It is there agreed that he is the sole owner of the stock, plant, &c., and that if he should be repaid the amount advanced by the partnership, it was agreed that he shall be the owner of the half interest in it and the respondent and his sons of the other half. To adjudge any other interest in the latter, or to allow them to rank on the partnership funds for anything beyond their half interest in the stock, plant, &c., would be in direct opposition to the provision made in the agreement and would be giving the respondent and his sons an interest contrary thereto. We need not inquire into their reasons, but several good ones are suggested by the circumstances at the time, why the Macdonalds entered into those stipulations? It is enough that they are easily understood and they negative the claim of the respondent The respondent, however, claims that the articles do not contain the agreement really entered into and seeks to have it reformed.\nThe reformation of a contract by a Court of Equity requires the exercise of the most extreme care and caution, and \u201cto substitute a new agreement for one which the parties have deliberately subscribed, ought only to be permitted upon evidence of a different intention and of the clearest and most satisfactory description,\u201d as held by Lord Chelmsford in Fowler v. Fowler[18].\nIn McKenzie v. Coulson[19], Vice-Chancellor Sir W. James said:\nCourts of equity do not rectify contracts. They may and do rectify instruments purporting to be made in pursuance of the terms of contracts. But it is always necessary for a plaintiff to shew that there was an actual concluded contract antecedent to the instrument, and which is sought to be rectified; and that such contract is inaccurately represented in the instrument. And again:\nIt is impossible for this court to rescind or alter a contract with reference to the terms of the negotiations which preceded it * * * Men must be careful if they wish to protect themselves, and it is not for this court to relieve them from the consequences of their own carelessness.\nMr. Justice Story, in his treatise on equity jurisprudence[20], says:\nRelief will be granted in cases of written instruments, only where there is a plain mistake clearly made out by satisfactory proof.\nHe also says:\nIt forbids relief where the evidence is loose, equivocal, or contradictory, or it is in its texture open to doubt or to opposing presumptions. The proof must be such that will strike all minds alike as being unquestionable and free from reasonable doubt.\nLord Thurlow, in one case, said that\u2014\nThe evidence must be strong, irrefragable evidence[21].\nI am of opinion, for the reasons I have stated, that the appeal should be allowed, the judgment of the Appeal Court of Ontario reversed, and the decree of the Court of Chancery confirmed with costs.\nGWYNNE, J.:\u2014\nThe plaintiff and his sons, the defendants, Edwin Macdonald and Randolph Macdonald, being in partnership together as contractors, and having contracts with the Dominion Government for the construction of certain public works situate within that portion of the Dominion of Canada constituting the Province of Quebec, became indebted to Morland, Watson & Co., and to divers other persons for monies advanced to the plaintiff and his said sons to enable them to proceed with the performance of the said contracts.\nTo secure their debt to Morland, Watson & Co. they executed, in accordance with the law of the Province of Quebec, a bill of sale of the plant which they had for carrying on such works. By force of the law prevailing in the Province of Quebec this bill of sale vested in Morland, Watson & Co. the absolute property in all the plant so sold to them, that law recognizing no mortgage of chattel property. It was intended, however, that to enable the plaintiff and his said sons to carry on the works which they had contracted to execute, they should have the use of the plant so sold by them to Morland, Watson & Co. A clause was therefore introduced into the bill of sale of the plant, to the effect that in order to secure repayment of the advances made and to be made by Morland, Watson & Co., they should have the possession and control of all the property and effects mentioned in the bill of sale, by the agency of some person employed by them, but paid by the plaintiff and his sons. Accordingly, Morland, Watson & Co. appointed one McCracken, a person in the employment of the plaintiff, as their agent, and delivered the said chattels to him to retain possession for them of all the said plant and effects while the plaintiff and his sons should have the use of them to enable them to proceed with the execution of the said works. In the month of January, 1875, the plaintiff and his sons being then indebted to Morland, Watson & Co. in the sum of $24,000 for monies advanced upon the security of the said bill of sale, the time for re-payment of which had arrived, and being also largely indebted to divers other persons, and being so straitened in their circumstances that without considerable pecuniary assistance they could not fulfil their contracts, became anxious to obtain the assistance of a man of capital and credit to join them as a co-partner; and this, their desire, having been communicated to the defendant, Worthington, through a mutual friend of his and of the plaintiff, negotiations for the formation of such a co-partnership were entered into between the plaintiff and Worthington. Such negotiations resulted in an agreement that a partnership should be formed between the plaintiff and his sons and Worthington in the event of their being able to procure the cancellation by the Government of the contracts then in existence, under which the plaintiff and his sons were carrying on the said works, and a new contract for the completion of the same to be given to the new firm, which should be known by the name of James Worthington & Co. It was a term in the negotiations that the defendant Worthington should procure to himself an assignment and transfer from Morland, Watson & Co. of all the plant and effects so as aforesaid sold and conveyed to them by the bill of sale executed by the plaintiff and his sons.\nThe government having agreed to cancel the old contracts, and the defendant, Worthington, having procured a deed to be executed by Morland, Watson & Co., whereby all the plant and effects so as aforesaid sold and conveyed to them, were sold and conveyed to, and vested in the defendant Worthington, partnership articles, by notarial deed, in accordance with the law of the Province of Quebec, where the works were situate and where the contract of partnership was entered into, were drawn up and executed in due form of law by and between the plaintiff and his sons, of the one part, and the defendant Worthington, of the other part, bearing date the 29th day of March, 1875, whereby, after reciting the previous contracts under which the plaintiff and his sons had been carrying on the said works, and that they had been cancelled and a contract for the completion of the same had been given by the government to James Worthington & Co., bearing date the same 29th day of March, it was declared and agreed that the above plaintiff and his sons described therein as parties of the first part to the said instrument had agreed to contract a partnership with the defendant Worthington, described therein as the party thereto of the second part, for the prosecution and completion of the said works, under the name, style and firm of James Worthington & Co., under and subject to the conditions thereinafter set forth, the 4th article of which conditions was as follows:\n[The learned judge then read article 4[22].]\nNow, it is to be observed that this article, in very plain terms and in strict accordance with the law prevailing in the Province of Quebec, recites the fact to be, that by a deed executed by Morland, Watson & Co. to the defendant Worthington, the latter had become and then was the proprietor of all the plant, property and effects which had been sold to Morland, Watson & Co. by the plaintiff and his sons, and it is declared to have been well agreed and understood that the same and all other plant, &c., &c., which might be put on the said works should be and should continue to be the entire property of the defendant Worthington, until he should be repaid, out of the profits of the partnership then formed, the said sum of $24,000 and interest, paid by him to Morland, Watson & Co., and all other sums which he should or might advance to or for the said firm, and that upon such re-payment the said plant, property and effects, which are enumerated in an inventory and valued therein at $40,000, and for the purpose of identification signed by the parties and the notary, should then, and not sooner, become the property of the members of the firm of James Worthington & Co., in equal moities, one of such moities to be the joint property of the plaintiff and his sons and the other the property of the defendant Worthington. In this manner and upon this sole condition, namely, re-payment to Worthington of his advances out of the business and profits of the firm of James Worthington & Co., in which the defendant Worthington is declared to have a full half interest, does the property which the defendant Worthington had purchased from Morland, Watson & Co., and which was then his property and not the property of the plaintiff and his sons, become the property of the co\u2011partnership.\nThe works in respect of which the co-partnership was formed having been completed, the plaintiff has filed his bill, claiming that in the taking of the partnership accounts he and his sons are entitled to receive credit to the amount of $40,000, the estimated value of the said plant and effects so as aforesaid assigned and transferred by Morland, Watson & Co., to the defendant Worthington, before the profits of the said partnership, if any there be, divisible between the plaintiff and his sons of the one part, and the defendant Worthington of the other part, can be ascertained in the same manner as if the said plant, property and effects had been brought into the co-partnership as the capital and property of the plaintiff and his sons, and no special provision in respect thereof had been inserted in the articles of co-partnership; and he alleges that it was never contemplated or intended that the defendant Worthington should have a half interest in the said property without first giving credit to the plaintiff and his said sons, for the said sum of $40,000; and that the defendant Worthington has no right whatever to make such claim without first giving such credit, and the plaintiff contends that such is the true construction of the articles of partnership of the 27th March, 1875, as the same are framed, or it not, that the said articles should be reformed and rectified so as to conform with such contention of the plaintiff, which, he alleges, was the true intention of all the parties to the said articles of co-partnership, and such in substance is the first and main part of the prayer of his bill.\nThe defendant Worthington, by his answer, utterly denies the plaintiff\u2019s contention, and upon oath alleges that during the negotiations which he had with the plaintiff, with a view to the formation of the said co-partnership, the plaintiff and his said sons were in great financial embarrassment, and unable to complete the works mentioned in the plaintiff\u2019s bill, and in consequence of such embarrassment became obliged either to abandon the said works and forfeit their outlay in the performance of the contracts, or else to obtain the assistance of some person of capital and credit to carry out and complete the same; and he alleges that being a person of capital and credit sufficient to complete the works, and after repeated offers by the plaintiff to give to him one-half interest in the said contracts and in the said plant and stock in consideration of his assistance, he, the said defendant, agreed to the formation of the said co-partnership, and that the same was entered into by the defendant Worthington upon the express condition and understanding with the plaintiff and his said sons, that all the plant and stock set forth in the inventory annexed to the articles of co-partnership should be brought into the partnership upon the defendant Worthington being reimbursed all his advances in acquiring the same from Morland, Watson & Co., and otherwise, and that thereupon he should own and have one undivided half interest in the said plant and stock, and that such undivided half interest and property of him the said Worthington therein, was the consideration of his agreeing to enter into the said co-partnership and to pay off and discharge the said liabilities of the plaintiff and his sons to Morland, Watson & Co. and others, their creditors, and to assist them with his capital and name and credit, to carry on and complete the said works, and that it was fully understood by the plaintiff and his said sons, that the said plant and stock were to become assets of the said co-partnership firm in manner and for the consideration aforesaid, and that it never was contemplated or intended that the defendant Worthington should be chargeable with or accountable for, or that the plaintiff and his said sons were to get credit for the said sum of $40,000, as alleged in the plaintiffs bill. The learned Vice-Chancellor Proudfoot, before whom the case was tried, was of opinion that the articles of partnership were not open to the construction that was contended for by the plaintiff, that he was to get credit for the $40,000 on the taking of the partnership accounts, the effect of which credit, if given, would be to make Worthington to pay something over $12,000 as consideration for his being admitted as a partner, without his having any share or property in the plant and stock in which he is, by the articles, expressly given a half interest upon the purchase, by the co-partnership firm, of such plant and stock, by payment to Worthington, out of the business and profits of the firm, of the amount advanced by him to acquire such plant and stock from Morland, Watson & Co., and as to that part of the bill which prayed for a rectification of the articles, he was of opinion that in the face of the clear denial by the defendant, upon his oath, of the plaintiff\u2019s allegations, no case for the rectification of the instrument had been made out; in fact, he was of opinion, that the whole dealing of the parties seemed to support the defendant Worthington\u2019 s allegation of the intention of the parties rather than that of the plaintiff, and being of opinion that the plaintiff had failed to establish the case made by his bill, he made a decree dismissing the plaintiff\u2019s bill. The learned judges of the Court of Appeal for Ontario concurred with the learned Vice-Chancellor in the opinion that it was impossible to construe the articles of co-partnership otherwise than as an agreement, that upon the defendant Worthington being paid by the partnership the amount paid by him to Morland, Watson & Co. for the said plant and stock, one-half of such plant and stock and only one-half should belong to the plaintiff and his sons, and the other half to Worthington; but while admitting that the rule as to the rectification of instruments upon the ground of mistake was that the mistake must be mutual, and that the evidence in support thereof should be of the clearest and most satisfactory nature, they were of opinion that the evidence adduced in this case not only preponderated in favor of the plaintiff\u2019s contention, but that it was, in truth, of such weight and cogency as to exclude all reasonable doubt that the agreement, as stated by the plaintiff, was the true agreement entered into between the parties, and they, therefore, reversed the decree of V.C. Proudfoot and made a decree for rectification of the articles of partnership, by the insertion of a clause giving to the plaintiff and his sons credit in the accounts of the firm for the said sum of $40,000, the value of the plant, materials and appliances mentioned in the inventory annexed to the articles of partnership. The learned Chief Justice of the Court of Appeal who delivered the judgment of the court admitted, in his judgment, that the effect of the judgment would be to make Worthington pay over $12,000 for admission into the co-partnership; and in arriving at the conclusion which he announced as the judgment of the court, he rested that judgment upon the discussion, which, during the negotiations for the partnership, he considered to have been proved to have taken place between the parties as to the value of the plant. \u201cThis matter as to the value of the plant,\u201d (he says in his judgment) \u201cis a piece of conduct on the part of Worthington which he regarded as a piece of evidence of the greatest weight, inasmuch as he thought it was consistent with no other theory than that the Macdonalds were to be entitled, as between themselves and the firm, to be credited with the agreed value of the stock as so much capital brought in by them to the partnership.\u201d\nTo alter the articles of partnership which have been deliberately signed and sealed by all the parties thereto, by the insertion therein of a clause having an effect so diametrically opposite to that which, in the opinion of the courts, the articles, as executed, in plain terms express, and which terms, as the defendant Worthington swears, correctly express not only his intention but that of all the parties to the articles at the time of their execution, appears to me to be the making of a wholly new contract for the parties and not the rectification of an instrument purporting to express the contract which was entered into between the parties, by the insertion therein of a clause clearly established to have been omitted by mutual mistake.\nIf, as appears to me to be very clear, the language of the articles of partnership is so plain as to exclude, as both of the courts below have held, any other construction than that the plaintiff and his sons were to have one clear half interest in the plant, stock, &c., if and when\u2014and only when\u2014the co-partnership firm should, out of its business and profits, pay and reimburse to Worthington the amount advanced by him to purchase them from Morland, Watson & Co., until which time they were, by the law of the Province in which the plant was, and in which the contract was entered into, the exclusive property of Worthington, it is, in my judgment, impossible to conceive how, in view of the care and attention attending the preparation of the contract and the reading of it over by the notary to the parties, clause by clause, before execution, a contract having an effect so diametrically opposed to that which the plaintiff now contends was the real intention and agreement of all the parties thereto could have ever been assented to and signed by the plaintiff.\nThe enquiry into the value of the stock and plant by Worthington, and the difference of opinion and discussion in relation thereto, upon which the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario is rested, took place at the very commencement of the negotiations between the parties, and had relation, as I think plainly appears, to a very rational desire in Worthington to know the real value of the security which, by becoming purchaser of the plant and stock by a conveyance thereof executed by Morland, Watson & Co., he should have for his advances, in case the works which were the subject of the contemplated partnership should prove to be unprofitable. It was very natural, as it appears to me, that he should be satisfied that the value set upon the security should not be in excess of its real value, fairly estimated, and that he should have an opportunity of considering whether the probable advances which he might be called upon to make should be in excess of the fair value of the proposed security. The scheme of the partnership was that Worthington should, as the first step to be taken, acquire by purchase from Morland, Watson & Co., the absolute property in the plant and stock, to which, in case the proposed partnership should prove to be unprofitable, he should look as his sole security for the advances which he was to make in carrying on the works; but in the event of the partnership works proving to be profitable, the scheme was that the partnership firm of James Worthington & Co. should reimburse Worthington his advances and so acquire the plant and stock which then, and then only, were to cease to be the exclusive property of Worthington and to become the property of the firm, Worthington himself thus paying half of the monies applied to such purpose. Now, the inventory having been made and the value of the plant and stock arrived at, for the purpose of satisfying Worthington as to the value of the security he should have for his contemplated advances, and the articles of partnership, providing that the firm, upon reimbursing him his advances, should become the owners of the plant which should thus become partnership property, as the inventory had to be referred to for the purpose of identifying the articles which should thus become partnership property, it was not at all extraordinary that the notary should have referred to them in the manner in which he has in the articles, or that he should have mentioned in the articles the value at which the plant and stock so to become the new stock of the partnership were valued in such inventoy.\nInasmuch as the first step towards the formation of the partnership was to make Worthington proprietor of the plant and stock of which the Macdonalds had the use only by their agreement with Morland, Watson & Co., they were the parties chiefly interested in having provision made in the articles for divesting Worthington of the property in the plant and stock acquired by him by conveyance from Morland, Watson & Co.; it was natural, therefore, that they should be anxious as to the provision made in the articles, as to the plant, upon the co\u2011partnership paying Worthington the amount of his advances, and thus, as it appears to me, is naturally explained the anxiety upon this head alleged to have been exhibited at the time of the signature of the articles by one of the plaintiffs sons, who, in the language of the notary (whose version of the matter, though not very clear, is safer to rely upon than that of the plaintiff\u2019s son himself) enquired of him whether the clause in the articles as to the plant was plain enough that it was for the benefit of the partnership. Now, in the articles it is very clearly expressed that upon payment of his advances to Worthington by the partnership firm out of its business and profits, the plant and stock, &c., shall belong to the co-partners in equal shares; that is to say, one-halt to the Macdonalds, and the other half to Worthing ton, who, in such case, should pay for his half $12,000 or one-half of whatever the amount of his advances over and above that sum was; and it seems to me so much more reasonable and so much more in accordance with the undisputed facts of the case that Worthington should pay such sum, as the articles executed by the parties make him pay, for a half interest in deteriorating property of the then estimated value in the whole of $40,000, and which at the close of the works for which the partnership was formed, appear to be worth only about $20,000, than that he should pay so considerable a sum to enable the plaintiff and his sons to acquire a right to obtain a credit in the taking of the partnership accounts of $40,000 to Worthington\u2019s prejudice, while neither in the articles nor in the negotiations leading to the formation of the partnership, does anything signifying such an intention appear, that I entirely agree with the learned Vice-Chancellor Proudfoot in the opinion that no case for rectification of the articles has been made. I can attach no such weight as the Court of Appeal has done to the enquiry and discussion as to the value of the plant and stock, which appear to me to have been quite consistent with Worthington\u2019 s declaration of the intention of the parties. But, however difficult the court might find it to be to ascertain with certainty the object with which the valuation of the plant was made and referred to in the articles of co-partnership, it is impossible, in my opinion, consistently with the practice of the court and the doctrine upon which it proceeds in rectifying signed agreements upon the ground of mutual mistake of the parties\u2019 thereto, to introduce into the articles of partnership in this case, signed and executed as they were with great deliberation, a provision of the nature asked by the plaintiff, in the face of the peremptory denial of the defendant, that any such intention or any such agreement as is averred by the plaintiff was ever entertained or concurred in by him, or that any such intention was ever expressed to be entertained by the plaintiff, and when we find the terms of the partnership which the parties had agreed expressed in the articles of partnership in such a clear, explicit and unequivocal manner as to exclude all idea of such intention having been entertained, and to make it impossible to conceive how the partnership articles could have been signed by the plaintiff and his sons, if, in truth, such an intention had been entertained.\nA view has been suggested, however, by a majority of this court, which was not suggested by the plaintiff in his bill, and which, in my judgment, is directly at variance with the case as made in the bill, and which was not suggested on the plaintiff\u2019s behalf in the argument of his learned counsel before us, namely, that in the taking of the partnership accounts Macdonald & Sons should have a credit given to them for $16,000 instead of the $40,000, as claimed by themselves. We have no authority whatever, in my judgment, to justify us in directing, by an order of this court, a thing to be done in the interest of the plaintiff, as if agreed upon by the parties to the partnership articles which the plaintiff himself, by his bill, admits and shows never was agreed to, and which is different from what he says was, in fact, agreed to. All that we have to do, in my judgment, is to determine what is the true construction of the contract entered into between the parties, as appearing in the articles of partnership deliberately executed in notarial form; and whether or not, by mutual mistake something has been inserted therein or omitted therefrom which makes the instrument purporting to express the agreement to appear to be different from what the agreement and contract of the parties in fact was, and from what was the real intention of both parties that the instrument should express.\nIt was not contended before us that the true construction of the articles of partnership, as executed, is, that the Macdonalds are entitled to have credit for $16,000 instead of the $40,000, as claimed in the bill. The sole contention was, that in respect of the plant in question they were entitled to have creditor $40,000, as in fact agreed upon by the parties, and not for any other and different sum. A decree that in the taking of the partnership accounts they shall have credit given to them for $16,000 cannot, in my judgment, be supported upon the basis that such credit is warranted by the express terms of the contract, as executed. Such a direction is, in my judgment, in direct conflict with the express terms of the contract, apparently prepared with great care and deliberation, and of this opinion were both of the courts below.\nThen, under the other branch of the prayer of the plaintiff\u2019s bill, namely, that the instrument purporting to express the contract of the parties may be rectified by the insertion therein of a provision, as if omitted by mutual mistake, we cannot give any such direction. For a direction that a credit shall be given to one of the parties to a contract, which neither party pretends ever was agreed upon and which is at Variance with what the plaintiff avers was agreed upon, certainly cannot be justified upon the ground of a mutual mistake in the omission of such a provision from the instrument purporting to express the contract of the parties. If, then, a direction that the Macdonalds shall, in the taking of the partnership accounts have the credit of $16,000, is neither warranted by a true construction of the contract as signed, and there is no agreement alleged by the plaintiff to have ever been made that they should have credit for such amount, while the plaintiff does allege an wholly different agreement, which the defendant peremptorily and unequivocally denies upon his oath, I am unable to understand upon what principle the direction can be supported. I entirely concur with the Court of Appeal for Ontario, that unless the plaintiff and his sons are entitled to the credit for the whole of the $40,000, as claimed by their bill, they cannot have credit given to them for a part of such sum, and I entirely concur with the judgment of the learned Vice-Chancellor Proudfoot, that they are not entitled to credit for the $40,000 or any part thereof, either upon the construction of the articles of partnership or upon any other ground whatever.\nIt was not contended, in the argument before us, nor in any stage of this cause, that, nor from anything that I have heard does it appear that there is any difference between the law of the Province of Quebec and that of the Province of Ontario, affecting the principles governing the construction of written contracts, or governing the rectifying or re-modelling instruments purporting to express, but which by mutual mistake fail to express what the parties in reality intended to express; and if there be any difference in the proceedings of the courts of these Provinces for effecting the latter purpose, which would present a difficulty to the courts in Ontario rectifying an instrument executed in notarial form in the Province of Quebec, that difficulty is quite unimportant as regards the case before us\nThe proper decree to be made, in my opinion, is, that upon, taking of the accounts of the co\u2011partnership (which may be taken under a decree, if the plaintiff desires it) the plaintiff and his sons are not entitled to be credited with the said sum of $40,000, as claimed by the plaintiff, but that he and his sons together are entitled to one moiety of the plant and stock, and the defendant, Worthington, to the other moiety thereof; and that the appeal should be allowed with costs, and that the plaintiff shall pay to the defendant Worthington, all his costs incurred in the case in the Court of Chancery, and that further considerations and further costs should be reserved.\nOrder of Court of Appeal varied.\nSolicitor for appellant: J.R.

J. Ritchie, C.J., and Strong, Fournier, Henry and Taschereau JJ.\nOn Appeal From The Supreme Court Of British Columbia.\nContract of towage, liability under\u2014Sea damage\u2014Joinder of defendants\u2014Right of a saw mill company to let to hire a steam tug\u2014Liability limited\u201425 and 26 (Imp.) ch. 63\u201431 Vic. ch. 58, sec. 12\u2014Motion for judgment\u2014Findings of jury not against weight of evidence\u2014Practice\nThe B. C. T. Co. entered into contract of towage with S. to tow the ship Thrasher from Royal Roads to Nanaimo, there to lcad with coal, and when loaded to tow her back to sea. After the ship was towed to Nanaimo, under arrangement between the B. C. T. Co. and the M. S. Co., the remainder of the engagement was undertaken between the two companies, and the M. S. Co.'s tug boat, Etta White, and the B. C. T. Co's tug, Beaver, proceeded to tow the Thrasher out of Nanaimo on her way to sea, the Etta White being the foremost tug. Whilst thus in tow the ship was dragged on a reef, and became a complete wreck. The night of the accident was light and clear, the tugs did not steer according to the course prescribed by the charts and sailing directions; and there was on the other side of the course they were steering upwards of ten miles open sea free from all dangers of navigation, and the ship was lost at a spot which was plainly indicated by the sailing directions, although there was evidence that the reef was unknown. The ship had no pilot, and those aboard were strangers to the coast.\nIn an action for damages for negligently towing the ship, and so causing her destruction,\nHeld,\u2014(1) That as the tugs had not observed those proper and reasonable precautions in adopting and keeping the courses to be steered, which a prudent navigator would have observed, and the accident was the result of their omission to do so, the owners of the tugs were jointly and severally liable, (Taschereau, J., dissenting as to the liability of the M. S. Co., and holding that the B. C. T. Co. were alone liable).\n2. That under the British Columbia Judicature Act the action was maintainable in its present form by joining both companies as defendants.\n3. That as there was nothing in the M. S. Co.'s coarter or act of incorporation to prevent their purchasing and owning a steam tug, and as the use of such a vessel was incidental to their business, they had a perfect right to let the tug to hire for such purposes as it was used for in the present case.\n4. That as the tugs in question were not registered as British ships at the time of the accident their owners were not entitled to have their liability limited under 25 and 26 Vic. (Imp.) ch. 63.\n5. That the limited liability under section 12 of 31 Vic. ch. 58 (D.) does not apply to cases other than those of collision.\n6. This case coming before the Court below on motion for judgment under the order which governs the practices in such cases, and which is identical with English Order 40, Rule 10, of the orders of 1875, the Court could give judgment, finally determining all questions in dispute, although the jury may not have found on them all, but does not enable the Court to dispose of a case contrary to the finding of a jury. In case the Court consider particular findings to be against evidence, all that can be done is to award a new trial, either generally or partially under the powers conferred by the rule similar to the English Order 39, Rule 40. The Supreme Court of Canada, giving the judgment that the Court below ought to have given, was in this case in a position to give judgment upon the evidence at large, there being no findings by the jury interposing any obstacle to their so doing, and therefore a judgment should be entered against both defendants for $80,000 and costs.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Supreme Court of Brtish Columbia, sitting as an Appeal Court, rendered and pronounced on the 19th April, 1882, and by which the appeal of the present appellants from the judgment of the Supreme Court of British Columbia rendered in this cause, in favor of the defendants, on the 11th July, 1882, was dismissed.\nThis was an action for recovery of damages ($80,000) for negligently towing the plaintiffs' ship on a reef, during the performance of a towage engagement, and so causing her destruction.\nThe following, as disclosed by the evidence and pleadings, are the material facts of the case.\nThe plaintiffs were strangers, owners of the ship The Thrasher, an American ship registered at Bath, Maine, U. S., of which one R. Bosworth was the master. The defendants were towing companies, carrying on business for hire in the navigable waters of British Columbia.\nOn the 22nd day of May, 1880, a contract of tonnage was entered into between the plaintiffs and the defendants, the Towing Co., to tow the plaintiff's ship, Thrasher, from Royal Roads to Nanaimo, there to load with coal, and when loaded to tow her back to sea.\nAfter the ship was towed to Nanaimo, the agent of the Towing Company sent the Beaver, belonging to the Towing Company to the captain of the Thrasher, to tow her to Cape Flattery. The Beaver not having sufficient power, the agent supplemented that power by sending another towing steamer, the Etta White, belonging to the Moodyville Saw Mill Co.\nThe Thrasher's captain, and those on board were strangers to the coast, and had no pilot, having paid the half forfeit required by law, as the tugs knew. The captain of the Beaver had been acting and was then holding a certificate as a licensed pilot in the navigable waters of British Columbia, though at the time and in the contract under consideration he was not acting or receiving remuneration as a pilot, but was solely the servant of the defendants, The Towing and Transportation Co.; and the master of the Etta White held a pilot's certificate for the district of Nanaimo, though then not acting or receiving remuneration as a pilot, but simply and solely as the servant of the said defendants.\nAbout seven o'clock on the evening of the 14th July the Thrasher passed her hawser to the Beaver, and the Etta While, leading, passed her hawser to the Beaver. The Thrasher's hawser was made fast to her port-bow and the hawser from the Beaver to the Ella White, was made fast to the starboard bow of the Beaver, these arrangements being made by the tugs. The two tugs and ship being thus attached, the Captain of the Thasher gave orders for the tugs to start.\nThe weather was calm and clear and a bright sky overhead.\nNo direction of any kind, except a general one to tow to the point of destination, was given from the tow to the tugs.\nA safe course is laid down on the chart and the \" Van couver Island Pilot,\" or Sailing Directions.\nWhilst thus in tow, the ship (which was laden with coal and drew some twenty\u2014five feet of water) was dragged on a rock some distance outside of the limits of what was known at the time and laid down on the charts as Gabriola reef, and became a complete wreck.\nThe respondents severed in their defence.\nBy their plea, the Towing Co., respondents, in effect, contended that the loss of the ship was not attributable to any negligence, carelessness, or unskilfulness of the tugs, that, on the contrary, the loss was caused by the carelessness and want of skill of the master of the ship, for whom the company are in no way responsible; that, moreover, the master of the Thrasher was responsible for the course, direction and navigation of the said tugs; that the rock in question was, an unknown rock, not laid down on any authorized chart, and that the accident was inevitable; and that, under any circumstances, the appellants' claim must be limited to $38.92 per ton of the gross tonnage of the Beaver, which, without making any deduction for engine room was 159.12 tons.\nThe respondents, The Moodyville Saw Mill Co. by their defence, contended that the tow in sailing without a pilot had contributed to the negligence, and that the master of the Thrasher had been guilty of great negligence and carelessness in consequence of the Thrasher not following the course steered by the tug next to her, to wit\u2014the Beaver, and that the course taken by the Ella White was in accordance with the sailing directions of the Vancouver Island pilot, and that they were not to blame for the unknown dangers of the seas and navigation. By way of alternative defence they, also, pleaded that by the law of Canada, which regulates and governs the law of ships and shipping navigating Canadian waters, the owners of any ship (where any loss or damage is by reason of the improper navigation of such ships, caused to any other ship or boat) shall not be answerable in respect of loss or damage to ships, boats, goods, merchandise, or other things, to an aggregate amount exceeding $38.92 for each ton of the ship's registered tonnage, where such loss or damage occurs without their actual fault or privity, and without in any way admitting that they are responsible for the alleged loss of the Thrasher, the respondents claim that the said loss alleged occurred without their actual fault or privity, and that the amount of damages, if any, recoverable against the respondents must be limited to $38.92 per ton of the registered tonnage of the said tug; that the gross registered tonnage of the said tug is 97.35 tons without any deduction for engine room.\nThe trial was had before the Hon. Chief Justice Beg- bie, assisted by a special jury. The Judge charged the jury and left to them the following questions :\u2014\nQ.\u2014Did the defendants or either, and which of them, at any time contract to tow the Thrasher from Nanaimo to Fuca Straits without a pilot engaged as such by the Thrasher? A.\u2014There was no contract made by either of the defendants to tow the Thrasher from Nanaimo to the Straits of Fuca without a pilot, neither was there any direct stipulation in the contract which was made between Captain Bosworth and (the agent) Mr. Saunders, of the British Columbia Towing and Transportation Co., that the vessel should take a pilot.\nQ.\u2014What was the magnetic compass course taken by the tugs from Entrance Island? A.\u2014The magnetic compass course taken by the tugs was about due east from Entrance Island, which course was changed by the Etta White some ten minutes before the Thrasher struck.\nQ.\u2014Was any specific compass course (or any other course) given by the tow to the tugs, either by the captain or other officer? A.\u2014No course of any kind was given by the tow to either of the tugs by Captain Bosworth or any of his officers.\nQ.\u2014At what time did the captain of the Thrasher go to bed? A.\u2014We are of opinion that Captain Bosworth left the deck about a quarter to nine o'clock.\nQ.\u2014Did the captain of the Thrasher direct his steersman to neglect the Beaver's course? A.\u2014Captain Bosworth did instruct his steersman not to follow the course of the Beaver but that of the Etta White.\nQ.\u2014Was there any current and in what direction? Would it have been probably noticed and allowed for by a competent pilot on board the tow or either of the tugs? A.\u2014There was some current setting in shore and we are of opinion that same would have been noticed and allowed for by a competent pilot either on board the tow or either of the tugs. Q.\u2014Was the Thrasher Rock a generally well-known rock previous to the accident? A.\u2014We are of opinion that the Thrasher Rock was not generally well-known prior to the accident.\nQ.\u2014Did the captain of the Thrasher follow a reasonably direct course after the tugs? A.\u2014We are of opinion that the captain of the Thrasher did follow a reasonably direct course after the Etta White but not after the Beaver.\nQ.\u2014Did the accident take place with the actual privity of either of the defendants? A.\u2014The accident did not take place with the actual privity of either of the defendants.\nQ.\u2014Did Captain Bosworth take proper and what precautions as captain of a tow should, such as to take notice of the rate and real direction of the progress? A.\u2014We are of opinion that Captain Bosworth, as captain of a tow, did not take proper precautions as to noticing rates of speed and real direction of his vessel's progress.\nQ.\u2014At the time of the stranding what was the value of the Thrasher, of the cargo of freight; if no evidence, say so? A.\u2014There is no evidence to show the value of either ship, cargo or freight at the time of stranding.\nThe following were the additional questions submitted by counsel at the trial as questions to be put by the judge, but rejected:\u2014\n\" Was there any negligence or want of common care and caution on the part of the ship without which the accident would not have happened, and if so, what was such negligence, or want of common care or caution?\n\" Notwithstanding any such negligenceor want of care and caution on the part of the tow, could the tugs by the exercise of skill on their part, have avoided the neglect or carelessness of the ship?\nOn the 4th and 7th days of July, 1881, the plaintiffs, pursuant to notice, duly applied to the Chief Justice to enter judgment for the plaintiffs for $80,000, but on the 11th day of July, 1881, the Chief Justice, upon such motion, directed judgment to be entered for the defendants, and the following is such judgment:\n\" The action having on the 26th, 27th and 28th days of June, A. D. 1881, been tried before the Honorable Sir Matthew Baillie Begbie, Knight, Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of British Columbia, and a special jury of Victoria, and the jury having been discharged without finding a verdict expressly either for the plaintiffs or defendants, but having answered certain questions put to them by the judge as appears by the certificate of the registrar, and now upon this day motion is made to His Lordship the Chief Justice, on behalf of the plaintiffs (pursuant to notice duly given in that behalf) to enter final judgment in favor of the plaintiffs for the sum of seventy-five thousand dollars and cost of suit,, and the said motion having been debated by the council on both sides, his lordship did adjudge that judgment should be entered for the defendants with cost of suit. Therefore it is adjudged that final judgment be entered for the defendants, and that the plaintiffs do pay the defendants their cost of suit, to be taxed by the registrar.\"\nFrom this judgment the appellants appealed to the full court, which confirmed the judgment unanimously so far as it concerned the Moodyville Saw Mill Co., but the hon. Mr. Justice Gray dissenting so far as it freed from liability the British Columbia Towing Co.\nMr. Davie for appellants:\nWe submit this court can direct judgment to be entered according to the merits of the case, as it has before it all materials necessary for finally determining the questions in dispute, Sec Rules 294 and 298 of the Supreme Court of British Columbia, under Judicature Act\u2014the same as English Order 40, Rule 101, and Hamilton v. Johnson[1]. The Chief Justice and the majority of the court below, although there is abundant evidence of negligence on the part of the tugs, have laid down the rule of law to be that in all cases of towage, the tow must direct the course, and that the tugs are not responsible. If this is admitted, then it would be useless to have a new trial, but, we think, the true proposition is that where no express orders, other than a general direction, are given from the tow, the tug has the general direction of the course, and is bound to tow the ship in a safe and prudent course. Smith v. St. Lawrence Tow Boat Co.[2]; The Robert Dixon[3]; McLachlan on Shipping[4]; and cases there cited.\nWe ask the court to do here what the Court below should have done. We do not ask for a new trial. Mr. Justice Gray, in his judgment sums up what we contend for[5].\nWe ask the court to supplement the findings of the jury. There are sufficient materials before the court to enter a judgment according to the merits of the case. There is uncontradicted evidence of the value of the ship at the time of stranding.\nThe employment of a tug is a contract which implies the exercise of diligence, care, and reasonable skill in the fulfilment of the engagement. Although there is no implied warranty to bring the tow to the point of destination at all hazards and under all circumstances, she engages to use her best endeavors for that purpose, and should only be prevented by vis major or by accidents not contemplated, which render the performance of the contract impossible. The Minnehaha[6]; the Julia[7]; the Galatea[8]; Spraight v. Tedcastle[9]; McLachlan on Merchant Shipping[10]; the Margaret[11].\nThe tug is bound to have local knowledge of the place where she is towing : she is bound to know the proper channel : the state of the tides : all recognized impediments and dangers of the way, and not voluntarily to deviate from a recognized and safe channel, much less to proceed in a course where there may be, and, as the results proves, is danger ; or when there is a well known course which she may pursue of unquestionable safety. The Energy[12] ; the Lady Pike[13] ; the Express[14] ; the Trojan[15] ; the Niagara[16] ; the steamer Webb[17] ; the Brazos[18] ; the C. F. Ackerman[19] ; the Favorite[20].\nThe above authorities show that for any breach of duty on the part of the tug, she is responsible in damages to the tow, should damage ensue.\nThe tug is bound to keep a look-out for tow and tug. The Jane Bacon[21].\nThe mere fact of an accident happening throws the onus upon the tugs of showing that the accident was not caused by their negligence, or that the tow contributed to the disaster, and a fortiori is this so when the tug is admittedly towing out of the usual course, has no look-out, and has not recognized the tides. Little short of vis major, or inevitable accident, could excuse the tugs, even if no actual negligence could be proved against them, but when ignorance and unskilfulness is once proved against the tugs, the defence of inevitable accident, or vis major is set up in vain.\nThe Lady Pyke[22] ; The steamboat Deer[23].\nAnd every doubt as to the performance of the duty and the effect of non\u2014performance should be resolved against the vessel sought to be inculpated, until she vindicates herself by testimony conclusive to the contrary. The Ariadne[24].\nThe allegation and finding that the rock on which the ship struck was unknown does not help the respondents. They were admittedly out of the course, in a locality stigmatized in the sailing directions as dangerous ground, and the question is, not whether or not the rock was known, but is whether they could have exercised ordinary care and have been where they were. Not observing the force of the current, which the jury find would have been observed and allowed for by a competent pilot, is conclusive evidence of negligence.\nThe defence set up in paragraph fourteen of the statement of defence of the Towing Co., and in paragraph five of the statement of defence of the Sawmill Co., alleging a sudden change of course on the part of the ship, and of her improperly following the foremost tug at a particular moment, instead of the tug next her, is unsupported by the evidence.\nNow as to Moodyville Saw Mill Co.'s liability.\nThe Moodyville Saw Mill Co., although not parties to the contract, had a duty imposed upon them, the same as that which resulted from the contract, and are liable in damages for the breach of such duty, and under the Judicature Act, sub-sec. 7 of sec. 2, rules 17 & 16, and sub-sec. 7 of sec. 2, both parties can be joined in the action.\nSee MacLennan's work on Judicature[25] ; See, also, Martin v. Great Indian Peninsular Ry. Co.[26]; Foulkes v. Met. Ry. Co.[27].\nThen, as the defence of limited liability, I contend it cannot be maintained.\nThe loss of the ship occurred before the statute 43 Vic., ch. 29, D, came into operation. The accident did not happen within the body of the county. There is no proof that the tugs were registered.\nThe defendants, if they had wished to limit their liability, should have pleaded the Imperial Statute 25 and 26 Vic., ch. 63, sec. 54.\nLiability must be admitted and money paid into court before the relief given by the statute can be invoked.\nHill v. Andus[28] ; James v. London, S. & W. Ry. Co. [29]; The Amalia[30]; The Normandy[31]; Georgian Bay Transportation Co. v. Fisher[32]; Prehn v. Bailey[33].\nIt is also objected that the defence does not show the tugs to have been registered.\nMr. Robinson, Q.C., follows for appellants :\nThe law as to the relative duties of tug and tow as applicable to the facts of this case, is well laid down in Spaight v. Tedcastle[34], and the decision of this case must depend upon the answer to the question, who was responsible for the course taken in this case? And if, as the evidence clearly establishes, respondents choose to contract to tow this vessel and, without orders being given by the tow, and none being asked by the tugs, take a wrong course they are responsible.\n[The learned counsel then reviewed the evidence, contending that these tugs were guilty of negligence, and that the tow had not been guilty of any contributory negligence.\nThe following cases were also referred to the tug Ackerman, \" The Robert Dixon\"[35].]\nAs to the liability of the Moodyville S. M. Co., I do not think the question can present any difficulty under the recent decisions. The question is, if sued alone would they be liable? If so, because they are sued with another company, are they less liable? As to their liability I refer to the steamboat Deer[36]; Heaven v. Pender[37] ; and Hooper v. L. & N. W. Ry. Co.[38]. See also Leslie v. Can. Cen. Ry. Co.[39]. The liability of both is identical, and we are claiming for the same sum, and we ask for one payment. There is no objection taken here except as to misjoinder, and under the new Judi- cature Act this objection can no longer be entertained if both are liable. Separate trials can be granted by a judge when it is found more convenient, but here there is no pretence that it was inconvenient.\nAs regards the limited liability under the Dominion statute, it is sufficient to say it is confined to cases of collision.\nMr. Bethune, Q. C., for respondents, British Columbia Towing Co.:\nAs to the relative duty of tug and tow:\u2014\nIn a case of towage the tug is the moving power, but it is under the control of the master or pilot of the vessel in tow. The Duke of Sussex[40] ; The Christina[41] ; The Energy[42] ; The Sinquasi[43] ; Smith v. The St. Lawrence Tow Boat Co.[44] ; The Cleadon[45] ; The Aracan.[46].\nWhere no directions are given by the vessel in tow, the rule is, that the tug shall direct the course, and, under such circumstances, it is the duty of the tow to follow directly in the course of the tug. Smith v. The St. Lawrence Tow Boat Co[47] ; The Stranger[48], a case somewhat similar to this ; The Jane Beacon[49].\nEven if the tug be to blame for the course taken by it, the tow cannot recover when any misconduct or unskilfulness on her part contributed to the accident. The Julia[50] ; Smith v. The St. Lawrence Tow Boat Co.[51].\n[The learned counsel then referred to the cases cited by counsel for appellant, and argued they were distinguishable on the facts of the present case.]\nThen, as to negligence, I contend that we followed the proper course, and it has been so found by the jury.\nThe steamers steered a proper course from the outset and far beyond or outside the limits of danger shown by the chart, and they were unaware of the sagging of the vessels.\nThe rock in question, also, is about a mile beyond the danger limit shown on the chart, and was at the time not generally known and was certainly wholly unknown to any one on board the steamers.\nIn the present instance, the tow was guilty of gross negligence,\u2014by sailing without a pilot, by the master leaving the deck and going to bed, at least an hour before the ship struck; by the failure of the tow to steer directly after the tug (the Beaver,) and unskilfully steering after the Etta White, which was towing the Beaver, thereby causing the three vessels to sag towards the shore, by the failure of those on board the tow, who noticed the sagging at least an hour before the accident, but failed to warn the tugs or direct them in any way to alter their course, by persisting in steering on the Etta White, even after she had altered her course from E. to E. S. E. (the Beaver still running due east), and thereby placing the tow about fifty feet nearer shore than the Beaver, her tug, and thereby, in fact, bringing about the accident which occurred; there being deep water between the sunken rock (then covered by eleven feet of water) on which she struck and her tug.\nAs to question of procedure, the learned counsel argued that if the court were of opinion that certain facts ought to have been found by the jury, then there should be a new trial.\nThe clause in the Act cannot be interpreted so as to give to a court the power of a re-trial before a judge.\nMr. L. N. Benjamin, for respondents, The Moodyville Saw Mill Company: The statement of claim alleges a contract with Saunders' as agents for the Tow Boat Company to tow safely. The appellants elect to sue the Tow Boat Company as principals, and not the agent. The Saw Mill Company was only the servant of the Tow Boat Company; in order to make the Saw Mill Company liable on these pleadings, as no contract is alleged with them, it is necessary to show expressly the creation of a duty, and the breach of it which appellants fail to do. Dutton v. Powley[52] ; Winterbottom v. Wright[53].\nMoreover, the Company were not authorized to tow vessels for hire, and their doing so was ultra vires of their corporation. Morawetz on Corporations[54].\nThe liability of owners of ships or steamers, for damages occasioned without their actual fault or privity is limited to the sum of $38.92 per ton of gross tonnage of steamers. 31 Vic.

Young et al[60]; MacLachlan on Shipping[61].\nAs to the course, the evidence shows that the steamers steered a proper course from the outset and one far beyond and outside the limits of danger shown by the chart, and were unaware of the sagging above referred to.\nThe rock in question also is about a mile beyond the danger limit shown on the chart, and was at the time not generally known, and was certainly wholly unknown to any one on board the steamers.\nMr. Robinson, Q. C., in reply.\nRitchie, C. J.:\u2014\nI have given this case very careful consideration, and I entirely agree with Mr. Justice Gray in the conclusion at which he has arrived in, if I may be permitted to say, his very able and exhaustive analysis of the facts of this case, and as my views are in precise accordance with the judgment which will be delivered by my brother Strong, I shall therefore content myself with simply saying that I entirely concur in every word that he has written, both with reference to the facts and the law in this case.\nStrong, J.[62]:\u2014\nThe first question which is presented for decision in this case requires us to determine what was the duty of the defendants implied in the engagement which they entered into to tow the plaintiff'sship. I am of opinion that the answer to this question may be given in a very few words, by saying that the authorities establish tha the defendants were bound to use reasonable care and skill in the performance of their undertaking \u2014 and that this applies to both the defendants\u2014as well to the company who were the owners of the Etta White, as to the British Columbia Towing & Transportation Co., who were the parties with whom Captain Bosworth made the contract for towage. The reasons for applying this rule to the owners of the Etta White I will state hereafter.\nIn the face of the decisions in the cases of the Julia [63], and in that of Spaight v. Tedcastle[64], it is difficult to see how there can be any doubt as to the duties of a tug under circumstances like those in evidence here. In the former case Lord Kingsdown lays it down that:\nThe law implies an engagement that each vessel would perform its duty in completing the contract, that proper skill and diligence would be used on board of each, and that neither vessel by neglect or misconduct would create unnecessary risk to the other, or increase any risk which would be incidental to the service undertaken.\nIn Spaight v. Tedcastle, Lord Blackburn refers to this case of the Julia with approval, saying that \" it accurately and clearly states the law.\"\nThe judgment of the Supreme Court of the United States in the case of the steamer Webb[65] states the law as applicable to American waters in the same terms; it says:\nThe contract requires no more than that he who undertakes to tow shall carry out his undertaking with that degree of caution and skill which prudent navigators usually employ in similar services.\nHaving thus ascertained the duty which was incumbent on the defendants, and for the present assuming that it applies equally to both tugs, as well to the Etta White, whose owners made no contract with the plaintiffs, as to the Beaver, we have next to consider if this duty was sufficiently performed. It is said on behalf of the defendants that there was contributory negligence on the part of the plaintiffs, which, according to well understood principles, disentitles them to maintain the action. The negligence thus attributed to the plaintiffs consists, it is said, in their omission to take a pilot, and in the officers in charge of the plaintiffs' ship not having themselves been sufficiently vigilant in seeing that the tugs steered the proper course. These objections are directly answered by what was said by Lord Blackburn in the case of Spaight v. Tedcastle, and by the principle of the well known case of Davies v. Mann[66]. If the proximate cause of the loss of the ship was the negligent steering of the tugs, it is no defence to the action within the rule as to contributory negligence, that if the plaintiffs had done something which they might, and, perhaps, ought to have done, but omitted to do, the accident would have been avoided. In Davies v. Mann, if the donkey had not been negligently left by its owners on the highway, it would not have been killed, but this was considered not to be decisive, the question being if the killing of the animal would have been avoided if the defendants had used reasonable care, which the law made it incumbent on them to use. Applying that doctrine here, the question must be, would the loss of the vessel have been altogether avoided, if the tugs had observed those proper and reasonable precautions in adopting and keeping the courses to be steered which a prudent navigator would have observed. If it could be shown that those in charge of the vessel were in any way responsible for the course taken by the tugs, that would have taken this case out of the principle of the cases cited, but it does not suffice to show that, apart altogether from any concurrence in the neglect of duty by the tugs, the captain of the ship might, if he had not omitted to take a pilot, have been able to guard himself from the consequences of the defendants' negligence. In order to constitute con-contributory negligence, there must be a neglect on the part of the person suffering the injury contributing to that which is the proximate cause of the accident. In Spaight v. Tedcastle, Mr. Justice Blackburn says :\nBe it that there was negligence in the ship, and those for whom the ship was responsible, in letting her get so dangerously near the bank before the helm was ported, as complete as the negligence of those who in Davies v. Mann left the fettered donkey dangerously rolling in the road, it forms no defence to an action against the persons who, by want of proper care, have injured the ship.\nThis is, I conceive, exactly applicable to the present case, and reduces the enquiries to these: Did the defendants exercise due care and take all reasonable precautions in ascertaining the proper course to steer and in adhering to it? And if they did not, was the accident the result of their omissions so to do? This is a question of fact on the evidence, to which, as it appears to me, there can be only one answer.\nThe tugs did not steer according to the course prescribed by the charts and sailing directions, and the accident immediately resulted from their omissions in these respects. After what has been said by the Chief Justice and by Mr. Justice Gray in his judgment in the court below, where the evidence bearing on this point has been most ably examined and analyzed, I do not purpose to take up time by further reviewing it. An observation is made in the judgment in the case of the Webb already referred to, that\u2014\nThere may be cases in which the result is a safe criterion by which to judge of the character of the act which has caused it.\nAnd in the present case, when we consider the condition of the weather, the fact that the night was light and clear; that there was on the other side upwards of ten miles of open sea free from all dangers of navigation ; that the line of danger within which tugs should not have steered was clearly marked in the charts and pointed out by the sailing directions, the mere fact that the ship was lost at a spot which was plainly indicated by the sailing directions as a place where it was not safe to take her, by itself and without any inquiry into the course actually steered, demonstrates, at least prim\u00e2 facie, that the accident was the result of negligence.\nThe burden thus being shifted on to the defendants to show some excuse for this, can it be said that they have exonerated themselves? Have they shown anything like vis major, or any other causes for such a result except such as could not easily have been met with proper management? Do they show that any conduct or neglect of the ship's officers contributed to their neglect to steer the proper course? Granting that they originally laid out the proper course to be steered, but that the effect of the steering of the ship or the currents, or both together, was such as to carry them off the course, how can this make any difference, if these were causes which with reasonable care would have been observed, and being observed could easily have been neutralized. If there had been a narrow channel, with dangerous ground on both sides, the case might have been different, but here the tugs had on one side many miles of safe water, open sea. They could easily have avoided all danger if they had seen it, and but for very gross neglect of the ordinary precautions of a prudent navigator, they must have seen it. With these general observations on the evidence, and adopting what has just been said by the Chief Justice here, and by Mr. Justice Gray in the court below, I come to the conclusion that the immediate and sole cause of the accident was the negligence of the defendants.\nIt was held by Mr. Justice Gray in the court below, and was argued here by the learned counsel who appeared for the owners of the Etta White, that as there was no contract with their company, the plaintiffs had no right of action against them. I am unable to agree to this. True it is that there was no privity of contract; but the law, as I understand it, implies a duty, in cases like the present, on the part of those who undertake to perform services which involve the persons or property of others being placed in their power and control, that they will execute their employment with due and reasonable care. The case of a railway traveller who having purchased a ticket from company A., entitling him to be carried to a point beyond the line of company A, on that of company B., is entitled to make the latter company, with whom he has no contract, responsible to him for not exercising reasonable care is, as it seems to me, a sufficient analogy to show the liability of the owners of the Etta White, in the present case; and the late case of Heaven v. Pender[67], in the English court of appeal, also establishes this doctrine to its fullest extent.\nThat the action can be maintained under the British Columbia judicature act in its present form, by joining both the companies as defendants, is beyond doubt. The English supreme court rules of 1875, order 16, rule 3, of which the British Columbia rule is a transcript, provides that:\nAll persons may be joined as defendants against whom the right to any relief is alleged to exist, whether jointly, severally, or in the alternative.\nThe only remedy for a mis-joinder, if, indeed, such a term is now applicable, is by an application to strike out one of the defendants. It suffices to say that the case has proceeded to trial without any such order being made. It would seem, moreover that the present case is an eminently proper one for the application of the rule, since the evidence is common to the case of both the defendants, and, therefore, that the present is just such a joinder of defendants as the rule was intended to authorize.\nIt was contended at the bar on the argument here that the Moodyville Saw Mill Co., the owners of the Etta White, were not liable, because the contract which they entered into with the British Columbia Towing & Transportation Co. to tow the Thrasher, was ultra vires of the first mentioned company. I cannot assent to this proposition. It is not shown the Saw Mill Co. had not under their charter or act of incorporation power to purchase and own a steam tug; in the absence of anything appearing to the contrary, it is to be presumed that they had the power, and the nature of the business which they were incorporated to carry on as is well known, warrants the inference that the possession of such a vessel was, if not necessary, useful and usual in towing logs and rafts and thus incidental to their business. And if there was nothing ultra vires in the acquiring and holding the property in such a steamer, surely it could not be ultra vires that the company should, when they had no occasion for its use themselves, make it profitable by letting it to hire for such purposes as it was used for in the present case. If this question had arisen in an action by the Saw Mill Co. against the Towing Co. to recover the compensation agreed to be paid by the latter to the former company for the services rendered by the Etta White, the question would have been precisely the same as that which arose in the Queen's Bench Div., England, in the case of The London & North Western Ry. Co. v. Price[68], where it was held that a contract to pay a railway company a specific charge for using the plaintiffs' weighing machine for weighing the defendants coals was not ultra vires, upon the principle that the weighing machine being incidental to the business of the railway company as carriers, they had a perfect right to allow not only the persons from whom they carried coals, but also the public at large, to have the occasional use of the machine, and were entitled to make a fair charge for the use of it.\nAnd if the saw mill company could have recovered the amount agreed upon for the hire of the vessel, the vessel must have been lawfully employed in the service in the course of which this accident happened, and if lawfully employed, the law will imply the usual obligations, already observed upon, as to the duty arising towards third persons, for whose benefit the service was to be performed, though not actually parties to the contract, to use due diligence and reasonable care in the performance of the undertaking.\nThe defendants also insist upon the benefit of the statutory defence of limited liability which they have pleaded in their statement of defence. The English Act, 25 & 26 Vic., ch. 63 (The Merchant Shipping Act Amendment, 1862) cannot apply, for the tugs were not foreign ships, neither were they as British ships within the condition which is indispensable to entitle the owners to the benefit of the provisions of the Act uniting responsibility, for they were not registered as British ships[69]. Indeed, it is evident from the terms in which the defence is pleaded, the claim being that the liability should be limited to $38.92, the amount to which the recovery is restricted by the Canadian Act, that the latter, and not the Imperial, statute was meant to be set up by the defendants. The Canadian Act is the 31st Vic., ch. 58, the 12th section of which provides for the limitation of liability in the same terms as those employed in section 54 of the English Act, but the 11th and 12th clauses of the Canadian Act are prefaced with a heading in these words: \" Duty of Masters\u2014Liability of owners as to collision.\" The 11th section does not relate to the liability of owners, but prescribes the duties of masters of ships in case of collision, and the words \" liability of owners as to collision\" must therefore have been intended to relate to the 12th section only, which we must read as if it had the heading or preamble \" liability of owners in case of collision,\" and the plaintiffs therefore contend that it confines the operation of this 12th section to cases of collision. The provisions of the 12th section are none of them such that any repugnancy would be caused if the words by \" collision with another ship,\" or equivalent expressions were to be interpolated in each of them; and this being so, and having regard to the decisions as to the effect of headings of this kind in the cases of Bryan v. Child [70]; Hammersmith Rwy. Co. v. Brand[71]; Lang v. Kerr[72], and other cases which are collected in the note in Maxwell on Statutes[73], I cannot see my way to holding that this restricted liability applies to cases other than those of collision. Further, the preamble to the statute itself, which sets forth its object to be to enact certain rules of navigation and regulations for \" preventing collisions,\" shows that the scope of the act itself was much more confined than the English Act and was only intended to ensure careful navigation and to prevent cases of collision. I do not see that we can apply the restricted liability in the present case, and the plaintiffs must, therefore, be entitled to the full amount of damages which they have proved, and which I think have been properly estimated by Mr. Justice Gray at the sum of $80,000.\nThis case came before the court below on a motion for judgment according to the new practice under the English Judicature Act lately introduced in British Columbia. The British Columbia order which governs the practice in such cases is identical with the original English Order 40, Rule 108, of the orders of 1875. This enables the court to give judgment finally determining all questions in dispute, although the jury may not have found on them all. I take it, however, that it does not enable the court to dispose of a case contrary to the finding of the jury, but that in case the court consider a particular finding to be against evidence, all that can be done is to award a new trial, either generally or partially under the powers conferred by the rule similar to the English Order 39, Rule 40. There has, however, here been no finding by the jury which interposes an obstacle of this kind. The finding that the Thrasher Rock \" was not generally well known prior to the accident,\" is not inconsistent with a decision by the court that on the whole evidence the defendants are proved to have been guilty of negligence in not steering a proper course, and adhering to the sailing rules and otherwise taking proper precautions.\nThe finding that there was no evidence of damages, when the value of the ship is distinctly stated in the evidence of Captain Bosworth, is something difficult to understand. By this I do not understand that the jury found that there was actually no damage, or that they discredit the evidence of Bosworth, but that no evidence of damage had been offered, which was incorrect and must have been an oversight. It was not, however, as I understood the counsel,insisted that there should be a new trial merely for the purpose of ascertaining the damages which may, therefore, be fixed at Mr. Justice Gray's estimation. This court, giving the judgment that the court below ought to have given, is, therefore, in a position to give judgment upon the evidence at large; and the result, in my opinion, must be that a judgment be entered for the plaintiffs against both defendants for $80,000 and costs, and that the plaintiffs also have the costs of this appeal. Fournier, J.:\u2014\nI am of opinion that this appeal should be allowed with costs against both companies.\nHenry, J.:\u2014\nI had very little difficulty at the argument of this case in coming to the conclusion that the plaintiff is entitled to recover in this action, not only against the company with whom he made the contract, but also against the company who came in to assist the other one in its performance. It is a clear proposition that when a party undertakes to aid in the performance of a contract entered into by another, he assumes the responsibility of performing his part of it, either singly or jointly with the original contractor ; and if he fails in the proper performance of that duty, and the contract is not properly carried out through the negligence or improper performance of either or both the parties, the other party is entitled to recover against both. Now, the facts here are very clear, and there is no difficulty in ascertaining what they are. The party who undertook to convey this vessel by a tug from one place to another, says : \" Although the vessel was lost, you should have put on board a pilot, and as none was put on board we are not answerable.\" Now, in order to sustain that proposition, it was necessary that the party so asserting should show that it was a part of the contract, either expressed or necessarily implied, that a pilot was to be put on board by the owners of the ship. There is no such express contract shown, and it is not necessarily implied, as I take it, that the party letting his ship to be towed from one place to another is required to have a pilot on board, or is required to put a pilot on board the leading tug, or the other tug, as the case may be, in order that the contracting party shall perform his contract properly. There are a great many cases where pilots are necessary, especially in going through very difficult channels and places where the owners of the tug are not supposed to be acquainted. There it might be implied as part of the contract that the owner of the ship shall provide a pilot, but it must be implied from the nature of the case.\nIn this case it is not expressed in the contract, and I see nothing here to warrant the implication that there was any such contract on the part of the plaintiffs. The defence on that ground, I think, entirely fails. Then, the question of negligence, on the part of the two towing tugs: they had undertaken to tow the vessel in a proper way and without negligence, and without deviation from the proper and ordinary course. I think that whether the rocks upon which this vessel was put were actually known to the parties or not, they were guilty of negligence in keeping so close to the shore. It was a turning point in the course on which they were proceeding that the ship struck, and they had eight or ten miles of sea room on the other side, where there was no danger, but they ran too close to the turning point. They could not justify such a course as that. They had no right to shorten their voyage by taking the turn too abruptly. It was their duty to take all reasonable care to avoid any possible sunken rocks near the shore. They did not do so, and therefore I think they are answerable for the damages that have been sustained.\nNow, as to the amount of these damages. I think they were, under the evidence, properly assessed by the learned judge Gray in the court below. I think that under the circumstances, and under the law and the practice, we have the right to sustain the finding of the judge as to the amount of the damages. The evidence was clear as to the value of the ship and the cargo that were lost, and I think that what the jury in their answer referred to was not the amount and value of the ship and cargo, but the extra amount of damages actually sustained ; but whether that was so or not, it is not necessary to be considered here, if we do not go beyond the amount of the actual value proved. I think there can be no doubt from the evidence what that amount was, and I consider it would be doing an injustice to the plaintiff, and adding more costs to the defendants, if we were to send it back for a new trial. The defendants could not expect to reduce the verdict below the actual value of the property, and it would be entailing not only additional delay but additional costs.\nUnder the whole circumstances, I think the appeal should be allowed, and we are entitled to give the judgment which the court below ought to have given, viz: judgment against both defendant companies for $80,000 and costs.\nTaschereau, J.:\nI am of opinion to allow this appeal, and that judgment should be for the plaintiffs against the British Columbia Towing and Transportation Co. for $80,000 with costs, the said plaintiffs' action to be dismissed as against the Moodyville Saw Mill Co., without costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for appellants: The\u00e9odore Davie.\nSolicitors for respondents The British Columbia Towing Transportation Co.: Bethune & Bethune.\nSolicitors for respondents The Moodyville Saw Mill Co.: L.

In trading on the voyage S. and others were not to dispose of any goods on credit, but were to bring back such goods as they could not dispose of, so as to obtain a return cargo in lieu thereof. The plaintiffs put on board the vessel at Halifax merchandize to an amount exceeding $6,000, and after having done so, and upon the day on which the vessel sailed from Halifax, effected with the appellants (defendants) the policy sued upon, and an extract from which is as follows:\u2014 \"Rumsey, Johnson & Co. have this day effected an insurance to \"the extent of $2,000 on the undermentioned property, from \"Halifax to Labrador and back to Halifax on trading voyage. \"Time not to exceed four (4) months, shipped in good order and well \"conditioned on board the schooner Mabel Claire, whereof Mouzar \"is master, this present voyage.

S., were not covered by this policy, and that it was not to cover the return cargo.\nHeld (affirming the judgment of the court below, discharging a rule nisi to set aside a verdict for the plaintiffs), that the policy covered not only goods put on board at Halifax but all the merchandize under deck shipped in good order on board said vessel during the period mentioned in the policy.\nHeld, also, that there was sufficient evidence to show that the plaintiffs had an insurable interest in all the goods obtained and loaded on the vessel.\nAppeal from a judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia discharging a rule nisi to set aside a verdict of $1,871.93, rendered by Weatherbe, J., without a jury, in favor of the respondents.

RITCHIE, C.J.:\u2014\nThis was an action brought to recover insurance on merchandise on board the schooner Mabel Claire, from Halifax to Labrador and back to Halifax on a trading voyage. The loss of the vessel being admitted, this cause was tried before Mr. Justice Weatherbe, without a jury, who gave a judgment or verdict for the plaintiffs for the amount of claim, $1,871.93.\nA rule nisi was taken on special grounds to set aside the verdict with power (by consent) for the court to direct a final judgment to be entered for either party, which was argued before Justices McDonald, Smith and Weatherbe.\nJudgment was given on the tenth day of April, 1883; the only written judgment being that of Mr. Justice Weatherbe, in which the other judges concurred, discharging the rule nisi with costs.\nThe following is an extract from the policy:\nThe Merchant's Marine Insurance Company of Canada.\n(Ocean Cargo or Freight Certificate.)\nHead Office, Montreal. No. 18,373.\nHalifax, July 13, 1878.\nRumsey, Johnson & Co. have this day effected an insurance to the extent of two thousand dollars, on the undermentioned property, from Halifax to Labrador and back to Halifax on trading voyage\u2014time not to exceed four (4) months, shipped in good order and well conditioned on board the schooner Mabel Clare whereof Mouzar is master, this present voyage. Loss, if any, payable to Rumsey, Johnson & Co. said insurance to subject to all the forms, conditions, provisions and exceptions contained in the policies of the company, copies of which are printed on the back hereof.\nJ. V. Oswald,\nC. J. Wylde, Agent. General Manager.\nDescription of goods insured, merchandize under deck, amount $2,000, rate 5 per cent., premium $100 to return two (2) per cent. if risk ends 1st October, and no loss claimed; additional insurance of five thousand (5,000) dollars, \"Warranted free from capture, seizure and detention, the consequences of any attempt thereat.\"\nTwo points were raised in this case. First Did the policy cover only the goods laden at Halifax? Second. Have the respondents proved sufficient interest to entitle them to recover? As to the first point: This case seems to me abundantly clear, the policy was, in my opinion, unquestionably intended to cover, during the trading voyage from Halifax to Labrador and back, all \"the merchandize under deck\" on board said vessel during the period mentioned in the policy, viz., for four months from the 13th July, 1878, shipped in good order, and was not confined to the goods shipped at Halifax and brought back to Halifax. The policy dated 13th July, 1878, insures to\nThe extent of $2,000, on the undermentioned property, from Halifax to Labrador and back on trading voyage\u2014Time not to exceed four months, shipped in good order and well conditioned on board the schooner Mabel Claire.\nThen, what is the undermentioned property?\nDescription of goods insured, merchandize under deck, amount $2,000, rate 5 per cent., premium $100 to return two (2) if risk ends 1st October and no loss claimed.\nTrading voyages are well understood. The goods are constantly shifting. The idea is simply to barter the goods taken from Halifax between that place and Labrador, and to bring back to Halifax the goods obtained by such bartering, and the goods insured were all merchandize under deck on the trading voyage from Halifax to Labrador, and back, irrespective of where the same may be taken on board, whether on the voyage from Halifax or on its return, provided they were merchandise under deck on the trading voyage. I can discover nothing what ever to limit the subject-matter of the insurance contemplated by this policy to the original cargo on board at Halifax. There is nothing, in my opinion, in the terms used, on the most strict construction of the language, to justify such a conclusion\u2014if we take the nature of the voyage\u2014\"a trading voyage\"\u2014the termini, \"Halifax and Labrador and back to Halifax,\" that it is to be an insurance on a trading voyage from Halifax to Labrador and back to Halifax, the object of such a voyage being for trade and barter, that is, the exchange from time to time, and from place to place during the continuance of the voyage, of the delivered cargo for a return cargo, which, from the coast between Halifax and Labrador, we may take historical, if not judicial, notice, would be a fish cargo. Then the duration of the risk\u2014four months, the rate, 5 per cent.\u2014everything, in my opinion, indicates that it was never intended by the parties that there was to be an insurance on a single passage from Halifax to Labrador; nor can it be supposed that it was contemplated that the cargo taken from Halifax would be brought back in specie as shipped there. On the contrary, the cargo brought back would be obtained by barter or sale of the outward cargo, and from this a return cargo, and therefore unless the term \"and back\" referred to such return cargo, it would be meaningless. \"From Halifax to Labrador\" fix, in my opinion, merely the termini of the trading voyage, and the subject-matter of insurance \"merchandize under deck,\" if shipped in good order and well conditioned on such \"trading voyage.\"\nThere is no language in this policy such as \"begining the adventure from the loading thereof on board at Halifax,\" or any language intimating that the policy is only to attach on goods loaded at that port, which is the terminus a quo of the trading voyage insured, viz., \"from Halifax to Labrador and back,\" and the reason is very obvious; any such language would be utterly inconsistent with the nature of the voyage, the provisions contained in the policy and the object the parties must have had in view in effecting the policy. Had it been the intention of the parties that the policy should be so restricted, I cannot doubt but that unequivocal language, so limiting it, would have been used, and in its absence, bearing in mind the character of the voyage and the terms used, the irresistible inference is that no such limitation was contemplated.\nIn what in principle does this differ from the constant every day practice of insuring goods or stock-in-trade in a store for a given period, where the insured reproduce the same stock. Has it ever been doubted or questioned that a policy on a, stock of goods covers such after acquired and substituted goods? According to defendant's contention, the return cargo in this case would not be covered at all. It cannot be supposed that either party could have contemplated that the trading voyage would be utterly fruitless, and that the goods taken from Halifax would not be used for the purpose for which they were shipped, but would be brought back to Halifax.\nIn the case of Violett v. Allnut[33], plaintiff declared upon a policy of insurance at and from Plymouth to Malta, with liberty to touch at Penzance, or any port in the channel to the westward, for any purpose whatever, upon goods by the ship Lion, beginning the adventure from the loading thereof on board the said ship as above. The ship sailed from Plymouth and touched at Penzance for the purpose of loading and taking in these other goods for Malta. The ship was stranded. The question was, whether by the terms of the policy defendant was liable for the loss of the goods taken on board at Penzance, his contention being that by the terms of the policy the insurance attached only the cargo to be loaded at Plymouth, but the court held there was no ground for the objection.\nAnd in Barclay v. Stirling and another[34]:\nThe defendants being owners of the ship Neptune, which was loaded at Jamaica in September, 1814, with a cargo on freight from various shippers, and was bound to London, effected a policy of insurance for \u00a31,200, on the freight of the said ship, valued at \u00a34,200, which policy the plaintiff underwrote for \u00a3500. The voyage described in the policy was, \"At or from port or ports of loading in Jamaica, to her port or ports of discharge of the United Kingdom, with leave to call at all, any, or every one of the British and Foreign West India Islands, to seek, join and exchange convoy, beginning the adventure upon the goods from the loading thereof aboard the said ship, as aforesaid.\" And in a subsequent part of the policy, after the usual declaration, that it should be lawful for the ship, in that voyage, to proceed and sail to, and touch and stay at any ports whatsoever, the following words were introduced:\n\"And wheresoever, with leave to discharge, exchange, and take on board goods at any ports or places she may call at, or proceed to, without being deemed any deviation from, and without prejudice to this insurance.\"\nThe ship sailed from Jamaica on the 30th of October, 1814, with the said cargo; and on the 8th of November, in the course of her voyage, got on shore off the Island of Cuba. There she remained till the 18th of December, during which time part of the cargo was saved, but the greater part consisting of sugar, was washed away and lost. On the 20th December the ship reached the Havannah, and having received there such repairs as were necessary to enable her to proceed to England, took on board so much of her cargo as had been saved, and likewise a considerable quantity of fresh goods on freight, from the Havannah to London, and sailed the latter end of February, 1815.\nPlaintiffs contended that it was clean from the terms of the policy, that it included freight, not only of such goods as were shipped at Jamaica, but also of all goods put on board at any of the West India Islands in the course of the voyage; for the policy contained a liberty to call at any such islands, and to discharge, exchange, and take on board goods at any place the ship might call, without being deemed a deviation, &c.\nDefendants denied that the freight of the goods shipped at the Havannah was covered by the policy, for the policy is precise in describing the adventure to be, \"at and from her ports of loading in Jamaica\"; and that it shall begin \"from the loading of the goods aboard as aforesaid,\" that is at Jamaica; and the leave given in a subsequent part of the policy to exchange and take on board goods at any places the ship might call at, was not intended to alter the adventure before described, but only to excuse a deviation. Therefore, though the loading of goods at the Havannah shall not avoid the policy, by reason of the liberty contained in it, yet is it no part of the risk insured.\nLord Ellenborough, C.J., said:\nThe freight was earned in respect of goods loaded partly at Jamaica, and partly, owing to a mis-adventure in the voyage, at Cuba; and the whole has been received by the assured at the ship's port of discharge. First let us consider the freight insured. The policy runs thus: \"At and from the port of loading in Jamaica, to her port of discharge, beginning the adventure from the loading on board the ship as aforesaid, that is, from the loading at Jamaica, with leave to call at all and every of the West India Islands.\" The ship being driven on the coast of Cuba by the accidents of the voyage, this became a part of the voyage. And without considering it as part of the voyage in the first instance, the liberty given to the assured to touch and take in goods at Cuba, incorporates this part of the adventure, by necessary construction, with the voyage. It is said, this liberty does no more than excuse a deviation; but the case of Violett v. Allnutt[35] shows that an intermediate port may be included within the policy, equally with the terminus a quo mentioned in it; and it is very material that it should be so.\nBayley, J.:\nThe first objection is, that this policy would only have attached on the freight of such goods as were put on board at Jamaica, but not elsewhere. But such a construction is contrary to the true intent of the policy; for the policy contains no words limiting it to the goods to be put on board at Jamaica. The two termini were Jamaica, and the ship's port of discharge in the United Kingdom, with leave to call at any of the West India Islands; and I think that any freight earned between these two termini, and within the limits of the lease specified, would have been covered by the policy. In a subsequent part of the policy, there is leave given to discharge, exchange, and take on board goods at any place the ship may call at; this was not deemed to be a deviation. Then, if the assured were to have full power to do this, how comes it that the freight of the goods thus taken on board, is not to be included in the policy?\n* * * * *\nIn principle and good sense, there can be no reason why this policy, which was intended to cover the freight upon the whole voyage, should not attach upon the freight of goods loaded at an intermediate port in the voyage. I therefore think the Havannah freight was covered by the policy. It would be unjust to hold otherwise.\nHolroyd, J.:\nThis is a policy not confined to freight] on goods loaded at Jamaica, but is to be extended to goods loaded during the voyage from Jamaica to her ports of discharge. The leave to call at other ports, and load there, puts the freight arising from the goods loaded at the Havannah, upon the footing with the former freight, and brings it within the meaning of the policy. I agree with the court on the other point.\nAs to the second point that the plaintiffs have no insurable interest in the goods\u2014the evidence, I may say the uncontradicted evidence on this point as to the transaction and plaintiff's interest in the goods lost is as follows:\u2014\nB. A. Rumsey, sworn\u2014My partner is Johnston, Rumsey, Johnson & Co. The schooner Mable Claire loaded most of cargo July, 1878. Value of cargo I think between $9000 and $10,000. Had arrangement with Stephen C. Tupper, to fit him out, a verbal arrangement. We were to supply most of cargo for trading voyage, we took bills of lading of it. The return cargo was to come back to us, we were to dispose of cargo and pay ourselves and pay them the balance. It was to be a trading voyage to Newfoundland and back.\nThe whole return cargo was to come back to us. This is the B. L. of cargo we put on board, only what we put on board. It is signed by the master of the schooner. (Put in and read, objected to, marked B. A. J.) Cargo was put on board by Weir Brothers and others which we paid for but it is not in this B. L. Tupper put in some of the cargo himself. The whole of it, including what Tupper put in was insured by us and was subject to the arrangement I have spoken of.\nG. R. JOHNSON.\u2014Partner in R. J. & Co. I made arrangements with Tupper. He wanted supplies for trading voyage to Labrador. Had chartered new schooner Mable Claire. He wanted us to supply. He applied to me at Liverpool, N. S., through a friend of his who offered to give him a certain amount towards his supplies, and that as security to us he would allow that portion to go as security as a preference that ours should be paid first. I asked him what amount. He said probably ten thousand dollars. The arrangement was not made at Liverpool. I promised to telegraph to him what we would do. When I returned the vessel was here, and I made the arrangements for the firm with Tupper and Mouzar. We were to supply them and have complete control of all the goods until they got back. They were to give no goods out on credit, and sooner than give credit they were to bring goods back, and we would credit them with full price.\nThey promised to bring back any goods for which they exchanged them. We were to effect insurance on them to the full extent of cargo, and if there was not sufficient to pay everybody when they returned, we were to be paid first. They were our goods until they came back. When they went away they expected to make a profit on them. If they were successful they were to let us know what extra amount to price was needed for the benefit of the adventure.\nTo say that under this testimony the plaintiffs were merely unpaid vendors, with the rights only of unpaid vendors, is simply to ignore the evidence in the case and the agreement which it clearly establishes. The only evidence apparently relied on in the court below as displacing the effect of this evidence, is that of Rumsey, who on cross-examination, in answer evidently to a question put to him, says:\u2014\nIf the goods had been lost on the voyage to Newfoundland without insurance, the loss I suppose would have been Tupper's.\nI cannot see how this can possibly affect in any way the liability of the defendants to the plaintiffs. Plaintiffs had supplied Tupper and no doubt looked to him personally for payment, as well as to the goods over which it was agreed that they should retain the control for the purpose of securing such payment. But whatever may have been the relative liabilities of the parties as between themselves, it is quite clear that the plaintiffs had such a claim on these goods supplied and shipped as on the goods acquired and shipped in good order and well conditioned during such trading voyage as would have been enforceable against Tupper, had he endeavored to dispose of them and divert the proceeds from the plaintiffs contrary to the terms of the agreement. For these reasons I am of opinion that the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nSTRONG, J.:\u2014\nI am of opinion that this appeal wholly fails. The policy was in terms upon \"merchandise under deck on trading voyage from Halifax to Labrador, and back to Halifax on trading voyage.\" It is contended that these words only covered the original cargo shipped at Halifax. Such a proposition is wholly unsustainable. The policy must be construed according to the known course of trade, and according to that the only object of the voyage was to dispose of the original cargo and to substitute a return cargo for it. This is a much stronger case than that of Columbian Insurance Co. v. Cattell[36], cited for the respondent, for in the policy in that case the words \"trading voyage\" were not contained, and the court there held that the underwriters must be presumed to know what is here expressly stated in the definition of the risk. The English cases are clear to the same effect. In Hill v. Patten[37], Lord Ellenborough says:\nYet it is not to be inferred that shipping on successive cargoes on board the same ship in the course of the same continued adventure as in the African and other trade out and home, may not properly be the subject of insurance under the word \"goods,\" for in view of these cases the successive cargoes i. e. (1) of English goods (2) African articles of traffic, and lastly, West India produce are according to the course of such trading adventures construed subject matter of insurance under the one name of goods.\nUpon the question of interest the evidence was ample to justify the verdict for the respondents, and the court below very properly held that there was sufficient evidence to show that the property in all the goods, as well those forming the original cargo as such as might be shipped in the course of the voyage, were to be vested in the respondents until the joint-adventure was finally wound up by a sale of the return cargo. The answer of Rumsey on cross-examination that he supposed \"the loss would have been Tupper's\" if the goods had been lost on the voyage to Newfoundland without insurance, was a mere inference of what the witness supposed would have been the legal rights of himself and his partner, and afforded no ground for a new trial.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nFOURNIER, J.:\nEn juillet 1878, Stephen Tupper, William Mouser et A. W. Moren affr\u00e9t\u00e8rent la go\u00eblette \"Mabel Claire,\" pour un voyage de trafic au Labrador, dans lequel ils \u00e9taient tous int\u00e9ress\u00e9s. La go\u00eblette partit de Liverpool, N. S., o\u00f9 elle prit une partie de sa cargaison, valant environ $1,200; elle fit escale \u00e0 Halifax o\u00f9 elle compl\u00e9ta sa cargaison avec des marchandises achet\u00e9es des Intim\u00e9s et d'autres personnes. Ces marchandises ne furent pas alors pay\u00e9es. La go\u00eblette fit voile d'Halifax, le 13 juillet pour Boone Bay et Labrador avec une cargaison valant environ $9,000, y compris $1,300 en argent.\nTupper et Mouzar qui s'embarqu\u00e8rent sur le vaisseau, le premier comme subr\u00e9cargue et le deuxi\u00e8me comme capitaine, vendirent et \u00e9chang\u00e8rent les marchandises et re\u00e7urent en retour du poisson, de la pelleterie, etc., qu'ils mirent \u00e0 bord du vaisseau. Lorsqu'ils laiss\u00e8rent St: Augustin pour le retour \u00e0 Halifax, ils n'avaient plus que pour environ $1,000 des marchandises prises \u00e0 Liverpool et Halifax.\nLe 13 juillet les intim\u00e9s assur\u00e8rent pour leur propre compte au bureau de l'appelante pour $2,000 de marchandises. La perte de la go\u00eblette \u00e0 son voyage de retour est admise; l'assurance fut effectu\u00e9e de la mani\u00e8re suivante.\n[Ici l'honorable juge donne lecture du re\u00e7u ci-dessus cit\u00e9.]\nLes moyens de d\u00e9fense invoqu\u00e9s par l'appelante soul\u00e8vent deux questions desquelles doit d\u00e9pendre la d\u00e9cision de cette cause. 1o. Les demandeurs intim\u00e9s ont-ils un int\u00e9r\u00eat assurable (insurable interest) dans les marchandises comprises dans la police d'assurance effectu\u00e9e en leur faveur? 2e. La police couvre-t-elle les risques du voyage de retour et les marchandises re\u00e7ues en \u00e9change de celles prises et mises \u00e0 bord \u00e0 Halifax et \u00e0 Liverpool?\nLes marchandises fournies par les intim\u00e9s pour le voyage de trafic dont il s'agit, l'ont \u00e9t\u00e9 en vertu d'un arrangement particulier par lequel ils se sont r\u00e9serv\u00e9s une propri\u00e9t\u00e9 sp\u00e9ciale dans les marchandises qui devaient remplacer celles qui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 mises \u00e0 bord \u00e0 Liverpool et Halifax. Ils devaient en retenir la possession jusqu'au paiement de leur r\u00e9clamation.\nLa preuve \u00e0 ce sujet \u00e9tablit que les intim\u00e9s devaient \u00e9quiper Tupper (to fit him out). Rumsey, l'un d'eux, dit:\nHad arrangements with Stephen C. Tupper to fit him out\u2014a verbal arrangement. We were to supply most of cargo for trading voyage. We took bills of lading of it. The return cargo was to come back to us. We were to dispose of the cargo and pay ourselves, and pay them the balance. It was to be a trading voyage to Newfoundland and back. The whole return cargo was to come back to us. Tupper put in some of the cargo himself. The whole of it, including what Tupper put in, was insured by us and was subject to these arrangements I have spoken of.\nL'autre intim\u00e9, Johnson dit:\nI made arrangements with Tupper. He wanted supplies for a trading voyage to Labrador. He applied to us at Liverpool, N. S., through a friend of his who offered to give him a certain amount towards his supplies, and that as security to us, he would allow that portion to go as security, as a preference that ours should be paid first. We were to supply them and have a complete control of all the goods until they got back. They were to give no goods out on credit, and sooner than give credit they were to bring goods back and we would credit them with full price. They promised to bring back any goods for which they exchanged them. We were to effect insurance on them to the full extent of cargo, and if there was not sufficient to pay every body when they returned, we were to be paid first. They were our goods until they came back.\nLa seule tentative faite pour diminuer la force de cette preuve est la r\u00e9ponse donn\u00e9e par Johnson sur la question de savoir qui aurait support\u00e9 les risques, dans le cas de perte sans assurance, \"if the goods had been lost on the voyage to Newfoundland without insurance, the loss, I suppose, would have been Tupper's. Cette question avait pour but de faire voir que les intim\u00e9s n'ont d'autre int\u00e9r\u00eat que celui de vendeur non pay\u00e9, (unpaid vendor), ce qui ne constituerait pas un int\u00e9r\u00eat assurable. Mais le t\u00e9moignage \u00e9tablit si positivement l'arrangement verbal entre Rumsey et Tupper, par lequel les intim\u00e9s se sont r\u00e9serv\u00e9s le contr\u00f4le absolu des marchandises afin de garantir leurs avances, et que ces avances n'ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faites que sur la foi de cet arrangement qu'il faut n\u00e9cessairement en conclure que les Intim\u00e9s ont d\u00e9montr\u00e9 qu'ils avaient un int\u00e9r\u00eat assurable, an insurable interest. Apr\u00e8s la d\u00e9cision de la cause de Clarke v. Scottish Imp\u00e9rial Insurance Co.[38], dans laquelle cette question a \u00e9t\u00e9 si compl\u00e8tement trait\u00e9e, il serait inutile de revenir sur le sujet. Il suffit de r\u00e9f\u00e9rer \u00e0 la savante dissertation de Sir William Ritchie, C. J., sur le sujet et aux nombreuses autorit\u00e9s qu'il a cit\u00e9es pour appuyer son opinion. Les pr\u00e9tentions des intim\u00e9s \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard doivent donc \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9es comme parfaitement justifi\u00e9es.\nIl en doit \u00eatre de m\u00eame sur la question de savoir si la police ne couvre seulement que les marchandises charg\u00e9es \u00e0 Halifax. Les mots de la police \"merchandize under deck,\" sont assez amples pour comprendre toute esp\u00e8ce de marchandises ou autres propri\u00e9t\u00e9s qui devaient se trouver sous le pont du vaisseau pendant toute la dur\u00e9e du voyage jusqu'au retour. Le voyage dont il s'agit \u00e9tant un (trading voyage) voyage de trafic, \u00e0 la connaissance de l'appelante qui dans tous les cas doit \u00eatre pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e savoir que le trafic dans un tel voyage signifiait le troc ou \u00e9change des marchandises. Les parties au contrat d'assurance en question ayant les faits pr\u00e9sents \u00e0 l'esprit ont d\u00fb avoir l'intention de comprendre dans la police toutes les marchandises sous le pont en tout temps, depuis le d\u00e9part d'Halifax jusqu'au Labrador et de ce dernier endroit jusqu'au retour \u00e0 Halifax. Que signifieraient les mots back to Halifax, s'ils ne s'appliquait \u00e0 la cargaison de retour? Les mots from Halifax to Labrador dans la premi\u00e8re partie de la police n'indique pas la provenance des marchandises et ne sont l\u00e0 que pour la description du voyage et non pas pour la d\u00e9signation des marchandises assur\u00e9es qui sont d\u00e9sign\u00e9es par les expressions merchandizes under deck. Les principes \u00e9nonc\u00e9s par le savant juge Story, dans la cause de Colombian Insurance Co. v. Cattell[39], sont parfaitement applicables \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente cause. L\u00e0 comme ici la question \u00e9tait de savoir si l'assurance ne s'appliquait qu'\u00e0 la cargaison ordinaire, ou bien si elle comprenait \u00e9galement les cargaisons successives qui \u00e9taient le produit du trafic de la premi\u00e8re. La citation enti\u00e8re de cette autorit\u00e9 serait trop longue, je n'en donnerai qu'un court extrait.\nThe underwriters must be presumed equally with the assured to know the nature and course of such a voyage. It is for the purpose of trade and the exchange of the outward cargo by sale or barter for a return cargo of West India productions. If we could shut our eyes to the knowledge of this fact, belonging as it does intimately to the history and commercial policy of the nation itself as disclosed in its laws, the whole evidence in the case furnishes abundant proofs of its notoriety. The true meaning of the policy is to be sought in an exposition of the words with reference to this known course and usage of the West India trade. The parties must be supposed to contract with a tacit adoption of it as the basis of their engagements. The object of the clause under consideration may be thus rationally expounded, as intended only to point out the time of the commencement and termination of the risk on the goods, successively, and at different periods of the voyage constituting the cargo. It would be pushing the argument to a most unreasonable extent to suppose that the parties deliberately contracted for risks on a homeward voyage on goods which, according to the known course of the trade and the very nature of the commodities, were not, and could not be, intended to be brought back to the United States.\nCes raisonnements s'appliquent parfaitement \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente cause. On peut encore ici, invoquer le principe qui r\u00e8gle les assurances de fonds de commerce contre le feu. Ces fonds sont par leur nature destin\u00e9s \u00e0 \u00eatre souvent renouvel\u00e9s et remplac\u00e9s. S'il n'y avait d'assur\u00e9 en cas de perte que les marchandises qui se trouvaient en magasin lors de l'assurance, l'assurance serait une pr\u00e9caution vaine et illusoire, car le plus souvent on ne retrouverait pas les marchandises assur\u00e9es. Aussi est-il de principe que:\u2014\nA policy covering merchandize in store, does not cover any special property, but property comprising such a stock as may be on hand when a loss occurs, although nothing is said in the policy concerning the matter. This is implied from the nature of the risk and the usages of the business covered by the policy.\nIl serait plus facile qu'utile de multiplier les autorit\u00e9s \u00e0 ce sujet.\nEn r\u00e9sum\u00e9 je crois qu'il est bien \u00e9tabli en preuve que les intim\u00e9s ont un int\u00e9r\u00eat assurable dans les marchandises comprises dans la police d'assurance, et que cette police doit \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9e comme couvrant les risques sur la cargaison de retour re\u00e7ue en \u00e9change des premi\u00e8res marchandises. Je me suis abstenu de prendre en consid\u00e9ration quelques autres points, comme par exemple le d\u00e9faut de mise en cause d'Alfred W. More, ne les pensant pas plus que la Cour Inf\u00e9rieure, n\u00e9cessaires \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision de cette cause. Pour ces motifs, je suis d'opinion que le jugement doit \u00eatre confirm\u00e9.\nHENRY, J.:\nThis case differs from some of those referred to, and therefore I have some doubt on the question raised, but not sufficient to induce me to dissent from the majority of the court. If the result were to be affected by my judgment, I should consider it necessary to give the question fuller investigation.\nGWYNNE, j.:\nStephen C. Tupper and William Mouzar chartered the schooner \"Mabel Claire\" for a trading voyage from Nova Scotia to Labrador and back, and, not having sufficient means themselves to load the vessel with merchandize for the voyage, made an arrangement with the plaintiffs to supply them with a cargo.\nApplication for this arrangement was first made to the plaintiffs at Liverpool, where the vessel then was, by Tupper, through a friend of his, who had agreed to give him a certain amount towards his supplies, and that such portion should stand as security to the plaintiffs that they should be paid first. The arrangement was not then completed, but Tupper put goods on the vessel at Liverpool to the amount of $1,200.00 and took the vessel to Halifax, where the arrangement with the plaintiffs was completed, by which it was agreed between Tupper and Mouzar and the plaintiffs, that the plaintiffs should furnish the greater part of the cargo for the trading voyage and were to have complete control of all the goods put on board the vessel until it should return, when the return cargo was to be disposed of by the plaintiffs, who were to pay themselves for their advances and pay over any balance remaining to Tupper and Mouzar. In trading on the voyage Tupper and Mouzar were not to dispose of any goods on credit, but were to bring back such goods as they could not dispose of so as to obtain a return cargo in lieu thereof, accordingly the plaintiffs put on board the vessel at Halifax merchandize to an amount exceeding $6,000, and, after having done so, and, upon the day on which the vessel sailed from Halifax effected with the defendants the policy of insurance sued upon to the amount of $2,000 on merchandize under deck, from Halifax to Labrador and back to Halifax on trading voyage\u2014time not to exceed four months\u2014shipped in good order and well conditioned on board schooner Mabel Claire, beginning the adventure upon the said goods and merchandize from and immediately following the loading thereof on board said vessel, and to continue and endure until the said goods should be safely discharged and landed. On the 13th July, 1878, the vessel sailed on her voyage with Mouzar, as master, and Tupper, as super-cargo. In the course of the voyage they disposed of all the goods which had been laden on the vessel, with the exception of goods to the value of about $1,000, with which on board, together with a large return cargo, the vessel, when on her return voyage to Halifax, within the four months named in the policy, together with her cargo, was lost by the perils insured against.\nAgainst the plaintiffs right to recovery upon this policy it is contended, first, that they were merely unpaid vendors and had no insurable interest, and that the goods put on board at Liverpool were not covered by the policy, and the value of the goods put on board at Halifax that were lost does not amount to $1,871 the amount of the verdict, and that the policy does not cover the return cargo. Some other objections were suggested but it is unnecessary to refer to them.\nThat the plaintiffs had an insurable interest under the agreement in evidence, as well upon all the goods which were on board the vessel when the policy was effected, including those which had been put on board at Liverpool, as also upon such goods as should be put on board as return cargo in pursuance of the agreement, cannot, I think, admit of a doubt. The only material question, therefore, is whether such interest is to its full extent covered by the policy. I quite agree with the view taken by the appellants in their factum to the effect that the underwriters, as is made clear by the policy, intended to insure all the goods then already loaded; the words \"on the undermentioned property\" which by the policy is declared to be \"merchandize under deck,\" shipped in good order and well conditioned on board the schooner \"Mabel Claire,\" seem, I think, sufficiently clearly to establish this contention of the appellants. But it seems to me to be also clear that as the appellants knew that the voyage during which the policy on cargo was to have effect, was to be a trading voyage from Halifax to Labrador and back to Halifax (not to exceed four months), they never could have supposed that all the goods leaving Halifax were expected to be brought back to Halifax; what must have been in their contemplation was that what usually takes place on a trading voyage should take place, namely, that other goods obtained at the points of destination of the vessel on her trading voyage, should be brought back in exchange for, or in lieu of, those taken from the port of departure of the vessel at the commencement of her voyage. The words then \"beginning the adventure upon the said goods and merchandise from and immediately following the loading thereof,\" &c., &c., &c., can be given effect to by applying them to determine the time when the policy should begin to have effect upon the return cargo without interfering with the contention of the appellants that they were not intended to apply to the loading at Halifax which was already completed before the policy was effected. The policy being construed to apply to the return cargo, in which, under the agreement in evidence, the plaintiff had an undoubted insurable interest when obtained and loaded on the vessel, it is clear that the interest of the plaintiffs in the goods lost was abundantly sufficient to support the verdict, which ought, therefore, to be upheld, and this appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellants: J.

Stats. N. B\u2014Covenant in mortgage deed\u2014Payment by co-obligor.\nJ. H. borrowed $4,000 from M. C. on the 27th of Sept., 1850, at which date J. H. & J. W. gave their joint and several bond to M. C. conditioned for the repayment of the money in five years, with interest quarterly in the meantime. At the same time, and to secure the payment of the $4,000, two separate mortgages were given: one by J. H. and wife on H's wife's property, and one by J. W. and wife, on W.'s property. Neither party executed the mortgage of the other. The mortgage from J. W. contained a provision that upon repayment of the sum of \u00a31,000 and interest according to the condition of the bond by J. W. and J. H., or either of them, their, or either of their, heirs, etc., then said mortgage should be void; a similar provision being inserted in the mortgage from J. H. The bond and mortgages were assigned to L. et al. (the appellants) in 1870, and the principal money has never been paid. J. W. died in 1858, and by his will devised all his residuary real estate, including the lands and premises in the above mentioned mortgage, to G. W. (one of the respondents) and others. J. W., in his lifetime, was, and since his death the respondents have been, in possession of the premises so mortgaged by J. W. Neither J. W., nor any person claiming by, through, or under him, ever paid any interest on said bond and mortgage, or gave any acknowledgment in writing of the title of M. C., or her assigns. J. H., the co-obligor, paid interest on the bond from its date to 27th March, 1870.\nOn 20th January, 1881, under Consolidated Statutes of New Brunswick, ch. 40, a suit of foreclosure and sale of the premises mortgaged by J. W. was commenced by the appellants in the Supreme Court of New Brunswick in equity, and the court gave judgment for the respondents. On appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada,\nHeld (affirming the judgment of the Court below, Strong, J., dissenting)\u2014\n1st. That all liability of J. W.'s personal representatives and of his heirs and devisees to any action whatever upon the bond was barred by secs. 1 and 6 of ch. 85 Consolidated Statutes of New Brunswick, although payment by a co obligor would have maintained the action alive in its integrity under the English Statute 3 and 4 William IV., ch. 42.\n2nd. That the right of foreclosure and sale of the lands included in the J. W. mortgage was barred by the Statute of Limitations in real actions, Cons. Stats. N. B., ch. 84, sec 40.\nPer Gwynne, J.\u2014The only person by whom a payment can be made, or an acknowledgment in writing can be signed, so as to stay the currency of the Statute of Limitations to a point which, being reached, frees the mortgaged lands from all liability under the mortgage, must be either the original party to the mortgage contract, that is to say, the mortgagor, or some person in privity of estate with him, or the agent of one of such persons, and that moneys paid by J. H. in discharge of his own liability had none of the characteristics or quality of a payment made under the liability created by W's mortgage.\nAppeal to the Supreme Court of Canada from the Supreme Court in Equity of New Brunswick, without any intermediate appeal to the Supreme Court of New Brunswick, sitting in appeal, from so much of the decree of the said Supreme Court in Equity, in a suit therein, wherein the present appellants were plaintiffs, and the present respondents and John Howe, William Edwin Archdeacon and Elizabeth White Archdeacon (his wife), Louisa Catherine Hanford, Charles Edward Brown and Sarah Georgiana Brown (his wife), Arthur Wellesley Howe and Mary Elizabeth Howe (his wife), Joseph Howe, Charles Lawton (the younger), Charles Lawton, Sarah A. Lawton, Eliza Lawton, the Reverend William Armstrong, James Sterling, James Dunlop, James Duke, Edward Thorpe and James Davis were defendants, as directed that the plaintiffs' bill of complaint should stand dismissed with costs against the said respondents.\nThe following is the case settled by the Judge in Equity of New Brunswick.\n\"1. This suit was commenced by summons issued out of the Supreme Court in Equity dated the twentieth day of January, A.D. 1881. The bill of complaint was a bill filed for the foreclosure and sale of certain mortgaged lands and premises comprised and described in a certain indenture of mortgage from John Howe and wife to Margaret Cunningham, dated the twenty-seventh day of September, A.D. 1850; and also certain mortgaged lands and premises comprised and described in a certain indenture of mortgage from James White and wife to the said Margaret Cunningham, of the same date; both mortgages and the assignments thereof being duly registered in the records of the city and county of Saint John.\n\"2. On the said twenty-seventh day of September, A.D. 1850, the said John Howe and James White executed a bond or obligation to the said Margaret Cunningham in the words and figures following, that is to say:\u2014\n\"Know all men by these presents that we, John Howe, of the city of Saint John, in the county of Saint John, and province of New Brunswick, postmaster for said province, and James White of the same place, Esquire, are held and firmly bound unto Margaret Cunningham of the same place, spinster, in the penal sum of two thousand pounds of lawful money of the province aforesaid, to be paid to the said Margaret Cunningham, or to her certain attorney, executors, administrators or assigns, for which payment well and truly to be made, we bind ourselves and each of us by himself, our and each of our heirs, executors and administrators firmly by these presents, sealed with our seals, and dated the twenty-seventh day of September, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and fifty.\n\"The condition of this obligation is such that if the above bounden John Howe and James White, or either of them, their or either of their heirs, executors or administrators, do and shall well and truly pay or cause to be paid unto the said Margaret Cunningham, or to her certain attorney, executors, administrators or assigns the just and full sum of one thousand pounds of lawful money of the province aforesaid, with lawful interest thereon, in manner and at the times following, that is to say: the said principal sum of one thousand pounds to be paid on the twenty-seventh day of September, which will be in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and fifty-five, and lawful interest on the said principal sum to commence from the day of the date of these presents, to be paid quarterly on the twenty-seventh day of December, the twenty-seventh day of March, the twenty-seventh day of June, and the twenty-seventh day of September in each and every year until the said principal sum shall be paid and satisfied, then this obligation to be void, otherwise to remain in full force and virtue.\n\"Signed, sealed and delivered in \"J. Howe. [l.s.]\n\"presence of Geo. A. Lockhart.\" \"J. White. [l.s.] \"3. That to secure the amount of the said bond or obligation the two several mortgages, to foreclose which this suit was instituted, were severally given by the said James White and John Howe, the condition of the mortgage from the said James White being as follows, that is to say:\u2014\n\"Provided always, nevertheless, and these presents \"are upon this express condition, that if the said James \"White and John Howe of the city aforesaid, postmaster \"for New Brunswick aforesaid, or either of them, their \"or either of their heirs, executors or administrators, do \"and shall well and truly pay or cause to be paid unto \"the said Margaret Cunningham, or to her certain attorney, \"executors, administrators or assigns, the just and \"full sum of one thousand pounds of lawful money of \"the province aforesaid, with lawful interest for and \"on the same, in manner and at the times following, \"that is to say: the said principal sum of one thousand \"pounds on the twenty-seventh day of September, \"which will be in the year of our Lord one thousand \"eight hundred and fifty-five, with lawful interest on \"the said principal sum to commence from the date of \"these presents, quarterly, on the 27th day of December, \"the 27th day of March, the 27th day of June, and the \"27th day of September in each and every year until \"the said principal sum shall be paid and satisfied, \"without fraud or delay, according to the condition of \"a bond or obligation bearing even date herewith, and \"made and given by said John Howe and James White \"to said Margaret Cunningham, then these presents to \"be void, otherwise to remain in fall force and virtue.\"\nAnd the condition in the mortgage from John Howe and wife being as follows, that is to say:\n\"Provided always, nevertheless, and these presents \"are upon this express condition, that if the said John \"Howe and Mary E., his wife, or the said James White, \"or either of them, or their, or either of their, heirs, \"executors or administrators\/do and shall well and \"truly pay or cause to be paid, to the said Margaret \"Cunningham, or to her certain attorney, executors, \"administrators or assigns the just and full sum of one \"thousand pounds of lawful money of the Province of \"New Brunswick, with lawful interest on the same, in \"manner and at the times following, that is to say: \"the said principal sum to be paid on the 27th day of \"September, which will be in the year of our Lord one \"thousand eight hundred and fifty-five, and lawful \"interest on the said principal sum of one thousand \"pounds, to be paid quarterly on the 27th day of December, \"the 27th day of March, the 27th day of June, \"and the 27th day of September in each and every year \"until the said principal sum shall be fully paid and \"satisfied, such interest to commence from the date of \"these presents, according to the condition of a certain \"bond or obligation bearing even date with these presents, \"and given by the said John Howe and James \"White to said Margaret Cunningham, then these presents \"to be void, otherwise to be and remain in full \"force, virtue and effect.\"\n\"4. That the interest of the said Margaret Cunningham in the said bond and mortgages is now vested in the plaintiffs, and they are the assignees of the said bond and mortgages.\n\"5. That the said James White died in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and fifty-eight, leaving a will appointing the said John Howe an executor thereof, and by his said will, after making certain specific devises, devised all his residuary real estate, including the lands and premises in his above mentioned mortgage, to his daughter, Georgiana Wilson, the respondent, and his daugher Mary E. Howe, wife of the said John Howe. \"6. That in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and eighty, a partition was made between the said respondent Georgiana Wilson and the said Mary E. Howe, the said John Howe being a party thereto, and the said John Howe and Mary E. Howe releasing to the said Georgiana Wilson their interest in the portion of the said mortgaged premises so devised by the said James White, which the appellants seek to have foreclosed and sold, but the said John Howe concealed from the said Georgiana Wilson the fact that the property had been encumbered by the said mortgage of the said James White, and that such mortgage was then in existence, and she took the property at full value in the division.\n\"7. That the said James White up to the time of his death was in possession of the said mortgaged premises described and set forth in the said indenture of mortgage given by him to the said Margaret Cunningham, and since the death of the said James White the said respondent Georgiana Wilson has been in possession thereof, except a portion of the same conveyed by her to William A. Lawton; and the said William A. Lawton and his assigns (the said Benjamin Lawton being now in possession) have been in possession of said portion so conveyed to the said William A. Lawton since the said conveyance; and the said respondent James Harris being a tenant to the said Georgiana Wilson of another portion thereof.\n\"8. That it was proved on the hearing, without objection, that the said John Howe admitted that the original debt was contracted for his benefit, and that he received all the money on said bond.\n\"9. That neither the said James White during his lifetime, nor any person claiming by, through or under him, did at any time pay the interest on the said bond and mortgages, nor has any payment of interest been made otherwise than as is hereinafter mentioned, nor did the said James White, nor any person claiming by, through or under, him ever give any acknowledgment in writing of the title of the said Margaret Cunningham or her assigns, either to the said Margaret Cunningham or to any person claiming under her.\n\"10. That the said John Howe from the date of the said bond paid the interest thereon to the said Margaret Cunningham and the assignees of the said bond and mortgages up to the twenty-seventh day of March, A.D. 1879, since which time no interest has been paid, and the principal sum due on the said bond and the interest from that date are now due to the appellants.\n\"11. The said Georgiana Wilson at the time of the partition above mentioned was not aware of the existence of the said mortgage, except the knowledge, if any, to be implied constructively from the registry thereof.\n\"12. That the respondent James Harris has placed valuable improvements upon the lot of land leased by him from the respondent Georgiana Wilson.\n\"13. The said Margaret Cunningham was not, nor were any of her assignees, ever in possession of the said mortgaged premises, or any part thereof, nor in receipt of any of the rents or profits thereof\n\"14. That on the thirtieth of November, A. D. 1846, being previous to the date of said mortgage made by said James White, he the said James White leased to one James McGregor with covenants to pay for improvements or renew for a further term with like covenants, one of the parcels of land included in said mortgage called lot 18 (eighteen), which said lease was duly registered before the registry of said mortgage, and is referred to in said mortgage as having been given to said McGregor. That said lease was by several mesne assignments, all duly registered, surrendered, assigned and transferred to the said Mary E. Howe and Georgiana Wilson, the last transfer being dated 23rd December, 1858, and registered the fourth day of April, A. D. 1860, in which year the partition deed hereinbefore referred to was executed and by which the said Mary E. Howe released to the said Georgiana Wilson all her interest in said lot number 18 (eighteen), and which said partition deed was registered March 1st, 1860. A nd the said Georgiana Wilson by deed conveyed by way of mortgage all her interest in the said land to secure the sum of seven hundred pounds to one William A. Lawton, and afterwards released all her interest in the equity of redemption in the said lot of land to the said William A. Lawton, all whose interest subsequently became vested in the said respondent Benjamin Lawton.\n\"15. The plaintiffs filed the bill in this suit to foreclose the said mortgages and have the mortgaged premises sold, to which the other defendants put in no answer, and the bill has been taken pro confesso against them.\n\"16. The respondents appeared by separate solicitors and filed separate answers to the said bill of complaint, insisting and claiming that the right of the appellants to have a foreclosure and sale of the lands and premises described and conveyed in the mortgage from James White to Margaret Cunningham, in which they are interested, was barred by the Statutes of Limitation in force in the province of New Brunswick.\n\"Question.\u2014Whether the right of the plaintiffs to foreclose and sell the lands that were so partitioned to Georgiana Wilson and included in White's mortgage, are barred by the Statute of Limitations? and whether the right of foreclosure and sale exists against lot number eighteen, held by the said Benjamin Lawton.\"\nMr. Weldon, Q. C., for appellants.\nDr. Tuck, Q. C., and Mr. Millidge, for respondents. The statutes and authorities relied on by counsel are commented on in the judgments hereinafter given. STRONG, J.,\nThis is an appeal from a decree made by the judge in Equity of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick, in a suit for the foreclosure of a mortgage. There is no dispute as to the facts, which are few and free from complication. For the purposes of the appeal to this Court, a case has been settled by a judge of the court below, in which all the facts are admitted, and the only question presented for decision is one of law, relating to the construction and application of section 40 of the English Statutes of Limitations, 3 and 4 W. 4, ch. 27, and 7 W. 4, and 1 Vic., ch. 28, which have been adopted and re-enacted in New Brunswick, and are respectively sections 29 and 30, ch. 84, of the Consolidated Statutes of New Brunswick, entitled \"An Act relating to the limitation of real actions.\"\nThe suit was commenced by summons issued out of the Supreme Court in Equity on the 20th January, 1881. The facts stated and admitted in the case are as follows:\nOn the 27th of September, 1850, John Howe and James White, executed a joint and several bond to Margaret Cunningham in the penal sum of two thousand pounds, conditioned for the payment by the obligors, or one of them, of one thousand pounds, on the 27th of September, 1855, with interest payable quarterly, on the 27th day of December, the 27th day of March, the 27th day of June, and the 27th day of September, in each and every year, until the principal sum should be paid and satisfied. The case contains the following statement as to the debt which this bond was given to secure. It says:\u2014\nThat it was proved on the hearing without objection that the said John Howe admitted that the original debt was contracted for his benefit and that he received all the money on said bond.\nThe case then states:\u2014\nThat to secure the amount of the said bond or obligation the two several indentures of mortgage, to foreclose which this suit was instituted, were severally given by the said James White and John Howe, the proviso of the mortgage executed by the said James White, [and which is alone in question in this appeal] being as follows: \u2014 Provided always, nevertheless, and these presents are upon this express condition, that if the said James White and John Howe of the city aforesaid, or either of them, their, or either of their heirs, executors, administrators, or assigns, do and shall well and duly pay, or cause to be paid, unto the said Margaret Cunningham, or to her certain attorney, executors, administrators, or assigns, the just and full sum of one thousand pounds of lawful money of the Province aforesaid, with lawful interest for and on the same in manner and at the times following, that is to say, the said principal sum of one thousand pounds on the 27th day of September, which will be in the year 1855, with lawful interest on the said principal sum, to commence from the date of these presents, quarterly, on the 27th day of December, the 27th day of March, the 27th day of June, and the 27th day of September in each and every year, until the said principal sum shall be paid and satisfied, without fraud or delay, according to the condition of a bond or obligation bearing even date herewith and made and given by said John Howe and James White to the said Margaret Cunningham, then these presents to be void, other wise to remain in full force, virtue and effect.\nAnd the proviso contained in the mortgage deed executed by Howe was (mutatis mutandis) to the same effect. Howe was not a party to the mortgage now in question, and no covenant by him was contained in it. These mortgages were in fee and of lands of which the respective mortgagors were severally seised. The bond and mortgages were assigned to and are now vested in the plaintiffs, who are trustees under a marriage settlement. White remained in the possession of the mortgaged premises comprised in the mortgage executed by him, up to the date of his death in 1858, upon which the property, under the provisions of his will, became vested in his two daughters, the respondent Georgiana Wilson and Mrs. Howe, as tenants in common, and upon a partition the lands now in question were allotted to Mrs. Wilson, and she and the other respondents claiming under her have since remained in possession, and neither the original mortgagee, Margaret Cunningham, nor the plaintiffs, her assignees, nor any of them, were ever in possession of the whole or any part of the mortgaged premises. The joint and several bond and the mortgage given by White were executed by him as a surety for Howe, to whom the money advanced was lent by Mrs. Cunningham. The special case then contains these statements, which I extract verbatim:\nNeither the said James White during his lifetime, nor any person claiming by through or under him, did at any time pay the interest on the said bond and mortgage, nor has any payment of interest been made otherwise than as is hereinafter mentioned, nor did the said James White, nor any person claiming by, through, or under, him, ever give any acknowledgment in writing of the title of the said Margaret Cunningham, or her assigns, either to the said Margaret Cunningham, or to any person claiming under her. The said John Howe, from the date of the said bond, paid the interest thereon to said Margaret Cunninghan and the assignees of the said bond and mortgages up to the 27th day of March, 1879, since which time no interest has been paid, and the principal sum due on the said bond and the interest from that date are now due to the appellants.\nTo the bill for the foreclosure of the mortgages mentioned, which was filed in this suit, the respondents by their answers pleaded the statutes of limitations, and insisted and claimed that upon the foregoing state of facts the right of the appellants to foreclose the lands comprised in the mortgage from White to Mrs. Cunningham was barred.\nThe cause came on to be heard before the judge in equity, before whom evidence was taken, and who dismissed the plaintiff's bill, so far as it sought to foreclose the lands comprised in the mortgage executed by White. This decision proceeded upon the ground that the payment of interest made by Howe up to 1879 could not be considered as payments made by an agent for or on behalf of White.\nThe decision of this question must be governed entirely by the provisions contained in the English Statute of Limitations, 1 Vic., ch. 23, which, in common with the provisions of the statutes 3 and 4 W. 4, ch. 27, and 3 and 4 W. 4, ch. 42, have been adopted and re-enacted in New Brunswick, and are, as before stated, included in ch. 84 of the consolidated statutes of that province, entitled \"Limitation of Real Actions,\" and ch. 85 of the same consolidation, entitled \"Limitation of Personal Actions.\" The English Statutes of Limitations have also been adopted and re-enacted in two other provinces of the dominion, Nova Scotia and Ontario. The question now presented for our adjudication is therefore of considerable general importance, more especially as in at least one of these provinces\u2014Ontario\u2014it is a common practice of loan companies and other lenders on mortgages to take, as in the present case, as collateral security, in addition to the mortgage of the borrower and principal debtor on his own lands, a mortgage of a surety on other lands. The enactment applicable to the present case, which must be regarded as a suit for the recovery of land, is the 30th sec of ch. 84 of the consolidated statutes, which is a literal transcript of the Imperial statute 7 W. 4, and 1 Vic., ch. 28, and is in the words following:\nIt shall and may be lawful for any person entitled to, or claiming under, any mortgage of land, to make an entry, or bring an action at law, or suit in equity, to recover such land, at any time within twenty years next after the last payment of any part of the principal money or interest secured by such mortgage, such payment being made within twenty years after the right of entry first accrued, although more than twenty years may have elapsed since the time at which the right to make such entry or bring such action or suit in equity shall have first accrued, anything in this chapter to the contrary notwithstanding.\nThe cases of Heath v. Pugh[1] and Harlock v. Ashberry[2] have decided that a suit for the foreclosure of a mortgage of land is a suit for the recovery of the land, and is therefore within secs. 3 and 4 of the 3 & 4 W. 4, ch. 27 (of which secs. 3 and 21 of ch. 84 of New Brunswick are re-enactments), and is barred at the end of twenty years after the accrual of the right, unless the party can bring himself within some of the savings contained in the original statute, or within the provision already stated of 1 Vic., ch, 28, and these cases have determined that the right of a mortgagee to foreclosure does not depend upon the 40th sec of 3 and 4 W. 4, ch. 27 (New Brunswick statutes, ch. 84, sec. 29), which is applicable, not to a suit for a recovery of the land, but to an action or suit for the recovery of money charged on land, which a foreclosure is not considered to be, a point which was left in uncertainty by the previous case of Chinnery v. Evans[3], which was, however, not a foreclosure suit, but a proceeding to have a charge upon lands raised by a sale.\nNothing, however, depends upon this consideration, since the House of Lords in Chinnery v. Evans, as well as the Court of Appeal in Harlock vs. Ashberry, hold that the two, enactments are to receive the same construction as regards the point now in question,\u2014that as to the person by whom the payment of principal or interest requisite to take a case out of the bar of the statute is to be made. It is true that in the case of Chinnery v. Evans the Lord Chancellor read the words found in sec. 40, but not found in 1 Vic., ch. 28, \"by whom the same shall be payable, or his agent,\" as applicable, not only to a written acknowledgment, but also to a payment of principal or interest, but in a subsequent part of his judgment he says:\nI should have stated that the other statute, the 7 W. 4 and 1 Vic., cap. 28, was passed for the purpose of preserving in the mortgagee the right to make an entry and bring an ejectment to recover the lands, the language of the 40th sec. of the former act being confined to cases of recovery of money. The same principle is applicable to both, and the same ratio decidendi will apply to both sections.\nI should say therefore that if Chinnery v. Evans stood alone, that it established that the payment mentioned in the 1 Vic., ch. 28, meant a payment by a party liable or entitled to pay, or by some person expressly or impliedly delegated to make the payment. But all doubt on this point is removed by the subsequent case of Harlock v. Ashberry in which the Master of the Rolls (Sir George Jessel), whilst doubting the verbal construction of the words of sec. 40, 3 and 4 W. 4, ch. 27, already mentioned, construes the word \"payment,\" standing alone in 1 Vic., sec. 28, as implying satisfaction by a person liable to pay, or by some one acting as his agent, or by his authority, or, as Lord Justice Brett expresses it: \"by a person 'entitled' to make a payment,\" and held that it does not apply to money received by the mortgagee from a mere volunteer.\nThe question here is therefore reduced to this:\u2014Was Howe, upon the facts stated, and having regard to the terms of the proviso in White's mortgage, and to the legal relation of principal and surety which existed between him and White, a person entitled to make a payment of principal and interest within the statute 1 Vic., ch. 28 (New Brunswick, ch. 84, sec. 30)?\nI should say that it was admitted on the argument at the bar, that the interest was regularly paid by Howe up to the 27th March, 1879, and that this fact was shown by the evidence or admissions at the hearing of the cause, and that the 10th paragraph of the case, framed for the purpose of this appeal, was to be taken as so stating, and it was not pretended that at any interval between the date of the mortgage deed and the 27th of March, 1879, the interest was ever in arrear for twenty years.\nI am of opinion that the payment of the interest by Howe was a payment by a person entitled to make it, and a payment on behalf of White, and this upon two distinct grounds; first, the proviso or condition of the mortgage deed executed by White, in the words \"these presents are upon this express condition that if the said James White or John Howe, or either of them, do and shall well and duly pay or cause to be paid,\" is an express stipulation that Howe shall be entitled to make payments which shall enure to the benefit of the mortgagor; and secondly, that, if this proviso had been differently framed, and had made no mention of payments by Howe, but had been the usual condition for the avoidance of the mortgage upon payment by White, the mortgagor, alone, there would, from the established relationship between the parties\u2014that of principal and surety\u2014have been an implied authority to Howe to pay on behalf of White. Whatever may be said upon the point of law involved in the last of these grounds, it is to me difficult to see how there can be any doubt as to the effect of the proviso. Prim\u00e2 facie if a mortgagor stipulates that the mortgage shall be avoided, not only by a payment made by himself, but also by a payment made by another person named, he stipulates that he shall have the benefit of a payment made by such named person, and if he stipulates that he shall have this benefit of the payment made by the third person, it would seem to require no demonstration to show that the third person is entitled to make the payment, and that the mortgagee cannot legally refuse to accept a payment tendered by such third person.\nBy the law of England a stranger to a contract for the payment of money cannot make a payment which will be good to discharge the debtor, though if the creditor accepts the payment, and the debtor afterwards ratifies it, then, upon the general principle of the doctrine of ratification, the subsequent adoption is equivalent to a prior authority, and the payment is good; but I apprehend there is nothing to prevent the parties to a contract from providing by the contract itself that the obligation of the debtor may be discharged by a third person not a party to it, and where this is done the person whose payment is so agreed to be accepted by the creditor is not to be considered a mere agent of the debtor whose authority would be revoked by the death of the latter before the day of payment, but that his payment ad diem after the death of the original debtor, would also discharge the executor. Again, no reason can be suggested why, as in the present case, an estate upon condition such as a mortgage may not by the terms of the condition be made defeasible upon payment by a stranger to the deed, and if so, just as in the case of the personal contract, the third person so named would not be an agent whose agency would be revoked by the death of the mortgagor before payment, but as his payment would be the event upon which the condition was to be determined, he would be a person entitled to pay, and whose payment at the day named would, by force of the literal terms of the condition, have the effect at law of re-vesting the estate in the mortgagor. Therefore, if White had died before the 27th of September, 1855, the day named for the payment of the principal of the mortgage debt, and before any default in the payment of the interest at the stipulated terms, payment on that day by Howe would at once and irrespective of adoption or ratification have enured to the benefit of White's representatives, and the estate would have immediately become re-vested in the devisees.\nBy reason of this distinction between a mere agent and a person entitled to pay by the terms of the mortgage deed, Littleton, sec. 334, and Lord Coke's commentary upon it[4], where he says:\nBut if any stranger in the name of the mortgagor or his heir (without his consent or privity) tender the money and the mortgagee accepts it this is a good satisfaction and the mortgagor or his heir agreeing thereunto may re-enter into the land \u2014\nare inapplicable so far as the assent of the heir is said to be requisite. And if such would have been the effect at law of a payment ad diem, it of course follows that a good equitable tender of the whole debt might have been made by Howe at any time, and that consequently he was a person entitled to make payments of interest accruing due subsequently to default in the payment of the principal at the day appointed by the mortgage deed.\nI have made these observations, which may appear so elementary as scarcely to have been called for, not because I consider there is any real difficulty upon the point, but as affording an answer to the argument, which I understood to be urged at the hearing of the appeal, that Howe was a mere agent whose authority was revoked upon the death of his principal, White.\nSo far I have been considering the case with regard to the effect of the proviso only, and as if Howe had been a mere stranger in no way liable for the mortgage debt, but when we advert to the fact that whatever legal form may have been given to the transaction by making the parties jointly liable as bond-debtors and severally liable as mortgagors, its real nature was that Howe was the principal debtor and White a mere surety, whose mortgage was given as a collateral security for the debt of his principal, the conclusion is irresistible that Howe was under the terms of the proviso a person entitled to pay, notwithstanding White's death. The mortgagee must have had notice that White was a mere surety, for it is found as a fact that the loan was made to Howe alone. Then, is it not reasonable to consider this proviso, though very inartificially drawn, to have been framed as it is for the very purpose of making provision for the case of payment by Howe alone as the party primarily liable? I am of opinion that it is, and that when we find this form of proviso, coupled with the fact that the parties were from the beginning principal and surety, we must assume that it was intended for the purpose of giving expression to the right of White the surety and all claiming under him, to the benefit of payments made by Howe, the principal debtor, as being made in exoneration of White's estate.\nThese considerations make it impossible to say that Howe was a mere agent for payment whose authority was revoked by the death of his principal.\nI have come to the conclusion therefore, that by the terms of the proviso Howe was entitled to make payments of interest in discharge of White's liability. And merely adverting to the principle upon which all these exceptions in statutes of limitations proceed, that a party is not to be considered in default unless he sleeps upon his rights, this appears to me to be not an unreasonable conclusion. On the contrary, would it not be most unreasonable to say that the mortgagees were neglecting to enforce their rights, when all the time they were receiving payments, sufficient to satisfy the requirements of the statute, according to the strict tenor of the agreement between the parties and from the person primarily liable to pay, and were thus, to the extent of these payments at least, under no necessity of enforcing their rights and disabled from doing so.\nFurther, the authorities warrant the second proposition before stated, that, discarding altogether the provision of the deed already considered, and treating the case as though there had been no express mention of payment by Howe, the legal relationship of principal and surety which existed between Howe and White, which is admitted in the case, made payments by Howe which enured to the benefit of White, payments by a person who, according to the expression of Lord Justice Brett in Harlock v. Ashberry, \"was entitled to pay,\" which is all that is required to bring the case within the terms of 1 Vic., ch. 28, (New Brunswick Statutes, ch. 84, sec. 30.) Upon this point, which in the view I take it is unnecessary to dwell upon, there are ample authorities. Harlock v. Ashberry is itself one of these authorities, but others can be produced. Chinnery v. Evans, if it establishes anything, establishes the proposition, that a person who has a right to require from the mortgagee the acceptance of his payment, whose offer of payment would be considered a good equitable, if not a good legal, tender, is a person entitled to pay within the meaning of the statute\u2014unless, as in the case of the personal liability of joint contractors, some statutory provision is found to the contrary. If this be so, the payment of a principal debtor must be sufficient to keep alive the claim of the mortgagee against the mortgaged estate of the surety. But this very point was decided in a case before the Master of the Rolls in Ireland, which was cited in argument without disapprobation in the case of Chinnery v. Evans. The case I refer to is Homan v. Andrews[5]. The facts there are very long and somewhat complicated, but may be stated shortly as follows; there being a charge (not a mortgage) upon certain lands, the owner of the lands sold them subject to the charge, and gave the purchasers, by way of indemnity or collateral security against the charge, a lien or charge upon other lands; no payments were for upwards of twenty years made by the purchasers, the owners of the lands originally charged, but the owner of the indemnity lands, had made payments of interest, from time to time, within the statutory term, to the persons entitled to the money charged, and the Master of the Rolls held that such payments were sufficient to take the case out of the statute. It is true, that this case of Homan v. Andrews was considered to be within section 40 of 3 and 4 W. 4, ch. 27 (New Brunswick statutes ch. 84 sec. 29,) but that can make no difference, as the person entitled to make payments sufficient to save the statute is the same under both statutes, as is established by Chinnery v. Evans and Harlock v. Ashberry. This case of Homan v. Andrews is therefore a direct authority for the proposition I am now dealing with, and its authority, so far as I can ascertain, has never been impugned. Again, a case decided by the Chancellor of Ontario, Slater v. Mosgrove[6] is also an authority for the appellants. The interest on a mortgage debt being in arrear and overdue, the mortgagor gave the mortgagee his promissory note for the amount of the arrears, endorsed by his son as a surety, the surety subsequently paid the note, and the learned Chancellor held this sufficient to prevent the statute operating as a bar to the mortgagee's right of foreclosure. It is true that the learned Judge refers to Mr. Justice Fry's decision in Harlock v. Ashberry, which had not then been reversed, but it is obvious from the context of his judgment that he did not proceed upon that decision alone, but also upon the principle that the interest had been paid by a person entitled to make the payment, and whose money the mortgagee was legally bound to accept in payment. The case of Toft v. Stephenson[7] may also be added to these authorities[8].\nThe principle of all these cases appears to be that the payment is sufficient, if it is a payment on account of the identical mortgage debt itself, made directly on account of the debt, and not merely of a sum which the mortgagor would, according to the rules of a court of equity in taking a mortgage account, be bound to give credit for and also provided it is a payment by a person who could require the mortgagee to accept a payment of the whole amount due for principal and interest. The argument in support of this last proposition being obviously this, that a mortgagee should not be barred by the statute of limitations as long as his rights are recognised by a payment on account of interest from a person who has a right to call upon him to accept the principal and interest in full. For these reasons, I am of opinion that the appellants are clearly entitled to a reversal of the decree, and this conclusion is not in the least degree shaken by a consideration of the reasons for the contrary view given in the judgment below and also in that which will be delivered on behalf of the majority of this court, and which I have been permitted to read. As regards the argument which is founded on the bond which was executed as collateral to the mortgage, and which was the joint and several bond of Howe and White, and the effect of section 6 of chapter 85 of the consolidated statutes of New Brunswick upon the right to recover the bond debt, I see nothing in it to cause any doubt as to the correctness of the opinion already stated. The provisions of the statutes of limitations which would apply in the case of this bond would not be those which I have been considering, 3 and 4 W. 4, c. 27, secs. 2 and 24, and 1 Vic., ch. 28 (New Brunswick, ch. 84, secs. 3, 21 and 30), but 3 and 4 W. 4, ch. 27, sec. 40 (New Brunswick, ch. 84, sec. 29) which, as settled by cases very lately decided, Sutton v. Sutton[9], Fearnside v. Flint[10], applies to personal actions for the recovery of debts charged on lands. Section 6 of ch. 85, con. stats. New Brunswick, is in the following words:\u2014\nNo person jointly contracting, or liable, or his representative, shall be answerable for or by reason of, any payment, acknowledgment, or promise of his co-contractor, or debtor, or his representatives.\nAlthough not exactly in the same words, this section is in substance a re-enactment of section 14 of the English statute, known as the Mercantile Law Amendment Act of 1856. The statute in which it is found, ch. 85 of consolidated statutes of New Brunswick, is confined to the \"Limitation of Personal Actions,\" whilst the provisions corresponding to the English statute, 1 Vic., ch. 28, and 3 and 4 W., ch. 27, are included in the preceding chapter, of the New Brunswick statutes ch. 84, which is entitled \"Limitation of Real Actions.\"\nIt appears to me quite plain that this provision can have no application here, since this is not an action for the recovery of the money due upon the joint and several bond, but one for the recovery of the land, and that the payment relied on as preserving the right to maintain this suit or action is not a payment by a joint contractor, but a payment by a person entitled to pay on behalf of the mortgagor. It is, I think, for these reasons manifest that this provision can have no reference to a payment sufficient under 1 Vic., ch. 28 (New Brunswick ch. 84, sec. 30). Indeed, I should doubt if it could apply to sec. 40 of 3 & 4 W. IV., ch 27, (New Brunswick ch. 84, sec. 29), but as that question does not arise here I need not stop to consider it.\nThe case of Harlock v. Ashberry is relied on as in favor of the respondents. So far from being so, it seems to me a clear authority for the appellants. The ratio decidendi of that case was that the payment of the rent by the tenant of one of several mortgaged parcels was not a payment of either principal or interest, that at most it was the payment of a sum which the mortgagee would be compelled to bring into account; and that no ratification by the mortgagor would make it a payment of principal or interest, since it was not originally made as such; the payment therefore only operated as a receipt of rent equivalent to a taking of possession of the particular parcel in the occupation of the tenant, and saved the statute as to that, but had no effect as to the other lands comprised in the same mortgage\u2014a decision upon questions which obviously have no bearing upon the present case. But, on the other hand, the learned judges of the Court of Appeal all distinctly recognize, and state in the most explicit manner, the principle that a payment of interest by any party liable or even \"entitled\" to pay it, is sufficient to bring a case within 1 Vic., ch. 28, (New Brunswick ch. 84, sec. 30,) which, as the court also decides, is the statute which exclusively regulates the saving of the rights of mortgagees from the operation of the statute by means of payment. As regards the case of Bolding v. Lane[11], it was a case, not of payment, but of written acknowledgment, it came under section 42 of 3 and 4 W. 4, ch. 27, and, as is shown by Lord Westbury in Chinnery v. Evans, can have no bearing on the present question. The cases of Fearnside v. Flint and Sutton v. Sutton do not touch the present question; they merely decide that a debt arising on a bond given as collateral security to a mortgage, or for money otherwise charged on land, is within sec. 40 of 3 and 4 W. 4, ch. (New Brunswick ch. 84 sec. 29) and was therefore subject to the shorter period of limitation of 12 years applied by the last statute to the recovery of money charged on land, and not to the provisions as to bond debts not charged on land, which are governed by 3 and 4 W. 4, ch 42, which makes 20 years only a bar to such debts. It may be remarked that these cases of Fearnside v. Flint and Sutton v. Sutton, also show that an action to enforce the personal liability on the bond in the present case would be subject to sec. 40 of 3 and 4 W. 4, ch. 27, (New Brunswick Consolidated Statutes ch. 84, sec. 29,) and not to the provision of sec. 6 ch. 85 of the last mentioned statutes. It appears to me, therefore, that none of the reasons upon which the majority of the court rely are sufficient to show that the conclusions I have above stated are erroneous, and I must adhere to them.\nThis appeal, as I have said, comes before us upon the case settled by the court below, pursuant to the 29th section of the Supreme Court Act, and the pleadings and evidence have not been printed, and are not before this court. In the case the suit is described as one for foreclosure, and I have so treated it. If, however, it had been one for a sale of the mortgaged lands instead of foreclosure, though it might not have been a suit for the recovery of land, and so within the New Brunswick enactment corresponding to the 1st Vic., ch. 28, it would have been a suit for the recovery of money charged on land, and so within the New Brunswick re-enactment of sec. 40 of 3 and 4 W. 4, ch. 27, which, as already shewn, is to be construed in the same way as 1 Vic., ch. 28, and I should, therefore, have been, in that case, also of opinion that the payments of interest by Howe were, for the reasons before stated, sufficient to prevent the bar of the statute.\nI am of opinion that the plaintiffs are entitled to a decree of foreclosure, and that the appeal should be allowed.\nFOURNIER, J., concurred with Gwynne, J.\nHENRY, J.:\u2014\nThe decision of this case depends, in my mind, wholly on the application to it of the provisions of section 6 of the 85th chapter of the Consolidated Statutes of New Brunswick.\nThat section provides as follows:\nNo person, jointly contracting or liable, or his representatives, shall be answerable for or by reason of any payment, or acknowledgment, or promise, of his co-contractor, or debtor, or his representatives.\nThe circumstances of this case may be briefly stated as follows:\nIn 1850 John Howe, as principal, and James White became parties to a joint and several bond to a party, through whom the appellants claim, in \u00a32,000 conditioned for the payment of \u00a31,000 as therein mentioned. It would seem that White became a party to it as surety for Howe, although such does not appear by the bond. On the same day Howe and White executed two separate mortgages of different real properties to the obligee of the bond conditioned for the payment by Howe of the same \u00a31,000 secured by the bond. The time provided for the payment thereof expired on the 27th September, 1855. Howe continued to make payments on the bond and mortgage up to 1879. White died in 1858, and it is not shown that either he or any one authorized by him ever paid anything in the shape of principal or interest on the bond or mortgage executed by him, nor has any of his representatives, or any one authorized by law to bind them, done so. The statute of limitations, as to him, began to run in 1855, and if White and his representatives are not bound by the payments made by Howe, the claim as against the latter is barred by the statute.\nPrevious to the enactment I have quoted, there is no doubt that payment by a joint debtor by bond or otherwise would suspend the operation of the statute, and another joint debtor could not successfully set it up as a defence, but since the enactment of a similar provision in England, I can find no case to justify me in deciding that the payments made by Howe had any effect in suspending the operation of the statute as to the representatives of White.\nAs, therefore, no payment, acknowledgment or promise is shown to have been made by White or any one by him authorized\u2014for Howe had no authority to bind him\u2014or by any one of his representatives, I am of opinion the claim against the respondents was barred by the statute, and that the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nTASCHEREAU, J., concurred with Gwynne, J.\nGWYNNE, J.:\nThis case, when thoroughly understood, appears to me to be free from difficulty and concluded by authority.\nOn the 27th September, 1850, John Howe, as principal, and James White, as his surety in fact, though not expressed so to be, executed in favor of one Margaret Cunningham, their joint and several bond or obligation, whereby they bound themselves, and each of them, himself, his heirs, executors and administrators, in the penal sum of \u00a32000 money of New Brunswick, subject to a condition thereunder written that the said obligation should be void, if the said John Howe and James White, or either of them, or either of their heirs, executors, or administrators, should well and truly pay, or cause to be paid, unto the said Margaret Cunningham, her executors, administrators, or assigns, the just and full sum of \u00a31000 of lawful money of New Brunswick, with lawful interest thereon, as follows, that is to say, the said principal sum to be paid on the 27th day of September, A.D., 1855, and lawful interest on the said principal sum to be paid quarterly on the 27th day of December, March, June and September in each and every year.\nOn the same day, the said John Howe and James White severally executed to the said Margaret Cunningham two several indentures of mortgage conveying to her certain lands of which they were respectively seized in fee simple. The indenture of mortgage so executed by the said James White, conveying to the said Margaret Cunningham, her heirs and assigns, the lands of the said James White therein mentioned whereof he was seized in fee simple, was subject to a proviso in the words following:\nProvided always, nevertheless, and these presents are upon this express condition, that if the said James White and John Howe, or either of them, their, or either of their heirs, executors or administrators do and shall, well and truly pay, or cause to be paid, unto the said Margaret Cunningham, her executors, administrators or assigns, the just and full sum of one thousand pounds of lawful money of the province aforesaid, with lawful interest for and on the same, in manner and at the times following, that is to say, the said principal sum of one thousand pounds on the 27th day of September, which will be in the year of our Lord, 1855, with lawful interest on the said principal sum to commence from the date of these presents quarterly on the 27 th days of December, March, June and September in each and every year until the said principal sum shall be paid and satisfied without fraud or delay according to the condition of a bond or obligation bearing even date herewith, and made and given by the said John Howe and James White to said Margaret Cunningham, then these presents to be void, otherwise to remain in full force and virtue.\nThe indenture of mortgage executed by John Howe of the lands whereof he was seized in fee simple to his sole use, was subject to a like proviso for avoiding it.\nIt will be convenient here to draw attention to the difference between the mode of expression in the English statute and in that of the province of New Brunswick bearing upon the point in issue. In the Imperial statute 3 & 4 W. 4., ch. 42. by the 3rd section it is enacted that actions of debt upon any bond or other specialty shall be brought within 20 years after the cause of any such action or suits, and not after.\nThe 4th section makes provision for the case of infants, femmes covertes, &c., and the absence of defendants beyond seas.\nThen comes the 5th section, which provides\u2014\nThat if any acknowledgment shall have been made, either by writing signed by the party liable by virtue of such indenture, specialty or recognizance, or his agent, or by part payment or part satisfaction on account of any principal or interest being then due thereon, it shall and may be lawful for the person or persons entitled to such actions to bring his or their action for the money remaining unpaid, and so acknowledged to be due, within twenty years after such acknowledgment by writing or part payment or part satisfaction as aforesaid, or in case the person or persons entitled to such action shall at the time of such acknowledgment be under such disability as aforesaid, or the party making such acknowledgments, at the time of making the same beyond the seas, then within twenty years after such disability shall have ceased as aforesaid, or the party shall have returned from beyond the seas, as the case may be, and the plaintiff or plaintiffs in any such action on any indenture, specialty or recognizance, may by way of replication, state such acknowledgment and that such action was brought within the time aforesaid in answer to a plea of this statute.\nNow, if the present question arose under this statute the payments by Howe would have had the effect of preserving the original action in its integrity against White and his heirs and executors upon that bond. That point was decided by Lord Chancellor Cranworth, assisted by two common law judges, Williams and Crowder, JJ., after a most careful examination of the statute, in Roddam v. Morley[12]. In the opinion delivered by the common law judges, they say that it never had been at all doubted, either at the bar or on the bench, but that the act extends as well to the case of a bond with several obligors as also to the case where the liability has been transferred by death to a representative of the party originally liable, and that if one of several obligors were to make the requisite acknowledgment, it had never been disputed that this would be an acknowledgment by the party liable, within the intention of the statute, and that it follows from thence, that the words: \"The party liable or his \"agent,\" are to be read as if they were \"the party \"or parties liable by virtue of the bond, &c., &c., or any \"of them, or his, her, or their agents,\" and Lord Chancellor Cranworth, in giving judgment, says:\nI have come to the conclusion that when a part payment, or payment of interest, has been made which has the effect of preserving any right of action, that right will be saved not only against the party making the payment, but also against all other parties liable on the specialty.\nIt was held in that case, that where a tenant for life of devised real estate had for many years, and up to the time of his death regularly paid interest on a bond of his devisor, in which the heirs were bound, such payment of interest by the tenant for life was an acknowledgment within the meaning of the proviso of 3 & 4 William IV., ch. 42, sec. 5, and kept the bond alive in its integrity as against the devisee in remainder. The provision of the New Brunswick statute upon this point is very different. By the 85th chapter of the Consolidated Statutes of New Brunswick, sec. 1, it is enacted that no action upon any judgment, recognisance, bond or other specialty shall be brought but within twenty years after the cause of action. By sec. 5:\nNo acknowledgment or promise shall be evidence of a new and continuing contract or liability whereby to take any case out of the operation of the provisions of this chapter, or to deprive any party of the benefit thereof, unless such acknowledgment or promise be in writing signed by the party chargeable thereby, but a payment made on account of any such debt shall have the effect of such acknowledgment or promise.\nAnd by section 6\u2014\nNo person, jointly contracting or liable, or his representatives, shall be answerable for or by reason of any payment, acknowledgment or promise of his co-contractor or debtor, or his representatives.\nNow, upon the execution of the several instruments above mentioned, Margaret Cunningham held, as security for the moneys due to her, the joint and several bond or obligation of John Howe and James White, which was enforceable against them jointly and severally and against their several and respective personal representatives, and also against their respective heirs, and devisees as to lands descended or devised, by an action brought upon the bond in pursuance of the statute 3 W. & M. ch 14. She also held special separate security upon the respective real estates of them, the said John Howe and James White, conveyed by the several mortgages by them respectively executed. Upon the 27th September, 1855, the principal secured by the bond became due, and from that day the statute of Limitations began to run. The regular payment of interest by Howe until the 27th March, 1879 (it may be admitted) deprived Howe and his real as well as personal representatives, of all benefit of the statute of Limitations as a defence to an action upon the bond, but it had no effect in stopping the running of the statute of Limitations as a defence by White and his real and personal representatives to any action upon the bond. While the statute was so running in favor of White and his representatives, White died in the year 1858, having by his will made Howe his executor. It is admitted, however, that all payments of interest made by Howe since the death of White were, as had been those made by him before White's death, made by him on his own individual liability, and not in the capacity of White's executor, so that, on and from the 25th September, 1875, all liability of White's personal representatives, and of his heirs and devisees as to lands descended or devised, to any action whatever upon the bond, became extinguished by force of the provisions of the 1st and 6th sections of the 85th chapter of the consolidated statutes of New Brunswick, although such a payment by a co-obligor would have maintained the action alive in its integrity, under the English statute, equally against the other obligor not paying as against the one making the payments; and the sole question remaining is whether, during all the time that the statute was thus running so as to mature into a complete discharge of White's personal representatives, and of his heirs and devisees as to lands descended or devised, on any action being instituted on the bond, it was or not running at all in favor of White's devisee of the real estate mentioned in the mortgage, the contention of the plaintiffs being that it was not\u2014or, in other words, that the act of White's co-obligor which could not keep alive White's liability or that of his real or personal representatives under the bond, could nevertheless keep alive his liability and that of his real representatives under the mortgage, or that an act which was insufficient to prevent the completion of the discharge of White and his real and personal representatives from all liability in respect of the principal obligation, is sufficient to keep alive his liability, if living, and that of his real representatives, he being dead, in respect of a property conveyed only as a security collateral to, and for securing payment of such principal obligation.\nThe New Brunswick statute directly bearing upon this point, namely, the 27th section of ch. 84 of the Consolidated Statutes of New Brunswick, is identical in its terms with the English statute, 3rd and 4th William IV., ch. 27, sec. 40, and is as follows:\u2014\nNo action or suit or other proceeding shall be brought to recover any sum of money, secured by any mortgage, judgment or lien, or otherwise charged upon or payable out of any land at law or in equity, but within twenty years next after a present right to receive the same shall have accrued to some person capable of giving a discharge for, or release of, the same (unless in the meantime some part of the principal money, or some interest thereon, shall have been paid, or some acknowledgment of the right thereto shall have been given in writing signed by the person by whom the same shall be payable or his agent,) to the person entitled thereto or his agent, and in such case no such action or suit or proceeding shall be brought but within twenty years after such payment or acknowledgment or the last of such payments or acknowledgments, if more than one were given.\nThe whole point in the case lies in the proper solution of this question, namely, who is the person designated by the expression in the act:\u2014\nUnless in the meantime some part of the principal money or some interest thereon shall have been paid by the person by whom the same shall be payable or his agent?\nThe connection of the words \"or some, acknowledgment of the right thereto, shall have been given in writing, signed,\" after the words \"unless in the meantime some part of the principal money, or some interest thereon shall have been paid,\" and before the words \"by the person by whom the same shall be payable,\" seems to indicate, I think, very plainly, that the statute contemplates that the person competent to make a payment so as to stay the continuance of the running of the statute and to keep the mortgage alive, and the person competent to keep it alive by a written acknowledgment of a right thereto, that is, to payment, must be one and the same person, and that such person must be either the mortgagor or some person interested in the estate mortgaged by title derived from him. Money handed over to the mortgagee by a person not a party to or affected by the contract contained in the mortgage, could not be a payment in discharge of, or in acknowledgment of, a liability existing in virtue of the mortgage, so as to have the effect of keeping it alive. As the section is dealing with respect to the rights of the mortgagor and mortgagee and those claiming under them the lands held in mortgage, and to the money secured thereby, it appears to me to be equally clear that the principal money, the payment of some part of which, or of some interest thereon, is to have the effect of staying the operation of the statute of limitations and of keeping alive the liability created by the mortgage, must be the principal money as secured by the mortgage, and not as secured by some other instrument. Upon the execution of the mortgage, the principal money for which the bond, which constituted the principal obligation, had been given, was made payable out of, and charged upon, White's land comprised in the mortgage. Upon White's death, in 1858, all White's estate and interest in that land passed to his devisee, in whose hands it remained subject to the liability to pay the money secured by the mortgage, or in default to lose the land; coupled, however, with a right to come upon White's personal estate for indemnity if compelled to pay the debt so secured by mortgage, in order to release the mortgaged lands. The statute is to be read, as it appears to me, as providing that no action shall be brought to recover any sum of money secured upon and payable out of any land, but within 20 years next after a present right to receive the money so made payable out of the land mortgaged, shall have accrued, unless, in the meantime, some part of the principal money, that is, as secured by the mortgage, or some interest thereon, shall have been paid by some person by whom the same, that is, the money secured by the mortgage, shall be payable under and by force of the mortgage. The language of the section appears to me to point very distinctly to the mortgagor as the person primarily referred to in the sentence as the person by whom the same shall be payable, and, secondarily all persons claiming through him any estate or interest in the lands out of which the money secured by the mortgage is thereby made payable. There could be no sense, as it appears to me, in holding that any person could by any act of his deprive White's devisee of the benefit of the Statute of Limitations continuing to run to maturity so as to free the land devised to such devisee from all liability under the mortgage other than such devisee as the owner of the equity of redemption in the land mortgaged, or his or her agent. No act of White's personal representatives, who are strangers to the devisee of the land mortgaged, and to any estate in such lands could, as it appears to me, have such effect, and if no act of White's personal representatives could have the effect, a fortiori a person who, by the statute ch. 85 of the Consolidated Statutes of New Brunswick, could not by any act of his subject White's personal representatives to any liability under the bond, could not by any act of his prejudice the estate and interest of White's devisee in the land devised. And this view is consistent with the construction which the act has received in the English courts.\nIn Bolding v. Lane[13] the question arose as to the right to recover more than six years arrears of interest on money decreed by mortgage under the 42nd section of 3rd and 4th William IV., ch. 27, in which similar words to those in the 40th section, viz., \"the person by whom the same was payable,\" occur. The question was whether an acknowledgment in writing signed by a mortgagor to the effect that the arrears for more than six years were due would enable the first mortgagee to recover the whole amount of the arrears out of the land as against the second and subsequent mortgagees, and it was held that it would not. V. C. Stuart had held the words, \"the person by whom the same was payable\" meant the person who was liable to pay the interest under the contract, i. e., the mortgage contract, namely, the mortgagor or his representative, and he accordingly held that the acknowledgment by the mortgagor was sufficient, but upon appeal this decision was reversed, Lord Westbury holding that the acknowledgment signed by the mortgagor was not binding on the second and subsequent mortgagees. The words of the statute appear, he says, to have been selected as a description capable of including not only every person liable to be sued at law, i.e., under the mortgage, but every person who, having an interest in the land sought to be charged, might be properly sued as a defendant in a suit in equity brought to enforce payment of the principal and interest out of such land, and it follows, he says, as a necessary consequence, that it was not the intention, nor is it the effect of the section, to give to the mortgagor, or other person who is by law compellable to pay the interest, a statutory power to deprive, by his acknowledgment given to a prior incumbrancer, the subsequent incumbrancers of the benefit of the statute, which would be monstrously unjust, but to enact a plain and simple rule that no person having a charge on lands shall recover more than six years' interest on such charge against any other person having an interest in the lands without an acknowledgment in writing signed by such person, or by some former owner from whom his interest is derived, i.e, as the context shows, signed by some former owner before the interest, derived from him and existing when the acknowledgment was given, was created.\nThat rule, as it appears to me, applies precisely to the present case in which the payment relied upon as keeping the mortgage alive notwithstanding the currency of the statute of limitations was not made by the mortgagor or by any person liable to pay by force of the mortgage, but by a person an utter stranger thereto, and to any interest whatever in the land mortgaged, which is sought to be charged with the liability originally and solely created thereby.\nIn Chinnery v. Evans[14], where a mortgage had been made of estates A, B and C, situate in three different counties, and by an order made, on the petition of the mortgagee under the provisions of a statute in that behalf, a receiver was appointed who entered into possession of estate A only, and out of the rents received in respect thereof, paid the interest upon the mortgage, the equity of redemption in estates B and C was sold and conveyed by the mortgagor without the mortgagee being made a party to the conveyance to a purchaser, it was held that payment by the receiver out of the rents of estate A, was a payment \"by a person by whom the sum was payable or his agent,\" within the meaning of the section so as to preserve the mortgagee's rights against estates B and C also, and Bolding v. Lane[15] having been cited as an authority to the effect that payment by such receiver was not sufficient for that purpose, Lord Westbury, while insisting upon the correctness of the decision in Bidding v. Lane, points out the distinction between it and Chinnery v. Evans, that the former was a case of several incumbrancers ranking in a series one after another, in which case payment, although made by the mortgagor, could not keep alive the right of a first mortgagee to arrears of interest as against a second mortgagee, whereas in Chinnery v. Evans, the payment by the receiver being, as it was held to be, the same as payment by the mortgagor himself to the mortgagee, of the three estates included in one mortgage, and out of the rents derived from one of them, the mortgagee could not be deprived of his right to resort to any estate comprised in his mortgage, so long as that mortgage is legally and regularly kept alive, as it was in that case kept alive by payment of interest accruing due upon it by the mortgagor, whom the receiver represented within the meaning of the statute. In this case it was also held that the same principle and ratio decidendi are to be applied to the English Act 7th William IV., and 1st Vic., ch. 28, which is identical with ch. 84 of the Consolidated Statutes of New Brunswick, sec. 30, as are to be applied to 3rd and 4th William IV., ch. 27, sec. 40, which is identical with sec. 29 of the above ch. 84 of the New Brunswick Statutes, the Act 7th William IV., and 1st Vic., ch. 28, having been passed merely to remove doubts and to secure to mortgagees the same right to recover the lands held in mortgage as by 8rd and 4th William IV., ch. 27, sec. 40, they are given to recover the monies secured thereby.\nAs remarked by Sir George Jessel, M. R., in the Court of Appeal from the Chancery Division of the High Court of Justice in Knatchbull v. Hallett[16], it is the establishment of some principle to assist a judge in deciding future cases arising, that the chief use of authorities consists. Now, the principle to be derived from Chinnery v. Evans, and Bolding v. Lane, appears to me to be that whether the action, suit or proceeding, be for recovering the mortgaged lands, or for enforcing payment of the moneys secured by the mortgage, the only person by whom a payment can be made, or an acknowledgment in writing can be signed, so as to stay the currency of the statute of limitations to a point which, being reached, frees the mortgaged lands from all liability under the mortgage, must be either the original party to the mortgage contract, that is to say, the mortgagor, or some person in privity of estate with him, or the agent of one of such persons. Now, the payments by Howe were not made in discharge of any contract of White contained in the mortgage; in making those payments, which Howe made in discharge of his own liability under his own bond and mortgage, he was as much a stranger to White's mortgage and the liability incurred thereby as any other person could have been. Money paid by Howe in discharge of his own liability had none of the characteristics or quality of a payment made under the liability created by White's mortgage, and consequently could not in reason be held to have the effect of staying the progress of the statute of limitations to the point of liberating the lands comprised in \"the mortgage from the liability created thereby.\nIn Toft v. Stephenson[17], it was held in 1852 that the person competent to make the payment which should keep alive the mortgage must mean a person, who, unless he paid, must lose his land. That decision is referred to as good law in 1871 in Pears v. Laing[18]. The principle which is established by Harlock v. Ashberry[19] in the Court of Appeal, I take to be also, that payment to keep alive a mortgage against the operation of the statute of limitations must be a payment by a party affected by the mortgage or his agent\u2014that the payment to prevent the barring by the statute the mortgagee's title to the lands mortgaged must be equivalent to an acknowledgment by the party making it of his liability under the mortgage, and an admission of the title of the mortgagee to the benefit of the mortgage and to the mortgaged lands, and this principle, appears to me, to carry with it the sanction of sound sense and wholly independently of authority recommends itself to the understanding. The payments made by Howe, who is an utter stranger to the mortgage, and made by him in discharge of his own liability under his bond and mortgage, can never amount to such an acknowledgment by White, or his devisee.\nUpon principle, therefore, and upon authority, I am of opinion that an act of a person wholly inadequate and incompetent to preserve the liability of White and his representatives under the principal obligation involved in his bond can not preserve his liability and that of his devisee under the mortgage, which is but a collateral security to the principal obligation, and that, therefore, this appeal must be dismissed with costs.\nSince writing the above, the April number of the current volume of the Chy. Div., vol. 22, has come to hand containing two cases, which confirm me, in my view, Sutton v. Sutton[20] and Fearnside v. Flint[21]. These cases arose under 37 and 38 Vic. ch. 57, which reduced the period of prescription from 20 to 12 years, but they equally apply to the present case. They decide that where the remedy against the land is barred by lapse of time, the personal remedy, whether that personal remedy consists in an action upon the covenant contained in the mortgage deed, or an action upon a collateral bond, is barred also, the debt secured by the real and personal obligation being one. The same principle applies to the converse of this proposition.\nAppeal dimissed with costs.\nSolicitor for appellants: G Sidney Simith.\nSolictors for respondents: Harrington & Millidge, W. B.

A few days prior to nomination the respondent went into Mireau's shop with a scraper he wanted to be sharpened, and in return for sharpening the scraper told him to keep the old pieces of saw which he might still have. Mireau in his evidence answered as follows:\nQ. He did not speak of your vote? A. No.\nQ. What has he said? A. He said that Mr. Magnan was coming like mustard after dinner?\nQ. M. Dugas did not ask you for whom you were? A. No\nQ. Do you swear on the oath that you have taken that M. Dugs left with you these two pieces of saw in question with the intention to buy (bribe) you? A. I think so, I cannot say that it is sure I don't know his mind (son id\u00e9e.) It is all I can swear.\nQ. It has not changed your opinion? A. No. Q. For whom were you in the last election? A. For M. Magnan.\nThe scrapers were worth in all about two dollars, and were of no use to the respondent, and no other conversation took place afterwards between the parties. The judge who tried the case found that there was no intention on the part of the respondent to corrupt Mireau.\nHeld,\u2014That the Supreme Court on appeal will not reverse on mere matters of fact the judgment of the judge who tries an election petition unless the matter of the evidence is of such a nature as to convey an irresistible conviction that the judgment is not only wrong, but is erroneous, and that the evidence in support of the charge of bribing Mireau, as well as of the other charges of bribery and treating, was not such as would justify an Appellate Court to draw the inference that the respondent intended to corrupt the voters.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of Hon. Mr. Justice Mathieu, of the Superior Court of the Province of Quebec, the judge trying the election petition, under the Act of Canada, 37 Vic ch. 70 ([1]).\nThe case upon which this appeal was decided was the personal charge against the respondent of having bribed one Mireau. The facts of this case as well as the facts of the other charges, appear in the report of the case in the 12th volume of La Revue L\u00e9gale ([2]) and in the judgments hereinafter given.\nMr. J. Bethune, Q. C, and Mr. Pagnuelo, Q. C, for appellants:\nIn the Mireau case, the respondent allowed the evidence to go uncontradicted, and his silence cannot but be taken as a confession of guilt.\nBorough of Eversham case ([3]). As to the amount of the gift it matters very little in the present circumstances.\nShrewsbury case ([4]) ; Blackburn case ([5]).\nBellechasse case in Superior Court (McCord) ([6]), and S. C. in Supreme Court ([7]).\nMr. G. Irvine, Q. C., and C. Pelletier, Q. C for respondent.\nThe respondent was not bound to contradict evidence of this description. There was no corrupt intent.\nWindsor case ([8]); Staleybridge case ([9]); Jacques Carlier case ([10]); Kingston case ([11]).\nRITCHIE, C J:\u2014\nThe only case which has given me any difficulty is the personal charge in the case of Mireau, in which it is alleged defendant bribed Mireau, by giving him a piece of an old broken saw.\nThe abandonment of the pieces of the saw to Mireau was not in connection with any conversation relative to the election either before or at the time or subsequently, the only reference to the election (but not in connection in any way with the saw,) was the casual observation to Magnan, which he thus details:\nQ. Il ne vous a pas parl\u00e9 de votre vote ? R. Non.\nQ. Qu'est-ce qu'il a dit ? R. Il a dit que Monsieur Magnan arrivait comme de la moutarde apr\u00e9s diner.\nQ, Il ne vous a pas demand\u00e9, Monsieur Dugas, pour qui vous \u00e9tiez? R. Non.\nNor are there any circumstances beyond the simple abandonment from which a corrupt intention can be inferred ; on the contrary Mireau would seem to have been a man in very poor circumstances, the defendant much the reverse and having, it would seem from his mills a great number of broken saws, which it may be readily supposed, from the circumstance of the pieces left with Mireau having been allowed to remain with him for two years without being called for or otherwise noticed, they could not have been considered of much, if any, value to Dugas, if not actually worthless. This conduct of defendant would seem to show that he attached to them very little, if any, value, and considering that Mireau was then performing a service for defendant in sharpening his scraper, though Mireau thinks the service trifling and the pieces of the saw more than an adequate payment, the defendant, having no use for the pieces, and having, as Mireau says, a great number of pieces of broken saws, may have esteemed the remuneration equally trifling ; at any rate, it is very clear, that before a party can be declared guilty of a corrupt act entailing such serious consequences as would flow from declaring defendant guilty, the intention to corrupt must be established beyond a reasonable doubt. With reference to the trifling value of the article with which it is alleged Mireau was bribed, I can only say that when an intention to bribe is clearly established the extent or value of the bribe is of no. importance, but in considering whether the intention to corrupt exists the trifling character of the bribe may, in connection with other circumstances, become most important to negative the corrupt intent.\nI cannot think that simply leaving, with Mireau, in return for sharpening his scraper without any reference being made to the election, the small pieces of a broken saw of comparatively little or no value, and which defendant had allowed to remain in Mireau's possession for two years without having been in any way inquired after or apparently esteemed of any value, is of itself, sufficient to justify the conclusion that the defendant thereby necessarily intended corruptly to influence Mireau in voting or abstaining from voting at the election.\nStill less do I think the case so clear as to justify me in over-ruling the decision of the judge who saw and heard the witnesses who it cannot be denied was in a better position to deal with the questions of fact than I now am.\nIt is true that in his evidence, Mireau, in answer to this question:\nQ. Jurez-vous sur le serment que vous avez pr\u00eat\u00e9, que M. Dugas vous a laiss\u00e9 ces deux bouts de scies en question dans l'intention de vous acheter ? R. Je le pense. Je ne puis pas dire que c'est certain. Je ne connais pas son id\u00e9e. C'est tout ce que je puis jurer.\nQ. \u00c7a n'a pas chang\u00e9 votre opinion ? R. Non.\nThe opinion of the voter has nothing to do with the question. What we have to deal with is the intention of defendant, and this we must discover not from the opinion of the voter, but from the acts facts and circumstances developed by the evidence in the case or the necessary inferences deducible there from; and even at most the impression made on Mireau does not really amount to more than a suspicion; and if only a suspicion was created in his mind, can I say the evidence is sufficient to establish a conclusion beyond a reasonable doubt in my mind.\n2nd case, Azarie Pauz\u00e9. Case of an alleged bribing by an offer to buy a man.\nI quite agree with the learned judge that there is nothing whatever in this case to justify the conclusion that there was any infraction whatever of the 92nd sec. of the Dominion Elections Act of 1874.\n3rd case, as to the treating at Thouin's.\nI have nothing to add to what the learned judge has said as to this case. As to all the other cases the learned judge has very carefully and minutely discussed them all, and as I agree in the conclusions at which he has arrived I do not think it worth while to take up time by again going over the same ground.\nSTRONG, J.:\nAt the conclusion of the argument in this case I was convinced that the appeal was wholly unfounded. A subsequent careful consideration of the evidence has convinced me that with the exception of Mireau's case the appeal is not only unfounded, but may be characterized as frivolous. Mireau's was perhaps an arguable case, but when the facts are considered, as already stated by the learned Chief Justice, the only proof upon which the learned \"judge of the court below was asked to draw the inference that there was an intention to corrupt the voter was this, that a piece of old saw, worth less than $2 which about two years before had been left with Mireau by the respondent for the purpose of making hoes out of it, was in his possession at the time he paid this visit whilst the canvass for the election was going on, and the respondent told Mireau that he might keep this. It was not handing him a present, or conferring any benefit on him, but he abandoned to him this piece of old iron, for which he had no use whatever, the respondent being in the saw mill business, and having a number of old saws lying by him. This the learned judge found was without corrupt intent. To say that a Court of Appeal should draw a different inference from that drawn by the judge of first instance, who has seen the witnesses and had them examined before him would be not only reversing all the principles on which this court, acts in cases of appeals on questions of fact, but would be directly to controvert the principle laid down by an eminent judge of high authority on questions of this kind\u2014I refer to the late Chief Justice of this court\u2014whose thorough experience in election cases, and his great practical knowledge of the law of elections make his opinion of the utmost value, and who, in his judgment in the Kingston case ([12]), lays it down as law that, wherever there is a doubt the benefit of that doubt is to be given to the respondent. On that principle alone, in the present case, it would be out of the question to say, that the judge has given a wrong interpretation to this evidence, much less could we sitting in appeal and reviewing the evidence, be asked to hold otherwise. I think, therefore, that Mireau's case, which is really the only substantial one which we could be asked to interfere upon, was properly decided by the learned judge, Mr. Justice Mathieu, in the court below, and, for the reasons which he gave there as well as for the reasons given by the Chief Justice in the judgment which he has just read I have come to the conclusion that we cannot disturb the judgment. I repeat, as to all the other cases I consider them frivolous. The appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nFOURNIER, J.:\nThe evidence is not sufficient to authorize an appellate court to reverse the judgment in favor of the member elected\nHENRY, J.:\nThe animus, of course, with which anything is done in an election by a candidate appealing to a voter is all important. The amount is of secondary importance, but the amount of gratuity has, of course, a great deal to do with determining the mind of the party who makes it. It is said that this man Mireau was a poor man, and a couple of dollars to a poor man would be as important, or more so, than $20 to a wealthier individual. The circumstances here are in a nut-shell. The sitting member was engaged in canvassing in his election. He takes a hoe to this blacksmith to be sharpened. The blacksmith says it wanted very little. While he was proceeding to do it, he spoke of the election and made use of the term which has just been mentioned. The subject was in his mind, at all events, and whether he was canvassing this man or not, it was in the mind of the man who made the gratuity. After sharpening this hoe which, he said, took very little time, for it wanted very little, he said\u2014\" These saw plates which I gave you to manufacture on our joint account you can have altogether. I will not exact what I required by our agreement.\" That was really giving him up something that was alleged to be worth some two or three dollars. I admit the principle laid down, not originally by our late learned Chief Justice, but by a judge in England that if you can ascribe two motives to a party, one legal and the other illegal, we are not, at all events, bound to ascribe the illegal one, and it would be quite sufficient to exculpate a party charged with bribery in an election. If I were trying the case as the first judge, I should have had a good deal of difficulty in deciding as to the animus of the candidate in that election but the judge, who tried the case, and who was better acquainted with the manner of dealing and the minds of the people than I can be, has given a judgment. I do not consider that is a case which we should review. The judge having given his decision, and being much better able to decide under the circumstances, than I can be from his knowledge of the habits and mode of dealing of the parties in question, I would defer to his judgment. I would be totally unjustified, because of a doubt in my mind, in reversing his judgment. Under the circumstances, I think this appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nGWYNNE, J.:\nThe questions raised upon this appeal are all questions purely of matters of fact. In the case of Cimon v. Perrault ([13]) I have stated my opinion to be that\u2014\nIf there are any cases in which more than in others we should inflexibly adhere to the rule that we should not, on appeal. reverse upon mere matters of fact the judgment of the judge who tries the cause, having himself heard all the evidence, unless the matter of the evidence is of such a nature as to convey an irresistible conviction that the judgment is not only wrong but is erroneous, they are these election cases in which so much depends upon the manner in which the witnesses give their evidence and upon the degree of credit to be attached to them respectively. A judge sitting in appeal, not having before him the demeanor of the witnesses which the judge who tried the petition had, assumes a grave responsibility, and indeed, as it seems to me, exceeds the legitimate functions of an appellate tribunal when he pronounces the judgment of the judge of first instance in such cases to be erroneous, upon anything short of the most unhesitating conviction.\nTo this opinion, thus expressed, I still adhere. In the present case, all the parties whose acts are called in question, and all the witnesses who speak to those acts are French habitants of the Province of Quebec and the judge himself of the same nationality as they. After a careful perusal of the judgment of the learned judge who tried the case, and heard all the witnesses give their evidence in his and their own language, and who possessed a peculiar knowledge\u2014a knowledge which I have not and cannot have\u2014of the habits and customs of the parties whose acts came in review before him in this contestation I have no hesitation in saying, that if I should reverse his judgment upon these questions of fact, my judgment would be deservedly open to the imputation of presumption, In the principles of law by which three learned judge has, in his very able judgment and review of the reported cases, stated that he was governed in his consideration of the evidence, and in arriving at his conclusion upon it, I entirely concur.\nIn this view it is unnecessary to express an opinion upon the question as to the sufficiency of the evidence of the parties said to have been corruptly approached by the respondent or by his agents, being electors.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellant: Pagnuelo & St. Jean.\nSolicitors for Respondent: Pelletier & Martel.\n[1] 12 Rev.
